33273242,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640237,1725665431,Why Has Bitcoin Been Bearish Lately? CryptoQuant Head Chimes In,"Bitcoin has continued its bearish momentum as its price has now slipped below $56,000. Here’s what could be behind this trajectory, according to CryptoQuant’s Head of Research. Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Are All Giving Bearish Signals Right Now In a new thread on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has discussed why the original cryptocurrency has been struggling recently. “Bitcoin price is down simply because there is no demand growth,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Are All Showing Death Cross: Say Hello To Bear Market? To showcase how demand for the asset has been looking like, Moreno has shared the chart for the “Apparent Demand” indicator, which leverages on-chain data to estimate the 30-day demand for BTC among investors. According to the above graph, demand for Bitcoin had been high earlier in the year, according to this indicator. Still, after peaking in April, the indicator sharply declined towards zero. Since then, the Apparent Demand has continued to consolidate around this neutral level, which may be why the cryptocurrency’s price has been locked in an overall bearish trajectory. The second indicator that the CryptoQuant head has cited is the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator. This metric combines a few BTC indicators related to profit and loss to produce one value that sums up the entire market. From the graph, it’s visible that the the asset had been inside the historical “Overheated Bull” region from the perspective of CryptoQuant’s Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator back when its price had set the all-time high (ATH). After the coin had cooled off from this top, the indicator flashed a normal “Bull” signal, just like it had done in January and February. These bull market conditions were maintained until the crash early last month. During this plunge, BTC dropped below $50,000, and the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator flagged the market as “Bear.” Since then, the indicator has continued to consolidate around the transition boundary, jumping back and forth between Bull and Bear signals. In the past week or so, though, the metric has consistently maintained inside the Bear region, which may be why Bitcoin has registered a drawdown of 6% in this window. Related Reading: Dogecoin Among Altcoins Seeing Deepest Trader Losses: DOGE Rebound Soon? Moreno has also pointed out a price level to watch, as BTC is quite close to retesting it. The level in question is the lower band of the average cost basis of the BTC traders. At present, this level is situated around $55,500. It remains to be seen how a retest of this level goes if the cryptocurrency continues its decline. BTC Price Bitcoin is currently trading around $55,900, which means the coin is pretty close to retesting the trader above the cost basis level.

33270559,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640312,1725660025,"Bitcoin 200-Day Average Signals Waning Bullish Momentum, Here’s What It Means For BTC Price","A key long-term price indicator for Bitcoin, the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) appears to be losing its bullish momentum as the US economy added fewer jobs in August 2024. Bitcoin Must Overcome The 200-Day SMA To Reverse Trend The 200-day SMA is considered one of the more reliable long-term indicators to gauge an asset’s upcoming price action. Bitcoin’s 200-day SMA shows a weakening bullish momentum, giving short-term traders little joy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles: Can Bulls Step In to Save the Week? Notably, this is the first time since October 2023 that the 200-day SMA looks poised to enter bearish territory. Since late August, the daily increase in average price increases for BTC has not crossed $50, while it used to consistently record moves of more than $200 per day during the first half of 2024. At press time, the 200-day SMA stood at $63,840, about 13.96% higher than the current BTC price of $56,840. It’s worth highlighting that short-term moving average indicators such as the 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA are already past their peak and have been trending downward. A bearish crossover was seen recently when the 100-day SMA fell below the 200-day SMA. According to cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, the Stochastic relative-strength index (RSI) has signaled a trend reversal from bullish to bearish on the Bitcoin 2-month chart. If going by historical data, such a move has typically led to a significant correction of up to 75.50%. In addition, Google Trends shows that searches for the word “Bitcoin” have been at their lowest since October 2023, when BTC was hovering around $30,000. Adding to the overall bearish sentiment surrounding the leading digital asset, former CEO of BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange Arthur Hayes posted on X that he’s currently short Bitcoin and could see the crypto-asset crash to sub $50k level over the weekend. In contrast, other market experts opine that Bitcoin will likely bottom at $55,000 before the influx of US liquidity helps re-ignite the severely lacking buying pressure in the crypto markets. Bitcoin’s Fundamentals Remain Intact Although several crypto analysts seem to lean bearish on Bitcoin’s short-term price movements, the long-term bull case for the leading digital asset remains unchanged. Crypto analyst Crypto Jelle posits that Bitcoin’s tepid price action during the summer might reach its conclusion by early October before it could potentially resume another rally to the upside.

42390403,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1YJf,1725658930,Kalshi Cleared to Offer Congressional Prediction Markets in Victory Against CFTC,"Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated prediction market platform, won its federal lawsuit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over a plan to offer contracts on which party will control each house of Congress after the November election.  Although the CFTC could appeal, Kalshi, which had been locked out of this year's election betting boom while the case was pending, can now grab a sliver of that action in the last two months before the election.  ""We did it!"" the company said in a notice on its website Friday. ""U.S. election markets are coming to Kalshi.""  More broadly, the ruling represents a victory for advocates of prediction markets, in which traders bet on the outcomes of real-world events ranging from elections to album sales to temperature increases. Prediction markets are popular in crypto circles, and although Kalshi does not use cryptocurrency, the crypto industry has been watching the case closely; VC firm Paradigm filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the plaintiff.  Last year, the CFTC forbade Kalshi from listing the Congressional control contracts, on the grounds that they would amount to unlawful gaming and would be ""contrary to the public interest."" Kalshi then sued, calling the regulator's decision ""arbitrary [and] capricious.""  In a ruling handed down Friday, Judge Jia M. Cobb, of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, sided with Kalshi.  ""For the reasons stated in the Court’s forthcoming memorandum opinion, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment ... and DENIES Defendant’s cross motion for summary judgment,"" Cobb wrote. ""Defendant’s September 22, 2023 order prohibiting Plaintiff from listing its congressional control contracts for trading is hereby VACATED.""  Proponents say prediction markets beat polls and pundits as a method of forecasting events and gauging sentiment, because participants have skin in the game and so are incentivized to do thorough research and express their honest opinions.  This year's prediction market breakout success, Polymarket, runs on crypto rails and is riding high on excitement about election betting. In August, the site logged over $470 million in volume, a record, according to Dune Analytics data; the lion's share of that was traded on election contracts.  Polymarket is reaping the benefits of the U.S. election despite being barred from doing business with U.S. residents under a regulatory settlement with the CFTC. Bets on Polymarket are written into smart contracts on a blockchain and settled in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 for dollars.  Kalshi, by contrast, does business only in the U.S. and settles trades in normal greenbacks. However, every contract it lists is subject to approval or second-guessing by the CFTC, which is why it had to take the regulator to court over the Congressional control contract.  Another fight looms, as the CFTC weighs a proposed rule to bar any of the entities it regulates from offering contracts on political contests, in part over concerns they would undermine the integrity of elections.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/06/kalshi-cleared-to-offer-congressional-prediction-markets-in-victory-against-cftc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a3c8a542e341ec23a14f48c5b7c9691cc72669e-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33268779,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640333,1725654639,"Crypto Analyst Says It’s September 2016 For Bitcoin Again, What This Means","Crypto analyst CryptoCon stated in his recent market analysis that the Bitcoin current price action is reminiscent of December 2016. He further explained what he meant and provided insights into what to expect from the flagship crypto going forward. “It Is September 2016 All Over Again For Bitcoin” CryptoCon mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it is September 2016 again for Bitcoin. In line with this, he remarked that the “Bitcoin trend strength prophecy” has been fulfilled. He explained that just like in September 2016, Bitcoin has dipped into the support zone after the mid-top. Related Reading: Dogecoin Moving Averages Say Accumulation Has Ended, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next To further support his stance that the flagship crypto is mirroring past trends, he noted that all months had been the same for support zone entries for alternating cycles. He also asserted that the “pattern of 3’s” has not failed yet, both in the mid-cycle or bear market. His accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin is currently at the last part of its reaccumulation zone, just before it hits a cycle top, just like in the 2016 market cycle. Following his analysis, CryptoCon boldly stated that the cycle is not over, providing belief that Bitcoin will still hit new highs and surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000, which it hit in March earlier this year. Before now, the crypto analyst assured that Bitcoin’s price dips are just a minor setback and that the crypto will still rise to as high as $160,000 at the peak of this bull run. CryptoCon also noted how Bitcoin experienced such choppy and “boring” periods in previous halving cycles just before reaching new ATHs the following year after the halving event. The crypto analyst had previously predicted that the cycle top would come sometime in November 2025. This projection is also based on Bitcoin’s price action in previous halving cycles. More Hope For BTC Investors Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently gave Bitcoin investors hope that the worst was almost over for the flagship crypto. In an X post, he stated that a Bitcoin parabolic rally is looming as DXY is about to break down from the macro bear flag. The analyst also noted that the same scenario occurred in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play In another X post, Mikybull Crypto stated that Bitcoin’s next expansion will raise its price to $95,000. He added that Bitcoin is displaying a bull flag while the DXY is on a bear flag on a macro chart. However, the crypto analyst is confident that macro disbelief and fear are ending, with Bitcoin set to enjoy its parabolic run when that happens. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $56,300, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The world's oldest digital currency witnessed a risk-off mood on Tuesday, as it slipped to $57K. ""September is widely known as the worst month for U.S. equities, and risk assets followed the script with large sell-offs across the board,"" Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA.org said. ""Markets are currently in the middle of an important regime change, which is historically the most volatile juncture for macro assets. We are starting the post-holiday week on a soft note,"" Fan added. BTC continued to largely slide throughout the week, and stuck to a narrow trading range of ~$58K-$53K from Tuesday to Friday. The cryptocurrency had seen a brief rally on Wednesday, as it climbed over the $58K mark, but was unable to sustain it. The cryptocurrency, however, came under pressure on Friday as the nonfarm payrolls growth shifted up in August, but fell short of expectations. The jobs report reinforced growth worries and sparked a debate over the expected size of the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut later this month. Bitcoin's ( BTC ) downward move on Friday was similar to Wall Street's as at 3:10 pm ET, with the three major indices trading in the red. BTC's price is largely falling in sympathy with broader financial markets, said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm. ""Bitcoin’s price faces downward pressure amid global recession fears and ETF outflows,"" SA analyst Dean Popplewell said. Short-term Bitcoin holders are feeling the pain, while long-term investors remain profitable. A deeper pullback is possible, with Bitcoin currently 22% below its all-time high, Popplewell added. ""Crypto prices saw the risk-off move lower with BTC falling back to its recent range on the Nasdaq selloff, though sentiment appears to be getting increasingly wary by the day without an obvious catalyst to take prices higher,"" Fan told Seeking Alpha on Wednesday. Notable News Bit Digital ( BTBT ) produced 53.4 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in August, down, 12% from July, while Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) produced 322 bitcoins in the month, down 13% from 370 produced in July and -3% year-on-year. Core Scientific ( CORZ ) earned 358 bitcoins in August from its owned fleet of miners, while HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) mined 112 Bitcoins, down from July's 116 Bitcoins. A crypto trading subsidiary of Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) reached a $3.9M settlement with the state of California.

33266126,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640280,1725649246,Solana To $100 Inevitable After This Break? SOL Forms A Triple Bottom,"Like Bitcoin and other top altcoins, Solana continues to sell off at press time, rewinding losses of the first part of the year. At press time, SOL, the native currency of the smart contracts platform, is trading at around $130, retesting a critical support level. As it is, the third-most valuable crypto asset is down nearly 40% from 2024 highs of around $210. Technically, sellers are in control, and unless there is a sharp shift in trend favoring buyers, the short-term will continue to be bearish. Is SOL Preparing For $100? Triple Bottom Forms Though some analysts are upbeat, expecting a rebound toward the $200 zone in the coming days and weeks, others are bearish. Taking to X, one analyst said SOL, in line with the current state of price action, thinks the coin will slip to as low as $100. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Are All Showing Death Cross: Say Hello To Bear Market? This outlook, it should be noted, follows the recent drop from a key resistance, previously supported, level at around $140. With the coin changing hands at $130, the analyst is convinced there will be more losses in a bear trend continuation pattern. From his outlook, SOL will trickle lower “if nothing changes” in the market. The forecast, looking at the candlestick formation in the daily chart, isn’t surprising. As mentioned earlier, SOL is down by nearly 40%% from March highs. With prices consolidating and moving inside a wide range of between $210 on the upper end and $130 on the lower end, this prediction aligns with recent price movement. Presently, SOL is now retesting multi-month support as a triple bottom form. For the printout of the uptrend from October 2023 to March 2024, SOL must find support around spot rates. Subsequent gains above $140 and $160 could spark demand, lifting the coin toward $190 and, finally, $210 or 2024 highs. Solana Dumps, Bitcoin Sell-Off And Pump.fun Liquidation Impact Sentiment Even so, the leg up will depend on a multitude of factors. A recovery in Bitcoin prices would almost likely lift altcoins, of which SOL is highly ranked. Besides this, the resurgence of meme coin activity on Solana will be a big price movement. Related Reading: Cardano Bull Sees ADA Jumping 1,000% In An ‘Insane’ Rally Lookonchain data shows that Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad on Solana, has been liquidating SOL.

Besides macro factors driving prices lower, blockchain usage deteriorated in August. One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun. By Matthew Sigel & Patrick Bush In August, most crypto assets saw significant declines amid rising market volatility and a risk-off environment driven by macroeconomic factors such as the yen carry trade implosion. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Most crypto assets fell sharply in August as fundamental usage and financial statistics slipped against the broader market backdrop of rising volatility. For the month of August, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 11%, Ethereum (ETH-USD) -24%, and Solana (SOL-USD) -21%, vs. the S&P +2% and the Nasdaq +1%. The market capitalization of all Smart Contract Platforms (SCP) ended August (-12%) lower than it closed in July. Though the precipitating event for the dismal price performance was a risk-off typhoon spawned by the yen carry trade, general sentiment for crypto remained poor even after the event. The apex of the pandemonium was August 5, when BTC wicked as low as $49k while ETH crashed to $2.1k after opening the month at around $64.6k and $3.2k respectively. Though Bitcoin has regained some of its value since the “flash crash,” sitting around $ 58k at the time of writing, ETH is still wallowing around $2.5k. The impact of the yen carry trade implosion translated into BTC and ETH’s August 30-day volatility climbing (+48%) and (+52%) higher than the previous month, as well as Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with the Nasdaq rising to an 18-month high of 38%. Besides macro factors driving prices lower, blockchain usage deteriorated in August. For example, daily active usership was down (-10%) in August, fees generated fell (-12%), and DEX volumes sagged (-4%) compared to July. The German & US Governments also transferred 62k Bitcoin to exchanges, presumably for sale, while Mt. Gox and Gemini bankruptcy distributions totaled another 124k Bitcoin. That’s $11B in non-repeatable sales, roughly equivalent to the net inflows to Bitcoin ETPs in the first two months of trading. Lastly, driving weak price action at month-end, the SEC sent a Wells Notice to OpenSea, one of the largest NFT exchanges, claiming that the company is an unregistered broker. The action is another sign that regulation by enforcement may continue in the US unless Donald Trump wins the election.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun. A very important DeFi “primitive,” WBTC, or “Wrapped Bitcoin,” is a token on Ethereum that is backed by Bitcoin custodied at the crypto exchange Bitgo. Someone who wishes to use mint WBTC can send their Bitcoin to Bitgo, which then issues the WBTC on Ethereum. WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, held by Bitgo, which provides attestations of holdings. At the time of writing, more than 153k BTC worth $9.2B have been “wrapped” into WBTC for use in Ethereum’s DeFi. As part of the new partnership agreement, Bitgo will move custody of WBTC outside of the United States to three different Asian countries. The crypto community reacted negatively to these developments due to the negative perception of Justin Sun and past issues with other projects brought under his aegis, like USDD and TrueUSD . MakerDAO, the entity that runs the permissionless crypto-backed stablecoin DAI, passed a governance proposal banning wBTC as used for collateral to create DAI. To seize the initiative, Coinbase announced its own wrapped version of BTC called wbBTC. At the same time, Bitcoin L2 Babylon unexpectedly declared the launch of their mainnet the week after Bitgo’s new custody announcement. Meanwhile, existing competitors such as tBTC and BTC.b saw modest inflows of 250 BTC and 50 BTC. Daily Memecoin Volumes on Solana Fall Back to 2023 Levels Source: Dune @ally as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Solana (-21%) has had a mixed month as several underlying issues surfaced to generate a minor FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) cycle. Speculation is the lifeblood of crypto, and no more is this a reality than on Solana, which accounts for ~22% of all DEX trading, of which 47% has been memecoin trading since June 1, 2024. It is apparent to many in the crypto community that Solana memecoin trading is rife with fraudulent activity. A coin supposedly associated with Donald Trump was “rugged” for $2M , someone hacked McDonald’s Instagram account to announce a memecoin that eventually scammed buyers out of $700k , while other tokens with liquidities of $10M. The result has been that many traders on Solana have lost money due to memecoins. It is estimated that only 0.76% of wallets on Solana’s top memecoin platform, pump.fun, are profitable. Many small traders are catching on to the fact that memecoin trading is usually a zero-sum game. This change in sentiment has driven memecoin trading down (-43%) month-to-month while total DEX volume on Solana is down (-48%). As a result, Solana's monthly fees have declined (35%). On the positive front for Solana, the first (and second) spot SOL ETF debuted in Brazil, while the interesting DePIN project Grass announced its token airdrop, and the perpetual futures platform Drift launched a prediction market. The stablecoin of PayPal, PYUSD, reached $664M in supply on Solana, nearly double the $345M of PYUSD on Ethereum. In August, the total supply of all stablecoins on Solana reached $3.9B, 160% greater than a year earlier. A budding challenge for the widespread adoption of Solana is its blockchain's massive size in computer storage space. Solana is designed to process tens of thousands of transactions per second and has consistently demonstrated this capability. Blockchain transactions are essentially “writes” to each blockchain’s database of information. The more transactions, the more “writes” occur, and this causes more data to be stored on a blockchain. While Bitcoin’s blocks are around 1.6MB in size and occur every 10 minutes, Solana blocks can be as large as 128MB, and these blocks occur around every half second. The result is that the Bitcoin blockchain is around 550 GB in size for 15 years of history, while Solana’s chain is around 150TB (272x bigger) for roughly 4.5 years of history. This is an issue because it makes it very difficult and expensive for people to store its history and query its contents. Looking at past events or simple things like an account’s historical balances is cost-prohibitive. Solana expects private entities to spin up to provide services for those wishing to comb Solana’s history. Allium , an S-tier data services provider, is one of the few entities that can effectively assess Solana’s history. This presents a challenge to anyone who wants to create assets on Solana. If an audit is to occur or an issue crops up, someone has to spend large sums of money to untangle Solana’s historical archive. The instability of Solana’s consensus mechanism and its history of outages add to the challenges posed by Solana’s substantial history. Because of these two issues, it is nearly impossible to prove that Solana’s chain has operated without any faults (double spending of currency) and without sifting through the entire chain. Though this is a challenge with any blockchain, Solana’s massive data output creates novel difficulties that are not posed by lower throughput chains. It must also be noted that while history is challenging to verify by new nodes, real-time verification of chain functionality can be verified by anyone with a full node. Newer high-throughput blockchains, such as Aptos and Sui, have different design philosophies that seek to address these challenges. But realistically, Solana’s big data limitations will likely plague other high-capacity blockchains. Hosted on the Polygon blockchain, Polymarket has crept into the news cycle during the US presidential election season as an exciting use case of crypto technology. Polymarket is a permissionless prediction market that allows users to create betting markets and speculate on the outcome of off-chain events in politics, sports, finance, and popular culture. The smart contracts that power Polymarket are hosted on the Polygon blockchain. These smart contracts receive, interpret, and execute better payoffs using data brought on the chain by the crypto “oracle” Uma. The pseudo-anonymous nature of Polymarket combined with its limitless, global accessibility allows it to incorporate valuable information more efficiently and dynamically than is possible outside of crypto. Because people can create any market with any type of outcome without a central party to prevent the flow of information by limiting markets or betting, Polymarket is arguably a more accurate prediction engine than any web2 betting platform. While web2 companies can be pressured to censor or alter markets, Polymarket’s decentralized system prevents outside parties from stopping the incentivized transfer of knowledge that prediction markets enable. The recent attention on Polymarket has focused on its political prediction markets, such as the winner of the US presidential election or the winners of key US congressional races. Polymarket is generating enormous controversy with detractors contending that public opinion can be swayed by large-pocketed investors who manipulate prediction markets. Regardless, Polymarket usage has surged, with over $440M in wagers placed by over 60k monthly active traders in August. Recently, its data feeds have been integrated into Bloomberg terminals worldwide. Despite its popularity, Polymarket has only generated $17.9k in fees for the Polygon blockchain where it is hosted.

In stablecoin news, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin USDT, has shelved plans to launch its blockchain, citing market saturation. Another interesting development is that Maker, the entity behind the collateral-backed stablecoin DAI, has decided to rebrand to SKY. As part of its move, Maker will upgrade its DAI token to USDS and change its governance token, MAKER, to SKY. Users can choose to upgrade their existing DAI or MAKER tokens to receive token rewards and the Sky Savings Rate, which will only be available in certain jurisdictions. As part of the sweeping changes Maker calls its “Endgame,” Maker will allow independent entities called Stars to launch innovative stablecoins. Meanwhile, Circle, the creator of USDC, has launched the Euro-backed stablecoin EURC on Base. Meanwhile, the VanEck-backed Agora stablecoin 1 has proven to be one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in crypto. Since its launch on August 19, it has grown to $57.5M on Avalanche and Ethereum. Agora intends to grow rapidly by expanding its presence to other chains such as Sui. This would make Agora the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Sui. Agora’s strategy is to grow through revenue-sharing agreements and distribution partnerships. Some target partnerships include protocols, on-chain applications, centralized exchanges, and other important entities in crypto. Nick Van Eck, founder of Agora, believes that stablecoins will become a $10T asset class expanding to enterprises issuing their own stablecoins. For more on stablecoins, please look out for our upcoming research piece on the topic. Breaking Down Ethereum’s Struggles One of the most confounding topics has been the consistent underperformance of ETH since the beginning of the bull market in crypto assets in November 2023. Of the 22 major L1 projects that we track, Ethereum ranks 13th with a yearly return of 62%. While this absolute return is spectacular, this is less than ½ of BTC’s 138% return, and far below Solana’s astounding 624% return over the same period of time. During periods of crypto price pullbacks, Ethereum has also underperformed. For example, over the past 90 days, ETH (-30%) ranks 12th place among the group of 22 and has been outshined by competitors such as BNB (-5%), Tron’s TRX (+37%) and TON (-3%). More recently, over the past 30 days, ETH has been an abysmal (-23%), which ranks it 19th among the 22 layer 1 blockchains we track. ETH is the 18th Worst Performing Asset Over the Last 30 Days Source: Artemis XYZ as of 8/29/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We attribute ETH’s dismal performance to the following factors: Decline in revenues Speculation moving to high throughput blockchains L2 blockchains cannibalize Ethereum’s revenue items like transaction fees and MEV Deliberate policy choices Ethereum has reduced fees for its L2 customers Ethereum relies upon L2s Value Extraction by Service Entities L2s, data availability blockchains, staking, and re-staking take away Ethereum’s value Without question, the best use case for public blockchains at this early stage is speculation. The current monetization of SCPs relies on people moving assets or trading them on-chain. This generates revenue for blockchains through transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), ultimately bringing value to tokenholders. Without speculation driving on-chain revenues, a blockchain must bank its worth on uncertain long-term potential. Ethereum's Decline in the Face of Faster Competitors Ethereum was once the epicenter of crypto speculation because it was the first smart contract platform to attract novel projects and allow users to speculate upon their tokens. However, the competitive landscape has changed, with more capable blockchains eating into Ethereum’s once-dominant position. These chains apply advancements in distributed systems technology to handle more transaction throughput and faster transaction processing. While Ethereum can process ~15 TPS per second with transaction confirmation times measured in minutes, chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos can process thousands per second with confirmation latency measured in seconds. Simultaneously, the new crop of blockchains has figured out how to parallelize transactions that can be processed alongside each other. This allows transactions unrelated to congested areas on the blockchain to execute their logic unencumbered. Ethereum only allows transactions to process sequentially, and if one part of Ethereum is bombarded with demand, transactions on other parts are held in queue. As a result, the user experience for Ethereum’s traders is clunky, and the number of individuals who can utilize Ethereum is limited. Because of Ethereum’s bottlenecks, developers building novel applications are increasingly deploying their projects to chains that can accommodate a better user experience and more users. These projects are also deploying their tokens to these new chains. Many innovative, non-financial crypto projects, like Helium and Hivemapper, reside on more advanced blockchains. Slowly, Ethereum is not only losing its dominance as a place to speculate, but it is also losing the tokens that appeal to speculators. Ethereum’s Diminishing Fee Revenues Quantifying Ethereum’s loss of its pole position among blockchains, since 2022, the share of all blockchain fees received by Ethereum has fallen from 86% to 33%, while its share of DEX volume has declined from 42% to 29%. ETH Share of Fees Has Fallen Sharply; Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Volume Share is More Stable DEX ) Volume Share is More Stable""> Source: Artemis XYZ as of 8/27/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum's Shift to Layer-2: A Double-Edged Sword? Ethereum’s solution to improve its scalability, pushing transactions to L2 blockchains, has thus far failed to drive value to ETH. Not only do the L2 blockchains increasingly cut into Ethereum economics through multiple pathways, but they also offer a suboptimal user experience while still offering far less transaction throughput than Ethereum competitors. On the first dimension, value accrual to ETH, pushing transactions to its orbiting blockchains, also moves revenue-generating components like MEV and transaction fees to those L2 chains. Though L2s remit value to Ethereum by posting proofs and batches of transactions, Ethereum’s share of transaction fees in its ecosystem (Ethereum + L2s) alone has dropped from 98% to 89% since 2022. MEV is difficult to calculate but can be approximated as a portion of DEX volumes. At the start of 2023, Ethereum commanded 90% of DEX volumes in its ecosystem, whereas today, that share is around 52%. The MEV that is generated by these DEX volumes accrues to the L2s instead of Ethereum. The shift to L2s has also expanded the amount of available Ethereum blockspace, which has lowered the price of transactions. To make transactions even less costly, Ethereum passed EIP-4844, which created a new data processing lane for batches of L2 transactions. This has reduced revenues for both Ethereum and its L2s. At the start of 2024, Ethereum collected ~$6M; in August, that figure was $1.2M. The pie has shrunk at the behest of Ethereum, lowering its blockspace pricing, and because of Layer-2s. Ethereum’s share of that pie has also diminished. Compared to 180 days ago, the 7 Day Moving Average of Ethereum’s fees is down (-89%)! By comparison, Bitcoin’s fees have sagged (-13%) while Tron’s and Solana’s are up (+125%) and (+114%). This lack of fee generation has bled into Ethereum, becoming an inflationary economic system, with inflation now sitting at 0.74% and 944K of yearly issuance worth $2.45B in new supply. New Tokens and Competitors: Ethereum's Growing Challenges At the same time, many tokens have been launched that currently, or in the future, cleave value from Ethereum’s ecosystem. These include L2, Data availability, re-staking, and staking tokens. Each of these product groups offers a competing service to Ethereum. Influential investors holding billions of dollars worth of tokens will demand that these projects cut into Ethereum’s core businesses. Many of these projects have yet to launch a token, but we can estimate the value they have subtracted from Ethereum by looking at the collective FDV of their tokens. The twelve who have launched or have pre-markets for their tokens’ values have captured roughly 11% of Ethereum’s ecosystem value. As more projects launch tokens, there will be further competition in Ethereum’s service set, driving the price of Ethereum’s core services lower while offering competing investment opportunities. This pricing pressure may shrink the economic pie available to ETH holders while increasing competition for investor interest.

Among Ethereum L2s, Polygon and Optimism stood out this month for significant increases in developer activity, with their contracts per deployer 30-day moving averages up ~7.9x and ~4.8x, respectively. However, MATIC & OP tokens performed in the middle of the pack, down (-15%) and (-14 %), respectively. Polygon PoS developers are likely busy deploying contracts in preparation for the PIP-19 component of the broader Polygon 2.0 rollout, scheduled for September 4th. This upgrade will transition Polygon’s native MATIC token to the ecosystem’s next-generation POL token, which is designed to accommodate an array of ZK-based L2 chains with community staking and governance. POL is optimized for the development of the aggregated Polygon network (“ AggLayer ”). This network aims to be a unique scaling solution, moving beyond the current binary competition between modular and monolithic blockchain thesis dominated by Ethereum and Solana. Polygon & Optimism Dev Outputs Surge Ahead of Upgrades Source: Artemis XYZ as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Optimism developers increased their output this month due to two main catalysts: addressing recently discovered fraud proof vulnerabilities and preparing for interoperability upgrades ahead of OP Labs' Superchain upgrade in early 2025. The Granite Network Upgrade proposal , made in response to third-party audits identifying security issues in Optimism’s fault proof, includes both security and performance enhancements. The proposal passed on August 28th and is scheduled for execution on September 10th. More proactively, Optimism announced its ‘Superchain’ roadmap this month, a three-milestone plan to bring interoperability to the OP Stack. According to L2Beat , nine of the top 20 Ethereum L2s are built using Optimism’s OP Stack codebase. If successful, this roadmap could significantly reduce the liquidity and user fragmentation currently affecting the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Bringing interoperability to the OP Stack could elevate its user experience to be comparable with high-performance L1s like Solana while retaining the security, applications, and user base of the Ethereum ecosystem. Adding to the Superchain’s gravity, Sony Group announced the development of its own Ethereum L2, ‘Soneium’ that will be built using the OP Stack for both general Sony Group ecosystem applications. Additionally, Soneium will allow the exploration of new purposes, including “…the protection of rights to creativity created by creators, new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds.” Notably, the Japanese Prime Minister will speak at a Web3 Event in Tokyo later this year. Arbitrum’s native ARB token underperformed this month, down (-23%), with the L2 blockchain showing no meaningful increase in average developer output or total developer count. Earlier in the month, Arbitrum’s DAO proposed and approved the development of an ARB staking mechanism, which plans to stream DAO-generated rewards from the L2’s sequencer along with MEV, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification rewards to eligible token holders who are delegated to active governance participants. Alongside Uniswap’s UNI token, ARB was also added to the custodial business of the controversial Special Purpose Broker-Dealer, Prometheus Capital. Contrary to more nuanced takes from many crypto industry participants, Prometheum is aligned with the SEC’s stance that traditional securities laws provide clear guidance on digital assets transactions. Given Uniswap’s embattlement with the SEC, one could view ARB’s addition to Prometheum as a bullish catalyst in terms of institutional distribution and liquidity or as a bearish catalyst in terms of exposure to the SEC. In either case, ARB appeared to lag other L2s in organic growth this month. Base Has ~10x More Contract Deployers Than Other Top L2s Source: Artemis XYZ as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Coinbase’s Base blockchain is the largest Ethereum L2 by daily active addresses. Base also boasts a substantial number of smart contract deployers. Data from Artemis.xyz shows that Base has nearly an order of magnitude more addresses deploying smart contracts on its L2 than Arbitrum, Blast, OP Mainnet, or Polygon PoS combined. Like other entrepreneurs, crypto developers must strategically anticipate where their customers will be. We think developers they are increasingly choosing to build on Coinbase’s Base because it enjoys a key competitive moat: a direct-to-consumer onramp from its dominant centralized exchange. In an increasingly fragmented L2 landscape, Coinbase’s unique nexus of onchain and offchain users, developers, and liquidity offers compelling virtual real estate for building a crypto business. As Base is also part of the OP Stack, it participates in the Superchain’s revenue sharing model. According to the ‘Superchain Health Dashboard’, Base contributed an estimated 142.45 ETH (~$367k) month-to-date to the Superchain Collective as of August 29th, second only to OP Mainnet itself. Base and Optimism thus present an interesting synergy, with Optimism potentially playing the long-term role of a relatively decentralized modular scaling solution counterpart to Coinbase’s more centralized, retail-centric strategy. August’s Notable Performer - Tron (+20%) Tron’s Stablecoin Market Cap Outpaces Other Leading L1s Source: Artemis.xyz as of 08/28/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Up (+20%), Tron’s native TRX token stood out once again this month, reaching levels not seen since April 2021. The blockchain’s significant performance may largely be attributed to the mid-August launch of the Sun Pump platform Beta - a platform modeled after Solana’s infamous pump.fun and named after Tron’s founder Justin Sun. Sun Pump is a streamlined tool to launch meme coins in seconds. As of August 28 th , Sun Pump has already launched over 56,000 meme coins on Tron, generating over 23 million TRX in revenue for an estimated $3.64 million USD. Effective August 25th, Tron executed Proposal #92 to increase the blockchain’s energy cap, lowering gas fees and increasing transaction throughput in response to the increased user activity. Sun Pump’s initial success marks a significant diversification in Tron’s adoption drivers, which historically have been centered around stablecoin investments and transfers in the APAC region and emerging economies. Data from Artemis, visualized in the chart above, illustrates the disproportionate amount of stablecoin value issued to the Tron blockchain relative to other leading smart contract blockchains. Indeed, while other blockchains experienced sizable drawdowns in stablecoin market caps during the bear market, Tron’s blockchain demonstrated more sustained USD stablecoin retention and growth, even surpassing Ethereum as the blockchain with the most circulating Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. However, Tron was not without headwinds or controversy this month. After the Tron DAO Reserve removed ~$732 million of Bitcoin backing the USDD stablecoin ( purportedly without community vote), Justin Sun tweeted to assuage concerns, stating, “The TRON DAO Reserve plans to spend time upgrading USDD in the future to make it a more competitive decentralized stablecoin in the market”, after lamenting that “…the capital utilization [of USDD’s reserves] is not very efficient.” We maintain a positive view of Tron’s retail market penetration as a stablecoin-centric network. However, we hold a highly cautious view of the ecosystem’s exposure to Justin Sun’s control, given his questionable past actions with USDD and other projects. Bluechip, a third-party stablecoin ratings agency, estimated that USDD’s 53% collateralization was comprised of 69% TRX, 29% BTC, and 2% TUSD— before the latest BTC withdrawal. USDD was initially inspired to compete with the now-collapsed UST stablecoin involved in Terra/LUNA, and we fear it risks suffering a similar fate due to its reliance on TRX for collateral. We are also concerned about the general challenges facing USDT holders who want to off-ramp their tokens to fiat. USDT can be redeemed for dollars by only a few entities, and many holders are supposed have to swap for USDC to offramp their USDT. Additionally, moving USDT from Tron to Ethereum is nearly impossible, adding to our concern of collusion between Sun and Tether to block exits for Tron’s USDT holders. August’s Notable Laggard - zkSync (-24.05%) zkSync User Growth Lags Base, Arbitrum, and Others as Ethereum L2 Ecosystem Activity Bounces Source: Artemis.xyz, as of 08/28/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. zkSync’s native ZK token experienced a significant decline of (-24%) this month, driven partly by its underperforming user growth compared to other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As the chart above illustrates, the growth of zkSync’s daily active addresses—a proxy for users—lags that of Base, Arbitrum, and other leading L2s, even as overall activity in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem rebounds. Absent a clear negative catalyst. However, zkSync’s stagnation can primarily be attributed to the vacuum left by the absence of its previous driver: airdrop farming. Previously, zkSync fueled speculation about a potential airdrop, prompting users to interact with its network to increase their potential eligibility. For instance, a September 2023 zkSync blog post mentioned plans to “fully decentralize the protocol’s technology, community governance…,” and emphasized “empowering the community with ownership.” On June 11th, zkSync finally revealed details about the airdrop of its native ZK token. However, the distribution was criticized for lacking sybil resistance, a vulnerability in which a single entity can use multiple accounts to gain disproportionate amounts of airdropped tokens. After ZK token claims began the following week, one user claimed to have received over 6.6 million tokens across 350 Sybil wallets, valued at nearly $1.2 million. Simultaneously, many good-faith users found themselves ineligible for the airdrop, rubbing salt in the wounds of loyal community members and highlighting the inefficacy of zkSync’s approach to “fair” ZK token distributions. The combined effects of the resulting negative sentiment, lack of ongoing user incentives, and 83% overhanging ZK supply contribute to selling pressure. Moreover, the Ethereum L2 competitive landscape remains fierce, with L2s like Base gaining traction with the development of features like on-chain verification-enabled applications . It is logical that growth driven by organic demand for on-chain applications and more direct-to-consumer distribution such as Coinbase’s is more sustainable than the airdrop hype that may have driven much of zkSync’s initial growth.

33263467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640262,1725643838,Here’s How Cardano Price Will ‘Survive’ A US Recession: Crypto Analyst,"In a new video analysis, popular crypto analyst Dan Gambardello delved into the potential future of the Cardano (ADA) price amidst the troubling forecasts of a US recession. With a significant following of 369,000 on YouTube, Gambardello highlighted the general unease among ADA holders and general crypto investors due to the ongoing economic discourse surrounding a potential recession. Will Cardano Bottom In December? He drew parallels between historical S&P 500 behavior and current market conditions, noting, “On average the S&P 500 bottoms three months after a recession begins, but 10 months before the recession ends.” This observation is crucial as it sets a potential timeframe for when investors might expect the crypto market, including ADA, to bottom out. “I give it a 50/50 odds that we’re in a recession now. Check this out. The Fed has signaled that September interest rate cut is coming all but two times in history when the Fed has started to cut rates, a recession followed,” Gambardello suggested and explained that recession starts are usually only declared to have started once they have already begun. He further explained that the prevalent discussion about the US already being in a recession could impact investment strategies. According to Gambardello, if history repeats itself, the market could see its lowest point in December 2024. He based this on a detailed look back at market downturns since 1957, which typically show significant movements three months following the onset of a recession. Related Reading: Stunning Fall From Grace: Cardano Suffers 90% Plunge In Market Share Since ’21 “I just think whenever the bottom will be in, it is going to be explosive oftentimes [they declare] it 10 months later and they’re like ‘hey, you know what, the recession started 10 months ago. Nobody, there’s no exact science to when it starts, not like a set date but 3 months after it, the bottom is in for markets,” the crypto analyst noted. Gambardello then addressed the Federal Reserve’s signals about upcoming interest rate cuts, which historically have been followed by recessions. This pattern adds another layer to the already complex market analysis, suggesting that a recession might indeed be imminent or already underway. “All but two times in history when the Fed has started to cut rates, a recession followed,” he remarked, highlighting the gravity of the current economic signals. Shifting focus to Cardano, Gambardello juxtaposed ADA’s current market performance against its historical data. He pointed out that, similar to previous cycles, ADA is currently down by 89% from its peak, closely mirroring its past downturns where it was down by 94% at similar points. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains Why Cardano Remains ‘Fundamentally Bullish’ “We’re down 89%. So put it all aside, Cardano is not doing anything different than it did last cycle. And the one thing I did notice though was from this 2018 high to when Ada made its way to where we are right now is, that was around 992 days after that all-time high. This time around and this is why I think it feels a little bit more painful for Cardano holders this time around, we’re looking at almost 1,100 days from all-time high to this moment right so it’s been very grueling,” Gambardello stated. Moreover, he analyzed Bitcoin’s influence on altcoins like Cardano. He discussed the potential for an ‘altcoin season,’ a period when altcoins typically surge if Bitcoin’s market dominance begins to wane. According to his analysis, such a season isn’t currently in play but could be on the horizon, correlating with his predicted market bottom in December. “Most altcoins, especially the blue chips, especially the top altcoins, are going to fly when market bottoms and crypto bounces,” Gambardello said. Concluding his analysis, Gambardello adopted a cautiously optimistic tone. He acknowledged the uncertainties inherent in predicting crypto markets but underscored the importance of historical patterns and current economic indicators in formulating investment strategies. He advised his viewers to stay vigilant, keep an eye on market data, and be prepared for more potential downside, but also be ready for an explosive growth period that has historically followed recessions.

33262882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640352,1725642724,Will Cardano ADA Create Millionaires In 2024? Mpeppe Casino Positioned To Generate More Wealth,"The blockchain industry continues to evolve, and with Cardano’s (ADA) latest “Chang” Hard Fork, a new era of decentralized governance is dawning. But as Cardano (ADA) positions itself for growth, the big question remains—will it create millionaires in 2024? Meanwhile, a rising meme coin called Mpeppe (MPEPE), specifically targeting the crypto casino niche, is drawing attention for its wealth-generating potential. Could this new player be the real wealth driver of 2024? Let’s dive into both Cardano (ADA)’s future and the growing buzz around Mpeppe (MPEPE). Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork: A Revolution in Governance The Chang Hard Fork is one of the most anticipated developments in Cardano (ADA)’s history. It signals the platform’s transition into full decentralization, aligning with Charles Hoskinson’s vision of making Cardano (ADA) a community-governed network. By introducing a new governance model, the responsibility of key decisions—such as upgrades and future hard forks—shifts from the developers to ADA holders. Under the new structure, ADA token holders now have the ability to elect representatives, known as dReps (delegate representatives), who will make decisions on their behalf. This governance model is designed to improve transparency and community involvement, providing a mechanism for ADA holders to have a real voice in the network’s evolution. Mpeppe’s Casino Play: A Wealth Generation Opportunity? In contrast to the slow-and-steady approach of Cardano (ADA)’s decentralized governance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has seen rapid growth in its presale phase. Priced at a modest $0.0021, the coin has attracted investors looking to capitalize on the burgeoning online gambling market, which is expected to reach $153 billion by 2030. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly becoming a favorite for those seeking to turn a small investment into a fortune. Crypto analysts have started comparing Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential rise to the likes of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, but with a twist. Unlike those tokens, which were largely driven by community enthusiasm, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has a real-world use case in the casino sector, giving it an edge over other meme coins. Investors are betting big on Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for explosive growth, with many believing that it could see a rally of up to 13,000% once it hits major exchanges. Cardano vs. Mpeppe: The Battle for Wealth Creation While Cardano (ADA) is making strides with its governance model and decentralized vision, it’s clear that some investors are impatient for quicker returns. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes into play. The speculative nature of meme coins, combined with a strong use case in the casino sector, makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an appealing option for those who want to take bigger risks for bigger rewards. That’s not to say Cardano (ADA) doesn’t have its appeal. With the Chang Hard Fork and the upcoming “Cardano 2” set for release in October, the blockchain is laying the groundwork for long-term success. Hoskinson himself has said that Cardano (ADA)’s emphasis on decentralization will ensure that the platform remains resilient and sustainable for years to come. But the question remains: Can Cardano (ADA) offer the kind of explosive short-term gains that investors crave? While ADA is poised to benefit from the introduction of decentralized governance, it’s unlikely to see the same rapid price jumps that meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) might achieve. Will ADA Create Millionaires in 2024? For long-term investors, ADA remains a solid choice. The community-driven governance model and upcoming updates could provide a stable foundation for future growth, and Cardano (ADA)’s focus on DeFi and smart contracts positions it well for the next wave of blockchain innovation. However, for those looking for faster wealth creation, Cardano (ADA) may not be the most exciting option. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is shaping up to be a potential breakout star in 2024. Its focus on the online casino industry, combined with the speculative appeal of meme coins, makes it a tempting investment for those willing to take on more risk for the possibility of higher returns. Conclusion Cardano (ADA)’s transition to decentralized governance is undoubtedly a game-changer, but whether ADA will create millionaires in 2024 remains to be seen. The platform is built for sustainability and long-term growth, which may not satisfy those looking for quick riches. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) casino-themed meme coin is positioned for potentially explosive short-term gains, offering a higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity.

33262747,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640349,1725642426,"ADA, MATIC & SOL: Market Expert Explains Why Solana, Cardano and Polygon Investors Are Joining Mpeppe","Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) have been key players in the cryptocurrency market, each building strong communities around their decentralized platforms. However, the tide is shifting as some investors are starting to question the long-term potential of these tokens due to recent controversies and technical changes. A growing number of these investors are turning their attention to emerging projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is currently priced at $0.0021 and has sparked interest for its unique blend of meme culture and casino-themed presale. ADA, MATIC, and SOL Face Uncertainty Cardano (ADA) has been at the center of a community-wide debate about the future of its Treasury and whether burning , Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) have been key players in the cryptocurrency tokens would be beneficial. Founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed strong opposition to burning Cardano (ADA) from the Treasury, stating that it would be akin to “theft” from the stakeholders who contribute to the network. This has led to a division within the community, with some supporting Hoskinson’s stance and others advocating for a token burn to increase scarcity and drive up the price. Meanwhile, Polygon (MATIC) is undergoing a significant transformation as it migrates from MATIC to a new token, POL, as part of its Polygon (MATIC) 2.0 roadmap. This migration is designed to enhance scalability and decentralization, but it has left some investors wondering whether the platform can continue to compete with other layer-2 solutions on Ethereum. The migration brings a level of uncertainty to the future of the project as it attempts to improve its position in a competitive market. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, has been battling its own issues. Recently, Solana experienced a major security scare involving phishing attacks that could potentially compromise user wallets. Despite Solana (SOL)’s efforts to address these vulnerabilities, the blockchain’s trading volume has plummeted to a three-year low, and many investors have started to shift their focus toward safer investments. Mpeppe: A New Meme Coin Sensation As Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) face their respective challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a fresh opportunity in the meme coin space. Leveraging the viral appeal of meme culture combined with the thrill of online gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained significant attention during its presale phase. Priced at just $0.0021, it has attracted not only retail investors but also larger players, including some Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) whales who are looking for higher returns in a shorter time frame. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its casino-themed ecosystem, where users can earn rewards while engaging with Web3-based games and gambling platforms. The project’s appeal lies in its potential for rapid gains, similar to the early success stories of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With a growing community and the anticipation of a post-launch surge, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is becoming an increasingly attractive option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Why Are ADA, MATIC, and SOL Investors Moving to Mpeppe? The shift from established tokens like Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by several factors: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new altcoin offering a fresh start amid ongoing debates within the Cardano (ADA) community and technical changes at Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL). Its low entry price and high potential for rapid gains make it an appealing option for investors willing to take on higher risk in exchange for significant returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strong community support and viral nature of meme coins attract a new wave of investors looking for the next big thing in crypto. Its integration with online gambling adds another layer of appeal, providing a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional altcoins like ADA, MATIC, and SOL. Conclusion: ADA, MATIC, SOL, and the Future of Mpeppe For investors seeking short-term gains, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an exciting opportunity. With the backing of large investors from the Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) communities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to become the next meme coin success story. Whether it can sustain its momentum post-launch remains to be seen, but for now, the project’s potential for rapid growth has captured the attention of the crypto world.

33262697,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640347,1725642326,"ADA vs Mpeppe: Cardano (ADA) Gains Price Momentum Due To Hopskinson Update, What’s Mpeppe Response","Cardano (ADA), one of the most recognized names in the world of blockchain technology, is at a critical crossroads. Recent controversies within the Cardano (ADA) community have left investors, including the so-called Cardano (ADA) whales, questioning their confidence in the network’s future. Charles Hoskinson, the mastermind behind Cardano (ADA), finds himself defending the project’s path forward, especially in light of the ongoing debate surrounding the burning of ADA tokens. Meanwhile, new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) have started to gain attention, positioning themselves as the next big thing in the meme coin market. The Cardano (ADA) Burning Debate The controversy within the Cardano (ADA) community revolves around whether to burn ADA tokens stored in the project’s Treasury to reduce supply and potentially boost prices. Hoskinson has been vocal in his opposition to this, calling it “theft” from those who contribute to the network’s functioning, such as stake pool operators (SPOs). The Cardano (ADA) Treasury is built through a tax on block production and transactions, which helps fund development and projects within the ecosystem. Hoskinson’s argument is that burning ADA would be detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the network. He insists that the Treasury is not a surplus of tokens but rather a pool generated by collective efforts, making it essential for the continued innovation and stability of the platform. Many within the community support this stance, recognizing that the burning of tokens could undermine the resources necessary to fund future upgrades and enhancements. A Divided Community Despite Hoskinson’s strong opposition, a faction within the Cardano (ADA) community believes that burning a significant portion of ADA could help drive its value upward. Some have even proposed burning 1.5 billion ADA tokens, hoping that reducing the circulating supply would increase demand and result in a price spike. However, Hoskinson and other critics argue that this move could create only short-term gains at the expense of the network’s long-term viability. Cardano (ADA) Whales Seek Alternatives As the debate continues, Cardano (ADA)’s price has seen fluctuations, with the token currently trading at $0.319, down 10.56% in the past week. While some investors remain hopeful that the introduction of new governance tools and the ongoing progress of the Voltaire era will lead to a price recovery, others are less optimistic. These investors, particularly the whales, have started exploring alternative investment options. One such alternative is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin with a casino twist, currently priced at $0.0021. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained traction in the crypto community, with its presale already raising significant funds. The casino-themed token offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, drawing in investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional altcoins like Cardano (ADA). Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its potential for rapid gains, as it leverages the excitement surrounding meme coins and the booming online casino industry. For Cardano (ADA) whales seeking faster returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an attractive opportunity. The project’s presale has already garnered attention from large investors, who see it as a way to capitalize on the volatile yet lucrative meme coin market. What Does This Mean for Cardano (ADA)? Cardano (ADA) is at a pivotal point in its development. The introduction of governance tools and the shift into the Voltaire era are steps in the right direction for those who believe in the platform’s long-term potential. However, the ongoing debate over token burning has created uncertainty, causing some investors to seek out new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Cardano (ADA) remains focused on decentralization and long-term sustainability, the allure of quick gains in projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) could lead to a shift in investor sentiment. For those willing to weather the storm, Cardano (ADA) still holds promise, but for others, the excitement of newer ventures is difficult to resist. Conclusion: ADA vs Mpeppe—What’s Next? The current debate within the Cardano (ADA) community reflects the broader tensions in the crypto world between long-term development and short-term gains. While Charles Hoskinson continues to advocate for the preservation of the Treasury to fund future growth, some investors are looking for immediate returns and have turned their attention to meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE).

33262650,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640343,1725642197,Cardano (ADA) Whales Begin To Doubt Hopskinson & Move ADA Into New Casino Presale Priced $0.00177,"Cardano (ADA) has long been a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, especially those who appreciate its strong focus on decentralization and its ambitious roadmap. However, recent events and the market’s volatility have left some Cardano (ADA) investors, particularly the whales, reconsidering their positions. In the wake of these concerns, many are shifting their attention—and their capital—toward promising new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-themed meme coin that has gained substantial momentum during its presale phase. Cardano (ADA)’s New GovTools: A Double-Edged Sword? One of the most significant developments in the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem has been the introduction of new governance tools, commonly known as GovTools. These tools allow ADA holders to participate more actively in the network’s decision-making processes by delegating their votes and acting as decentralized representatives (dReps). This push toward greater decentralization is part of Cardano (ADA)’s long-term vision, and the new tools aim to enhance the platform’s governance model, potentially boosting the value of ADA in the long run. Yet, despite these innovations, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain its footing in the crypto market. The ADA price has experienced a 10.56% drop over the past week, with the token currently hovering around $0.319. For ADA to regain its upward momentum, it must hold the crucial support level of $0.30 and break through resistance at $0.34. These price movements are pivotal in regaining the trust of investors who are increasingly looking for alternative opportunities, such as Mpeppe (MPEPE). Voltaire Era: Promising or Problematic? Cardano (ADA) entered the Voltaire era in September 2023, marking the beginning of a new phase focused on decentralization and governance. The recent implementation of the Conway hard fork has further pushed Cardano (ADA) toward its goal of full decentralization. The Voltaire era has the potential to transform Cardano (ADA) into a more community-driven platform, which could reignite interest in ADA and restore investor confidence. However, this optimism may not be enough to stave off concerns among larger investors, especially those who expected quicker results. Some whales, disillusioned by the slow progress, are diversifying their portfolios into newer, high-potential projects. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its presale price at $0.00177, has emerged as one such investment opportunity, particularly for those seeking high-risk, high-reward options. Mpeppe: The New Darling of ADA Whales While Cardano (ADA) continues to focus on its long-term vision of decentralization, whales are increasingly looking for short-term gains to balance their portfolios. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin with a casino twist, has attracted significant interest from these larger investors. The project’s presale has already raised a significant amount, and analysts are forecasting a potential price explosion once it officially launches on major exchanges. Unlike ADA, which is rooted in a slow-and-steady approach to development, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its ability to generate quick returns. The coin is currently priced at just $0.0021, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on early-stage gains. With a unique meme concept combined with a strong community backing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be poised to deliver substantial profits, much like other meme coins that have skyrocketed in the past. What This Means for Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA)’s focus on governance and decentralization is not without merit. The introduction of GovTools is a positive step toward empowering the community and ensuring that ADA holders have a say in the platform’s future. However, the market’s impatience and the slow pace of progress have left some investors, particularly whales, searching for faster-growing alternatives. If ADA can maintain its critical support levels and break through its resistance, there’s still potential for a strong price rebound. Some analysts even predict that ADA could soar to $75 if Bitcoin reaches $500,000, though such predictions are highly speculative and contingent on broader market conditions. For now, however, the attention of many Cardano (ADA) whales has shifted to Mpeppe (MPEPE). The meme coin’s potential for quick gains offers a stark contrast to Cardano (ADA)’s more conservative approach, making it an appealing option for investors looking for both excitement and returns. Conclusion: The Future of ADA and Mpeppe As Cardano (ADA) continues to develop its governance structure and solidify its long-term vision, it remains to be seen whether the platform can win back the whales who are migrating to other opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). While ADA has the potential for substantial growth, the allure of quick gains in the meme coin market is proving hard to resist for some investors.

The ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi) is the belief that a blockchain-based financial system will free society from rent-seeking intermediaries and make financial services accessible to the globally unbanked.  And yet, it’s not hard to miss that much of what is considered “DeFi” today really just feels like a circular casino that facilitates speculation on tokens whose value is primarily derived from monetizing token speculation.  It is not sacrilegious to acknowledge this fact, nor is it to accept that this current version of DeFi is clearly not sustainable. There is only so much demand for circular token speculation and there isn’t an infinite amount of retail capital to burn.  DeFi in its current state is not the catalyst that will scale crypto adoption beyond current levels, but that doesn’t mean the creation of an on-chain token casino was all for nothing.  Read more: Vitalik Buterin Reflects On Strengths, Weaknesses of Ethereum  DeFi, in its current form, has proven that an on-chain financial system can be created that provides all the core primitives that an open, globally accessible, and robust financial system would require: payments, swaps, lending, derivatives, insurance, and much more.  The infrastructure and protocols that underpin DeFi do indeed reduce counterparty risk and costs, while increasing transparency and accessibility — even if the initial product-market fit amounts to little more than token gambling.  So how can DeFi overcome its circular token gambling obsession and play its proper role in scaling crypto adoption?  Tokenized assets  At their most basic level, blockchains are the superior method of issuing, transferring, and tracking assets via the creation of digital tokens. Finance revolves around asset management, making DeFi the most tangible, obvious growth opportunity for crypto.  But, to grow, the DeFi economy needs access to more assets that can be represented as tokens. While cryptocurrencies have gotten DeFi to where it is today, evolving beyond the casino-stage means seeking out where most of the capital in the world resides. And the answer is blindingly obvious.  Tokenizing all the assets within the traditional financial system — bank deposits, commercial paper, treasuries, mutual funds, money market funds, stocks, futures, options, swaps, etcetera — would bring hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of capital on-chain.  One single firm, BlackRock, manages nearly five times more assets ($10.5 trillion) than the market capitalization of the entire crypto market ($2.2 trillion).  This is capital that can then be seamlessly plugged into existing on-chain finance protocols, in effect hotswapping token gambling with real-world financing. Far from just a pipedream, many of the world’s largest financial institutions are actively positioning themselves for a future where tokenization is the status quo.  In less than half a year, BlackRock’s tokenized fund on Ethereum, BUIDL, has exceeded $500 million AUM, bringing the total value of tokenized government securities on public blockchains to over $1.5 billion. While this amount is a small fraction of the value contained in the traditional system, the active participation of the world’s largest asset manager within a public blockchain ecosystem speaks volumes.  Read more: James Wo - How Ethereum 2.0 Can Transform DeFi  Furthermore, stablecoins have proven that the demand for tokenized assets is overwhelmingly real. With over $150 billion of U.S. dollars tokenized on-chain, and monthly transfer volume of $1.4 trillion, stablecoin usage now rivals that of established payments networks such as Visa. While not often thought of as a tokenized asset, the only difference between Circle’s USDC and BlackRock’s BUIDL is who receives the yield.  Stablecoins highlight the core value of tokenization as they allow anyone to transfer dollars to anyone else in the world with just an internet connection. Transactions are settled in under a second and for less than a penny in fees. For anyone in a country with a hyper-inflating currency, who has tried to make a cross-border remittance payment, or simply wants to make a financial transaction on a weekend or holiday, the benefits of stablecoins are immediately obvious.  While DeFi’s token gambling won’t ever completely disappear, it is clear that the underlying infrastructure that currently enables DeFi will come to define the way the world economy operates. The path forward comes from embracing a simple fact: tokenized assets are a superior way to represent financial assets.

33262107,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640339,1725641039,"Solana (SOL), ETH Stumble as Mpeppe Builds Aggressive Momentum","The cryptocurrency market has been on a rollercoaster ride in 2024, with major altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) grappling with intense volatility. While these top-tier projects have been struggling to maintain their positions, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising meme coin, has gained aggressive momentum, attracting investors looking for more dynamic opportunities. Solana (SOL)’s Struggles in 2024 Solana (SOL), once heralded as a breakthrough blockchain for its speed and scalability, has encountered significant hurdles in recent months. Despite being one of the top altcoins, Solana (SOL) has seen a sharp decline in trading volume, dropping to its lowest levels in three years. In the past, Solana (SOL) had managed to compete head-to-head with Ethereum in terms of transaction speeds and innovation, but the current market dynamics have proven challenging for the project. In September 2024, Solana (SOL)’s 24-hour trading volume dropped below $5 billion, a significant decline compared to Ethereum’s activity. The decrease in liquidity and trading activity has caused concern among Solana (SOL) investors, many of whom have started shifting their investments toward other altcoins, including Tron and the new presale star Rollblock. However, Solana (SOL) is not out of the game yet. Trading at around $130, the project still holds potential, but its recovery has been slow. With competition increasing, Solana (SOL)’s investors are seeking faster-growing opportunities, which is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) enters the scene. Ethereum (ETH) Struggles with Market Dynamics Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has also seen its share of struggles. In the wake of a bearish market, Ethereum’s price has fluctuated significantly, failing to maintain the momentum it saw earlier in the year. Despite the adoption of Layer-2 solutions and continuous updates to its network, Ethereum’s growth has stalled. Investors are beginning to diversify their portfolios as Ethereum battles market volatility. While ETH continues to hold a dominant position in the crypto space, the allure of faster, more aggressive gains in newer coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the attention of those looking for fresh opportunities. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) Meteoric Rise While Solana (SOL) and Ethereum face challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been breaking records. The meme coin, which has gained a cult-like following, is experiencing an aggressive surge in value, thanks to its community-driven growth and impressive presale performance. In just a short time, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has built significant momentum, with its presale already reaching over 66% of its target in Stage 4. This performance has raised eyebrows, especially among seasoned investors looking for the next big breakout. Whales and retail investors alike are now eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) as it builds aggressive momentum in a market otherwise dominated by struggles. With the meme coin space heating up, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise is fueled by strong community engagement and the potential for exponential returns. As it nears major exchange listings, many believe Mpeppe (MPEPE) could follow in the footsteps of previous meme coin successes like PEPE, but with even greater potential due to its unique appeal. Why Investors Are Turning to Mpeppe As Solana (SOL) and Ethereum battle market volatility, investors are looking for coins with more aggressive growth trajectories, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) fits the bill perfectly. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale success, coupled with its strong community support, has given it the edge in a market where quick profits are becoming increasingly difficult to find. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s continuous green candle streak over the past few months has attracted significant attention, especially from Solana (SOL) investors who have seen their holdings diminish in value. With the potential for a Tier-1 exchange listing on the horizon, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised for significant gains, and many traders are betting on it to deliver high returns in the short term. Conclusion: Mpeppe’s Dominance on the Horizon While Solana (SOL) and Ethereum remain key players in the crypto world, their recent struggles have left many investors searching for alternative opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its aggressive momentum and strong presale performance, has emerged as one of the most exciting prospects in the current market.

42390408,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1YjJ,1725640856,'Blurt' Developer Thinks Crypto Makes for Better Donations to Twitch Streamers,"SALT LAKE CITY — Many of the software devs attending mtnDAO are building projects to support their venture capital-backed crypto companies.  T.J. Littlejohn, a longtime attendee of this self-described ""notorious"" hacker house, says he's building for himself.  T.J. hacked his new product together with a few weeks of collaborative coding and countless ZYN packets – two hallmarks of the event. Called ""Blurt,"" the latest creation from the mtnDAO trenches offers a crypto-powered alternative for live streamers to collect donations from their viewers – in crypto, of course. Its development is a sign of progress for a Solana innovation introduced earlier this year – called blinks – that makes interacting with crypto as easy as a click on a tweet.  Blurts was hardly an idea before mtnDAO opened its August edition. Now, with only a few days left before dozens of Solana blockchain-focused developers clear out of this WeWork in downtown Salt Lake City until February, it's fully functional.  In a slapdash kind of way, Blurts embody the staying power of a hacker house that doesn't have an agenda beyond show up and build. Hosts Barrett and Edgar Pavlovsky don't seem to care what the attendees of mtnDAO do while they eat the free lunches, sit at free desks and pile up free swag for an entire month – though they do sometimes invest seed capital in the most promising projects made here.  Whether Blurts gets that infusion feels almost beside the point. In an interview, T.J. was noncommittal about making Blurts his full-time gig. He's more like a one-man ""product studio"" that ""ships fast"" and pivots often. During the last mtnDAO six months ago, he was building animation programs for the Apple VR headsets everyone was wearing.  What are Blurts  Blurts are built on blinks, a months-old standard for accessing and executing blockchain programs directly from X (formerly Twitter). A properly-coded blinks program populates a mini-app for, perhaps, trading cryptocurrencies, within the social media webpage, saving the would-be trader from having to move to another website to place their bid.  For Blurts, this means a would-be donor to a streamer can send crypto dollars to their favorite Fortnite-playing tweenager directly from the window where they're watching the stream.  ""That's a big thing with blinks: It keeps the viewer in the content of the stream while they donate,"" said T.J., himself a streamer. (He said he ""generally beats the five-year-olds"" in Fortnite. ""But the 12-year-olds are where I struggle.""  Right now Blurts only work on X, but T.J. said blinks' creator company Dialect has committed to expanding blinks to Twitch, where millions of live streamers play video games for profit.  Building at mtnDAO  ""I probably wouldn't have shipped this if I was just home,"" T.J. said, citing the ""builder energy of a sometimes bustling WeWork that at peak had 70-odd developers typing away in front of monitors.  There's practical upside for building in a collaborative workspace, too. Representatives of Dialect were on hand to help T.J. through some of the intricacies of deploying on blinks. So, too, were employees of TipLink, another crypto payments startup that streamlines the wallet onboarding process with users' Google accounts.  ""Being able to shoot the sh*t with people and bounce ideas off of everyone and show prototypes every step of the way"" helped get things done faster, T.J. said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/06/blurt-developer-thinks-crypto-makes-for-better-donations-to-twitch-streamers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa1416999473a8c8478a181a6eaa222e4d5f90d3-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Justin Drake, a prominent researcher at the Ethereum Foundation (EF) wrote during a typed ask-me-anything, on an Ethereum subreddit under the handle ""bobthesponge1,"" that the EF spends roughly $100 million per year and currently has roughly a 10-year runway, depending on the price of ether (ETH), the blockchain’s native token.  Drake confirmed to CoinDesk that bobthesponge1 is his Reddit account.  ""The EF has a fiat buffer to cover a couple of years of runway,"" he wrote in the AMA session. ""ETH sales were temporarily paused for regulatory reasons so the buffer wasn't replenished until recently.""  The last time the EF released insights on its financial holdings was in March 2022, at which point the EF treasury reported a balance of about $1.6 billion. That included $1.3 billion of ETH and about $11 million of ""other crypto.""  At the time, the ETH price was $3,283. It's down about 30% since then, to $2,296.  Over the last two years, due to the burn rate and price decreases, the funds have significantly decreased.  A redditor followed up, asking about if there was a sustainability plan in place, in the event that the EF runs out of funds.  “I'm not aware of any plan to sustainability :),” Drake responded.

42390407,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1YZ3,1725639530,Legacy Payment Processors Charge Adult Sites a Fortune; MyPeach.AI Found a Crypto Solution,"SALT LAKE CITY – Internet users love them. But mainstream payment processors hate working with them. Adult websites exist in an economic purgatory that, at best, makes them harder and costlier to connect to the conventional banking system than most other online businesses.  Which is why Crass Kitty, the pseudonymous founder of artificial intelligence-powered sexting website MyPeach.AI, is turning to crypto.  MyPeach.AI users might not realize that when they're, say, flirting with an AI-generated clone of an OnlyFans girl or paying for an alluring (also AI-generated) personalized image. Many of them will likely be paying by credit card, after all.  Invisible to them, however, is that they're actually buying stablecoins. Those go to MyPeach.ai to cover the startup's payroll, the high cost of generating AI content and the real-life OnlyFans models who agreed to let the website train its AI models on their images, voice and personality.  Kitty says payment processors charge a 3-5% fee when customers use a card to buy crypto. For adult entertainment purchases, it's 10-15% – an exorbitant amount, Kitty says.  ""There's a real incentive to build on crypto,"" she said.  So, to be clear, MyPeach.AI's customers are getting adult content. And some of them may be using a credit card to pay for it. If they do, behind the scenes, what's really happening is they're purchasing a stablecoin and sending it to MyPeach.AI – all because payment processors charge through the nose for adult entertainment.  Porn sites notoriously suffer high rates of chargebacks that have prompted card processors to impose higher-than-normal transaction fees. This puts a squeeze on the business owners: They're not making as much money from their customers.  Crypto isn't a catch-all solution. As Kitty found in her previous adult-themed crypto business – a marketplace for buying and selling NFTs of porn stars – newbies seldom tolerate setting up wallets, acquiring tokens and then sending them to addresses. It's just too much friction.  Kitty is developing her site at the mtnDAO hacker house in Salt Lake City. At a previous mtnDAO, Kitty decided to pivot to AI. Her bet was that people would flock to the tailored experiences that large language models can be trained to create. As OnlyFans has shown, they're also willing to pay a premium for personalized sexual content.  MyPeach.AI combines both with a bit of crypto. It incentivizes users to exchange flirty texts with AI personas – either trained to their sexual preferences or to mimic real-life models – by paying them PEACH tokens. The users can pay PEACH tokens in exchange for AI-generated images. If they don't have enough tokens, they can top up with a credit card (that's where the stablecoin workaround comes in).  According to Kitty, a handful of banks are willing to work with crypto companies. A few are also willing to work with adult entertainment businesses. But none seem willing to work with crypto-powered adult entertainment businesses.  ""Being able to have most of our treasury on-chain means we don't have to worry about, if our banks shut us down, losing all of our funds,"" she said.  Kitty's been coming to mtnDAO since the August 2022 edition. The bustling and loud hacker house is a change of pace from her normal cadence of working from home in a Seattle apartment. In Salt Lake City, she said, it's ""been very helpful to have live feedback from the audience at mtnDAO – from a bunch of dudes.""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/06/legacy-payment-processors-charge-adult-sites-a-fortune-mypeachai-found-a-crypto-solution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2a7e1bf86dbbb67c1b651c4d7fdc625a5b53de2-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts at the British bank argued that both companies have ""matured meaningfully.""  Coinbase, in particular, could profit from a friendlier regulatory environment as a result of the presidential election in November, Barclays said.  British banking giant Barclays has upgraded both Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) to equal weight from underweight, citing better business models.  Both company’s stocks opened the day higher on Friday after the report was sent out overnight. The stocks later dropped more than 3% as bitcoin {{BTC}} and broader crypto market index CoinDesk 20 fell.  According to Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish, both companies have “matured meaningfully,” particularly because of their product expansion and more positive financial outlook.  Coinbase, in particular, could profit from a friendlier regulatory environment, given that both presidential candidates have taken an increasingly friendly stance towards the digital asset industry, and with the approval of several spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Barclays said in the note.  “While we continue to see risks for Coinbase, we think the improving environment, P&L profile, gradual but ongoing diversification, clear industry leadership in the US, and recent share performance point to a more balanced risk/reward, and we move to Equal Weight,” the analyst wrote.  The crypto industry has been through a lot since the collapse of FTX and some other then-major crypto companies in 2022 and 2023, but Coinbase has been resilient, the report stated. Budish applauds the company for keeping costs low, specifically related to its workforce even as activity has picked up in 2024.  “Management has been disciplined in their hiring and costs have grown much more modestly vs. prior, allowing the model to enjoy more incremental margin from this leverage,” Budish said.  He also mentioned Coinbase’s increasingly diverse sources of income. While the exchange still gets most of its revenue from trading fees and interest income, it has started seeing other areas of the business become a meaningful contributor, including Blockchain rewards, custody revenues and other transaction fees, Barclays said.  The analysts warn that while many things seem to be moving in the right direction for Coinbase, there remains uncertainty in the space, including the broader macroeconomic environment and regulatory unclarity regarding several assets being securities and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) suit against Coinbase which has yet to be resolved.  'Increasingly turning around'  The analysts also see similar positive developments in Robinhood’s business model which could lead to future upside. The main reasons for his positive stance include new products, the firm’s expansion in the UK and Europe and new potential customers coming from the pending acquisition of Bitstamp.  “The factors that drove our Underweight ratings are increasingly turning around, and we now see the risk/reward for both stocks as more balanced,” Barclays said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/06/coinbase-robinhood-upgraded-by-barclays-analyst-citing-matured-business-models,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3eb17dc847aac0d17b8d002fa8ce150050ff0de-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33260870,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640238,1725638402,Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play,"Meme coin Shiba Inu now finds itself trading between a narrow range of $0.000013 on the support side and $0.00001370 on the resistance side in the past 48 hours. This consolidation price action has emerged after a decline that saw SHIB fall from $0.00001600 in the last week of August. This notable decline has culminated with SHIB bouncing off support at $0.000013, which coincides with the 0.618 level on the Fibonacci extension indicator within a bearish trend that has persisted since April. While Shiba Inu has continued to battle this larger bearish trend on the monthly timeframes, crypto analysts are confident of a SHIB break to the upside. According to several technical experts, the fact that SHIB has maintained support at this crucial level without breaking lower is seen as a sign of resilience. Particularly, crypto analyst Javon Marks is confident of a SHIB recovery back to 2024 highs, especially as the meme coin has confirmed multiple bullish patterns with the RSI indicator. SHIB Recovery Still In Play Javon Marks’ analysis was noted in a social media post on X as an update to an ongoing SHIB analysis that dates back to September 2023. One of the key technical signals contributing to the analyst’s optimism is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has shown signs of bullish divergence. Related Reading: Litecoin Looks Poised To Explode As Grayscale Buys 10,000 LTC The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the strength and speed of price movements. In SHIB’s case, the RSI, which has fallen massively from an overbought zone in April, recently retested its lowest point in the first quarter of 2024. According to Marks’, this retest is bullish for SHIB and is a massive sign for the resumption of overbought momentum. This momentum, in turn, would see SHIB rallying over 231% from the current price level to retest its $0.00003629. With the attainment of a new yearly high, this would open the doors for a continued rally close to SHIB’s all-time high. Looking ahead, Marks remains steadfast in his long-term target for SHIB, which he initially outlined in his first technical analysis back in September 2023. According to him, “the $0.000081 target is still in play.” The $0.000081 price point has been a central focus of Marks’ analysis since his initial coverage of SHIB’s price analysis. To get to this price, SHIB would need to perform a 480% increase from the current price level. Current State Of Shiba Inu At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.0000132. SHIB continues to steadily attract investor interest, with whale activity recently seeing a drastic increase. According to analysts at Santiment, the interest surrounding meme coins, including SHIB, has been really quiet in the past few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: BTC Price Could Crack $50,000 If This Important Level Does Not Hold Santiment analysts believe that the low levels of activity and reduced market excitement could be signs that SHIB is approaching a bottom and laying the groundwork for a potential rebound.

Crypto companies have been very active in the current U.S. presidential election run, building a $169 million war chest at the Fairshake PAC, for which Ripple is one of the top contributors.  Apart from Fairshake, Ripple has sought to combat at least one prominent Democrat, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse has contributed to a PAC favoring Senate Republicans.  Ripple Co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen is among the 88 corporate leaders who endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the next U.S. president in a letter on Friday, revealing potential differences among company leaders.  While Larsen joined, other high-profile CEO's come from the likes of review site Yelp, cloud storage company Box and social media platform Snapchats Snap and more, according to the letter CNBC was first to report, Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse have targeted prominent Democrats in their campaign contributions.  The majority of the company's contributions have gone to pro-crypto super political action committees (PACs) like the Fairshake political action committee, which is focused on getting crypto-friendly candidates elected from both major parties. Ripple Labs has been among the chief backers of Fairshake and its affiliates, giving about $48 million to influence the 2024 elections.  While the industry's combined effort has tried to walk a tightrope between the two major political parties, Ripple's giving has leaned into the Republican side in one key situation: trying to defeat crypto critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) Garlinghouse, the company's CEO, has also personally given $50,000 to a super-PAC aimed at building a Republican majority in the Senate, according to disclosures to the Federal Elections Commission. So his political sympathies may be at odds with the letter Larsen signed, which favors a Democratic administration under Harris.  The letter argued Harris would ""continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment.""  Ripple has been in a protracted fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over accusations the company violated securities laws in its sales of the token {{XRP}}, and the case has represented one of the foundational battles between the industry and the regulator over how cryptocurrencies should be overseen by the U.S. government. The thinking of SEC Chair Gary Gensler is seen by the industry as being in line with Warren's.  Though the crypto sector has pumped unprecedented levels of money into the congressional and presidential races this year, the emerging view of digital assets businesses and enthusiasts has favored the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, who has strongly embraced crypto after years of previous suspicion. Trump reiterated during a speech in New York on Thursday that he wants to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if re-elected as president.

42390399,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1Xz9,1725637242,Prosecutors Tell NY Court They Didn’t Renege on FTX Exec Ryan Salame’s Plea Deal,"Federal prosecutors have fired back against Ryan Salame’s allegations that they reneged on agreements made in the former FTX executive’s plea deal – namely, that they would cease criminal investigations into Michelle Bond, Salame’s longtime partner and the mother of his child.  But prosecutors say they never made Salame any such promises, either formally or informally, and that their prosecution of Bond is fair game.  In a scathing 32-page memorandum filed Thursday, prosecutors urged U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to reject Salame’s recent petition asking for the conditions of his plea deal either be enforced or that his plea be thrown out and his sentence vacated, calling it a “shameless and self-serving attempt to renege on his guilty plea and conviction…and to undermine the lawful prosecution of Michelle Bond.”  Bond, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyer who spent years leading a D.C.-based crypto lobbying group, has been charged with violating campaign finance laws for taking illegal campaign contributions from Salame and other FTX employees during her failed 2022 run for Congress. She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted of all counts.  The day prosecutors indicted Bond, Salame’s lawyers filed a petition with the court alleging that “the Government failed to honor its implied commitment not to pursue the campaign-finance charges against Bond.”  On Aug. 29, Salame moved to withdraw his petition in order to allow Bond to bring up the issue in her own case. However, Judge Kaplan ruled that he would still hold a hearing on the original petition regardless of Salame’s motion to withdraw it, and mandated Salame’s attendance as part of his bail conditions. Salame is set to self-surrender himself to prison to begin his sentence in late October.  Prosecutors have urged Kaplan to reject the petition without a hearing.  In their memo, prosecutors called Salame’s assertions “inaccurate, incomplete, and outright false” and denied that they breached their plea agreement with Salame, noting that there was “nothing in Salame’s plea agreement that suggested that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York would not criminally prosecute any of Salame’s criminal co-conspirators in consideration of his guilty plea.”  Salame and Bond’s lawyers both knew that his guilty plea had no bearing on Bond’s prosecution, prosecutors argued, detailing conversations dating back to May 2023 where they claim to have explicitly told the defendants lawyers that “a Ryan disposition will not resolve investigation of Michelle’s conduct.”  A hearing on the matter is slated for Sep. 12, 2024.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/06/prosecutors-tell-ny-court-they-didnt-renege-on-ftx-exec-ryan-salames-plea-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16fff0c84c3c4e7f7175794e8555c952903ce0f1-1116x628.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33260038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640232,1725636608,MATIC Slides Deeper: Will It Break The $0.3132 Barrier?,"MATIC is under mounting bearish pressure as it continues its downward slide, drawing closer to a critical support level at $0.3132. A break below $0.3132 could open the door to additional losses, signaling a deeper bearish trend ahead. With the market sentiment turning increasingly negative, speculations are whether the bears can push the price beyond this vital support zone or if the support will hold firm against the downward momentum. As MATIC hovers near the crucial $0.3132 support level, this article aims to analyze its current price action by examining key technical indicators and market sentiment. It explores the potential outcomes if MATIC breaches this level and what this could mean for the cryptocurrency’s future trend. Current Market Overview: Bearish Sentiment Dominates On the 4-hour chart, after successfully breaking below the $0.5030 mark, MATIC has continued to build negative momentum dropping under the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it moves toward the $0.3132 support level. The digital asset has maintained a consistent downward trend, indicating that the bears remain firmly in control and could drive the price even lower if the selling pressure persists. Additionally, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line is well below the 50% threshold, situated at 33%. A sustained RSI reading below 50% suggests that the downward trend could continue, reinforcing the likelihood of additional declines as bearish sentiment remains strong. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Breakout Could Propel Price To $1 In Days: Crypto Analyst On the daily chart, MATIC is also exhibiting significant pessimistic movement as it trades below both the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $0.3132 support level. The formation of multiple bearish candlesticks underscores the prevailing negative sentiment and suggests that downbeat pressure remains dominant. This persistent drop indicates that the bears are maintaining control, and without a shift in momentum, MATIC may face further declines. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line has significantly dropped below the 50% threshold, currently sitting at 34%. This sharp decline below the 50% mark suggests a strong downside sentiment and pressure if the trend continues. A Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead For MATIC? As MATIC hovers near the $0.3132 support level, two primary scenarios are unfolding. Should the price hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal, targeting higher resistance levels such as $0.5030 or beyond. Conversely, a break below $0.3132 could exacerbate the bearish trend, leading to deeper declines toward the next support zone. Related Reading: MATIC: Market Nosedive Leads To 30% Wipe In Value MATIC is trading around $0.372, marking a 1.11% decline, with a market capitalization of over $1.7 billion and a trading volume exceeding $170 million, as of the time of writing. Also, in the past 24 hours, MATIC’s market cap has decreased by 1.25%, and its trading volume has dropped by 35.49%.

33258634,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24108,1725633211,How are Bitcoin Miners Holding Up Since the Halving?,"Since the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, which cut mining rewards in half, miners have faced significant profitability challenges, prompting many to adopt new strategies to stay afloat. With rising energy costs and reduced block rewards, miners are focusing on operational efficiency and upgrading hardware. Some are diversifying into AI and cloud computing, using their data centres for additional revenue. The post-halving landscape has also seen industry consolidation and an increased focus on innovation, as only the most efficient mining operations are expected to succeed in this more competitive environment. Slimmer Block Rewards and Even Slimmer Margins Since the 2024 Bitcoin halving on April 20th, the mining industry has been grappling with significant challenges. The halving, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, has halved miners’ revenues, pushing many to the brink of profitability. This cut has led to operational changes across the industry, as smaller miners face potential shutdowns while larger, more capitalised firms scramble to scale operations and increase efficiency. Energy costs, in particular, have become a primary concern as miners seek to reduce operational expenses amidst this new economic reality. In the months following the halving, miners have seen fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price, with short-lived rallies providing some relief but not enough to offset the reduced block rewards. Hashrate, the measure of computational power used to mine Bitcoin, initially dropped but has since shown signs of recovery. However, this recovery comes with increased mining difficulty, as competition intensifies among the remaining miners. The situation has forced many to adopt advanced hardware and pursue energy-efficient strategies to stay profitable. Many miners are exploring diversification beyond Bitcoin. Several firms have begun offering their infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, a growing industry with high energy demands. This pivot provides an alternative revenue stream for miners with large data centres and access to significant power resources. However, transitioning to AI is not without challenges, as the infrastructure requirements differ significantly from Bitcoin mining. The post-halving period has been characterised by adaptation and consolidation within the industry. Miners are merging, upgrading their hardware , and exploring alternative uses for their infrastructure in response to the halving’s revenue cuts. While the long-term effects of the halving will play out over the next few years, the current landscape suggests that only the most efficient and innovative mining operations will thrive in this new era of reduced block rewards. Rising energy costs have also intensified the challenges faced by Bitcoin miners. As electricity is the primary operational cost for mining (aside from hardware), those reliant on expensive or volatile energy sources are seeing their profit margins squeezed, making it increasingly difficult to remain viable . Only miners with access to the cheapest, often renewable, energy will be able to stay competitive, as they can operate more cost-effectively. This energy-driven pressure is expected to force many smaller or less efficient operations to capitulate, leading to consolidation in the industry, where only well-capitalised or strategically positioned firms with low-cost energy can weather the storm of the current market cycle. As Competition Increases, Miners are Seeking to Diversify Their Revenue Streams Bitcoin miners have been forced to explore diversification strategies to sustain their profitability. One key approach has been leveraging their existing data centres for alternative uses, particularly for supporting AI and cloud computing. Bitcoin mining firms like Core Scientific and BitDigital have begun repurposing their infrastructure to host high-performance computing services, which cater to the rising demand for AI applications. These firms are capitalising on the existing overlap between mining infrastructure and AI data centres, such as access to vast power supplies and fibre connectivity, to offer these services at scale. This allows them to tap into a growing market while reducing their dependence on volatile Bitcoin rewards. Another significant trend is the pivot towards energy-focused revenue streams. Mining firms are increasingly exploring ways to integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, into their operations. TeraWulf, for example, powers its mining facilities with nuclear energy and is planning to offer its infrastructure for machine learning tasks. By aligning themselves with sustainable energy initiatives, miners not only reduce operational costs but also position themselves favourably in a regulatory environment that is becoming more environmentally conscious. Additionally, some miners are exploring partnerships with power companies, converting surplus energy or stranded resources into operational power, creating a new avenue for financial returns while contributing to grid stability. In some cases, miners are directly monetising their access to energy infrastructure by offering surplus power to external customers. Companies like Marathon Digital have entered agreements where they are compensated for converting stranded methane or biomass into energy , effectively turning their mining facilities into energy hubs. This not only reduces their own energy costs but also provides an entirely new revenue stream through energy sales. By diversifying into energy management and distribution, miners are expanding their business models beyond Bitcoin and into the broader energy market, which provides more stability and growth potential. In response to declining profitability from Bitcoin mining, some companies are diversifying their operations by mining other cryptocurrencies that offer higher returns. These alternative cryptocurrencies, such as Kaspa or Ethereum Classic , may or may not (dependent on a miner’s hardware) require different mining algorithms or hardware but provide better short-term profitability due to lower competition and higher margins. By leveraging their existing infrastructure or by acquiring specialised mining equipment, these companies are able to capitalise on more favourable hash prices and block rewards, generating additional revenue streams. This strategic shift allows them to mitigate the financial pressures of Bitcoin’s post-halving environment, while still maintaining the flexibility to switch back to Bitcoin mining as conditions improve. Finally, miners are developing strategic partnerships and acquisitions to further diversify their offerings. Mergers and acquisitions within the industry, such as Riot Platforms’ attempted takeover of Bitfarms, reflect a consolidation trend where larger, more resilient firms are acquiring smaller operations to scale their efficiency and power capacity. Others, like Marathon, have taken an asset-light approach, investing heavily in mining rigs while leasing or acquiring energy infrastructure. This diversified investment in both energy assets and technology platforms enables miners to remain flexible, adapt to market fluctuations, and maintain profitability even as Bitcoin mining alone becomes less lucrative. With Mining Becoming More Cutthroat, What Can We Expect in the Future? As Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly cutthroat, the future will likely see further consolidation within the industry, favouring larger players with access to the cheapest and most efficient energy sources. Smaller miners, unable to keep pace with rising energy costs and intensifying competition, may be forced to exit the market or merge with larger firms. We can also expect mining companies to further diversify their revenue streams, leveraging their infrastructure for high-performance computing tasks such as AI processing, or mining other cryptocurrencies that offer better short-term profitability. Additionally, the increasing focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency will likely play a critical role, as firms that can secure sustainable, low-cost power will have a significant competitive advantage. Regulatory challenges may also rise as governments begin to scrutinise the environmental impact of mining, pushing the industry toward more innovative and greener solutions. Another key development we can expect is the diversification of revenue streams among mining companies. As profitability from Bitcoin mining alone becomes more challenging, firms are increasingly looking to other opportunities to monetise their infrastructure. Many are pivoting to provide high-performance computing services, such as AI model training and cloud computing, which can be more profitable than mining Bitcoin. Some companies are also exploring alternative cryptocurrencies that may offer better short-term returns, particularly in the periods where Bitcoin’s block reward reduction from halvings has yet to translate into significant price increases. This shift allows miners to maximise the utility of their hardware and reduce reliance on Bitcoin’s price volatility for profitability. The future of Bitcoin mining will also be shaped by a growing emphasis on sustainable energy solutions. As environmental concerns and regulatory pressures mount, mining companies are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar, and wind power. These energy sources not only offer cost advantages but also help mitigate the environmental impact of mining, which has been a point of contention in many regions. Companies that can successfully integrate these green energy solutions will not only reduce operational costs but may also gain favour with regulators and investors looking for environmentally responsible operations. This transition to greener mining practices will be crucial as governments and environmental groups scrutinise the energy consumption of the mining industry, potentially leading to more stringent regulations on energy usage and carbon emissions. The consolidation of the Bitcoin mining industry is already well underway as competition intensifies. Larger, well-funded mining firms with access to advanced hardware and efficient operations are in a stronger position to weather the pressures of rising energy costs and the diminishing block rewards post-halving. Smaller operations, which lack the capital to upgrade their infrastructure or secure low-cost energy, are more likely to exit the market or merge with larger entities. This trend is leading to a mining landscape dominated by a few major players, potentially reducing decentralisation, a hallmark of the Bitcoin network. As profitability becomes more dependent on scale, the industry will continue to favour those with vast resources and operational expertise.

With the success of Shiba Inu (SHIB), these large-scale investors are doubling down by diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising new casino and gaming token that is rapidly gaining momentum. Here’s why Shiba whales are diving into Mpeppe (MPEPE)and how they’re doubling their SHIB profits in the process. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Star in Casino and Gaming Mpeppe (MPEPE)is a revolutionary cryptocurrency that combines meme culture with the growing online casino and gaming industry. With its integration of DeFi protocols and focus on creating a gaming ecosystem where players can stake, earn, and play, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers unique value in the meme coin space. Whales who were early adopters of Shiba Inu (SHIB) are now turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), attracted by its casino utility and potential for massive gains. With its upcoming Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino launch, this token is poised to disrupt the online gambling sector, offering real-world applications beyond typical meme coins. Doubling SHIB Profits With Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi Integration One of the key reasons Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are backing Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi). Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), which relies primarily on its community and speculative growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers real financial functionality through yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance. These features provide whales with multiple streams of passive income, allowing them to earn significant rewards while holding onto their tokens. By staking Mpeppe (MPEPE) within DeFi liquidity pools, investors can generate continuous returns, making it a more lucrative investment compared to holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) alone. The Gaming and Casino Edge: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Unique Value Proposition The integration of gaming and casino utilities is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) truly shines. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become a household name in the meme coin world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a robust gaming platform that promises to redefine how cryptocurrencies are used in online casinos. With smart contracts ensuring fair play and blockchain technology offering transparency, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to attract players and investors alike. For Shiba whales, this presents an opportunity to invest in a cryptocurrency that is more than just a meme. The casino utility gives Mpeppe (MPEPE) real-world value, with potential for long-term growth as the online gambling market continues to expand. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Offers a Winning Combination for SHIB Whales Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are diversifying their portfolios with Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin with DeFi, casino utility, and gaming potential. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains momentum, they see long-term value in the token, potentially setting the stage for a big meme coin rally in 2024. Whether seasoned or new investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a must-watch cryptocurrency.

33257516,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640314,1725631247,Dogecoin Falls Behind Competitors Shiba Inu and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Both Develop Mobile Gaming Utility,"Dogecoin (DOGE), once the undisputed leader in the space, is facing stiff competition from newer projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these rising stars are pushing the boundaries of utility, particularly in the mobile gaming and online gambling sectors. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) introducing exciting features for users, Dogecoin (DOGE) may find itself playing catch-up. Here’s how Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are pulling ahead in the race for mobile gaming utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu’s Push into Mobile Gaming Both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have taken a different approach compared to Dogecoin (DOGE), focusing on developing real-world applications in the mobile gaming space. By integrating with mobile platforms, these cryptocurrencies are not only offering a more interactive experience but also tapping into a massive, global audience of mobile gamers. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains primarily a meme coin with speculative value, Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are giving their communities a reason to use their tokens beyond trading. By adding mobile gaming utility, they are creating real-world demand that could drive long-term value for both tokens. The Power of Meme Culture One of the biggest advantages that Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have over Dogecoin (DOGE) is their ability to leverage viral meme culture to grow their communities and drive token adoption. Mpeppe (MPEPE), in particular, has created a buzz within the online gambling community, allowing it to attract investors who are looking for a project with both entertainment value and financial potential. The viral influence of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been well-documented, and with the addition of mobile gaming and staking features, it’s clear that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is doing more than just riding the meme coin wave. It’s actively working to engage its audience in new and exciting ways, something that Dogecoin (DOGE) has yet to fully explore. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino: Instant Rewards for Players Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino offers a unique gaming experience that goes beyond traditional online casinos. By leveraging $MPEPE and other cryptocurrencies, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows players to earn instant rewards through their gaming activities. This is a major selling point for Mpeppe (MPEPE) and sets it apart from Dogecoin (DOGE), which lacks any substantial real-world applications in the gaming space. Players can engage with the Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform, earning timely rewards as they play, making the gaming experience not only fun but also financially rewarding. For Shiba Inu (SHIB), its focus on in-game economies allows users to earn and stake SHIB tokens in games, offering them a chance to participate in a broader ecosystem that merges entertainment with financial incentives. Why Dogecoin Is Falling Behind While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be one of the most popular meme coins, it has yet to fully capitalize on the mobile gaming and online casino sectors. Both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have moved quickly to integrate their tokens into these industries, providing tangible utility for users and investors. For Dogecoin (DOGE), its success has largely been driven by community support and celebrity endorsements, but without real-world applications like those being developed by Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), it risks being left behind. Conclusion: A New Era for Meme Coins Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are leading the way in the mobile gaming and casino sectors, combining viral culture excitement with real-world utility. These projects offer players and investors new ways to engage with their tokens, offering exciting opportunities to diversify portfolios and participate in the future of gaming and decentralized finance.

33257512,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640316,1725631244,Injective And Mpeppe (MPEPE): Two Cryptocurrencies Positioned For Major Growth In September,"As the cryptocurrency market gears up for a potential September rally, two standout tokens, Injective Protocol (INJ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), are making waves with their unique use cases and growing communities. With a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), A.I. integration, and community-driven innovation, both Injective Protocol (INJ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are positioned for significant growth. Let’s explore why these two cryptocurrencies are capturing investor attention and why September could be a pivotal month for both. Injective Protocol: A Powerhouse in DeFi and Cross-Chain Solutions Injective Protocol (INJ) is one of the most innovative projects in the DeFi space, offering cross-chain compatibility that allows users to trade derivatives, futures, and more across multiple blockchains. With a robust ecosystem and growing institutional interest, Injective Protocol (INJ) is primed for major growth. Cross-Chain Compatibility: Unlocking New Markets What sets Injective Protocol (INJ) apart is its ability to seamlessly connect different blockchains, allowing for decentralized trading of financial derivatives. This unique feature provides traders with access to multiple markets, enhancing liquidity and reducing barriers to entry. As more decentralized applications (dApps) build on the Injective Protocol (INJ) platform, the token is expected to see increased demand. Growing Institutional Interest Institutional investors are starting to take note of Injective Protocol (INJ)’s capabilities, particularly in the decentralized derivatives space. With major players showing interest in cross-chain DeFi solutions, Injective Protocol (INJ) is positioned for significant capital inflows, which could drive the price higher in the coming months. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Revolutionary A.I.-Powered Casino Token While Injective Protocol (INJ) focuses on DeFi and cross-chain trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining attention for its innovative approach to A.I.-powered online gambling and decentralized finance. By combining meme culture with real utility in the gambling sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as one of the most exciting new tokens in the market. A.I. Integration: Revolutionizing the Casino Experience Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out by integrating artificial intelligence into its casino platform. A.I. algorithms are used to ensure fair gameplay, optimize user experience, and enhance security.

33257510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640308,1725631229,"Shiba Inu Millionaire Adds Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin To Longterm Investment Portfolio, Here’s Why","A notable Shiba Inu (SHIB) millionaire has recently added Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) to their long-term investment portfolio. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has already proven its worth in the meme coin space, this strategic move signals confidence in the potential of both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Here’s why these two meme coins are catching the attention of high-net-worth investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi Integration: A Game-Changer in Meme Coin Utility One of the most compelling reasons behind the shift toward Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its groundbreaking integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Unlike traditional meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is adding real financial utility to its platform through yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance mechanisms. By allowing holders to participate in DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers more than just speculative gains. This enhanced functionality attracts long-term investors looking for ways to maximize returns and participate in the evolving DeFi space. Dogecoin’s Resilience and Meme Power While Dogecoin (DOGE) may lack the financial functionality of Mpeppe (MPEPE), its enduring popularity and status as the original meme coin cannot be ignored. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s ability to remain relevant, despite market fluctuations, makes it a staple in many portfolios. The support from high-profile figures like Elon Musk has also helped maintain DOGE’s position in the market. For the Shiba Inu (SHIB) millionaire, adding Dogecoin (DOGE) alongside Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects a balanced approach. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s community-driven success and its established brand in the meme coin space offer stability, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi innovation presents future growth potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Community-Driven Wealth Creation At the heart of Mpeppe (MPEPE)‘s vision is the creation of a global community that fosters creativity, drives positive change, and generates wealth for its members. Inspired by the success of other meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) takes this concept further by integrating blockchain technology and DeFi protocols into its platform. Investors, especially whales, are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) because it offers a unique blend of meme culture and financial technology. By participating in the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem, investors can take advantage of the community-driven approach while also benefiting from advanced financial services like yield farming and liquidity mining. Long-Term Growth Potential: Why Whales Are Flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) For any Shiba Inu (SHIB) millionaire or Dogecoin (DOGE) investor, the question is always about long-term growth. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant price surges, and Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to ride its wave of popularity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh perspective with its focus on DeFi and wealth generation. With its maximum token supply of 7.6 billion and initial price of $0.00177, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned for substantial growth. Investors are keen to get in early, with the belief that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could replicate the success of its predecessors while also offering greater utility through its DeFi capabilities. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin in a Long-Term Strategy The inclusion of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in a Shiba Inu (SHIB) millionaire’s portfolio demonstrates investor confidence in these two coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE), focusing on DeFi and community wealth creation, offers a fresh approach to the space. Balancing short-term gains with long-term growth could be a winning strategy for investors, as these meme coins are becoming a key part of diversified portfolios worldwide.

With a focus on creating an engaged community of gamers and NFT enthusiasts, Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gaming aims to capture the attention of those looking for a unique blend of entertainment and investment opportunities. The Appeal of NFT Trading Cards in Sports and Gaming One of the most exciting aspects of both Shiboshi and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gaming is the use of NFT trading cards. These digital collectibles offer a modern twist on traditional sports cards, allowing players to own exclusive and limited edition items that are stored on the blockchain. NFT trading cards not only guarantee secure ownership but also eliminate concerns about counterfeits or replicas. In both platforms, these cards can be traded in vibrant online marketplaces, creating a dynamic space for collectors and enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade their NFTs. For those who grew up collecting physical trading cards, the appeal of these blockchain-based collectibles lies in their uniqueness and the potential for value appreciation. Conclusion: The Evolution of NFTs in Gaming Shiboshi: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Games and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gaming are revolutionizing the world of NFTs and blockchain-based gaming by offering NFT trading cards and unique opportunities for players and collectors to engage with digital assets in a decentralized ecosystem, setting a new standard for gaming and collectibles.

The bank noted that network activity has been falling on Ethereum and stalling on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Both bitcoin and ether spot ETFs have seen outflows, the bank said.  The cryptocurrency market has continued to underperform other risk assets amid weakening demand, and is expected to stay highly correlated with equities, Citi (C) said in a research report on Friday.  The bank noted that both bitcoin and ether {{ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen outflows.  ""ETFs have seen net outflows, layer 1 activity has fallen or stagnated and funding rates remain very low,"" analysts led by David Glass wrote. Funding rates are the difference between price of the perpetual futures and the spot price of digital assets. A positive funding rate indicates that perpetuals are trading at a premium to the spot price, indicating increased demand for bullish bets.  Looking forward, the bank said it expects the crypto market to remain highly correlated with equities amid the upcoming macro calendar, which kicks off with today's Nonfarm Payrolls report.  Recent weakness in digital assets has resulted in lower energy consumption by bitcoin {{BTC}} miners and ""weaker production cost model outputs,"" the report said.  Meanwhile, the market cap for stablecoin continue to grow, shrugging off the recent market weakness, the bank said.  The Bitcoin hashrate, a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty, is now at the upper end of its recent range, the report noted. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  Activity has also been trending lower on the Ethereum blockchain, and stalling on the Bitcoin network, the report added.  Rival Wall Street bank JPMorgan expressed similar sentiment in a report on Friday. It said the crypto ecosystem lacks major catalysts in the near-term and digital assets are likely to be more sensitive to macro factors.

According to analysts, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is predicted to hit $0.00014, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) could surge to $0.20. Here’s a look at why the hype is forming around Shiba Inu and why Mpeppe (MPEPE) might be the next big thing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Building Momentum Toward $0.00014 Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long been considered one of the most promising memecoins following Dogecoin’s rise to fame. Its unique ecosystem, which includes ShibaSwap, staking options, and an active community, has allowed Shiba Inu (SHIB) to maintain its relevance in the ever-evolving crypto market.

The SHIB army, Shiba Inu’s loyal group of supporters, continues to push for broader adoption and utility of the token. With various new projects and use cases emerging, including potential partnerships in the gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is once again gaining traction. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Memecoin Positioned for a Major Surge to $0.20 While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is already well-established, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a standout player in the memecoin space. Analysts predict that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could reach $0.20, a significant jump from its current presale price.

Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn’t just riding the memecoin wave—it’s actively bringing utility to the table. By incorporating real financial services into its platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) creates an environment where users can both have fun and earn rewards, positioning it as a unique blend of meme culture and DeFi innovation. Why Shiba Inu Hype Is Forming Again Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s ecosystem is expanding, with new initiatives like ShibaSwap and staking options creating value for holders. The active community supports the token, pushing for mainstream recognition and adoption. Despite market downturns,Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains relevant. The token’s foray into decentralized finance and gaming is generating excitement within the community, as it can be integrated into gaming platforms and DeFi services, attracting a wider audience and creating new use cases. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Role in the Future of Crypto and Online Casinos Mpeppe (MPEPE), a blockchain-based online gambling platform, is gaining attention due to its enhanced security and privacy features. Its decentralized nature protects against data breaches, ensuring a safer gambling environment. MPEPE also facilitates global access to gambling platforms, allowing players to engage without traditional banking methods. The integration of blockchain technology ensures quick, low-cost, and transparent transactions, maintaining player trust in the gambling industry. Conclusion: SHIB and Mpeppe (MPEPE), Two Crypto Stars on the Rise Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining attention from crypto investors due to their expanding ecosystem and strong community support.

33255802,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640212,1725627605,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash Below $50,000 This Weekend","Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, today expressed a bleak outlook for the Bitcoin price’s immediate future. On his X profile, Hayes revealed his personal market maneuver, stating, “BTC is heavy, I’m gunning for sub $50k this weekend. I took a cheeky short. Pray for my soul, for I am a degen.” Why Hayes Possibly Expects A Bitcoin Price Crash While Hayes refrained from providing explicit reasons for his prediction, the timing of his statement closely aligns with significant US economic indicators set to be released this Friday. The US jobs data has been a critical factor for market analysts lately. The Kobeissi Letter analysts, commenting on the situation, noted the increasing influence of unemployment data on Federal Reserve policies. Related Reading: 100% Accurate Bitcoin Bottom Signal Hits: Time to Buy? They explained via X that, “Prediction markets are now pricing in 4 rate cuts in 2024, or 100 bps of cuts, for the first time since the August 5th crash, according to Kalshi. Over the last 2 days, prediction markets have priced-in an additional rate cut in 2024. This comes as labor market data has deteriorated around the board. It’s clear that unemployment data is quickly becoming the primary driver of Fed policy, along with inflation.” According to the analysts, today’s jobs report will be the key factor in determining if the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 bps or 25 bp. The next FOMC meeting takes place from September 17-18, 2024. “If the jobs report is in-line with expectations, or better, we believe a 25 bps rate cut is coming. Interest rate expectations appear to be shifting too dovish again,” The Kobeissi analysts believe. Notably, the deteriorating labor market scenario was just highlighted by data released earlier in the week. US job openings, as reported by the JOLTs survey, fell to 7.67 million in July from the previous 7.91 million in June, marking the lowest level since January 2021. Analysts had anticipated a figure around 8.09 million, making the actual data a significant miss from expectations. Related Reading: Senator Lummis Claims Bitcoin Could Cut National Debt In Half By 2045 Since March 2022, job openings have declined by an alarming 4.51 million, or 38%, a reduction that The Kobeissi Letter describes as “MASSIVE.” They added, “The most notable drop was seen in construction openings which fell to 248,000 in July, their lowest since October 2020. Meanwhile, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers fell to 1.07 in July, in line with 2018 levels.” This backdrop of weakening job data and revised economic forecasts has undoubtedly contributed to the bad sentiment on the Bitcoin market. Hayes seems to expect more bad macro data, which he believes could push the Bitcoin price below $50,000. Is $46,000 The Bottom? Adding to the chorus of bearish outlooks, renowned trader Peter Brandt also provided his technical analysis, observing what he terms an “inverted expanding triangle or a megaphone” pattern in Bitcoin’s weekly chart. Brandt highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to test a lower boundary around $46,000, underscoring a dominance of selling pressure over buying interest in the market. He pointed out, “This is called an inverted expanding triangle or a megaphone. A test of the lower boundary would be to 46,000 or so. A massive thrust into new ATHs is required to get this bull market back on track BTC. Selling is stronger than buying in this pattern.” At press time, BTC traded at $55,767.

42390416,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1ZJD,1725627600,"Sonic SVM, Gaming Project on Solana Blockchain, Plans $12.8M Node Sale","Sonic SVM has built its own framework, HyperGrid, which can be used to spin up new networks called ""grids"" that ultimately settle to the Solana blockchain.  The sale is scheduled for the week of Sept. 16 and will include 50,000 ""HyperFuse nodes"" in 20 pricing tiers.  The nodes come with token rewards and allow holders to monitor the network state.  ""While not officially confirmed, there are possible future airdrops for node operators,"" according to a press release.  Sonic SVM, a project to scale the Solana blockchain to gaming-quality speed and throughput, plans to sell as much as $12.8 million worth of validator nodes in its HyperGrid, a decentralized framework designed to support new application-specific networks.  The sale, scheduled for the week of Sept. 16, will be the first in the Solana blockchain ecosystem and will include 50,000 ""Hyperfuse nodes"" in 20 pricing tiers, according to the team. Proceeds will go into the project's treasury for general purposes, including supporting the development team and grants, CEO and co-founder Chris Zhu said in an interview.  Node sales have been growing in popularity as a way for blockchain projects to raise funds while simultaneously decentralizing their networks. Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure provider, disclosed in May that it raised about $126 million in Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} token by distributing more than 73,000 node licenses. Other projects including Sophon, CARV, XAI Games and Powerloom have used the method to bring in fresh funds.  The sale comes just a couple of months after Sonic SVM raised $12 million in a Series A fundraising led by Bitkraft and joined by investors including Galaxy Interactive and Big Brain Holdings.  Purchasers of the nodes will qualify for token rewards while also contributing to the HyperGrid network security, according to a thread on X. The nodes can be set up to run on a laptop or cloud servers.  ""Being a node operator actually allows them to monitor the HyperGrid state, which means they participate in the validation,"" Zhu said.  Solana's OP Stack  Under the project's architecture, Sonic SVM itself is considered a ""grid"" built atop a blockchain apparatus known as the HyperGrid. That, in turn, provides the interface for ultimately settling transactions on Solana. Other grids could be spun up as well, either for more gaming domains or even an AI network, according to Zhu.  Zhu likened Sonic SVM's HyperGrid to Solana's version of Optimism's OP Stack – a popular template for spinning up a new layer-2 networks atop the Ethereum blockchain. U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's layer-2 project, Base, is built on that framework.  Layer-2 networks are designed to scale blockchains by providing an alternate venue for faster and cheaper transactions than main, layer-1, blockchains. Such structures have historically been less emphasized for the Solana because it's already considered faster and cheaper than the far-more-sprawling Ethereum blockchain.  An added enticement is that the deal ""presents a rare chance for individuals to acquire Sonic Tokens at a valuation lower than that offered to top venture capital"" firms in the recent Series A fundraising, Sonic SVM said in a press release.

According to Friday morning's Nonfarm Payrolls report from the government, the U.S. added 142,000 jobs in August versus economist forecasts for 160,000 and July's 89,000 (revised from a previously reported 114,000). The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2%, in line with expectations and from 4.3% in July.  Down sizably in the days leading up to the report, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} rose about 1% to $56,500 in the minutes following the report. The price remains lower by 5% from week-ago levels.  A check of traditional markets shows U.S. stock index futures trimming early large losses, with the Nasdaq now lower by just 0.5% against a decline of more than 1% earlier. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is lower by 5 basis points to 3.68% and the dollar index has dipped 0.3%. Gold is up 0.5% to $2,557 per ounce, close to its all-time high.  Will the Fed cut 25 or 50?  Always a key data point, the jobs numbers for August had taken on extra importance given that the Federal Reserve is set to begin cutting rates at its mid-September meeting. The conventional thinking believed the U.S. central bank would enter this monetary easing cycle cautiously by lowering its benchmark fed funds rate just 25 basis points. The Fed, though, might be swayed by a weak August employment report to instead slash rates 50 basis points at that meeting.  The headline numbers from this report don't appear to make the case for a 50 basis point move. The downward revisions to not just July (to 89K from 114K), but also June (to 118K from 179K) are somewhat troublesome though. Taken together, the three month average job growth of just 116,000 is sure to come up in the Fed's discussions.  A check of other report details shows a somewhat stronger picture. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in August versus expectations for 0.3% and July's 0.1% dip. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 3.8% versus expectations for 3.7% and July's 3.6%.

42390417,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1ZE5,1725624441,First Mover Americas: BTC Treads Water Ahead of U.S. Jobs Report,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: $1,773.25 −1.29%  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,000.24 −1.27%  Ether (ETH): $2,370.13 −0.8%  S&P 500: 5,503.41 −0.3%  Gold: $2,519.38 +0.09%  Nikkei 225: 36,391.47 −0.72%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell as low as $55,300 before recovering to trade around $56,100, down 1% in 24 hours and extending its seven-day loss to over 5%. The broader digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has dropped more than 1.3% over 24 hours. The U.S. government is set to release its nonfarm payrolls report for August later. If the reading is weak, as all the other economic data this week has been, it will strengthen the argument for an interest-rate cut of 50 basis points in September.  Bitcoin's 200-day simple moving average is in danger of turning bearish as its upward momentum has slowed to a crawl for the first time since October. Since late August, the measure has averaged a daily increase of less than $50, a significant drop from the $200-plus moves seen earlier this year, according to data from charting platform TradingView. As of writing, the 200-day SMA was $63,840. The 100-day SMA recently moved below the 200-day SMA, confirming a bearish crossover. The averages signal a weakening bullish sentiment and growing caution consistent with the increasing macroeconomic uncertainty.  At the end of August, the crypto market had dropped 24% from its March peak to $2.02 trillion, JPMorgan said in a research report. The bank highlighted the lack of major catalysts to support crypto assets in the face of challenging macroeconomic factors. Spot ether and bitcoin ETF flows were ""somewhat uninspiring,"" JPMorgan said, adding that many viewed the launch of ETH ETFs as disappointing when compared with the bitcoin versions in January. Spot bitcoin ETF flows also disappointed, recording net outflows of $81 million in August. The bank said it awaits the next catalyst for development and ""enhanced retail engagement.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of ether held in wallets associated with centralized exchanges.  The so-called exchange balance has increased by over 263,000 ETH ($624 million) since late August, a sign of investors looking to liquidate their holdings or use coins for derivatives trading.

33253395,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640241,1725622200,"Dogecoin Moving Averages Say Accumulation Has Ended, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next","Dogecoin entered an extended accumulation range after hitting a new yearly peak in May 2024. Since then, the price has fluctuated widely, presumably giving investors time to enter back into the meme coin at lower prices. However, with the market on a decline and expectations for a recovery on the horizon, Dogecoin investors seem to be done with their buying. This signals that the drawn-out accumulation trend could be at an end, something that could be bullish for the meme coin’s price. Why The Dogecoin Accumulation Has Ended Crypto analyst, VIAQUANT, on the TradingView website, has suggested that the Dogecoin accumulation trend is finally at its end. The crypto analyst points to an important indicator, namely the Moving Average, and their positioning being the evidence that this is the case. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: BTC Price Could Crack $50,000 If This Important Level Does Not Hold According to VIAQUANT, the Dogecoin price has defended multiple moving averages on important timeframes. This development shows not only strength, but an end to the accumulation phase. The important moving averages here are the 21 Moving Average, the 100 Moving Average, and the 200-Day Moving Average. The analysis points out that on the 3-day chart, the Dogecoin price has held the 200 Moving Average. Next is the 100 Moving Average on the weekly chart, even after a rapid decline over the last week. Last but not least is the 21 Moving Average, which continues to hold tightly on the monthly chart. Given these developments, the crypto analyst believes that these moving averages being held show that the Dogecoin accumulation phase has ended. Not only that, they posit that this also means that the meme coin could be gearing up for another price recovery from here. What Happens To DOGE Price From Here? Presently, Dogecoin prices are still struggling against the headwinds of the bearish crypto market. But if VIAQUANT’s analysis is correct, then this could only be short-lived from here. Given how much the coin has fallen in the last few months, a bounce from here could be phenomenal. Related Reading: Litecoin Looks Poised To Explode As Grayscale Buys 10,000 LTC The crypto analyst points to a similar accumulation trend that took place at the start of 2024. Following that, the DOGE price had bounced more than 100%. Taking that scenario and using it in the current situation, the analyst pegs the Dogecoin price for another 100% surge. This would mean that the price would cross $0.2. Interestingly, the crypto analyst does not expect this move to take long. The chart shows that the move above $0.2 would be completed sometime in November, meaning a 3-month timeframe for the analysis to play out.

Short-term averages have already flipped bearish.  The nonfarm payrolls report due later Friday is likely to show the U.S. jobless rate ticked lower in August.  The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of bitcoin's {{BTC}} price, a widely tracked barometer of the largest cryptocurrency's long-term trajectory, is about to lose its bullish momentum ahead of key U.S. jobs data that is set to influence the Federal Reserve's interest-rate outlook.  Since late August, the gauge has averaged a daily increase of less than $50, well below the $200-plus moves seen earlier this year, data from charting platform TradingView show. It recently stood at $63,840 with bitcoin's spot price at $55,880.  The slump in variability is a sign the average has hit stall speed for the first time since October, indicating a pause or impending bearish trend change. The latter cannot be ruled out: The short-term moving averages, namely the 50- and 100-day measures, have already peaked and turned lower. The 100-day SMA recently moved below the 200-day SMA, confirming a bearish crossover.  Together, the three signal a weakening in bullish sentiment and growth in caution consistent with increasing macroeconomic uncertainty.  ""Looks pretty ugly out there right now, [with the] market rapidly pricing global recession risks,"" newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said on X Friday. Still, the final flush lower in BTC could set the stage for a bigger rally, it said.  Alex Kuptsikevish, a senior market analyst at The FxPro, said the risk-off mood in the broader financial market is not helping.  ""Despite the dollar's weakness, the financial markets are still in an anxious and expectant mood, which is not helping Bitcoin as much as it is helping gold,"" Kuptsikevish said in an email to CoinDesk. ""A critical technical support level for the BTCUSD remains just above $54,000, but slippage in the event of a volatility spike could see the price briefly drop below $53,000.""  The daily chart also shows major support at around $50,000, characterized by a trendline connecting corrective lows reached in May and July.  Interestingly, several market observers, including Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, say they expect BTC to drop to $50,000.  ""$BTC is heavy, I'm gunning for sub $50k this weekend. I took a cheeky short. Pray for my soul, for I am a degen,"" Hayes posted on X.  Price volatility may pick up the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report (NFP) for August. According to FXStreet, expectations are for a 160,000 rise in jobs following July's 114,000 increase. The jobless rate is forecast to drop to 4.2% from July's near three-year high of 4.2%.  A weak print will likely strengthen recession concerns and boost the probability of a 50 basis point interest-rate cut by the Fed this month, potentially putting a floor under risk assets, including bitcoin.

33251884,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640189,1725618652,"Cardano Bull Sees ADA Jumping 1,000% In An ‘Insane’ Rally","Cardano has been in the limelight lately, not only because it has slightly increased in price but also due to its forecasted surge. According to predictions, ADA may surge up 16% and reach as high as $0.37 by October 2024. But what really drew interest was the bold statement of Cardano analyst Dan Gambardello, that ADA could rally a whopping 1,000% against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Unfazed By Market Jitters, Climbs 13% – Details Gambardello’s forecast is based on a very similar setup to the bullish divergence in 2020 that indeed triggered a strong price ascent. In fact, despite this optimism, overall sentiment in the market for Cardano remains conservative. Although the price gain since then is insufficient to offset the 9% losses investors have suffered this week, it may provide a limited indication of increasing momentum for the coin. ADA has just recorded a modest gain in price of 2.5% to $0.3263. Analyst’s Bullish Case Gambardello is optimistic based on ADA/BTC’s technical chart. He pointed to a bullish divergence where the price of ADA keeps making lower lows, while the RSI and MACD are making higher lows-a sign that the downward momentum could be weakening and a reversal might occur very soon. Anyone who has followed crypto price movements knows this has been the precursor to many major rallies. 🚨 Insane bullish divergence on the ADA/BTC daily chart. Last time this happened 4 years ago, Cardano rallied over 1,000% against Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/cR0uqkIcTe — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) September 5, 2024 And he’s rather outspoken about his bold forecast, too. In a recent X post, Gambardello pinpointed how similar conditions were set back in 2020: ADA was also struggling then, but the bullish divergence set off a major rally against Bitcoin that took ADA to new all-time highs. If history repeats itself, we might well be looking at an “insane” price rally for ADA once again. Market Sentiment: Bearish Or Bullish? It is not all moonbound, though, for Cardano. If Gambardello’s rosy projection were anything to go by, the opposite might be said by the wider market. Market sentiment at the moment is without a doubt bearish. The Fear & Greed Index, one of the major barometers of investor confidence, rests at 22, indicating “Extreme Fear.” This in effect means most investors are still very skeptical about making a big move in ADA and risk appetite remains very low. Over the last 30 days, ADA has experienced some relatively moderate turbulence; only 53% of its days are in the green. The price action hasn’t really been consistent, and this kind of downward volatility could as well scare away many potential investors in search of some more durable pricing momentum. While the forecast for a rise by October 2024 is 16.24%, the current environment doesn’t really stand to inspire much confidence. One would be somewhat reasonable at being hesitant, given the temperamental nature currently governing the markets. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Dips 15% As New Innovations Fail To Spark Momentum ADA Price Forecast That leaves the investors to decide on a difficult matter. On one side, the technicals Gambardello presents show a possible breakout. Conversely, the state of the market is somewhat erratic, and generally the vibe is simply not optimistic. Maybe investors would be better off waiting for more persuasive proof of ADA’s next action and treading gently for now. The next few weeks are going to be crucial for Cardano. And though Gambardello’s prediction did manage to raise hope, the general market still seems to weigh down any immediate bullish momentum. For the time being, caution might be the best approach, but the moment ADA starts breaking out of its range, things can change pretty fast.

33251330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640258,1725617207,Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe: Two Cryptocurrencies To Watch In September,"As the cryptocurrency market navigates through a challenging year, September 2024 has emerged as a crucial month for investors, particularly those with stakes in Solana (SOL) and the rapidly growing meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both cryptocurrencies have captured the attention of the market, albeit for different reasons. Solana (SOL) is under scrutiny following a steep decline, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum as its presale stage 3 nears completion. This article explores why these two cryptocurrencies are worth watching closely this month. Solana (SOL)’s Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword Solana (SOL) has been one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent years, thanks to its high throughput and low transaction fees. However, 2024 has not been kind to SOL, with the token experiencing significant volatility. After reaching a high of $161 in late August, Solana (SOL)’s price took a nosedive, dropping 20% in just one week. By September 2, SOL had stabilized around $129, but the damage was already done. The recent price drop has raised concerns among investors, particularly those who bought in at higher levels. Despite this, some experts believe that Solana (SOL) could see a 40% rally in the near future. This optimism is partly fueled by the upcoming launch of Binance’s Solana (SOL) staking service, which is set to debut in late September. The staking service will allow users to earn rewards on their staked SOL, potentially driving up demand for the token. However, the broader market sentiment remains bearish, and Solana (SOL)’s ability to recover is far from guaranteed. The token is currently facing strong resistance at $160, and a further decline to $110 is not out of the question if market conditions worsen. For investors, the decision to hold onto Solana (SOL) or diversify their portfolios with other assets has become increasingly complex. Mpeppe: The Rising Star of Meme Coins While Solana (SOL) struggles to regain its footing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender in the altcoin market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a meme coin that has quickly gained traction during its presale, with Stage 3 nearing completion and a significant portion of tokens already sold. Unlike Solana (SOL), which has been hampered by market volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been riding a wave of positive sentiment, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins this month. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its combination of humor, community engagement, and the potential for high returns. As Solana (SOL) holders look for alternative investments to hedge their portfolios against further losses, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a promising option. The meme coin’s strong presale performance and growing community support suggest that it could be poised for significant growth once it officially launches. Why Mpeppe is Worth Watching Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid presale progress and the buzz surrounding it make it a cryptocurrency to watch closely in September. The meme coin has already attracted a loyal following, and its potential for high returns has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. As the presale stage 3 nears completion, the anticipation is building for what could be a significant price surge when Mpeppe (MPEPE) hits the open market. In contrast to Solana (SOL), which faces an uphill battle to regain investor confidence, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is benefiting from a strong community-driven narrative. The meme coin’s success story is still in its early stages, but the signs point to a bright future. For those looking to diversify their portfolios or take a chance on a high-potential altcoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an intriguing opportunity. Conclusion: Two Cryptocurrencies, Two Different Paths September 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Solana (SOL) is fighting to recover from a steep decline, with hopes pinned on the upcoming Binance staking service to provide some much-needed support. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum as its presale nears completion, positioning itself as one of the most promising meme coins in the market.

Holders Join Mpeppe Presale After Sliding A Further 12.69%,"In the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency, even giants like Solana (SOL) are not immune to the forces of market volatility. Recently, Solana (SOL) has seen a significant downturn, sliding a further 12.69%, prompting its holders to reevaluate their positions and seek refuge in new and promising opportunities. Among the alternatives capturing attention is the rapidly growing meme coin presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has been drawing in investors at an astonishing rate. Solana’s Decline: A Disappointing Year Solana (SOL), once hailed as the Ethereum killer and a shining beacon of innovation in the blockchain space, has had a challenging year in 2024. Despite a strong start, with the token surging from under $20 to over $200, the reality of market dynamics has hit hard. The current price hovers around $130-$140, a stark contrast to the highs it enjoyed just months ago. The decline in Solana (SOL)’s volume has been particularly concerning. Not only has trading activity decreased, but the ambitious goals of overtaking Ethereum seem more distant than ever. As the enthusiasm wanes, many investors are left wondering if Solana (SOL)’s best days are behind it. While some analysts predict a potential recovery to $250, the more realistic long-term projection suggests Solana (SOL) might stabilize around $150. The Search for Alternatives: Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Solana (SOL) struggles, its holders are looking for new opportunities to recoup their losses and potentially capitalize on the next big thing in the crypto world. One such opportunity is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has been making waves in the presale market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of the fastest-growing meme coins, with its presale stages nearing completion at breakneck speed. The meme coin’s appeal lies not only in its humorous and lighthearted branding but also in its potential for substantial returns. With the presale already 97% complete in Stage 3, the sense of urgency among investors is palpable. Why Mpeppe is Attracting Solana Investors The transition from a well-established token like Solana (SOL) to a new meme coin may seem surprising at first glance. However, there are several factors driving this shift: Market Disappointment: Solana (SOL)’s recent underperformance has left many investors disillusioned. The stark contrast between the high expectations set in early 2024 and the current reality has led some to seek out new, potentially lucrative ventures. Presale Momentum: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has been a massive success, drawing in investors with the promise of high returns. The presale’s rapid progress, with Stage 3 nearly complete, indicates strong investor confidence and a growing community around the coin. High Growth Potential: Meme coins, by their nature, have the potential for explosive growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strong presale performance, is positioned as a serious contender in this space, offering investors a chance to get in early before a possible price surge. The Future for Solana and Mpeppe While Solana (SOL) may recover in the long term, the immediate future remains uncertain. The blockchain’s technical capabilities are still highly regarded, but market sentiment plays a crucial role in the short-term price movements. For now, Solana (SOL) investors are hedging their bets, diversifying into emerging opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is riding the wave of presale success. If the momentum continues, it could very well establish itself as a leading meme coin in the market, providing early investors with substantial returns. Conclusion As Solana (SOL) faces one of its most challenging periods, its investors are not sitting idly by. The shift towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the ever-present search for profit in the cryptocurrency world. While Solana (SOL) may stabilize and recover, the allure of a fresh start with a high-growth potential meme coin is proving irresistible for many. The coming weeks will be crucial for both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), as each navigates the volatile waters of the crypto market.

33251086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640252,1725616690,Can Solana Hit $200 in September 2024? Sharks Join The Fastest Growing Meme Coin Presale,"As September 2024 unfolds, the crypto world watches closely as Solana (SOL) embarks on what could be a defining moment in its journey. The question on everyone’s mind is whether Solana (SOL) can hit the $200 mark this month. With the recent launch and rapid growth of the meme coin presale, particularly Mpeppe (MPEPE), the dynamics of the market are shifting, and investors are making calculated moves to maximize their gains. Solana’s Performance Amid Market Uncertainty Solana (SOL) has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability. However, like many other cryptocurrencies, Solana (SOL) has faced significant challenges in the volatile market environment of 2024. Over the past few weeks, Solana (SOL) saw a dip in its value, with losses reaching double digits at certain points. Despite this, there are glimmers of hope as Solana (SOL)’s recent performance shows signs of recovery. One of the key factors fueling optimism around Solana (SOL) is its growing ecosystem. The Solana (SOL) app, Pump.fun, a launchpad for meme coins, has been making waves in the crypto community. In just seven months, Pump.fun has generated over $100 million in fees, an unprecedented growth rate in the crypto space. This app has not only captured the attention of developers but has also solidified Solana (SOL’s position as a leading blockchain for innovative projects. The Role of Pump.fun in Solana’s Potential Rally Pump.fun has become a beacon of hope for Solana (SOL) enthusiasts. The platform’s ability to launch meme coins with high potential returns has attracted a swarm of investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing. The excitement surrounding Pump.fun reflects the underlying strength of Solana (SOL)’s blockchain, which has proven to be a robust foundation for such high-growth applications. The rapid adoption of Pump.fun has created a ripple effect across the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. Developers and investors alike are increasingly confident in Solana (SOL)’s technological capabilities, which could lead to further appreciation of SOL. As Solana (SOL) stabilizes around the $133 mark, the question remains whether this momentum can propel it to the $200 milestone. Market Influences and Investor Sentiment While the Solana (SOL) ecosystem thrives, external market factors continue to influence its trajectory. The upcoming interest rate decisions in the United States and Europe are expected to play a significant role in shaping the broader crypto market. A rate cut could provide the necessary fuel for a bullish trend, benefiting Solana (SOL) and other top cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the potential approval of a Solana (SOL)-spot ETF by the SEC in the spring of 2024 has added another layer of anticipation. If approved, this ETF could bring in a wave of institutional investments, driving Solana’s price closer to the $200 mark. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Captures Attention Amid Solana’s (SOL) ongoing developments, the emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the attention of the crypto community. As one of the fastest-growing meme coins in the presale phase, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting sharks from across the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is not just a testament to the power of meme coins but also to the opportunities they present for savvy investors. With over 97% of Stage 3 completed, the urgency to get in before the price spikes has led to a flurry of activity. As Solana (SOL) continues to stabilize, many investors are diversifying their portfolios by joining the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale, hoping to ride the wave of potential 100x gains. Conclusion: Will Solana Hit $200? The road to $200 for Solana (SOL) is paved with both opportunities and challenges. The strength of its ecosystem, highlighted by the success of Pump.fun, positions Solana as a strong contender in the crypto space. However, external factors such as market sentiment, regulatory decisions, and the performance of emerging meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) will play a crucial role in determining whether Solana (SOL) can reach this ambitious target.

As the presale of Mpeppe (MPEPE) surges forward, recently completing 97% of Stage 3, the token has demonstrated an incredible rally of 150%. This meteoric rise has prompted a wave of investor activity, with many comparing Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential to that of the Internet Computer (ICP). Mpeppe: A Formidable Player Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly emerged as a formidable player in the meme coin space, challenging even established projects like Internet Computer (ICP). With its innovative approach to combining meme culture with utility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captivated a diverse range of investors. The token’s rally of 150% is a clear indication of the growing confidence in its potential. One of the key factors driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is its community-driven nature, a trait it shares with Internet Computer (ICP). However, unlike Internet Computer (ICP), which has focused on creating a decentralized internet, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out a niche in the meme coin sector, offering investors a unique blend of entertainment and financial opportunity. Internet Computer (ICP) vs. Mpeppe: A Battle of Potential Internet Computer (ICP) has long been touted as a revolutionary platform, aiming to decentralize the internet by allowing developers to create websites, enterprise IT systems, and internet services directly on its blockchain. While Internet Computer (ICP)’s vision is ambitious and its technology groundbreaking, the project’s market performance has been mixed. The complexity of Internet Computer (ICP)’s ecosystem has made it challenging for some investors to fully grasp its potential, leading to slower adoption rates than initially anticipated. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s straightforward approach to meme culture, combined with its potential for significant returns, has resonated more immediately with investors. As Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Stage 3 presale nears completion, sharks and whales alike are moving quickly to secure their positions, hoping to capitalize on the token’s upward momentum. Sharks Move with Haste The recent rally of 150% in Mpeppe (MPEPE) price has not gone unnoticed by larger investors, often referred to as “sharks” in the crypto world. These investors are known for their ability to influence market movements due to the sheer volume of their trades. With Stage 3 of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale now 97% completed, there is a sense of urgency among these sharks to lock in their positions before the token moves into the next stage, where prices are expected to increase further. This flurry of activity around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is reminiscent of the early days of Internet Computer (ICP), when excitement and anticipation drove a wave of investment into the project. However, while Internet Computer (ICP) focused on long-term technological development, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the market’s attention with its immediate potential for high returns. Future looks Bright For MPEPE? As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, many are wondering whether it can sustain its current momentum. The comparisons to Internet Computer (ICP) highlight the different approaches these projects have taken. While Internet Computer (ICP) is built on a foundation of complex, long-term technological goals, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strength lies in its ability to tap into the current trends of the crypto market, particularly the meme coin phenomenon. The next stage of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale is expected to see even more interest, especially as the token prepares for its launch on major exchanges. Investors who have watched the success of Internet Computer (ICP) from the sidelines may see Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a more accessible opportunity, one that offers the potential for rapid gains in a shorter time frame. Conclusion: Mpeppe’s Ascent Continues As Stage 3 of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale draws to a close, with 97% already completed, the influx of sharks and large investors is likely to push the token even higher. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can truly challenge the likes of Internet Computer (ICP) remains to be seen, but for now, it is clear that this meme coin is one to watch closely in the coming weeks and months.

33250890,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640245,1725616175,Could Mpeppe Challenge Pepecoin Market Cap at Launch? Analyst Data Predicts 100x,"In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, the meme coin sector continues to be a hotbed of innovation and competition. Pepecoin (PEPE), once a dominant force in this space, has recently faced challenges that have opened the door for new contenders. Among these, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting it could rival or even surpass Pepecoin (PEPE)’s market cap at launch, with the potential for a 100x surge in value. Pepecoin’s Current Struggles Pepecoin (PEPE) has long been a staple in the meme coin community, celebrated for its strong community support and the potential for high returns. However, recent market activity has shown signs of weakness. Over the past week, Pepecoin (PEPE) has experienced a nearly 6% decline, sparking concerns among investors about the coin’s long-term viability. Despite these setbacks, a significant transaction by a Pepecoin (PEPE) whale—who moved nearly 293 billion PEPE tokens from Binance to a new wallet—has generated renewed interest in the coin. Such moves often indicate that major holders still have confidence in Pepecoin (PEPE)’s future, but whether this will be enough to reverse its recent fortunes remains to be seen. Mpeppe’s Strong Community As Pepecoin (PEPE) grapples with these challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a formidable rival. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the attention of the crypto community with its rapid presale success, raising nearly $2 million and selling over 90% of its stage 3 tokens. Priced at $0.0021 during the presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for a 100x increase in value is drawing significant interest from both retail investors and crypto whales. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is not just a flash in the pan. The project has built a strong community and employed strategic marketing to position itself as a serious competitor in the meme coin space. With its eyes set on challenging Pepecoin (PEPE)’s market cap, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to make a significant impact upon its official launch. Can Mpeppe Surpass Pepecoin? The big question on everyone’s mind is whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can surpass Pepecoin (PEPE) in market cap. While Pepecoin (PEPE) has a well-established presence, its recent struggles have created an opening for new entrants like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Analysts are bullish on Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s prospects, with many predicting that it could not only match but exceed Pepecoin (PEPE)’s market cap, especially if it continues to attract substantial investment and community support. The Future of Meme Coins As the meme coin market matures, competition is intensifying. Pepecoin (PEPE), once a dominant player, is now facing serious competition from rising stars like Mpeppe (MPEPE). The success of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale and the anticipation surrounding its launch suggest that it could become a major force in the meme coin sector, potentially challenging Pepecoin (PEPE) for market dominance. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is always in flux, and the meme coin sector is no exception. Pepecoin (PEPE) has enjoyed a long reign, but the rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) signals a shift in the landscape. With its impressive presale performance and strong community backing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to challenge—and possibly surpass—Pepecoin (PEPE)’s market cap at launch. Investors and analysts alike will be watching closely to see if Mpeppe (MPEPE) can live up to its potential and become the next big thing in the meme coin world.

33249621,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640087,1725613232,Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Are All Showing Death Cross: Say Hello To Bear Market?,"Data shows three popular Bitcoin momentum indicators recently formed a death cross pattern. Here’s what usually follows this formation. Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Have Seen Bearish Crossovers Recently In a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has discussed the latest trend in three momentum indicators related to Bitcoin. The momentum indicators here refer to combinations of some important moving averages (MAs) related to the cryptocurrency. The first is the “Active Address Momentum,” which involves the 30-day and 365-day MAs of the daily unique number of BTC Active Addresses. An address is said to be “active” when it makes some transaction on the network, whether as a receiver or sender. Related Reading: $170 Million In Crypto Longs Bite The Dust As Bitcoin Plunges Under $57,000 The number of Active Addresses may be the same as the number of users visiting the network, so this metric tells us how the blockchain activity is looking right now. Here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day MAs of the Active Addresses over the last few years. As displayed in the above graph, the monthly average of the Active Addresses saw a cross under the yearly average shortly after the asset’s rally to the new all-time high (ATH) and has since remained under it. This crossover implies activity on the BTC blockchain has been on the decline. Generally, user interest keeps rallies fueled, so an increase in Active Addresses is needed to keep any more sustainable. As investors are starting to pay less attention to the cryptocurrency, conditions may not be right for a bull run anymore. The chart shows that this kind of crossover also occurred at the end of the bull run in the first half of 2021, although the second-half rally did occur regardless. The second momentum indicator is the famous Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, which tells us whether the investors are in profit or loss. As the chart shows, the MVRV Ratio has also seen its monthly cross below its yearly, suggesting investor profits have been shrinking. This pattern has historically served as a death cross, with BTC shifting towards a bearish phase following it. The same cross also appeared just before the 2022 bear market kicked off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Drop To $40,600 If This Happens, Crypto Analyst Says Finally, there is also the bearish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day MAs of the Bitcoin price itself. Given all these negative patterns across the different Bitcoin indicators, the cryptocurrency may be heading towards at least a short-term bearish period. BTC Price Bitcoin has struggled recently as its price has dipped towards the $56,500 level.

42390425,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1iPP,1725608063,"Weeks After Ether ETF Debut, ETH Market Liquidity Has Dropped by 20%","Ether's 5% market depth on U.S. exchanges has dropped by 20% since the introduction of spot ether ETFs in the U.S.  Poor market conditions and seasonality effects are to be blamed, according to CCData.  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be net positive for market liquidity, making it easier to execute large buy and sell orders at stable prices. That's what CoinDesk reported in December 2023, before the ETFs were approved in the U.S.  The liquidity boost materialized well enough in the bitcoin {{BTC}} market following the debut of spot ETFs on Jan. 11. With ether {{ETH}}, however, the story played out differently. Ether's order book liquidity has declined since the July 23 debut of nine ETFs, according to data tracked by London-based CCData.  Since the ETFs' introduction, the average 5% market depth for ETH pairs on U.S.-based centralized exchanges has declined by 20% to roughly $14 million. On offshore centralized venues, it's dropped by 19% to around $10 million. In other words, it's actually now easier to move the spot price by 5% in either direction, a sign of reduced liquidity and increased sensitivity to large orders.  ""Although the market liquidity for ETH pairs on centralized exchanges remains greater than what was at the beginning of the year, the liquidity has dropped by nearly 45% since its peak in June,"" Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""This is likely due to the poor market conditions and the seasonality effects in the summer, often accompanied by lower trading activity.""  The measure refers to the amount of buy and sell orders within 5% of the mid-market price for an asset. Greater depth indicates strong liquidity and lower slippage costs. CCData considered the 5% market depth for all ETH pairs on 30 centralized exchanges.  Ether ETFs have witnessed a cumulative outflow of over $500 million since July 23, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.

Recently, renowned analyst Javon Marks shared an optimistic outlook for the meme-based cryptocurrency. This outlook shared by Marks comes at a time when SHIB is currently going through a bearish phase, although SHIB is not alone in this bearishness as several other notable meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), PEPE and dogwifhat (WIF) has also seen major plunge in value. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Above Trendline: Can The Bulls Drive SHIB To $0.00002045? Why Is A 480% Rise Ahead For SHIB? According to Marks, SHIB has confirmed several bullish patterns in its recent price action, particularly through the Relative Strength Index (RSI). These bullish patterns in its RSI, as highlighted by the analyst suggest a strong potential for a significant recovery, with Marks projecting that SHIB could witness a 231% rally to reclaim its 2024 highs. Moreover, the forecast doesn’t stop there—Marks believes that if SHIB continues on this trajectory, the cryptocurrency could surge by over 480% to hit a price target of $0.000081. Marks’ analysis particularly highlights the presence of a hidden bull divergence pattern, which is a bullish signal in technical analysis. This pattern occurs when a cryptocurrency’s price is making lower lows, while its momentum indicator, such as the RSI, shows higher lows. Essentially, this divergence indicates that the selling pressure is weakening, and a potential reversal in price is on the horizon. For SHIB, this could mean a significant upward movement in the near future. Shiba Inu’s Bearish Performance and Ecosystem Developments Despite this optimistic forecast, Shiba Inu has continue to experience a bearish trend in its market performance. Over the past week, SHIB has seen a decline of 7.4%, and the downtrend has continued, with the meme coin dropping by an additional 0.6% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001326. Notably, while SHIB’s price has been on the decline, the development team behind the cryptocurrency continues to push forward with ecosystem improvements. Recently, the Shiba Inu team announced the launch of the ShibDev Portal, aimed at “enhancing” the capabilities of developers building on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain. LucieSHIB, the project’s lead marketer, highlighted that the portal provides essential tools for developers, including API Management and Node Access, which are crucial for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Shibarium. https://t.co/zoPuR997MF — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) September 5, 2024 This latest update is seen as a positive step towards strengthening Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, with the potential to attract more developers and projects to the platform. By expanding its utility and attracting a broader range of dApps, SHIB could see renewed interest and demand, potentially driving its price upward. The long-term success of SHIB could be tied to these ecosystem advancements, as they aim to differentiate the token from other meme coins by providing tangible use cases and utility through Shibarium’s growth.

Short-term Bitcoin holders are feeling the pain, while long-term investors remain profitable. A deeper pullback is possible, with Bitcoin currently 22% below its all-time high. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices have struggled to gain momentum of late, with the fear and greed index remaining in fear territory. Global markets fear around a potential recession are weighing on the crypto market. Source: FinancialJuice Bitcoin bulls have failed to make a move above the $65k handle, and that has resulted in consistent selling pressure on the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Despite this, the average bitcoin investor remains profitable; it is the short-term holders who are facing challenges at present. According to Glassnode research, the last 3 months or so has seen a notable shift as downward price pressure has increased. Thus, it is important to pay attention and assess the unrealized loss held by investors to evaluate the financial stress they are experiencing. From the perspective of the broader market, unrealized losses remain historically low. Total unrealized losses amount to just 2.9% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is historically low. This suggests that the aggregate investor remains relatively profitable, even in the face of continued price declines Source: Glassnode There is also further room for downside if one considers that bitcoin is currently trading around 22% down from its all-time high. In terms of historical bitcoin bull markets, this is a relatively shallow drawdown, hinting at the potential for a deeper pullback. Bitcoin’s struggles this week is somewhat of a surprise, given that markets have gotten even more aggressive on the rate cut front. US data this week has seen the probability of a 50 bps rate cut increase. This would in theory lead to more disposable income for consumers and thus should lead to optimism around the price of bitcoin, but this has failed to materialize when looking at the bitcoin price. ETF Flows Also raising a red flag of late has been an increase in ETF outflows. According to Arkham Intelligence data released yesterday, 8 bitcoin ETF recorded outflows around $287 million dollars in the span of 24 hours. The only exception being BlackRock. This was the fifth consecutive day of outflows for bitcoin ETFs and market participants may be starting to ask… Is this a sign that investor confidence may be waning? Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $47.4 million. Grayscale’s ETF ( ETHE ) had a $52.3 million outflow, but this was partly balanced by Fidelity’s ETF (FETH), which had a $4.9 million inflow. The overall value of Ethereum spot ETFs is now $6.758 billion, according to the data. Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin is currently down about 3% today and might close below the important support level of 56,561. If it does, there’s a chance it could drop towards the 50,000 mark, which is a significant psychological level. What’s interesting is that this support level at 56,561 has been strong since early August, even after a market selloff. To reach 50,000, Bitcoin needs to get past the support levels at 55,000 and 53,965. On the other hand, if Bitcoin tries to climb higher, it must first break through 58,500 before aiming for 60,000.

Dogecoin MVRV Suggests DOGE May Be Offering A Buy Window In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how assets like Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) have been looking like regarding trader returns on various timeframes. The indicator of relevance here is the popular “Market Value to Realized Value” (MVRV), which keeps track of the ratio between the value that the investors of an asset as a whole are holding (that is, the market cap) and the value that they put into the asset (the realized cap). Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Drop To $40,600 If This Happens, Crypto Analyst Says When the metric has a value greater than 1, the investors are currently in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the cutoff implies the dominance of loss in the market. Historically, whenever the investors of a cryptocurrency have been in a state of high profits, tops have become more probable to occur for its price, as the likelihood of a mass selloff with the motive of profit-taking becomes significant in such conditions. Similarly, bottoms in the asset’s price have tended to take place when most of the investors have been in losses and sellers have reached a state of exhaustion. Based on these facts, Santiment has developed an “Opportunity & Danger Zone Model,” which finds out how the mid-term versions of the MVRV have diverged from the norm for the different coins in the sector. Below is the chart for the model shared by the analytics firm. The “mid-term” versions of the MVRV specifically target the investors who bought inside 30-day, 90-day, and 6-month timeframes. When the divergences of these metrics are positive for an asset, it means said coin may be undervalued right now. Similarly, a negative divergence suggests potential overvalued status. From the graph, it’s visible that most of the altcoins are currently in the bullish region, with some of them even seeing their divergence surpassing the 1 level, corresponding to a region that Santiment classifies as the “Opportunity Zone.” According to the analytics firm, Dogecoin, Toncoin (TON), and Ethereum (ETH) have seen the lowest 6-month MVRV values recently, with traders who bought them in the last six months sitting at 32%, 23%, and 22% losses, respectively. Interestingly, unlike these assets, XRP’s 6-month traders are in profits instead. Related Reading: $170 Million In Crypto Longs Bite The Dust As Bitcoin Plunges Under $57,000 “As a trader, if you enjoy making profits, you WANT to be in assets where other traders are in pain and seeing losses,” notes Santiment. Based on this, Dogecoin may offer the best window among the top coins, while XRP may be the worst option. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.0975, down more than 3% over the past week.

America As The Bitcoin Capital During a recent address at the Economic Club of New York, Trump articulated his vision for embracing industries of the future, notably positioning the United States as the global hub for crypto and Bitcoin. “Instead of attacking industries of the future, we will embrace them, including making America the world capital for crypto and Bitcoin,” Trump declared, showcasing his commitment to fostering innovation and growth in the digital asset sphere. Related Reading: DOJ Penalizes Robinhood $3.9 Million For Past Crypto Withdrawal Restrictions Addressing concerns around regulation, an area of contention within the industry, Trump pledged to spearhead a campaign aimed at liberating the economy from burdensome regulatory constraints. He emphasized a bold agenda to eliminate outdated regulations, promising a tenfold reduction for every new regulation introduced under his administration. Trump’s remarks come alongside hints at his upcoming project, “World Liberty Financial,” aimed at positioning the US as the leading player in the global crypto arena. In his latest comments, the former president expressed commitment to combat what he perceives as efforts to stifle the industry, asserting, “They want to choke you, and we are not going to let that happen.” While Trump did not specify who he believes is trying to “strangle” the crypto sector, his promises resonate with many in the industry who are frustrated with the SEC’s current enforcement strategy under Chairman Gary Gensler. Trump has previously indicated that he would seek to replace crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler upon his return to office, a move that many in the crypto community view as crucial for fostering a more supportive regulatory environment. Trump Positions Himself As ‘Crypto President’ With the election just 2 months away, Trump’s advocacy for cryptocurrencies and the broader industry could lead to significant shifts in US policy. He has also branded himself as the first “crypto president,” vowing to create a BTC reserve to offset the national debt, currently estimated at $35 trillion. Analysts believe that such commitments could enhance market confidence and potentially lead to price appreciation not only for Bitcoin, but for the entire digital asset ecosystem during the last part of the year. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Dips 15% As New Innovations Fail To Spark Momentum As NewsBTC reported, market experts predict that Trump’s unwavering support for digital assets and his proposed policy reforms could instill confidence in the market, potentially leading to further price appreciation and a more favorable regulatory landscape for the burgeoning crypto industry. As the countdown to the election narrows, all eyes remain fixed on the narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies and the transformative impact a Trump presidency could bring to the sector. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was down 3% from Wednesday’s price, resulting in a trading value of $56,000 per coin.

33242676,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640093,1725597000,THORChain Hard Forks: Why Is RUNE Down 70% And Still Dumping?,"THORChain, a cross-chain decentralized exchange using Cosmos technology, successfully conducted a hard fork yesterday, September 4. However, while the update was highly anticipated, sellers still needed to press on, looking at the formation in the daily chart. RUNE Slumps, Drops 70% In 6 Months According to CoinMarketCap data, RUNE, the native currency of the THORChain ecosystem, remains under pressure, losing 12% at press time. The drop over the last 24 hours means the token is down nearly 70% from March highs and continues to trend lower. Related Reading: XRP Rides High As Major Japanese Exchange Adds Support—Details At press time, the path of least resistance remains southwards. The immediate support lies at August lows at around $3. Conversely, buyers have resistance at approximately the $5 mark. RUNE traders can closely monitor how prices react at these levels as the coin moves sideways in a possible distribution. If buyers take over, RUNE may peel back losses, possibly doubling in the coming months. The pace at which the token will expand largely depends on market-related factors and how the broader crypto market performs. If Ethereum prices, for example, recover, breaking $3,500 in a buy trend continuation formation, it could rejuvenate the slump in DeFi. This would positively spark activity on the THORChain ecosystem, lifting sentiment and possibly RUNE prices. DeFi Slumps, THORChain Hard Fork For System Efficiency Overall, DeFi is flat, slumping after the expansion of early Q1 2024. According to DeFiLlama data, the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi protocols is over $80 billion. Ethereum remains the choice network for DeFi developers. Meanwhile, THORChain has a TVL of over $266 million, down from $396 million registered in late May. Despite the general contraction, THORChain is actively building. The recent hard fork sought to improve user experience and make the DEX more robust. Changes made in this upgrade include the improvement of the Cosmos SDK from version 45.1 to 45.16. Related Reading: Analysts Predict The Start Of Crypto’s First Ever Secular Bear Market Developers also remove unnecessary Cosmos modules to improve efficiency. At the same time, there were changes to the node state, increasing synchronization time. THORChain also introduced support for Bitcoin Taproot addresses, enhancing their interoperability with the Bitcoin mainnet. Amid this, the THORChain ecosystem remains robust and active even as crypto prices fall. Analysts note that on Sunday, September 1, THORChain enabled the swapping of the largest-ever transaction size on the platform. On this day, the DEX helped swap $8 million worth of BTC for USDC, netting $26,000 in fees.

Synthetix SNAXChain To Launch On Optimism’s Superchain Infrastructure Ethereum-based derivatives liquidity protocol Synthetix is set to unveil SNAXChain, an application blockchain built on Optimism’s Superchain infrastructure. For the uninitiated, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling network Optimism’s Superchain is essentially a network of L2 chains, known as OP chains. These chains share security features a communication layer, and are powered by an open-source technology stack. The Superchain ecosystem is governed by the Optimism Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Examples of existing OP chains include Base, Lyra, Mode, and Zora, with SNAXChain poised to join the list. Related Reading: What Is Defi? An Explainer And Guide The launch of SNAXChain aims to improve the protocol’s efficiency and scalability to offer a more seamless and cost-effective experience to DeFi enthusiasts interested in issuing and trading synthetic assets. SNAXChain will also boost Synthetix’s liquidity to keep up with the growing demand for synthetic assets. The Synthetix team notes that SNAXChain will be a neutral hub for on-chain governance and protocol decisions. At the same time, the protocol will continue to expand to additional blockchain networks and L2 solutions. Notably, Synthetix has partnered with Conduit to manage chain infrastructure. It partnered with Wormhole to provide cross-chain messaging between SNAXChain, Optimism, and Ethereum mainnet. Synthetix will kickstart a new governance epoch alongside the launch of the new application blockchain. According to the official post, interested individuals or groups can nominate themselves for various governance councils on SNAXChain. A small amount of Ethereum (ETH) must be bridged to the chain for gas. After bridging the ETH, interested nominees may connect their wallets to the Synthetix governance app and nominate themselves for the appropriate council. Voting for the Synthetix governance council is slated to begin on September 6, 2024. Can DeFi Make A Comeback? Despite the rapid pace of development and innovation in the Ethereum DeFi space with the launch of layer-2 scaling solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum, DeFi has not quite managed to take hold of the industry like it did during the ‘DeFi summer’ of 2020. However, recent on-chain trends and patterns could indicate a potential DeFi comeback later this year.

A crypto analyst has predicted that Bitcoin could witness an even steeper drop to $50,000 if its price does not hold this key support level. Bitcoin Risks $50,000 Drop If Support Fails Elja Boom, a crypto analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) on September 5 to discuss the current price trends and market movements of Bitcoin. Boom shared a price chart offering key insights into Bitcoin’s future outlook, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s short term uptrend has likely ended. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says The Bitcoin ‘Summer Chop’ Is Nearing Its End, Here’s Why The analyst expects Bitcoin’s price to stay within the range of $54,000 and $54,500. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to hold this crucial support level, its price could witness a significant correction, potentially pushing it down to new lows around $50,000. Interestingly, the analyst observed a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s price action in the last few months. He noticed that Bitcoin has declined significantly during the first five days of each month. The cryptocurrency dropped in the first week of July and August and is witnessing the same bearish performance in September. Earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price fell below $60,000, after witnessing strong price declines that dropped its value by over 4%. CoinMarketCap reveals that Bitcoin has increased slightly by 1.2% in the last 24 hours, however bearish sentiment still persists among various market analysts. Crypto expert, Ali Martinez disclosed recently that Bitcoin could drop as low as $40,600 if it fails to maintain a price above the $51,000 support level. Martinez emphasized that Bitcoin’s 2-month chart is showing a TD Sequential indicator that is presenting a sell signal. This suggests that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a major price correction. Additionally, the analyst has urged traders to keep an eye on a potential price breakout around $68,000. He revealed that until Bitcoin surpassed this key level, its price may continue dipping. Could A Bull Run Follow BTC’s Descent Towards $50,000? Due to Bitcoin’s persistent price corrections, many analysts believe that the cryptocurrency may decline even further before witnessing a price rebound. Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto analyst, has shared his price forecast for Bitcoin this September. Related Reading: XRP Price To $8: Analyst Says Repeat Of 2017 Could Drive Rally Poppe revealed that the Bitcoin market is currently in a steep correction phase, characterized by widespread liquidations that have failed to trigger a bounce upwards. In light of this, the analyst believes that a drop to $53,000 or even as low as $49,000 could occur for Bitcoin. After this downtrend, Poppe believes that a price reversal may be imminent. This bullish sentiment is shared by a crypto analyst, identified as ‘Titan of Crypto,’ who predicts that October may be the month that Bitcoin finally breaks out of its bearish cycle. Sharing a price chart tracking Bitcoin’s previous bear cycles and bull runs, the analyst predicts that the cryptocurrency could breakout to $100,000 soon, marking the possible start of a bull run.

33235861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640101,1725580830,Analysts Predict Solana’s Surge: $233 Target In Sight As Breakpoint Approaches,"Solana (SOL), one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap, has recently shown signs of a potential price recovery after a bearish performance in August. The asset, which experienced nearly a 10% decline in the past week, has started to regain momentum as it entered September. Solana has risen from a recent low of $124 to above $134 in early trading hours today, showing a 2.7% increase in the last 24 hours, now trading at $132. Amid this recovery, renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks has recently maintained a bullish outlook on Solana, with a long-standing target of $233.8 for the asset. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Is ‘Truly In Limbo’ If This Happens, Warns Crypto Analyst Why Is A $233 Target in Sight For Solana? According to Marks, Solana has shown signs of a continued upward trend, with its price potentially rising to $233.8 and even higher if momentum continues. The analyst’s projection for SOL reaching this mark and beyond is based on a hidden bullish divergence pattern, which SOL has been trading within for quite a while now. Marks particularly noted in the prediction post on X: Our $233.8 Target for SOL (Solana) has been maintained since mid 2023 at $16.12, with prices seeing an approximately 1,203% climb afterwards towards the meeting of it. Now, with the pullback just under, this target goes unchanged as the breakout bringing it in play, continues to hold, and with bullish signals coming in, a nearly +72% climb to finish that process of meeting it could be in development. The analyst further suggested that if Solana breaks past this $233.8 price level, it could see a further rise towards $457, representing an additional 93% increase. SOL Breakpoint Approaches In addition to the price outlook from Javon Marks, other analysts have weighed in on Solana’s potential price movements, particularly around the upcoming SOL Breakpoint event. Crypto analyst Marty Party, responding to a post by another analyst named Sai on X, pointed out that historically, Solana’s price has seen significant gains leading up to this event. Marty Party noted: “Solana Breakpoint pump average is 62%. With SOL currently trading at $133, a 62% increase could push it to $215.46.” Sai’s post highlighted Solana’s price behavior before previous Breakpoint events. In 2021, Solana saw a 68% price surge leading up to the conference, followed by a 42% rise in 2022 and a 58% increase in 2023. The Breakpoint event, which showcases the Solana ecosystem’s innovation and development, has historically attracted attention from investors, contributing to the pre-event price rallies. #Solana Breakpoint in 16 days. Do you know how the Solana price behaves before the breakpoint? 68% price surge in 2021 before Breakpoint 42% price surge in 2022 before Breakpoint 58% Price surge in 2023 before Breakpoint Follow the 🧵Thread 🧵 to make sure you don’t miss 2024… — Sai (@SaiPrathap846) September 4, 2024 This year, the Breakpoint event will take place on September 20th in Singapore, and excitement is already building in the Solana community.
