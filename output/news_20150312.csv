42378093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2JB,1426191626,Bitcoin Boosts Business at Las Vegas Casinos,"A Las Vegas casino owner's decision to start accepting payment in bitcoin has paid off, with business at his venues improving following the move.  Derek Stevens, CEO of the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino started accepting bitcoin at the sites in January 2014. Of the two casinos, the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel, is processing the highest number of bitcoin transactions, Stevens revealed, though he declined to disclose exact figures.  Bitcoin is now accepted at the front desks of the Golden Gate and the D and as well as the gift shop and three restaurants at the D, giving the latter destination the edge in terms of the number of bitcoin-accepting locations.  Recalling the past year, Stevens told CoinDesk:  ""We’re located in the growing tech sector of downtown Las Vegas, so it seemed like the right fit and we’ve definitely seen more business as a result.""  The D also recently replaced its Robocoin bitcoin ATM with a Genmega G6000 bitcoin ATM, though Stevens declined to provide a reason for the decision.  Low-cost items see boost  While tight-lipped about the finer details, Stevens did reveal the casinos currently see the highest number of bitcoin purchases at American Coney Island, an on-site eatery that specializes in classic American fare.  Bitcoin is also accepted at the higher-cost dining options Joe Vicari’s Andiamo Italian Steakhouse and the D Grill.  Stevens believes it is American Coney Island's relatively low pricing that is making bitcoin purchases more common there than at the other restaurants.  Community-driven business  Another factor in the performance of the program has been the local bitcoin community, which Stevens said frequents the properties to support the payment method.  Other factors influencing the performance include the price of bitcoin, and whether any tech events are being held locally.

42378088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2Ct,1426186472,Bitcoin Mining Pools Targeted in Wave of DDOS Attacks,"AntPool, BW.com, NiceHash, CKPool and GHash.io are among a number of bitcoin mining pools and operations that have been hit by distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks in recent days.  The incidents appear to have begun in the first week of March. For example, on 11th March, AntPool owner Bitmain sent an email to customers disclosing the DDOS attacks and advising external pool users to set up failsafe pools in the event of an outage.  According to many of the companies affected by the incidents, those behind the attacks demanded payment in bitcoin in return for stopping the attacks.  BW.com  alerted customers via its official blog to possible service disruptions owing to DDOS attacks, but did not say whether or not a ransom notice had been sent. Other pools took to Bitcoin Talk to warn users about the DDOS attacks.  GHash.io  operator CEX.io suggested that affected pools are seeing escalating DDOS threats, and said that the source of recent attacks on its pool came with increasing ransom demands.  A spokesperson for CEX.io told CoinDesk:  “The attack has been conducted by a hacker who has already DDOSed CEX.IO in October, 2014. Previously, he demanded 2 BTC for stopping the attack. This time, the payment has been raised to 5 to 10 BTC.”  At least one other mining pool, NiceHash, also reported sustained DDOS attacks last fall.  The alleged source of the DDOS attacks, operating under the name DD4BC, is believed to be behind a number of attacks on digital currency websites and services in the past year.  Incidents tied to DD4BC include an attack last year on the digital currency exchange Bitalo that resulted in the posting of a 100 BTC bounty. Following the recent DDOS threats, Bitmain contributed an additional 10 BTC to the bounty.  Disruptions likely to continue  Affected pools say they have moved to boost in-house defense mechanisms in light of the attacks, but some have warned that future outages may likely occur. Bitmain said that its other services, including the cloud mining platform HashNest, may also be affected in the coming days.  Operators that responded to press queries say they have refused to pay the ransoms and will continue keeping their pools open despite the risk of future DDOS attacks.  Some of the pools have conceded that resolving the situation will be difficult owing to the capabilities believed to be possessed by the source of the attacks.  Bitmain’s Yoshi Goto noted that the attacks appear to be systematic and acknowledged that it remains unclear when the situation will be completely resolved.  “It is a cat and mouse game now but we will do our best,” he said.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring the developments and post updates as they become available.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/12/bitcoin-mining-pools-targeted-in-wave-of-ddos-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f000b147a92328dafc7f97fbe188479e95c60c2c-2560x1790.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM6Bh,1426185016,Secretive Mining Firm Revealed as Possible US Marshals Auction Winner,"Last week's US government auction of confiscated Silk Road bitcoins has left a lingering mystery: who won the two biggest blocks of 27,000 and 20,000 coins?  The winners of the two previous US Marshals Service (USMS) bitcoin auctions always wound up announcing themselves within days of their successful bids.  The first auction winner was, famously, venture capitalist Tim Draper, who claimed all the 30,000 bitcoins for sale. The second auction saw the lion's share go to a syndicate organised by Bitcoin Investment Trust, although Draper again picked up some coins.  The third and most recent USMS auction had three winners, but only one of them has come forward so far. That's New York exchange itBit, which claimed 3,000 coins, the smallest tranche on the auction block.  Now blockchain-watchers believe they may have identified a second winner, who claimed the largest amount of coins – 27,000 BTC – on sale.  A Cumberland Mining mystery  In following the trail of the mystery winner, members of r/bitcoin unearthed a two month-old tweet from an account bearing the name 'Cumberland Mining' that simply listed a bitcoin address. That address later received 27,000 coins from the stockpile known to be controlled by the USMS.  The Cumberland Mining Twitter account contains just one tweet, but follows five accounts, including Israeli exchange Bits of Gold, the London-based exchange Coinfloor and credit-card payments enabler Simplex. Its avatar is a picture of the character Steve Youngblood of the comedy troupe the Upright Citizen's Brigade.  At least two bitcoin notables among those following the Cumberland Mining account are Fred Ehrsam, the Coinbase co-founder, and Phil G Potter, a manager of the Bitfinex exchange.  The mystery deepens. A website that appears to belong to Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC reveals little information. The single-page site contains a large stock image of a mine trolley, and the only description of the company's activities is that it provides ""solutions for bitcoiners"". A contact email is listed.  A check with Delaware's Department of Corporations shows that Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC was incorporated there just over a year ago, on 25th February 2014. It is listed as being resident in the United States and it is in 'good standing', according to the state business registrar.  Cumberland Mining has filed no annual reports and it has paid $300 for its annual tax assessment, the standard rate the state requires from limited liability companies. The state does not require LLCs to file an annual report.  Marshals transfer system  Independent analyst Danno Ferrin, who built a tool to track the movement of funds on the blockchain, has found that the Marshals Service used the same method for transferring coins to all three auction winners.  The USMS stated in auction instructions that coins would be transferred to winners in the sequence that their winning bids were received – first come, first served, in other words.  In the third auction, the first winner was itBit, the second winner won 20,000 BTC and the third winner – linked to Cumberland Mining – snagged 27,000 coins.  That method, detailed on Ferrin's Crypto Crumbs bloghttp://blog.cryptocrumb.com/2015/03/fbi-silk-road-auction-of-march-2015.html, shows the Marshals first sending a ""test"" transaction of 0.05 BTC to an address controlled by a winner.  A short time later – 30 minutes in the case of the first winner and two hours for the second winner – the full amount of coins won is transferred to the winner's specified address.  But when it came to the third winner, believed to be Cumberland Mining, the test transaction was sent near the end of the workday, at 4:30pm on 9th March. The Marshals then apparently left for the day, only transferring the full amount of 27,000 coins the following day at 7:45am Eastern Daylight Time.  'Cumberland' coins on the move  According to Ferrin's blockchain analysis, the Cumberland Mining address began to ""peel"" coins off to be sent to other addresses.  The winnings were divided into three chunks of 2,000 BTC, 5,000 BTC and 14,000 BTC. They were broken up within hours of receiving the auction winnings from the US Marshals.  The 2,000 BTC chunk has gone to an address known to be controlled by Bitfinex for customer deposits, Ferrin told CoinDesk in an interview.  The analysis notes that 6,000 BTC was what remained after the three chunks were transferred out. This sum appeared to have the test transaction amount and other transaction fees deducted from it.  Ferrin believes that the Cumberland Mining address was acting on behalf of a syndicate of three winners, hence the coins being peeled off. The remainder of 6,000 BTC with the fees deducted were held by the syndicate organiser, possibly Cumberland itself.  He wrote:  ""Within three blocks transactions for 2,000 BTC, 14,000 BTC, and 5,000 BTC were peeled off of the awarded amount. The remaining sum of nearly 6,000 BTC was short the test transaction amount and the fees paid to receive the initial sum. Because of this I feel the 6,000 distribution remained with the administrator of the syndicate.""  Ferrin also noted that the transactions occurred in quick succession, taking place in three consecutive blocks.  ""It's like he had a lineup of payments to make, or a plan of where to put the bitcoin,"" Ferrin said.  Ferrin cautions that while he stands by his theory that the big winner in the third auction was a syndicate with up to four members, including the organiser, the transactions could also show a single winner sweeping coins to cold storage and depositing a small amount to Bitfinex.  ""There is a chance that this is just one winner instead of a syndicate, but the speed with which the three transactions were peeled off and the nice round numbers make it feel like they are [transactions] to specific entities that were known prior to Tuesday,"" he said.  Cumberland's professional trading links  While little is known about Cumberland Mining's activities, it appears to have links with several companies in the bitcoin space. Ferrin discovered the public PGP keys of individuals with Cumberland Mining email addresses while searching for information on the company.  The keys are listed on public PGP keyservers, where individuals using the PGP email encryption system list and verify their addresses.  These records also show that the keys have been 'signed', or had their identities verified, by executives in the bitcoin space. The public key for W. Eric Saraniecki, which has a cumberlandmining.com domain-name, and which is listed as a Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC user, has been signed by Mark Lamb, the chief executive of London-based exchange Coinfloor. It has also been signed by Shaul Kfir, the chief technology officer at Digital Asset Holdings and a former director of technology at Bits of Golds, according to Kfir's LinkedIn profile. Mike Paleokrassas, a senior trader at SecondMarket, is also listed among the signatories.  Other individuals with Cumberland Mining email addresses appear to have histories as professional traders. A Cumberland address belongs to an individual named Chadwick Miller, for example. On Twitter, Chadwick Miller lists himself as a bitcoin enthusiast, with a link to bitcoinbank.com in his profile.  In a 2012 interview with a website called Poker Tips, Miller says he worked for a ""Chicago-based trading firm"" after graduating from Indiana University. An individual named Chadwick Miller from Indiana is listed as a political donor by the Center for Responsive Politics, which maintains an open database of donations. Miller lists DRW Trading Group as his employer.  Why 'privacy hygiene' matters  DRW Trading is the giant proprietary trading fund headquartered in Chicago. Its chief executive Don Wilson co-founded the bitcoin firm Digital Assets Holdings last year, which announced Wall Street star Blythe Masters as its chief executive yesterday.  Another signatory of Saraniecki's public key, Joshua Charnin-Aker, has a name that corresponds to a 'weather trader' employed at DRW Commodities. Saraniecki himself has a name that matches a New York-based ""commodities trader"" quoted in a New York Times article about buying property in the city.  CoinDesk has contacted the email listed on Cumberland Mining's website and the individuals listed on the keyserver for comment, but has received no response. The exception was SecondMarket, where Brendan O' Connor, a managing director who supervises Paleokrassas, requested a phone call to state that the firm doesn't comment on companies it may or may not be doing business with.  If the coins were won by itBit and the mysterious Cumberland Mining, what of the 20,000 BTC that has gone to an as yet unnamed winner? Ferrin has no guesses, although he stressed the importance of not re-using bitcoin addresses to maintain transaction anonymity.  ""This winner had excellent 'privacy hygiene',"" he said.

42426298,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5ph,1426168334,Bter to Return 'Hacked' Funds Following Security Partnership,"'Hacked' altcoin exchange, Bter, has outlined a plan to payback users after inking a deal with security firm Jua.com.  The Chinese platform reported that hackers had absconded with 7,170 BTC (roughly $2.1m at press time) on 14th February after accessing its cold wallet storage system. If verified, the figure would make the attack the second largest this year.  In a post on its reopened website yesterday, Bter said users will be repaid in batches using future profits and a 1,000 BTC interest-free loan from Jua.com.  An update to its Twitter page earlier today reads:    Most markets are re-enabled now and we are making withdrawals work for more and more coins.      — Bter.com Exchange (@btercom) March 12, 2015        However, certain trading data, including the platform's bitcoin, yuan and dollar charts, appear frozen at press time.    Jua.com partnership  Previously, Bter had considered selling its platform to make users whole, telling CoinDesk it did not have enough funds to reimburse those affected.    ""Hopefully a qualified party (especially a trusted security team) will take charge of it in the future,"" a spokesperson said at the time.      Alongside the 1,000 BTC loan, which will be provided in exchange for equity in Bter, Jua.com will now handle all the platform's cold wallet security.      Bter said:      ""Working with Jua.com, we reviewed all the security-related code on Bter completely and rebuilt the back-end, and trust all our cold wallets to our partner for specialised security storage, making a solid security foundation for Bter’s re-opening.""              Control of Bter’s hot wallets, used for deposits and withdrawals, will be moved over to Jua.com gradually, the exchange added. The company, which claims to provide enterprise security and storage services for bitcoin companies, runs BW.com, currently bitcoin’s 3rd largest mining pool.      Customers willing to trust the new escrow provider with their funds will receive one-month’s free trading on the platform.    Missing funds  Bter's missing funds have now been tracked to a coin mixing service, Bitcoin Fog, with the help of ""security teams and ... kind cryptocurrency enthusiasts"", the exchange said.  It is unclear whether these parties will be entitled to the 750 BTC bounty previously offered to blockchain experts willing to ""chase back"" the funds. Additionally, attempts to contact Bitcoin Fog have so far been unsuccessful, according to the exchange.  As bitcoin's public ledger, analysts have been using the blockchain to track and visualise the movement of funds in a number of high-profile security stories.  Blockchain analyst Danno Ferrin used data from the ledger to reveal Bitstamp's race to protect $1.75m in bitcoin following its hack in January.  Additionally, a white-hat hacker named 'johoe' was able to take over 267 BTC from Blockchain wallets in December after discovering a security flaw. He later returned the funds.
