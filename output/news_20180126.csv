42428468,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8BLh,1517007914,"Numbers or Not, Coincheck Isn't Mt. Gox","UPDATE (27, January 20:47 UTC): Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. It will repay them 88.549 Japanese yen (about $0.81 U.S.) per stolen coin, out of its own funds, according to a Google translation of the exchange's press release. With 523 million XEM taken, according to the latest estimate. that would bring the total company payout to more than $420 million. The timing of the repayment is still ""under consideration.""      The last time a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange was hacked for a record haul, it was a devastating blow to the ecosystem. Arguably, it took two years for it to fully recover.  This time, the numbers may be similar, but the crypto markets flinched and took all of a day to bounce back. In this way, the massive Coincheck theft is superficially reminiscent of the infamous Mt. Gox hack of 2014, but differs in key ways that underscore how far the industry has come.  To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Shortly after it discovered the theft, the exchange suspended trading of NEM, the stolen crypto in question, then of the other dozen coins it lists.  All told, about 500 million XEM tokens, worth roughly $420 million, was stolen from Coincheck, according to Bloomberg. That's some $80 million more than was taken in the Mt. Gox bitcoin hack.  While the initial news sent XEM prices down as much as 11 percent, data from CoinMarketCap indicates the price began to recover as of press time. Most of the other major cryptocurrencies slid, but only slightly, with declines in the single digits.  But then, neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago.  Different times  In its heyday, Mt. Gox was just about the only game in town for bitcoin traders and altcoins were still something of a novelty. Today, there are many more exchanges, and many more cryptocurrencies.  Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets’ aggregate network value at the time.  In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning ""the impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time,"" he said.  What's more, while the onramps for cryptocurrencies remain rickety, the markets have learned to differentiate them from the superhighways they connect to.  As Burniske put it:  ""[C]rypto investors and speculators have been through a number of exchange hacks by now, likely recognizing that an exchange hack involves a vulnerability in the application on top of a protocol, as opposed to a vulnerability within the crypto-protocols involved … the fundamentals of crypto assets have not weakened, though we have yet another example of the need for further professionalization in crypto application-infrastructure.""  Recovery of funds?  Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole.  During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed.  Separately, Paul Rieger, a member of the NEM Europe team, told CoinDesk that his organization was tagging the stolen XEM and sharing the affected addresses with exchanges.  Because NEM is an account-based platform, all associated accounts could be tagged, thereby letting exchanges know whether an account had stolen funds or not.  Rieger said third parties helped with tagging the accounts by sharing information about legitimate Coincheck withdrawals. However, it is not absolutely certain that every account tagged contained stolen XEM, or that every stolen token has been tagged.  Just another trading day  Data from CoinMarketCap showed that while cryptocurrencies generally took a tumble after the hack was revealed, each of the top 20 coins and tokens by market cap began to recover over the last few hours as of press time.  Many of these tokens are still down on the day, however, and it remains to be seen whether most of the coins listed on CoinMarketCap will move into the green.  NEM’s XEM tokens notably began to recover after hitting a low of 76.5 cents per token – which is still higher than the 72.1 cents per token it traded at on Jan. 17.  They had climbed to about $0.85 cents as of press time, after spiking to over a dollar just after the exchange suspended trading.

Schultz does not, however, believe that bitcoin will play a role in this strategy, remarking that he didn't believe the original cryptocurrency would ""be a currency today or in the future.""  He clarified that Starbucks is not developing a digital currency or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies.  Schultz made the remarks in the company's quarterly investor call, which were subsequently reported by diginomica.  According to the report, he said:  ""I believe that we are heading into a new age, in which blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application.""  Starbucks, he added, is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the changes.  ""We think we have something to offer the companies that are chasing this, because we are in a position to create the trusted legitimate place in which this could be accepted and possibly take advantage of the mobile payment digital platform that we have created.""  The platform Schultz referred to is Starbucks' mobile payment app, launched in 2015, which enables customers to pay and order in-app, while accruing rewards.  Mobile payments constitute nearly one-third of Starbucks' U.S. transactions, and as a result, Schultz said Starbucks is considering implementing cashless stores in the U.S.  Starbucks has a history of embracing leading-edge payment solutions.

42428458,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8B5h,1516995004,"Roubini Doubles Down on Crypto Criticism, Calls Blockchain 'Overhyped'","Nouriel Roubini, the former Clinton administration economist who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, says there is a revolution happening in the financial services industry, but blockchain – ""an untested, Utopian pipe dream"" – is not its catalyst.  In a new opinion piece published by Project Syndicate Friday, Roubini (nicknamed ""Dr. Doom"") said blockchain's potential has been overstated while condemning the notion that cryptocurrencies could replace fiat currencies as ""utterly idiotic.""  Roubini has made harsh public comments about bitcoin before, calling it a ""Ponzi game"" and a bubble, but his latest piece broadens the attack to include the underlying technology.  The New York University professor, who has also held positions at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve and the World Bank, claims that blockchain proponents erroneously compare the technology to the internet in its early incarnations.  Unlike the internet, he wrote, blockchain's accessibility is lacking and it has only one application: cryptocurrencies, which in his view are an unsuccessful experiment based on the false claim that they cannot be devalued by banks and governments. He continued:  ""According to its promoters, Bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21 million units, so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies. But that claim is clearly fraudulent, considering that it has already forked off into three branches: Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Gold. Besides, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day, alongside scams known as 'initial coin offerings,' which are mostly designed to skirt securities laws.""  Likewise, he argues that cryptocurrencies are especially precarious because they lack inherent value that fiat currencies naturally derive from citizens having to pay taxes.  George Soros, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England in the early 1990s, echoed Roubini's dismissal of cryptocurrencies this week in a speech at Davos.  Soros was quoted as saying that ""cryptocurrency"" is a misnomer, because its lack of stable value precludes it from being a currency at all. He joined the World Economic Forum's ""Crypto-Asset Bubble"" panelists in this conclusion, while also stating that the current market capitalization appears to be in a bubble.  In contrast to Roubini, however, Soros did praise blockchain technology during his speech, and said he plans to apply the technology to help migrants. He did not offer more specific details on these plans.

The document also identifies Filipino resident Joseph Calata as a founder or executive for all four companies.  All four of the companies declare their affiliation with the KropCoin token, which the filing notes is built on the ethereum network.  While ICOs are not regulated within the country, the SEC’s Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) claims that ""there is substantial evidence that [the companies] are selling or offering securities in the form of KROPS Tokens and/or Kropcoins to the public, in the Philippines, without the necessary license from the Commission.""  The EIPD filing notes that the four companies have five days to file an appeal of the order, and can have a hearing within 15 days if they do. The SEC then has a further 10 days to resolve or reject the appeal; otherwise the cease-and-desist will be automatically lifted.

""It seems like part one of phase one is getting something like being already done,"" Vitalik Buterin said in a developer meeting.  The technology, known as sharding, attempts to split the ethereum blockchain's data into more manageable parts. Pointing to an initial spec posted on Github, Buterin said:  ""It's theoretically a good spec of what minimal sharding is going to look like.""  Ethereum is under pressure to keep up with the rising popularity of the platform, which has led to slower transaction times and high processing fees. The congestion has already led some token-based projects to build atop other blockchains such as Stellar.  Buterin went to state that the next phase of the four-stage scaling proposal will be completed in ""a month and a bit,"" adding that development work will likely circulate on stateless clients, a type of ethereum software that does not need to process the complete history of the platform.  ""Then from there we're going to try and shard it into a working test, a kind of test network,"" the ethereum founder said.  In the meeting, Buterin also reflected on Casper, ethereum's new consensus protocol that is currently in testing.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the test network has been derailed by issues with the software it deploys. However, Buterin said that in spite of hiccups, the core of the project is sound, or as he put it: ""the Casper aspect of Casper… is totally successful.""  Still, with the code yet to be adapted for use across different ethereum software clients, he acknowledged:  ""That's on a bit of a back burner for now.""

In a press conference at 23:30 JST (14:30 UST), the exchange's president Wakata Koichi Yoshihiro and chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka estimated its loss at 58 billion yen (approx. $533 million). According to Bloomberg, which attended the conference, 500 million NEM tokens were taken from Coincheck's digital wallets.  Tweets by Nikkei appeared to indicate that the precise amount stolen may not be fully known until further checks have been carried out into the intrusion.  But though the exact dollar figure for the incident is hard to pin down (given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the company's lack of information), data suggests the figure is now at least over $400 million, factoring for a decline in the value of XEM, the NEM protocol's token, following the incident.  At press time, the price of XEM was $0.85, down from a high of $1.01 today, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  Notably, the dollar amount stolen from Coincheck is likely greater than the amount stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014 (pegged at $340 million), though the impact on the cryptocurrency market will be much smaller given the immense increases in market capitalization since.  Rumors had been circulating about the theft since early this morning when Coincheck abruptly froze most of its services.  The firm announced on its websitehttps://coincheck.com/en/blog/ around 13:00 JST (04:00 UTC) that it had restricted deposits, trading and withdrawal of XEM, the token running on the NEM blockchain.  A wider suspension on withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies as well as Japanese yen was announced around 30 minutes later. In the following hour, trading of all cryptocurrencies was also restricted, except bitcoin. According to the latest update, other deposit methods including credit cards have also been stopped.  Coincheck is looking into compensating its customers, its executives also announced.  It was also revealed that Coincheck was not registered with Japan's Financial Services Agency, but now plans to do so. Coincheck's president said he ""deeply regretted"" the issue.

At press time, the cryptocurrency has depreciated by 7 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChinaFX. On Bitfinex, the largest market for BCH/USD trading, bitcoin cash fell to $1,479 today; its lowest level against the dollar since Jan. 17. As of writing, it is trading at $1,599.  The development follows a sharp recovery from the Jan. 17 low of $1,343, which witnessed a follow-through buying in the subsequent days. However, the move ran out of steam at a high of $2,110 on Jan. 20 and BCH turned lower again, thus creating a lower high pattern (bearish pattern) on the charts.  That said, the 7 percent drop seen today is largely in line with the weakness in other cryptocurrencies.  For instance, BCH's rival bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 5 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, Ripple's XRP token and Stellar's XLM token are down 8 percent each, while ethereum's ETH cryptocurrency is down 2 percent.  Bitcoin cash chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  BCH is creating head and shoulders bearish reversal pattern. A close (as per UTC) below the neckline would confirm a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  50-day MA has shed bullish bias (topped out).  Falling channel marked by downward sloping trendlines representing lower highs and lower lows.  The relative strength index also favors the bears.  View  Confirmation of head and shoulders breakdown (close below $1,398 - neckline support) would open doors for a drop to $1,100 (Nov. 29 low) and possibly to falling channel support seen sloping lower to $1,050 over the next few days. A violation there would expose support at $851.12 (Nov. 17 low).  Meanwhile, the 50-day MA of $2,195 could be put to test if the bulls defend the neckline support and prices quickly move above $1,806 (Jan. 22 high).  On a larger scheme of things, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $2,400 would revive the bull run. Such a move would confirm upside break of the falling channel pattern and could yield $2,900-$3,000.

The new proposal, published by the ministry on Jan. 25, outlines both requirements for projects that launch ICOs, as well as for investors who wish to participate in the token sales. Since it has been introduced by a government body, the draft must yet pass legislative bodies such as the Russian State Duma and Federation Council before becoming law.  According to the draft, while there would be no investment limit for investors who are licensed professionals in accordance with Russia's securities law, a 50,000 ruble (around $900) cap would be imposed for investors without qualification for each token issuance.  In addition, the proposed law states that ICO organizers in Russia must disclose various information in order to fully comply with the regulation, including the full name of the token issuer, the project's website and network provider, as well as permanent operating bodies of the organizer.  However, promotional activities prior to the token sale may be prohibited according to the proposed law, which states:  ""Prior to the publication of an offer for the release of tokens, the tokens that are issued may not be offered to potential purchasers in any form or by any means using advertising.""  The new draft marks the latest movement in Russia towards the regulation of token sale activities. According to another explanation of the draft law, it has been based on instruction from Russia's President Putin issued on Oct. 21 last year.

42428476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Bdh,1516974037,Bitcoin Price Seeks Direction as Trading Range Narrows,"Bitcoin's price range continues to narrow with each passing day, but a big move on either side could happen soon, the technical charts suggest.  Having witnessed a bull reversal on Wednesday, prices on CoinDesk's bitcoin price index (BPI) rose to $11,711 at 03:59 yesterday. It appeared as though bitcoin (BTC) would break above $12,000 and confirm completion of the bottoming process.  However, prices fell back to $10,889 at 17:59 UTC. Bitcoin bulls made another attempt to regain lost glory, but faced rejection at $11,608 in Asian hours today.  The failure to capitalize on Wednesday's bull reversal has yielded a drop to a three-day low of $10,321 today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $10,600. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 4.11 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChainFX.  Further, the drop from the previous day's high of $11,711 to below $10,500 has neutralized the immediate outlook. A break either up or down would likely set the tone for the next major move.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows bitcoin has created a symmetrical triangle. It comprises of two converging trendlines, representing a series of sequentially lower peaks and higher troughs. It is a trend continuation pattern, i.e. it usually ends with a big move in the direction of the original trend.  In BTC's case, the symmetrical triangle is formed in a downtrend (sell-off from a record high of $20,000). So, the narrowing price range (symmetrical triangle) could end with a big move to the downside.  Such a move would open doors for a slide to $5,232 (target as per the measured height method - the difference between triangle high and low subtracted from the breakdown price/triangle support of $10,480). However, the downside target sounds far-fetched.  Nevertheless, BTC could revisit $9,000 following confirmation (4-hour close below triangle support) of a downside break of the symmetrical triangle pattern. The relative strength index (RSI) is sloping downwards, suggesting scope for a drop in prices. The key MAs - 50, 100, 200 - are sloping downwards in favor of the bears. So, the downside break looks likely as per the 4-hour chart.  That said, the dips below the $10,000 mark are to be viewed with caution says the daily chart.  Daily chart  So far, the bears have consistently failed to keep BTC prices under $10,000. Also, BTC has been able to avoid a daily close (as per UTC) below $10,391 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high). Further, the rising trendline (drawn from July low and September low) support is lined up at $9,370.  So, there is always a risk of BTC running into bids anywhere between $9,000 to $10,000.  View  A bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown could yield a sell-off to $9,000, but dips below $10,000 could be transient.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below the ascending trendline support of $9,370 would open doors for a sustained move lower to $8,148 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high).  Bullish Scenario: An upside break of the symmetrical triangle would add credence to persistent demand around $10,000 and could see BTC test resistance at $13,000 and $14,622 (50-day moving average) over the weekend.

42428459,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8B7h,1516972530,Wall Street Vets Raise $50 Million for Crypto Fund of Funds,"Sitting at his desk at Credit Suisse, Sina Nader watched the bottom fall out of the global economy.  As a junior associate helping manage a $100 million portfolio of equities, he had a first-hand view of the 2007-2008 collapse from the Swiss bank's Los Angeles offices and recalls frantically taking screenshots of the price as Lehman Brothers' stock collapsed to ""essentially zero.""  ""My first thought was, 'Holy shit, some traders just took out Lehman,'"" Nader told CoinDesk. ""My next thought was, 'Holy shit, if the fifth-largest investment bank in America can be taken out like this, is the banking system actually safe?'""  Likening it to the feeling kids get when they learn Santa Claus isn't real, Nader says that the day changed him forever – and eventually sent him into the wild world of cryptocurrency.  After going down the crypto rabbit hole, Nader, who's also worked for Morgan Stanley, teamed up with a former private wealth analyst at Morgan Stanley, Jacob Kirschenbaum, and others to launch Cryptolux Capital, a crypto fund of funds.  And revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nader has secured about $50 million of the $100 million the fund is seeking.  While the number of crypto hedge funds has grown from about 124 in October to 175 today, Nader positions his experience in one of the traditional financial system's worst hours as the key to Cryptolux's success.  ""I look back to what I saw in the financial services world, and that really sets the stage for me to be excited about crypto,"" Nader said. ""When you're watching the five biggest investment banks in the country either go out of business or change their entire business model, you realize that the banking system is not as strong as many people may have believed it was.""  He continued:  ""I've got this view that this banking system is not infallible, and wouldn't it be nice if there was a system that went around, or was outside of the banking system for the use of wealth?""  Have some humility  According to Nader, Cryptolux is designed specifically to take advantage of the lessons he learned, in an effort to offset the downside risks of the volatile cryptocurrency market.  At the heart of that is Nader's captivation by bitcoin’s ability to store value outside the traditional banking system. If the financial sector buckles again, bitcoin won't go down with it.  But as he started looking at crypto hedge funds more broadly, he saw a number of cryptocurrencies and funds diversifying in the cryptocurrency space outperforming bitcoin itself by as much as 200 percent.  So, he started talking to other investors and coming up with a strategy that would capture those huge gains.  And Cryptolux believes it's found that strategy in a targeted fund-screening process that looks for an attribute he contends is all too rare among today's cryptocurrency speculators, just as it was in investors before the financial collapse: humility.  ""Anyone who really claims to know exactly what is going to happen in the crypto space is probably misguided at best,"" Nader said, adding:  ""So I think it's important to come at this space with a strong amount of humility, because I think it will inform your investment strategy and ultimately your trading.""  Look to the futures  The second way Nader aims to offset downside risk is by further hedging with cryptocurrency futures options.  Nader said, initially the fund will establish short positions in the nascent bitcoin futures market. In the event of a market correction or pullback, he expects the bitcoin futures position will increase, providing Cryptolux with a buffer against the dips.  Currently, Cryptolux is only investing in bitcoin futures, but Nader expects to add ether futures should that product get approved by regulators.  Hinting at which hedge funds Cryptolux is mixing into its fund of funds, Nader said he’s ""excited"" about Silver 8 Capital and MultiCoin Capital, though he's keeping an eye open for changes in the strategies of the fund managers over time, and could modify his own fund's composition accordingly.  And going forward, Nader said the firm will be exploring the possibility of expanding its investments to include proprietary positions in crypto startups and other blockchain-related companies.  For interested investors, there’s a $1 million minimum to join, with a 1 percent management fee and a 15 percent carry on money made from the investment. By early next month, Nader expects to reveal further details about the company’s risk management program along with other new features.  And if all goes as planned, he hopes to raise a second fund targeting $125 million.  According to Nadar, he’s primed to do it, saying:  ""Our view of what our value-add is, is we give you a diversified portfolio and we take care of the risk management component on top of that.""

The new payment system, provided by cryptocurrency travel firm TravelbyBit, will enable travellers to use bitcoin, ethereum, dash and other digital currencies to shop and dine at various stores and restaurants across both of Brisbane's air terminals, a press release says.  Roel Hellemons, Brisbane Airport Corporation's (BAC) general manager of strategic planning and development, said that the airport is the first worldwide to incorporate cryptocurrency payments. The move, he said, ""makes sense"" because many people who have invested in cryptocurrencies travel internationally.  He continued:  ""This is just the beginning for us as we hope to expand the digital currency option across the business.""  According to TravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh, the payment system presents a ""genuine use case for cryptocurrencies"" in the field of tourism.  ""Here at TravelbyBit we are promoting the bitcoin travel movement. Digital currency for world-wide travel. It’s simple, safe and there’s no bank fees,"" Yeoh added.  The use of cryptocurrencies to boost tourism and related services is something that global politicians have increasingly being investigating.  In November, the head of Russia’s Federal Agency for Tourism predicted that blockchain technology will transform the country's tourism industry.  ""We are absolutely convinced in our federal agency that blockchain will seriously change the tourism market, although, in our opinion, it will happen not in two years but in 5–10 years,"" said Oleg Safonov at the time.  In the U.S., legislators in Hawaii have pushed for the creation of a working group dedicated to blockchain technology, with a focus on tourism payments.

42428463,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8BFh,1516964408,Chinese Finance Association Cautions on Overseas ICOs,"A self-regulatory association in China is warning citizens against participating in overseas initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading.  In a public statement published on Jan 26, the National Internet Finance Association (NIFA) writes that, after China issued a ban on ICOs last September and ordered closure of cryptocurrency exchanges, it has seen investors moving their funds to overseas platforms.  NIFA states:  ""Recently, as worldwide governments are tightening regulations on cryptocurrencies, some overseas ICO and trading platforms may also face the risk of being forcefully closed due to compliance issue. Therefore, domestic investors are advised to be cautious of the risk.""  Although a self-regulatory organization and not a regulatory authority, NIFA was first initiated in 2015 by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and approved by the State Council. The warning comes just weeks after the association sent out another warning on activities that offer the substance of ICOs, but marketed in different forms.  In addition, NIFA highlighted that existing over-the-counter (OTC) trading activities in China are not complying with current regulation. Some domestic social networks have served as a marketplace to facilitate peer-to-peer trading and some non-banking payment tools are also offering services to support the finance, the association states.  As reported, following the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, Chinese investors have largely moved to OTC platforms that operate over messaging applications such as WeChat and Telegram. Payment methods such as WeChat Pay, AliPay and bank transfers are still available for OTC traders to push through transactions.  Citing details from central bank's ban on ICOs, the association pointed out that all these activities still fall within the scope of cryptocurrency trading, which may be subject to regulatory oversight.  ""Investors should be aware that these trading services all have potential risks on the policy front, and be advised to stay away from these illegal financing activities,"" NIFA writes.  Just last week, the PBoC's Beijing branch reportedly issued a notice to local payment services requiring them to investigate and stop serving cryptocurrency traders in the country.

In a written testimony to a Senate committee on Jan. 25, ICE's deputy assistant director Greg Nevano said the agency has seen increasing usage of cryptocurrencies to pay for the trafficking of illicit drug such as opioids like fentanyl.  Combatting this growing concern, the agency said it has adopted various strategies to expose drug traders who are turning to cryptocurrencies for their difficulty to trace.  Nevano wrote in his testimony:  ""In support of its diverse financial investigative efforts ICE uses undercover techniques to infiltrate and exploit peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchangers who typically launder proceeds for criminal networks engaged in or supporting dark net marketplaces.""  In addition, Nevano also indicated that ICE is employing ""complex blockchain technology exploitation tools"" in a bid to analyze cryptocurrency transactions and to discover the identities behind those transactions. Further, training is being provided by the agency to national and international cryptocurrency investigators to continue tackling the issue.  While he did not disclose the precise details of the agency's cryptocurrency investigations, the comments mark ICE's latest effort in delving into cryptocurrency's underlying blockchain technology in order to strip its core feature of anonymity.

In an op-ed article published by news outlet Yicai, Fan Yifei, vice governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), outlined the bank's direction on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Fan stated that that central bank's CBDC will inherently differ from decentralized tokens, while centralized management and issuance will remain a high-level priority.  ""CBDC will still be the central bank's liability to the public. The nature of this liability will not change just because of the physical form of cash going digitalized. Therefore, we must ensure the central role of PBoC in issuing CBDC,"" Fan wrote, adding:  ""A CBDC will also help curb the public's demand for private cryptocurrencies, which will strengthen the role of our sovereign currency.""  The official further detailed that, unlike most cryptocurrencies, the CBDC might not operate via a peer-to-peer mechanism, which brings the key features of anonymity and untraceability. He explained that transactions using CBDC will be visible to the central bank, which would function as a third party to bring oversight on potential money laundering and illegal financing.  Fan's comments are the latest from the central bank that provide a glimpse into its possible direction on the CBDC after having established a research arm for the issue.  These comments are also in line with arguments made by Yao Qian, the director of PBoC's digital currency research lab. While the lab works on the R&D of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, Yao said last year in a conference that development of CBDC should not be confined to the ideology of blockchain's decentralization and distributed ledger technology.  In yesterday's article, Fan further specified that the central bank will be cautious in introducing smart contracts – a feature of some blockchain platforms that can automate certain processes – to the CBDC system. He argued that since a CBDC will essentially be a substitute for the country's fiat currency, existing laws that apply to the yuan should also extend to the digital currency.  Currently, Chinese laws specify that Chinese yuan can only be used in pricing, circulation, payment and storage, thus so should the CBDC. Fan explained that adding smart contract functionality to the PBoC's digital currency might enable other functions such as automating of taxation and fund raising, which could be unlawful activities.

42428467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8BPh,1516942850,Lightning Has a Problem: People Are Already Using It,"Fake money is boring.  At least, that's the contention of many micropayment enthusiasts, whose impatience for the Lightning Network has led to an influx of real bitcoin being transacted over the network, even though developers caution people against doing so since it's still in the testing phase.  ""The testnet just doesn't have the same adrenaline rush,"" representatives of VPN service TorGuard told CoinDesk, after announcing it would be accepting Lightning payments.  And they're not the only ones – Blockstream launched a Lightning-only merchandise store using its own Lightning implementation, c-lightning, and a Lightning main net explorer suggests more than $33,000 in bitcoin has been transacted via Lightning Networks.  The excitement is not hard to explain – the off-chain technology promises near-instant transaction speeds with vastly reduced fees – and many enthusiasts believe using the network on the bitcoin mainnet, as opposed to on the testnet, will speed up the time it takes to get the Lightning Network ready for prime time.  ""I think it's time for [Lightning Network] to go live, even if still buggy. But this is the best way to harden it,"" one Twitter user wrote.  Yet using the network while it's still in development has not only led to confusion as to its readiness, but it's also caused several people to lose real bitcoin funds. Because of that, Blockstream's decision has been criticized, and others have called opening Lightning channels with hundreds and thousands of dollars of bitcoin ""crazy.""  In spite of persistent warnings, though, mainnet implementations of Lightning already have over 205 nodes and 548 channels, at press time, with no sign of stalling.  Yet, what this momentum is slowing, according to developers, is the rate at which Lightning will be safe to use on the bitcoin mainnet.  As Pierre-Marie Padiou, who develops Lightning at ACINQ, told CoinDesk:  ""Recently we have seen more and more users configuring their software for mainnet, some thinking that this will make Lightning Network deployment happen faster somehow.""  Distracting the devs  But that's just not the case.  In a recent interview, CEO of Lightning Labs, Elizabeth Stark, approximated the developer count on the Lightning Network to be as low as ten individuals – a factor which as detailed by CoinDesk could be slowing down the release of the tech. Perhaps due to this shortage, Lightning Labs has appealed to users to stop sending money over the system, stating that, ""It has become an unnecessary distraction for our devs.""  ""A lot of people want to get on mainnet and it’s hard to tell them that it’s not quite ready and that they should test on testnet,"" said Alex Bosworth, a Lightning developer. ""I wouldn't recommend using mainnet unless you are explicitly testing and fully know what you are doing.""  According to Bosworth, who runs two of his own mainnet nodes, one major problem Lightning developers could run into as they move to release a mainnet implementation is needing to be backwards-compatible, so that the upcoming release would interoperate with the current prototypes being developed.  If the nascent mainnet continues to mature – it has doubled in node count in the past 72 hours – it could ""reduce the speed of development,"" as devs would ""have to worry about keeping backwards compatibility with previous versions,"" Bosworth said.  Yet, even with all this in mind, there's no sign active use will stop.  ""We plan on keeping our Lightning Network nodes up and running permanently to help support the network,"" said TorGuard CEO Ben Van Pelt.  Finding bugs  And that aligns with Lightning adopter David R. Sterry's defense of the active use of the in-development network, saying the criticism ""isn't unanimous,"" and adding that developers ""could have made it harder to do if [they were] really against it.""  He continued, ""There are some issues you'll only find with real money.""  And mainnet testing has led to the uncovering of several bugs.  According to the International Business Times, Blockstream's deployment of the tech led to the discovery of 20 bugs in the first 14 hours following its launch. And the CEO of TorGuard, Ben Van Pelt, told CoinDesk the company has encountered a few bugs along the way, but none that have caused the company or its users to lose money.  In this same vein, CSO of Blockstream Samsom Mow tweeted: ""Using Lightning Network on mainnet isn't just bug fixing, stickers and being #reckless. It's also learning about usability issues that we may not be considering.""  But Padiou thinks this overlooks an important point, saying once the network is live, ""Every bug encountered will potentially be orders of magnitude more costly in terms of development resources. That's why on the way to a stable, working Lightning Network, rushing things will not make us actually go faster.""  The active network ""just puts more pressure and adds more distraction to the already small number of people actually doing the development,"" he continued, adding:  ""Let's not forget that [developers] are the scarcest resource of all.""
