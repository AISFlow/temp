Today, SPEDN is now open to Canadians on both iOS and Android. The post claims 7,500 Canadian merchants will be on-boarded by early September.

Speaking with CoinDesk, Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding said the payments processor plans on launching in a few more countries by the end of the year but cannot disclose the locations.  On-boarding additional coins is also in the works.

42382549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryq3,1565722811,Bitcoin's 'Kimchi Premium' Vanishes Again as Trading Range Tightens,"The spread between the price of bitcoin on South Korean and U.S.-based crypto exchanges, which returned in June and hit 16-month highs, has disappeared once again.  A measure of how much more South Koreans pay for bitcoin, the spread, known colloquially as the ""kimchi premium,"" has reached remarkable levels, peaking at 54.48 percent in January 2018, according to researchers at the University of Calgary. From then, it dropped and ultimately vanished into early 2019, only to return again recently, running at around 5 to 10 percent.  But last week, local newspapers started to notice that bitcoin was back to trading lower in won terms. The Dong-a Ilbo, one of the country's major publications, reported on August 5 that bitcoin was priced just 2.15 percent higher in dollar markets than in won on South Korean exchanges.  The deficit persists. On August 13, bitcoin was trading on Upbit at 13,678,000 won and quoted on CoinDesk at $11,429.14, which translates to 13,931,951 won, a difference of 253,951 ($208). That's about 1.8 percent lower. At the end of the day on Tuesday in Korea, the gap had narrowed, but it remained.  The Dong-a Ilbo believes that the end of the kimchi premium has something to do with the fall of the Korean won. Since the end of July, the local currency has lost almost 3 percent of its value against the dollar.  At the same time, the regulatory environment is becoming more challenging for crypto exchanges in Korea. The banks are starting to more strictly apply AML guidelines and local regulatory requirements, such as real name accounts, while the authorities have recently said they are going to directly supervise the markets.  The University of Calgary researchers argue in an April 2019 paper that the kimchi premium is largely structural. Transfers between markets can take time, and this makes arbitrage difficult.  Profiting on the price difference is a risky trade due to the delay and the volatility of the coin, so the volume of these price correcting transactions is often too low to close the gap. The researchers also said that high transaction costs might disincentivize moves between the markets.  Exchange controls in Korea, though primarily administrative these days, do add friction and can slow the movement of funds needed to balance the arbitrage trade. The controls also have a way of making bitcoin more attractive to people in Korea, as the coin is transnational in nature and potentially a good vehicle for bypassing the exchange controls, the researchers added in their paper.

42382557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rywL,1565716205,SEC Files Emergency Action Against Organizer of 'Fraudulent' $15 Million ICO,"UPDATE (August 13, 2019 23:10 UTC): The SEC has obtained a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of Reggie Middleton and Veritaseum.  The order covers accounts at traditional financial institutions (Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase), cryptocurrency exchanges (Gemini and Kraken) and 15 addresses on the ethereum blockchain.      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to freeze the assets of Reggie Middleton, organizer of the $14.8 million Veritaseum (VERI) initial coin offering (ICO).  According to an emergency action filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Middleton conducted a fraudulent and illegal ICO in 2017 and manipulated the securities' value afterward.  A self-described ""financial guru,"" Middleton is accused of propagating false information about his businesses, as well as conducting trades in the open market that jacked up the price of VERI. The SEC further alleges he misappropriated at least $520,000 of investors' money for personal use, as well as $600,000 to purchase precious metals to prop up another scam.  In addition to freezing Middleton's assets, the SEC asked the court to prohibit him from destroying or altering documents and place a lifelong ban his ever operating a public company or participating in a digital asset securities offering.  According to the complaint, Middleton failed to register the VERI ICO with the SEC and claimed the coins were not securities, but investments in a technology platform or his personal brand. At several points, Middleton described VERI tokens as prepaid fees, software, or compared them to WalMart gift cards. This obfuscation, the SEC alleges, was an attempt to “skirt” the law.  The allegations of market manipulation stem in part from ""Middleton plac[ing] a series of secret, manipulative trades in VERI ... artificially increasing VERI's price by approximately 315% during just one day of trading. He then touted these price increases and returns to VERI holders,"" the SEC said.  https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1161270101527674880  'Rap star net worth'  Investors purchased 51 million tokens during the 2017 ICO, for 69,000 ether (valued at $14.8 million at the time), and continued to buy in based on Middleton’s material deceptions, the SEC said.  As part of a misinformation campaign, Middleton said he had brokered deals with airlines, ultra-high net worth individuals, and “one of the largest stock exchanges in the Caribbean” to sell VERI for its various stated use cases, according to the SEC. In total, he claimed to have sold $35 million worth of tokens for institutional use.  In fact, by June 2018, only 75 of the roughly 2 million tokens were “exchanged for research or any other services.”  Middleton instead fabricated trading volume on the EtherDelta exchange to pump VERI's price, the regulator said. He would then publicize the increasing volume or price to entice more investments.  The SEC quotes an email Middleton sent to an employee, detailing the first known instance of market manipulation: “The EtherDelta market is not accurate because of the very, very low volume. I will try to push more volume in… [t]his time next month, I’ll probably have all (as in every single) hip hop and rap star/producer beat in net worth.”  An additional $8 million of funds raised during the ICO are missing. In 2017, Middleton claimed hackers stole and liquidated the 36,000 tokens from company accounts.      In a separate document. SEC attorneys wrote:    And in just the last two weeks, after they learned that a Commission enforcement action against them was likely, Defendants transferred over $2 million of the remaining investor proceeds, at least in part to fund other endeavors.    Specifically, Middleton allegedly began transferring 10,000 ETH (worth about $2.3 million) of investor funds to ""other digital asset addresses,"" and another 750 ETH (about $172,500) to his personal account days after the SEC informed Middleton's lawyers they would recommend an enforcement action.

Investors can now onboard to try out Seed CX's swaps product matching platform during the testing period through its subsidiary Seed SEF, a regulated swap execution facility (SEF), the company announced  Seed CX's CEO Edward Woodford told CoinDesk that the testing would allow market participants to test both their connections to the marketplace, as well as the products themselves ""to ensure they are working as expected.""  ""We’re very excited to have begun user testing of our physically-settled bitcoin derivative product,"" said Seed CX president Brian Liston in a statement. ""We’re at the final step.""  Woodford told The Block that the company could launch its live swaps product over the next three months.  ""The three-month timeline is not firm, as we are waiting on regulatory approval and therefore it is not in our hands to control,"" he clarified to CoinDesk, adding:  ""We are ready from a technology standpoint. The other factors that can influence our timeline is the regulators’ views on these products.""  In his statement, Liston said that once testing is concluded successfully and regulators have reviewed, the company ""will be able to launch a much needed margined, physically-settled digital asset derivative to U.S. customers.""  Race to market  A number of firms are looking to offer physically-settled bitcoin derivatives, in which clients receive the actual bitcoin underlying a contract on expiration, in the U.S. To date, LedgerX is the only one to provide swaps and options products, which it offers to institutional clients, and opened a platform targeting retailers in recent weeks.  However, Seed CX wants to become the first to offer physically-settled products on margin, meaning investors can enter a leveraged position.  The company has previously announced its intention to offer bitcoin forwards, a product similar to the bitcoin futures that Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt, LedgerX and ErisX are hoping to offer customers. TrueDigital is also looking to launch bitcoin forwards.  While futures are standardized contracts traded on an exchange, forwards can be customized between parties and are traded over-the-counter. Clients can use both to bet on the price of bitcoin at some future date.  According to Tuesday's press release, Seed CX intends to offer nine different contracts simultaneously: four weekly contracts, three serial monthly contracts and two quarterly monthly contracts. Weekly contracts will expire on Fridays, while the monthly and quarterly monthly contracts will expire on the third Friday of the relevant months.  Seed CX, the parent firm to Seed SEF, launched a bitcoin spot trading market in January, offering institutional clients trading and settlement services.

42382560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rz3t,1565709381,XRP Price Charts First 'Death Cross' Since April 2018,"XRP is flashing red this Tuesday morning with a long-term price indicator turning bearish for the first time in over a year.  At press time, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $0.2955 on Bitfinex, representing a 1 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. More importantly, however, the 50-day moving average (MA) of XRP’s price has crossed below the 200-day MA.  That is the first “death cross” or a long-term bearish crossover since April 2018.  Technical analysis theory considers the death cross as an advance warning of a major sell-off. In reality, however, the crossover is the result of a major price slide – the MA studies are based on historical data and tend to lag price.  This is evident from the fact that XRP fell from $0.52 to $0.28 in 3.5-weeks to July 16 and the bearish crossover has happened today.  Put simply, the long-term MA crossovers are lagging indicators and have limited predictive powers at best.  In fact, the death cross has worked as a contrary indicator in the past, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  XRP fell from a record high of $3.30 to $0.45 in three months to April 1, 2018, and the 50- and 200-day MAs produced charted the death cross on April 9 following which XRP picked up a bid and rose to a high of $0.96 by April 24.  Take note of the fact that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions with a below-30 print on April 1. An oversold RSI indicates the sell-off is overdone and potential for a corrective bounce, which happened after the confirmation of the death cross.  This time, the RSI is hovering at 37.00 (above right). A reading between 50 and 30 indicates bearish conditions.  Further, the pennant breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, confirmed earlier this month indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Therefore, the latest death cross could end up bolstering the already bearish setup.  XRP could drop below the support at $0.2825 (April 25 low) in the short-run and extend losses toward the September 2018 low of $0.25.  The short-term outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $0.34097 (July 20 high), invalidating the bearish lower highs setup.

42382556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rz1N,1565707535,SEC Guidance Gives Ammo to Lawsuit Claiming XRP Is Unregistered Security,"The Takeaway:  A new amended complaint against Ripple draws on the SEC’s framework for digital assets to outline how XRP might be a security – likely the first federal case to do so.  The filing also cites California advertising law, in addition to federal securities law, to argue that investors were misled by Ripple’s promotion of XRP.  While the case is a year old and has not yet received class-action status, the new complaint is the first that Ripple must respond to with a substantive answer.  Ripple has until mid-September to file its response.    --------------------------    Investors in the cryptocurrency XRP have filed a new complaint against Ripple that marshals the Securities and Exchange Commission’s own words to argue that the startup illegally sold unregistered securities.  The amended complaint, filed Aug. 5 in a year-old lawsuit against Ripple, includes several new arguments and may be the first federal case to cite the SEC’s guidance for applying existing law and regulation to crypto tokens.  It also marks the first filing to which Ripple must directly respond by addressing the facts of the case. Four previous complaints were filed in California state court, but the company successfully moved to have these cases consolidated and shifted to federal court. Ripple has until Sept. 19 to file a response.  ""That filing will be the first time in the already-long history of this litigation that Ripple will substantively respond to the allegations around XRP,"" said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at crypto lending startup Compound Finance.  The company has been in the legal crosshairs since May 2018, when investor Ryan Coffey filed the first of several lawsuits seeking class-action status against Ripple Labs, subsidiary XRP II, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other individuals. XRP, which Ripple periodically sells, has ""all the traditional hallmarks of a security,"" Coffey claimed.  Investors Vladi Zakinov, Avner Greenwald and David Oconer filed similar suits shortly thereafter. The lawsuits were combined and moved to federal court in November.  While the suit has not yet been certified as a class action, law firms Susman Godfrey and Tayler-Copeland Law were appointed as co-lead counsel at the end of June, with investor Bradley Sostack being appointed as lead plaintiff. (Zakinov, Oconer and Greenwald were denied their own motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff.)  The new amended complaint lays out ""a strong case against Ripple,"" said Chervinsky, noting that Susman Godfrey is ""one of the best plaintiff’s law firms in the U.S."" In particular, he highlighted that the complaint claims XRP is a security under both federal and California state law.  ""This is important because California uses the 'risk capital test' in addition to the [federal] Howey test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security,"" he explained. ""The risk capital test is broader than the Howey test, meaning the plaintiffs could lose their federal securities claims and still win their state securities claims.""  The plaintiffs’ complaint is trying to tie the XRP Ledger, the distributed network underlying XRP (and therefore the cryptocurrency’s price), back to Ripple, said Rebecca Rettig, a partner at the law firm of Fisher Broyles, which is not involved in the case.  Ripple and Susman Godfrey declined to comment.  SEC framework  Perhaps the most important difference between the new complaint and its predecessors is the citation of the SEC’s framework for analyzing whether a digital asset qualifies as a security.  ""The Complaint reads like a love letter to the SEC,"" Chervinsky said. ""Although the SEC's Framework is technically only non-binding guidance, the Court will likely give it significant weight in deciding how to apply the Howey test to the facts of this case.""  Rettig agreed, telling CoinDesk that ""this is the first time we have seen the SEC’s Framework applied in a case in federal court."" She added:  ""Although the framework on its own doesn’t have precedential value – meaning the court is not required to follow it – it will be very interesting to see how the court handles the utility of the framework in moving forward in determining whether XRP is a security.""  The SEC published the guidance in April, providing for the first time a specific roadmap for how it might assess digital assets.  Over the course of 11 pages, the amended complaint details how the plaintiffs believe XRP is a security based on the framework, stating that ""XRP purchasers made an investment of money in a common enterprise""; ""XRP investors had a reasonable expectation of profits""; and ""the success of XRP requires efforts of Ripple and others"".  ""Lead Plaintiff and the Class invested fiat and other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to purchase XRP. As explained in the SEC Framework, investment of both fiat and digital currency meets the first prong of Howey,"" the filing says.  Ripple and its affiliated parties are the common enterprise, the complaint alleges, saying that any profit the potential class might see “are intertwined with the fortunes of Ripple.”  The price of XRP is dependent on Ripple’s efforts, the lawsuit alleges. Investors would have expected the value of their holdings to grow based upon the efforts of the company.  The complaint goes on to say:  ""Lead Plaintiff and the Class have entirely passive roles vis-à-vis the success of the XRP Ledger and XRP. Rather, as Defendants’ own marketing makes clear, the success of the XRP Ledger, and the profits the Class reasonably expected to derive from investing in XRP, are dependent on the essential technical, entrepreneurial, and managerial efforts of Defendants and their agents and employees.""  Rettig noted that “each of the [factors in the SEC Framework] are based on underlying federal case law, so the litigants will likely rely upon these underlying cases and not simply the framework [itself].”  Tweets as evidence  Like past complaints, last week’s filing points to public statements made by Ripple executives such as CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CTO David Schwartz to bolster its argument.  For example, Garlinghouse said in a 2017 CNBC interview that “people are looking at the success Ripple has been having as a company, and I think that’s increased the value of XRP,” according to the complaint.  Elsewhere, the complaint says Garlinghouse “conceded” that Ripple’s own self-interest is tied up “with building and maintaining a healthy XRP market.”  “The Complaint emphasizes Ripple's own statements to prove that XRP investors had a reasonable expectation of profits flowing from Ripple's managerial efforts,” Chervinsky noted. “This is similar to how the SEC framed its own Complaint against Kik,” the messaging app company that the SEC alleges violated securities laws when it raised $100 million during a 2017 token sale.  Beyond interviews, the complaint cites tweets that the plaintiffs believe demonstrate that Ripple indicated XRP’s price would rise due to work the company was doing.  Roughly 40 tweets are referenced in the filing, including tweets from the company, executives and other employees discussing exchange listings, Ripple’s XRP reserves and other marketing efforts. The complaint also references a Garlinghouse quote-tweet of a Motley Fool tweet which said companies using Ripple’s tools “could be a big deal for Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency” as an example.  “I've never seen so many citations to Twitter in a complaint before,” Chervinsky said.  (The suit also notes that Digital Currency Group, which holds a stake in Ripple, is also the parent company of CoinDesk, and cites a 2017 article on this website reporting that XRP’s price had risen above $1 for the first time ever as ""one of many instances in which Ripple would promote XRP price movements."" For the record: CoinDesk operates independently from the parent company, working in separate offices and maintaining strict policies on editorial independence and transparency.)  Beyond simply promoting XRP, the complaint hints that Ripple may have gone as far as to mislead the general public about which of its various products were being adopted.  ""On April 26, 2017, Ripple tweeted a link to an article on its own site, proclaiming: ‘#Ripple welcomes 10 additional customers to our #blockchain #payments network.’ Neither this tweet nor the article it linked to informed readers that the blockchain payments network did not refer to the XRP Ledger, but rather Ripple’s xCurrent enterprise solution,"" the complaint said, adding in the next paragraph:  ""Just days later, on May 3, 2017, with the price of XRP continuing to rise, Ripple tweeted: '#Ripple adoption is sparking interest in XRP 'which has had an impressive rally in the last two months' via @Nasdaq.'""  California claims  Securities law aside, the lawsuit also adds new claims that have not appeared in previous filings in the case, Chervinsky noted.  ""For the first time, the plaintiffs now claim that Ripple violated California's false advertising and unfair competition laws by making fraudulent statements about the genesis, circulating supply, and adoption of XRP,"" he said.  The fact that this complaint is in federal court may have helped the plaintiffs. Chervinsky explained:  ""Interestingly, the plaintiffs probably couldn't have alleged those claims on behalf of a global ‘class’ -- all persons or entities who purchased XRP -- if Ripple had left the case in California state court instead of removing it to federal court.""  According to the filing, Sostack and his fellow plaintiffs are looking for Ripple to reimburse them for their losses.  For the lead plaintiff, those losses total $118,100, according to the complaint, but the full size of the losses allegedly incurred by the class has not yet been calculated.  More significantly, the plaintiffs want the court to declare that XRP is a security, which could have an impact on Ripple’s ability to continue selling XRP from its reserves, as well as potentially limit who can acquire the token.  Other prayers for relief include the plaintiffs wanting Ripple to pay for all legal fees and have the court award any other damages that might be warranted.  Ripple now has 45 days from August 5 to answer the complaint, and could file a response (like Kik Interactive did to the SEC) or a motion to dismiss.

Pistor, the Edwin B. Parker Professor of Comparative Law at Columbia Law School, explored the legality - and importance - of corporate tokens like Libra in a world that seems reticent to adopt them.  ""Facebook's Libra is designed to become a new global currency that will complement existing fiat currencies. It is designed as a for-profit currency of currencies,"" Pistor said at the House Financial Services Committee on July 17.  Pistor went on to describe the governance model of Facebook's Geneva-based cryptocurrency project as a ""concentration of power... unmatched by any meaningful accountability to anyone."" Though that's less frightening than it sounds.  Later, at an Q&A hosted by CoinDesk, Pistor explained that Libra could only be possible because of the regulatory infrastructure that already supports fiat currencies. Just as treasury bills and bank deposits are guarded by the reputation and ""full faith of the United States behind"" them, so too would Facebook's stable cryptocurrency be ingratiated in the financial ecosystem. ""[Facebook] can't do this without the United States.""  Libra, because of its streamlined and ""elegant"" design, ""could eliminate a lot of things. It could be a lot cheaper. It could just be a much better system for many customers."" Ultimately, Pistor's question becomes, ""whether the central banks could actually offer something that's more attractive.""

Announced Tuesday, ABS Bank – an institution owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia – said it backed the TradeWindow platform after taking part in a pilot utilizing its tech to carry out a trade between a Korean importer and a New Zealand meat exporter last year.  A.J. Smith, founder and CEO of TradeWindow said the undisclosed investment means his firm is one of the first tech companies in the country to backed directly by a New Zealand bank.  “The decision by ASB to invest in TradeWindow is a great vote of confidence. The bank is committed to accelerating the progress of New Zealand’s trade environment using new technology and recognises the potential our product has to streamline trading between Kiwi exporters and the rest of the world,” Smith said.  The firm said the funding will be used to ""fast-track"" development of its platform.  TradeWindow uses distributed ledger technology to create a ""single trading window"" that provides real-time insight into a trade for all participants. Changes to data can only be made ""with the consensus of the majority of the network,"" the firm said, meaning the risk of fraud and cyberattacks are greatly reduced.  The most immediate benefit for clients, though, according to Smith, is the greater efficiencies and lower costs brought about by the real-time sharing of documentation. Currently, this is ""couriered at significant cost"" between all trade participants, he said.  As part of the funding deal, Nigel Annett, executive general manager of corporate banking at ASB Bank, will join TradeWindow's board.  “What began as collaboration through ASB’s innovation programme to solve a customer problem, is now a fully-fledged business ready to launch,” Annett said.  TradeWindow is said to be finalizing partnerships that will see it acquire two New Zealand-based export companies, as well as having more pilot schemes in the pipeline.

42382554,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryv5,1565701257,This Crypto Is Worth Less Than 1 Cent. VCs Are Betting Millions on Its Future,"Not all token sales led to quick failures or cash grabs. Some were part of a broader, albeit ambitious, business strategy.  The blockchain startup Patientory, which makes a consumer health app and offers enterprise data management services to hospitals and clinics, is conducting a $5.2 million Series A including R/GA Ventures. This comes as the startup’s first funding round since it split off from the Patientory Association, a nonprofit created after the May 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) of ethereum-based PTOY tokens raised $7.2 million.  “With the token, it basically regulates the storage in each node,” Chrissa McFarlane, Patientory CEO and president of the Patientory Association, told CoinDesk about her company’s token-oriented pilot programs. “You’re providing storage space and also paying for the transactions.”  That said, few people currently use the token for anything beyond experiments.  McFarlane said that beyond the holdings given to the founding team and nonprofit, she doesn’t know who is trading PTOY tokens these days on external exchanges like Upbit and Bittrex. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of PTOY plummeted in January 2018 and has remained at a pittance ever since, a fraction of a penny compared to a peak of $0.67 each in the bull market of December 2017.  However, Patientory doesn’t rely on users owning tokens. To the contrary, McFarlane said she accepts fiat payments from prospective clients and purchases tokens on their behalf to facilitate transactions. Node operators can earn these tokens as a reward for providing storage space to other network participants, but usage isn’t mandatory.  “We do not put data on the blockchain. Think of it as decentralized storage,” McFarlane said. Once the blockchain system is integrated with the hospital medical records, the data is encrypted and sharded so that the Patientory network basically acts like road signs for queries.  Her goal is to have data across different healthcare providers managed under the patient’s private key, so the patient can grant providers nearly instant access. Almost 350 users have tested the startup’s beta mobile app, which can include subscription features like personalized health tips, since it launched in late 2018.  Dylan Boyd, director of new programs at the Oregon Enterprise Blockchain Venture Studio (OEBV), told CoinDesk that R/GA Ventures’ investment came by way of a partnership between the firm and his Portland-based studio. He added McFarlane’s startup was chosen because she managed ICO funds in a “meaningful way.”  “Her fortitude to work through the [bear market] is pretty impressive,” Boyd said.  ICO breakdown  After the completion of the Series A, the Patientory ecosystem will have raised roughly $12.4 million to date, from the ICO to the latest venture capital round.  McFarlane told CoinDesk roughly a third of the ICO funds went toward the nonprofit’s marketing and conference budget, such as recruiting and participating in Dubai’s BlockHealth Summit in April. About 20 percent went toward developing the startup’s app, with seven developers on staff.  She added the remaining 45 percent of the ICO funds are under the nonprofit’s management, predominantly ether reserves along with 5 percent in conservative, traditional investment products.  So far, most of the ICO funds were spent establishing the nonprofit, with three board members, four institutional members and a dozen ambassadors promoting the blockchain solution abroad. Unlike most token-funded nonprofits, the Patientory Association is based in Silicon Valley instead of Switzerland or elsewhere offshore.  Most of the new Series A round will go toward developing the mobile app with more features, McFarlane said. However, any hint of profitability is a future projection at this point.  BlockInterop CEO Gina Malak, who spearheads a complementary token project focused on healthcare apps, told CoinDesk she is a PTOY holder who plans to run a node, pay for Patientory’s blockchain-as-service offerings and collaborate on workshops through the Patientory Association.  Both business leaders are black women entrepreneurs who turned to token sales because, as reported by Fast Company, researchers estimate less than 1 percent of traditional venture capital funding went to black women in 2018. Malak said:  “As an entrepreneur I found tokens sales offer several advantages and could open more doors for funding opportunities.""  Growing a community  So far, Patientory doesn’t have any paying clients. But it does have a slowly growing community of contributors.  With regards to association members, Boardmember Jonathan Fuchs told CoinDesk these members are involved with focus groups to brainstorm compliant solutions for sharing sensitive healthcare data.  “The federal standards for interoperability are in final stages of development,” Fuchs said. “Support groups remain integral to the testing, feedback and implementation of systems’ interoperability capabilities in a very complex and integrated healthcare ecosystem.”  Also along those lines, OEBVS’s Boyd said Patientory is participating in an OEBVS program to explore research opportunities with partners like Oregon Health Science University and ConsenSys.  The startup also has ongoing pilot programs with partners that run their own nodes, including Navicent Health, Moda Health and IrisGuard, the latter of which ran an aid distribution program with the United Nations in 2017 to serve refugees in Jordan. Patientory is also pursuing opportunities with the Dubai Health Authorityhttps://ptoy.org/2019/04/30/blockhealth-summit-by-patientory-association/.  BlockInterop’s Malak described both her own startup and McFarlane’s as “embarking on a similar path.”  Speaking to the benefits of joining the Patientory Association, with access to healthcare industry experts and support groups related to systems compliance, she added:  “I feel that together we have formed a strong strategic alliance that will empower patients and bring them to the center of their healthcare.”  Chrissa McFarlane image via Patientory",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/13/this-crypto-is-worth-less-than-1-cent-vcs-are-betting-millions-on-its-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ee82e1f78cb39d4b9ca9e7e71f051def5b9976d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post published late last week, Richard Laycock deputy director at the DWP's Digital Delivery Shared Platforms, said that improvements are planned across the DWP payments systems to ensure its 20 million customers ""receive their payments on time.""  ""As we move our Payment Services forward they need to be efficient, modern, fast, scalable, flexible, innovative and available 24/7,"" Laycock wrote.  For the updated system, the DWP is investigating various tech trends, including the growing adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT).  ""We are starting to see the first full production [DLT] implementations, such as Santander’s One Pay FX. The benefits include reducing time, cost and failure rate associated with making transactions whilst data is stored on a secure immutable ledger,"" according to Laycock.  The department is also to revamp its payments architecture – to introduce ""the biggest set of changes to the way UK payment schemes process payments in years."" With a rollout planned to start in 2021, the DWP will introduce a common payment message standard and consolidate existing schemes. New ""overlay"" services will also be added, including ""request to pay"" and ""confirmation of payee.""  Open banking – the use of open APIs to allow third-party developers to build apps and services around a banking institution – also offers a way to improve aspects of the DWP's payment services.  Laycock said:  ""I’m keen for us to consider how we can harness the payment innovations coming out of these trends and how we can influence the New Payment Architecture to help shape future of payments across government.""

42382559,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rz2d,1565694035,"Bitcoin's Bulls Now Have a Target of $13.2K, Monthly Chart Suggests","View  Bitcoin charted an ""inside bar"" pattern last month, making $13,200 the level to beat for the bulls.  A convincing move above $13,200 would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,050 seen in April.  A break below $9,049 (July's low) would confirm a bearish inside bar reversal on the monthly chart.  The hourly chart indicates prices could drop below $11,000 in the next 24 hours or so.  The bearish case would weaken if lower-highs pattern on the hourly chart is invalidated with a move above $11,431.      Bitcoin (BTC) now needs to break above $13,200 to revive the stalled bull market, a key monthly chart pattern suggests.  The top cryptocurrency by market value created an ""inside bar"" pattern in July, with the monthly high and low of $13,200 and $9,049, respectively, falling within June's trading range of $13,880 to $7,432.  An inside bar candle is characterized by a higher low and a lower high than the previous candle, and represents an indecisive market or consolidation in a narrowing price range.  A convincing break above the inside bar's high is widely considered a sign of a bullish breakout. As such, July's high of $13,200 is now the level to beat for the bulls.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,220 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.  Monthly and weekly charts  BTC broke into a bull market in April and rose to a 17-month high of $13,880 before creating last month's inside bar candle (above left).  Coming after a notable uptrend, the pattern suggests bullish exhaustion and an impending bullish-to-bearish trend change.  That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC ends the current month below July's low of $9,049.  On the other hand, acceptance above $13,200 (July's high) would signal a continuation of the rally from April's low near $4,050.  The probability of BTC ending the current month above $13,200 would rise if prices print a bullish weekly (Sunday, UTC) close above $12,000.  As can be seen (above right), the cryptocurrency has failed four times in the last seven weeks to find acceptance above $12,000. Many observers believe a weekly close above $12,000 would imply a continuation of the bull market.  While the argument has merit, a stronger confirmation would be a high-volume move above $13,200.  As for the next 24 hours, BTC risks falling below $11,000.  Hourly and daily chart  BTC has created a lower high at the lower edge of a flag pattern (above left) in the last 24 hours, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the flag breakdown – a bearish continuation pattern – confirmed yesterday.  Selling volume is again ticking up, validating the bearish setup, while the relative strength index, too, is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover.  As a result, prices may well drop toward the 5-week moving average, currently at $10,778.  The bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $11,431, invalidating the bearish lower highs setup. In that case, $12,000 could come into play.

42382527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwfR,1565689902,Coinbase Backs $4.3 Million Raise for New Crypto Derivatives Exchange,"A new cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that hasn't yet launched has already won backing from major investors including Coinbase.  Called Blade, the exchange platform is planning to go live in a few weeks with a focus on perpetual swaps, TechCrunch reported Monday.  The firm was founded by Jeff Byun and Henry Lee, who had previously launched a delivery startup that crypto-friendly payments firm Square acquired in part in 2017. The two have now brought some of the same investors in to back their new Blade venture.  Aside from Coinbase, investors in the $4.3 million seed round included SV Angel, A.Capital, Slow Ventures, Twitch.tv co-founder Justin Kan and Quora co-founder Adam D’Angelo.  Blade is taking a focus on perpetuals – a derivative product like a futures contract, but has no expiry or settlement date – because they are “arguably the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency trading,” Byun told TechCrunch.  As well as allowing traders to take a position on the future value of cryptocurrencies against the U.S. dollar, swaps can be used to make bets on the price on one cryptocurrency against another.  Blade hopes to compete against other similar offerings from rival exchanges by offering simple contracts. It's also offering margin and settlement in the stablecoin tether (USDT), as well as leverage as high as 150x on BTC/USD and BTC/KRW.  As the Korean won pair suggests, Blade is targeting the keen crypto trading markets in Asia. U.S. investors will not be allowed to use the platform, due to local regulatory issues.  Byun told TechCrunch:  “It’s kind of a bifurcated market. Either you have exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini or Bitrex that cater to the U.S. market that are highly regulated or the exchanges that cater to the non-U.S. market that are much less regulated, but that’s where most of the volume is.”  Image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/13/coinbase-backs-43-million-raise-for-new-crypto-derivatives-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a1a29dbcd3fd05ff51d267bda06c5a2969f374-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwoF,1565687739,UN Investigating 35 North Korean Military-Funding Cyberattacks,"After a U.N. report recently accused the North Korean regime of carrying out major cyberattacks of banks and crypto exchanges to fund its weapons of mass destruction programs, a longer version of the report has set out the claims in new detail.  As reported on Aug. 6, the earlier confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters – researched by “independent experts” and presented to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee – suggests that North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to collect roughly $2 billion.  The new lengthier version of the report, seen by Associated Press, sets out that North Korea may have carried out at least 35 hacks in 17 countries and that the U.S. experts are investigating.  The UN says that South Korea bore the brunt of the efforts, having suffered 10 attacks. The nation's Bithumb cryptocurrency exchange is said to have been hacked at least four times.  India came next with three cyberattacks, while Bangladesh and Chile each had two attacks. Thirteen nations suffered one attack each, listed in the report as: Costa Rica, Gambia, Guatemala, Kuwait, Liberia, Malaysia, Malta, Nigeria, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia and Vietnam.  The report further describes North Korea's modus operandi, saying that the nation employs three ""low risk and high yield"" methods to grab illicit gains.  As well as targeting crypto exchanges and users, North Korea's hacking experts also carry out attacks through the SWIFT bank messaging network, “with bank employee computers and infrastructure accessed to send fraudulent messages and destroy evidence.”  In one attack, the hackers managed to take over the ATM network for an entire nation and force 10,000 payments to alleged North Korean operatives.

Calling data ""the next oil,"" Vavilov said that 98 percent of all data is just sitting waiting to be analyzed.  While giving away few details, he added that the data analyses would utilize blockchain. “We also need to trust that data so that’s where blockchain comes in,” Vavilov said.  Bitfury  offers a number of blockchain services, as well as making computer and crypto mining hardware and running crypto mining data centers.  Last November, Bitfury closed an $80 million funding round led by venture capital firm Korelya Capital. Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Macquarie Capital, Dentsu Inc., Armat Group and others, also participated.  A month prior, the firm was said by Bloomberg sources to be considering holding an initial public offering (IPO) via a stock exchange listing in Amsterdam, London or Hong Kong. The sources said Bitfury may be valued as high as $3 billion–$5 billion if it goes public within the next two years.  Bitfury’s AI division is currently in “research mode,” according to Vavilov, with a clearer vision of its potential use cases and products expected at the end of the year or early 2020.

42382539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwuX,1565683201,60 Latin American Banks Can Now Use Bitcoin for Cross-Border Payments,"A leading bank technology provider in Latin America is partnering with cryptocurrency exchange Bitex to facilitate cross-border payments over the bitcoin blockchain.  “The integration of Bitex into Bantotal program represents a major step in the breakthrough of blockchain technology in banking,” said Bitex Chief Marketing Officer Manuel Beaudroit.  Bantotal is a core banking service provider based in Uruguay that services over 60 different financial institutions across 14 different countries. According to a Bantotal spokesperson, an estimated 20 million people use Bantotal’s money management services.  “Bantotal is one of the biggest banking providers in Latin America and is a huge player not just in Latin American but the greater Pacific,” said Sebastián Olivera, founder of the Uruguayan Fintech Chamber. “For me, Bitex provides a great solution for payments and they will be boosted by the structure and name of Bantotal.”  The partnership means that Bantotal clients will be able to access Bitex services in a marketplace of other traditional financial services that Bantotal offers through its BDevelopershttp://www.bantotal.com/developers/en/index.html program.  “With this technology, banks can have access to an API and have control of the whole process of [cross-border] payment with visibility and reliability on the bitcoin blockchain,” said Beaudroit.  Calling it a “quantum leap” forward for local banks in Latin America, Beaudroit said that average fees associated with cross-border payments are up to five times cheaper using Bitex than international wire transfers.  What’s more, these transfers are significantly faster, according to Beaudroit, who said payment times for exporters between Argentina and Paraguay in one instance last February dropped from one month to one hour after switching to Bitex’s cross-border payment services.  The partnership in the eyes of competitors such as Stellar, which also specializes in cross-border payments leveraging its own blockchain network, is seen as a positive signal.  Lisa Nestor, the Stellar Development Foundation’s director of partnerships, told CoinDesk:  “We think this announcement further validates the value financial institutions are recognizing in digital assets and distributed ledger technology for executing core banking activities, like international payments. It's also no coincidence these product partnerships are being launched in the [Latin American] market where cross-border payments, even in neighboring nations, can be slow and expensive.”  How Bitex works  Bitex essentially acts as a middleman for national and regional banks to convert fiat payments into bitcoin then back into fiat, as opposed to completing multiple fiat-to-fiat conversions.  “If I want to do a payment from Argentina to Chile, I don’t need to buy dollars with the Argentinian pesos then transfer the dollars to the U.S. then move the dollars to Chile and exchange them into Chilean pesos,” said Beaudroit. “I can just send a payment from Argentina to Chile directly [using bitcoin].”  Calling it a system of “peer-to-peer banking,” Beaudroit explained that Bitex handles the conversion of local currencies into and from bitcoin, as well as, its ultimate dispersion into regional or national bank accounts.  Normally, this process of transferring money across borders with local banks in Latin American can take anywhere from 48 to 96 hours depending on the specific bank branch and financial intermediaries used, according to Leo Elduayen, vice president of non-profit Bitcoin Argentina and founder of blockchain startup Koibanx.  Elduayen described the full process of cross-border payments using Bitex as an end-to-end solution for banks, saying:  “The purchase and [transfer] of bitcoin, Bitex does it all on your behalf. You as a user just send the money and Bitex takes care of the rest for you.”  ‘A good first step’  With the Bantotal partnership, Elduayen suspects that accessibility to Bitex services for consumers in Latin American will dramatically increase though there are a number of hurdles still left “to get banks on board.”  To this, Olivera said that both know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) legislation is still a major issue for banks when it comes to using the bitcoin blockchain.  Federico Ast, CEO of Buenos Aires-based arbitration startup Kleros, agreed – adding that regulatory uncertainty and seeing cryptocurrencies “as a fad” are still major barriers to entry for Latin American banks.  “I have to be honest. I think this is just the first conversation,” said Olivera. “It’s too early to say whether banks will choose to operate with Bitex but it’s a good first step.”  Rebuilding trust  At the very least, both Ast and Olivera see this partnership between Bantotal and Bitex as an opportunity to expose consumers in Latin American to the benefits of blockchain technology and help rebuild consumer trust in existing financial institutions.  “Historically, Latin America has had weak financial systems,” said Ast. “There's a history of bank runs with some sad highlights of confiscation of people's saving (e.g., Argentina in 2001). … This agreement will lead to lower costs for consumers and higher financial inclusion.”  Bitex’s Beaudroit has high hopes this partnership will also contributed to increasing the national GDPs of Latin American countries by enabling more commerce to flow “in a peer-to-peer fashion.”  In this way, Santiago Siri, founder of digital governance startup Democracy Earth and advisor to Bitex, said the work of Bitex went far beyond simply being a crypto exchange platform.  Said Siri:  “It’s an ideal partner for banks to use bitcoin … as a way of connecting banks in a way that is not very common in the industry yet is fundamental for markets like Latin America.”  Peruvian dance image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/13/60-latin-american-banks-can-now-use-bitcoin-for-cross-border-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5151673946a06f5ff9c1c6432908ce05a54b9524-1000x679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CloudFormation, part of the web services arm of the e-commerce giant, will support the company’s blockchain management system. The service will assist in “creating and configuring networks, members, and peer nodes.”  Instead of setting up blockchain environments and applications by hand, clients can build a template and use it to create all of the necessary resources, collectively known as a CloudFormation stack.  Free to clients of Amazon Web Services, CloudFormation acts as a replication and scaling tool between a client's web service applications, making it easier to build new blockchain networks.  The company writes in a statement published August 12:  “With CloudFormation support for Managed Blockchain, you can create new blockchain networks and define network configurations, create a member and join an existing network, and describe member and network details such as voting policies.”  The idea is that managed blockchains will become even more scalable. This model removes opportunities for manual error, increases efficiency, and ensures consistent configurations over time.  Amazon released the service three months ago. AT&T, Nestle, Accenture are counted as clients.  According to the company, “Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions.”  Last week, Amazon published a job posting that suggests it is building ways to use blockchain for its advertisement business.
