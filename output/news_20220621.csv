The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained ground for a third consecutive day, jumping past $21,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin was recently trading at about $20,600, up about 1% and far removed from the two-year low of under $18,000 it hit on Saturday.  Still, analysts were pessimistic about the rally's staying power, noting a rise in volatility perhaps tied to large investors buying on price dips and citing troubling underlying conditions that include global turbulence, rising prices and stress about a possible recession. All of that has plagued crypto markets for the past eight months. Investors are scared, and the occasional surge notwithstanding, may have assumed a defensive crouch until evidence emerges that the economy is on a longer upturn, analysts say.  Last month's collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin (UST) and more recent fiascos involving the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Celsius and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows have further stoked investors' fears.  ""Last week was bad,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital investment management firm Arca, told CNBC. ""It was not unprecedented in the sense that we've had multiple 30% to 50% moves in short periods of time. But it was historically bad in the sense that it was the first time it was happening in conjunction with bad things happening everywhere else.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently trading at $1,130, up 1.7%. Other major altcoins were in the green, with DOGE up 10% and SOL rising more than 5%.  Cryptos' price increases dovetailed with equity markets, which rose amid investors' likely temporary return to riskier assets. The tech-focused Nasdaq climbed 2.5%, while the S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, rose by nearly the same.  Still, in a Monday report, Goldman Sachs economists upped the likelihood of a recession to 30% from their previous prediction of 15%. Investors will be nervously watching Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Powell has been adamant about the Fed's more aggressive moves to tame U.S. inflation in raising interest rates and reducing liquidity in the economy.  Arca's Dorman said that he expects crypto investors to continue ""to hunker down,"" and that will translate to ""less growth from growth companies in the [crypto] space, in hiring and new product launches."" Last week, as bitcoin's price sank, investors redeemed a net $5.8 million from short bitcoin funds in the seven days through June 17, crypto asset manager CoinShares wrote Monday in a report. (A ""short"" position in financial markets is a bet on a price decline.)  Yet Dorman noted that the current crash differs significantly from earlier steep downturns in crypto's history because of the range of products and services now available. ""I think people are going to flock to DeFi much faster than anyone expected because it holds up,"" he said. He was sanguine about the prospects of a recovery this year.  ""My guess would be we probably start to see higher prices in the second half of this year,"" he said. ""There really isn't a lot of carnage in the applications themselves.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,764 +2.4%  DJIA: 30,530 +2.1%  Nasdaq: 11,069 +2.5%  Gold: $1,833 -0.3%  Insights  USDC's ‘Flippening’ of USDT and the Continuation of the Stablecoin Bear Market  Tether (USDT) has been of particular interest to the crypto industry after last month's collapse of LUNA, because like with UST, there has been a lot of skepticism about what exactly is backing it. Interest in the reserves that back USDT isn’t new, but the general crisis of confidence in crypto has placed more pressure on USDT’s tenuous peg.  Recently, the number of transactions on USDC surpassed those on USDT. For long-time, stablecoin war observers, that's a substantial ""flippening."" USDT’s share of the supply of stablecoins in smart contracts is dropping fast. What began at around 20% in January is now dipping to 13%. But what is unexpected is that USDC, which doesn’t have the same questions about its reserves as they are properly held in trust, is also seeing its price drop.  This is largely a product of the primary use case for stablecoins, DeFi platforms have seen their locked-in value decline significantly since the beginning of the year. What was once a $236 billion market when the year began, according to DeFiLlama, now has only $74 billion locked in as traders flee.  With that comes a big decline in the number of active addresses on both USDT and USDC, which is to be expected because the liquidity contributed to these protocols is often in stablecoins.  But again, all this seems to be a problem localized in the worlds of DeFi and stablecoins. Even as the price of bitcoin declines as institutions and miners sell, retail investors continues to buy what they can with the number of wallets containing more than 0.1 BTC rising from 3.4 million as of May 16 to around 3.6 million by Tuesday, according to Glassnode data.  So while there might be trouble in the land of digitized dollars and DeFi, there’s still confidence in digital gold (though its analog version might have been a better investment).

42374589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvxEsT,1655843522,Republicans Seek to Counter Effort to Curtail Crypto Mining,"Republican lawmakers are trying to slam the brakes on any hasty decisions the Environmental Protection Agency may consider to address potential harm from cryptocurrency mining businesses, urging the regulator to study the claims before taking action.  More than a dozen Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee signed a letter last week to EPA chief Michael Regan that was meant to counter a message from Democrats sent in April. The Democrats – a list of progressives that includes Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who leads a subcommittee within the Natural Resources Committee – had warned about climate risks and called for more scrutiny, and the Republicans expressed more support for the industry.  Environmental regulators should seek “a comprehensive analysis as it relates to understanding the potential environmental effects of digital asset mining,” according to the letter, which was signed by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), one of the authors of new legislation to regulate crypto, and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking Republican on the Financial Services Committee, along with three other senators and nine members of Congress. They insisted the U.S. government shouldn’t do anything to disrupt American leadership in the sector.  In the end, both camps are asking the EPA to look more closely, though their aims are far apart.  The Republican letter points out that “a substantial portion of digital asset miners’ energy use is based on renewable sources,” and that many of the mining operations “use other power sources, like natural gas, that may otherwise go unused.” And it argues that the feds have no right to pick the types of technology that should be granted favor.  That’s a jab at the Democrats, who contend that the government should note proof-of-stake mining technology as potentially having “99.99% lower energy demands” to validate transactions.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/21/us-republicans-seek-to-counter-effort-to-curtail-crypto-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6965c1fd812c2b25124e4bd9517e830f39c5a22-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin and ether (ETH) were both recently up about 5%, with bitcoin trading at $21,158.43 and ether at $1,146.41 on Tuesday afternoon.  Stocks also rose as part of a wider rebound in assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.88%, and the S&P 500, which had its worst week since 2020 last week, gained 2.74%.  Although the increases on Tuesday might cause some relief for traders after bitcoin saw its most volatile week since May 2021 last week, according to data from Arcane Research, many experts warn that the worst isn’t over.  “The bear market will not be over until recession arrives or the risk of one is extinguished,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients.  “This could be a short-term bounce. Longer term, I’d be concerned that there could be some more selling out there,” Tuttle Capital Management CEO and Chief Investment Officer Matthew Tuttle said on CoinDesk TV.  Smaller altcoins also rallied on Tuesday. Elrond (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Helium (HNT) were among the winners, surging by as much as 51%.  Smaller crypto assets by market cap have fared better than bitcoin this month, although they have also been deep in the red. One small-cap index, which tracks the performance of the 50 smallest crypto assets, fell 27%, according to a report by Arcane Research. Bitcoin, which dropped as much as 35%, underperformed all indexes in June.  “It's a long time since we saw such strong performances from the smaller coins,” the report stated. “It’s highly unusual to see small caps performing better than bitcoin in a falling market.”  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $21156, +5.45%    ●Ether (ETH): $1146, +4.02%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,776.74, +2.77%    ●Gold: $1834 per troy ounce, +NaN%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.31%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

'Enormous Outflows' From Largest Bitcoin ETF May Have Triggered BTC Crash  By Krisztian Sandor  The world's largest bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund lost half of its assets under management last Friday, which might have exacerbated bitcoin’s crash on Saturday.  The Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw an outflow of 24,510 bitcoins on Friday, the most severe redemption in a single day since the fund made its debut on the Canadian Stock Exchange in April 2021, according to the Norway-based Arcane Research.  The outflows mean that the fund had to sell about $500 million in BTC at Friday’s price, adding to the selling pressure in an already shaky crypto market, Arcane wrote in a report.  “The enormous outflows are likely caused by a forced seller in a huge liquidation,” Arcane analyst Vetle Lunde wrote. “The forced selling of the 24,000 BTC could have triggered BTC’s move down towards $17,600 this weekend.”  Read the full story here.

42421533,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYZR,1655842317,Gaming Out DeFi’s Regulated Future,"Among the blockchain ecosystem's biggest uncertainties is the type and amount of regulation that will exist in the future. The only thing that seems sure is that more and more compliance challenges are coming for the industry. As I’ve written in the past, this is mostly a good thing. Fair rules and a level playing field will unlock a huge amount of institutional capital that wants to get into this exciting new ecosystem.  The question people must ask, however, is less “When?” and more “How much?” Fully and equally applying all the rules that exist for the current financial system for the blockchain ecosystem might be quite difficult. For example, the current system assumes that banks know quite a bit about their customers and that they can share that information without disclosing it to the public, thereby protecting individual privacy.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Blockchains don't natively support privacy, though there are tools and workarounds that are maturing fast. Additionally, blockchain ecosystems have financial tools in them that do not directly have analogues in the existing financial world. If you are transacting with a decentralized, automated liquidity pool that includes assets from thousands of different users, who is your counterparty?  Politics, the very practical kind, also plays a part in the development of regulation. What would happen if transacting in cryptocurrencies or digital tokens suddenly became illegal or so impractical as to make these digital assets illiquid? This might feel a lot like confiscation to the 10%-20% of the population that already own these assets.  In fact, from player pianos to ride-sharing, it’s rare that new technologies get held to the same business models and constraints as legacy incumbents. This is a pattern that has repeated itself over and over.  Napster and BitTorrent enabled music and video piracy at a large scale. Even though much of the sharing being done was obviously illegal, we have never gone back to buying CDs or paying full price for albums. A la carte singles and music, as well as video subscriptions, have transformed the media landscape.  Read More: What Is DeFi?  The same happened with ride-sharing services. Taxi firms were always effective lobbyists blocking lots of competition up to and including mass transit to and from the airport in many American cities, but ride-sharing services with customer and driver ratings are immensely popular. In many cities, service standards went up, and prices went down with their introduction.  New York City is a prime example: Before ride-sharing, taxi medallions were worth up to $1 million. Today, even though ride-sharing is “fully regulated,” taxi medallions have never recovered their value. Today, they’re worth nearly 80% less than they were at their peak in 2013.  Accommodation, not annihilation  Regulation is coming for crypto and blockchain, but the precedents from radio and music to ride-sharing all point to accommodation, not annihilation. Most importantly, historically, accommodation has not restored previous incumbents to their positions of power.  In this respect, the current period of regulatory uncertainty means that things are likely stacked against the future of the finance industry’s incumbent leaders. First, it’s likely that new players will face a lower bar for their new products than existing players faced. This means that they will have lower costs and never have to develop some of the complex legacy systems that are currently required. Secondly, it also means that new players can take more risks than existing players.  For existing players in the traditional financial services business, the relationship with regulators is complex and often covers many areas. Angering regulators in one area could have consequences in others, where regulations and penalties are much clearer. For a startup, the math is simpler.  Read More: Tackling the Inflation Misinformation Machine  No product means having no revenue and no future, and that’s bad, but it’s not any worse than losing an enforcement case in court to a regulator and going out of business. So, the business bias will be toward risk-taking. Indeed, some entrants have already started suing regulators for failing to respond to applications in a timely manner.  While the path for startups may be clearer and simpler, the path for incumbents is more complex. So far, we see companies pursuing multiple different options. One is to take a partial but noncontrolling stake in a crypto-native firm, giving exposure without taking direct responsibility. Another is to build a business in a jurisdiction with more accommodating regulators and hope that enough experience and skill accumulates to support a quick globalization. And lastly, there’s the option to build a parallel organization in a separate legal entity and try to firewall off the risk and operations.  So far, there’s no clear winning strategy, but the adoption of these different approaches reflects the increasing urgency with which incumbents view the market and their fears about long-term customer losses.

Investors redeemed a net $5.8 million from short bitcoin funds in the seven days through June 17, the crypto asset manager CoinShares wrote Monday in a report. (A ""short"" position in financial markets is a bet on a price decline.) At the beginning of the week, assets under management (AUM) in these funds had hit an all-time high of $64 million.  The retreat from the short bitcoin funds might be ""suggesting negative sentiment is close to its peak,"" CoinShares said.  Overall, digital-asset investment products saw net outflows of $39 million last week, according to CoinShares. Total AUM dipped to $36.3 billion, the lowest since February 2021.  Underscoring the notion that some investors were buying the dip, bitcoin funds saw inflows totaling $28 million.  Funds focused on ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, suffered an 11th straight week of outflows, partly driven by investor worries about the Ethereum merge. ETH outflows totaled $70 million last week and brought year-to-date outflows to $459 million.

42374583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvxEmB,1655841269,'Enormous Outflows' From Largest Bitcoin ETF May Have Triggered BTC Crash,"The world's largest bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund lost half of its assets under management last Friday, which might have exacerbated bitcoin’s crash on Saturday.  The Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw an outflow of 24,510 bitcoins on Friday, the most severe redemption in a single day since the fund made its debut on the Canadian Stock Exchange in April 2021, according to the Norway-based Arcane Research.  The outflows mean that the fund had to sell about $500 million in BTC at Friday’s price, adding to the selling pressure in an already shaky crypto market, Arcane wrote in a report.  “The enormous outflows are likely caused by a forced seller in a huge liquidation,” Arcane analyst Vetle Lunde wrote. “The forced selling of the 24,000 BTC could have triggered BTC’s move down towards $17,600 this weekend.”  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $20,000 on Saturday, tumbling to as low as $17,678. Traders were rattled by fears of crypto industry insolvencies, as crypto lender Celsius Network halted client withdrawals, BlockFi sought additional financing and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital confirmed it suffered heavy losses.  The weekend's price action also marked the first time that the largest cryptocurrency had fallen below its previous cycle’s all-time high, notched in December 2017, of $19,783.  ProShares Futures ETF takes over as largest  Bitcoin ETFs track the value of bitcoin and provide a way to invest in the largest cryptocurrency without dealing directly with crypto; they can be bought, sold and traded on traditional stock market exchanges instead of on cryptocurrency trading platforms. ETFs actively add and sell bitcoin to match investors investing in and redeeming from the fund.  The Purpose Bitcoin ETF was by far the largest bitcoin-focused exchange-traded product, managing almost 48,000 bitcoins before Friday’s redemptions. Now, the fund holds only about 23,300 BTC.  Another bitcoin-focused fund, the 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF, suffered large outflows last month, selling 7,401 BTC of its holdings.  As a result of last week’s outflows, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF lost its top spot to the New York Stock Exchange-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF, which holds bitcoin futures instead of spot bitcoin.  BITO saw its second-largest net inflows last week since its launch last October, leading the fund's bitcoin exposure to grow by the equivalent of 4,115 BTC. Data shows that the fund manages $668 million in assets, equating to about 31,500 BTC.  The contrast suggests that “at least some U.S. investors are eyeballing the current sell-off in BTC as an attractive point of entry, taking advantage of forced sellers,” for a short-term relief rally, Lunde wrote in the Arcane Research report.  Overall, crypto funds that manage bitcoin raked in $28 million in inflows last week, seemingly benefitting from the weak prices, crypto fund provider CoinShares reported Monday.  “Opinion amongst investors is extremely polarized, with some seeing this as a great buying opportunity, while others are spooked, liquidating positions,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CoinDesk in an email. “Fund flows are likely to remain mixed.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/21/enormous-outflows-from-largest-bitcoin-etf-may-have-triggered-btc-crash,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42411792,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzuo,1655840232,Crypto Crash vs. Correction: What's the Difference?,"When the overall crypto market declines, it’s common to see the terms “crash” and “correction” used more or less interchangeably. The two words, however, actually mean different things.  Here's a guide to distinguish the difference between a crypto crash and correction.  See Also: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  What defines a crypto crash  A crash is widely regarded in traditional finance as a drop of over 10% in price over the course of a single day.  These are often fueled by impactful, sudden changes in the crypto market that cause panicked investors to exit en masse.  From a technical perspective, we can use charts to visualize and define a crash. In the finance and crypto markets, technical analysts tend to use moving averages on a chart.  In the case of a crypto crash, red flags go up if assets are seeing high selling volume and the price is closing below either the 50-day moving average or the 200-day moving average. If you look at the chart below, bitcoin (BTC) showed signs of the coming crash on Feb. 26, 2020. You can see it had higher than average selling volume while the price closed below the 50-day moving average.  March 12, 2020, indicated by the big red candlestick on the far right of the chart below, is the infamous “Black Thursday” crash. Prices fell 40%, from $7,969.90 to $4,776.59, following the World Health Organization's declaring of the coronavirus a global pandemic     In the chart below, we see ether (ETH) crashing. Ether closed below the 50-day moving average several times before crashing on Dec. 4, 2021.  These two examples of BTC and ETH crashing correlated with many other cryptocurrencies crashing. We can confirm that correlation and that the overall crypto market crashed on both Feb. 26, 2020 and Dec. 4, 2021 by using TradingView's TOTAL chart, which captures the price movements of the overall crypto market, as shown in the charts below.  These two examples show crashes occurring in conjunction with a moving average and high selling volume, but we also recognize the close price correlation of other cryptocurrencies with bitcoin and ether.  Read more: Crypto Flash Crashes: What You Need to Know  While technical factors can have dramatic effects on bitcoin and ether, large crashes seem to be the results of fundamental circumstances such as macroeconomic events, major company announcements and sudden changes to international regulations and policies.  The largest crash ever recorded on bitcoin’s chart took place on April 10, 2013, shortly after the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) shut down crypto exchange Bitfloor and announced bitcoin exchanges needed to register as “money transmitters.” Bitcoin prices collapsed over 73.1% in 24 hours, according to Bitstamp data, from a height of $259.34 to a low of $70.  During more recent times, the infamous “Black Thursday” crash of March 12, 2020, takes the top spot as the biggest crash after prices fell 40% from $7,969.90 to $4,776.59, after the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus is a global pandemic.  What is a crypto correction?  A correction is characterized by a gradual decline where prices drop more than 10% over the course of several days.  These usually indicate bullish traders have become exhausted and need time to consolidate and recover. Exhaustion occurs when a majority of buyers have bought the underlying asset and there are no more new buyers appearing to support the uptrend. If sell orders continue to pile in without anyone on the other side of the order book buying them, prices start to fall.  Let’s look at another chart demonstrating a correction between December 2020 and March 2021, which was a period of bullish price action. On the chart below, there are two examples of a correction. Neither correction closes below the 50-day moving average. In fact, the first correction on the chart crosses the 50-day moving average, but it doesn't close below the 50-day moving average.  We can compare the chart above with the ticker symbol, TOTAL, from TradingView to see that the price movement of the crypto market is similar to that of bitcoin as well.  The chart above shows the first correction to the left as a rather shallow correction compared with that of bitcoin’s during the same time period.  From a charting perspective, we see that price-movement correlation among the crypto market, bitcoin and ether plays an important role in defining the start of a crash.  From a fundamental point of view, corrections can be influenced by minor events but tend to be initiated by technical factors such as buyers running into strong resistance levels, depleting trading volume and negative discrepancies between bitcoin’s price and indicators that measure its momentum like the relative strength index (RSI).  Read more: 3 Signals a Crypto Crash May Be Coming, According to Experts  Understanding crypto volatility  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known for being highly volatile assets. That means prices tend to fluctuate significantly over a relatively short period of time compared with other assets. It’s also why many traditional investors, including Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn, consider it a highly risky investment.  According to recent data, bitcoin’s one-year volatility stands at 46.9% – significantly higher than the next most volatile assets and asset classes, which are oil at 13.2%, U.S. stocks at 5.87% and U.S. real estate at 6.60%.  While this high volatility has its upsides, particularly during bullish cycles where prices can rise dramatically, it also means prices crash and correct on a frequent basis.  To further understand volatility, volume is also an important metric to watch. You can use a volume indicator that is a common indicator across charting platforms. Above-average selling with high volatility raises a red flag because it is one of two signals defining a crash.  If we look at our previous chart, we see price volatility with above-average selling volume.  Knowing which downtrends are corrections and which ones are crashes can help you to better understand the market and how bitcoin traders react to certain fundamental and technical factors. In some events, crashes can foreshadow the arrival of a bear market and a prolonged period of cascading prices, whereas corrections can often be a sign of a healthy uptrend recovering to a support level before retesting a former high.  So the next time you see bitcoin prices dip into the red, you should be able to tell if there’s a correction taking place or a crash and whether the market is going through a healthy recovery or likely reacting to a sudden announcement.

42421542,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYfd,1655838175,Is Sam Bankman-Fried a Modern-Day Robber Baron?,"FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is like a modern day robber baron in at least one way. As the digital asset industry tumbles downward in fits and starts, the titan of industry who sometimes skips lacing his shoes is thinking about ways to prevent calamity – and perhaps profit.  This weekend, Bankman-Fried discussed the “responsibility” he feels to bail out crypto firms in crisis. He repeated the sentiment on Twitter, where he said the principal concern is mitigating retail losses, disclosing risks and preventing bad debts from spreading across the sector.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “I do feel like we have a responsibility to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion,” Bankman-Fried told NPR. ""Even if we weren't the ones who caused it, or weren't involved in it. I think that's what's healthy for the ecosystem, and I want to do what can help it grow and thrive.""  There’s a historical analogy here: J.P. Morgan, a leading banker in the time before the Federal Reserve, twice stepped in to prevent economic collapses.  During the panic of 1893, after a period of intense speculation and consolidation in the emerging railroad and banking industries, Morgan lent the Federal Treasury $65 million in gold to reup its dwindling reserves and firm up faith in the banking system.  Then, amid the financial crisis of 1907, Morgan pledged his own capital and led a coalition of wealthy financiers to backstop failing banks, stock exchanges and trust companies. Historians think Morgan’s actions prevented a much deeper recession at a time when the federal government had little ability to manage economic crises.  Bankman-Fried, though perhaps less stylish than his Gilded Age forebears, might see a similar historical role to play. Today, FTX supplied the struggling crypto lender BlockFi with $250 million in credit. Last week, Bankman-Fried’s trading outfit Alameda Research bailed out crypto broker Voyager Digital.  Over the years, he’s acquired firms, like Liquid, that would have gone under following hacks and has contributed to bailout funds for attacked protocols and projects. Of course, these lifelines aren’t simply altruistic, but also a way for FTX to expand.  Bankman-Fried is a self-proclaimed “effective altruist,” or capitalist who believes in earning as much as possible to give as much back. It’s unclear whether his actions now fall in the former or latter camps: Perhaps he’s intervening today to profit tomorrow.  Crypto is often compared to the wildcat banking era, a time when financial institutions were essentially able to print their own money and play by their own rules. Though there have been attempts to work with governments to achieve “regulatory clarity,” crypto sometimes seems to fall outside the norms and safety nets established in the traditional financial sector.  In recent days, some of the biggest players in the crypto industry including Coinbase, Crypto.com and Gemini have announced layoffs. Influential hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital appear to be insolvent, while major lenders Celsius and Babel Finance have paused customer withdrawals. It’s impossible to know the knock-on effects if any of these firms falter.  See also: Are Coinbase's Layoffs a Sign of Crypto Winter? | The Node  Bankman-Fried clarified on Twitter that his role is not to save individual firms, necessarily. His own firm is slowing hiring, and reportedly pulled out of talks to advertise on the MLB’s Los Angeles Angels jerseys.  Crypto is supposed to be guided by certain core principles including financial transparency and free markets. Perhaps the most important is the idea that autonomous code, not humans, should determine winners and losers in markets – ensuring that everyone plays by the same rules.  So is there a moral hazard in Bankman-Fried stepping in, even if he’s bypassing the guarantees of the Fed? Despite its lofty ambitions, crypto is racked with scams, insider trading and a culture of backroom deals.  Today, the firms that seem at the greatest risk of default are those that are primarily reproducing the worst aspects of the legacy financial system – all without consumer protections. Celsius and Three Arrows were taking risky bets with client funds. And centralized exchanges are black boxes.  While some on-chain, community-governed protocols seem to be faring better, that doesn’t make them a perfect solution. This weekend, developers of the lending protocol Solend “voted” to commandeer a highly leveraged user’s wallet to lessen the effects of an expected margin call. A DAO was formed and the transactions were on-chain, but it’s striking that this was ever a possible course of action.  If crypto learns anything from the ongoing market reckoning, let it be that its only real hope in breaking away from the convoluted, easily corrupted legacy financial system is in real decentralization. Open protocols cannot prevent bad actors, but can provide the necessary information for investors to make their own decisions.  In his interview with NPR, Bankman-Fried noted that the “core driver” of the market sell-off “had been the Fed.” The largest interest-rate hike since 1994 – an attempt to quell inflation it may have accelerated and failed to predict – is causing markets to puke capital.  See also: The Bright Side of Crypto Winter | The Node  Though he isn’t all doom and gloom, perhaps seeing himself in the American institution, he noted how the central bank is ""caught between a rock and a hard place.""  Progressive politicians of Morgan’s day were driven to create the Fed in part after witnessing Morgan and his peers’ influence in the economy. Despite his altruistic intentions, the Pujo Committee feared that Morgan could influence markets for his own gain.  For his part, Bankman-Fried is amenable to working with regulators. He’s said he’d spend upward of $1 billion in political contributions in part to earn officials’ ears. Changes need to be made, especially if crypto’s largest players are just going to create a worse banking system.  But the real change, challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry will happen at the protocol level – not directed by any one person.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/21/is-sam-bankman-fried-a-modern-day-robber-baron,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/251d99b4cc23a4ea87bf5fc278c96714d9ae5692-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is in the nature of things.  Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, New York-based blockchain software company.  Yes, the crypto markets have meme lords, trolls, psyops, internet culture and Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs). There have always been flags and stories, narratives and uniforms. Our Web3 voice and uniforms are special and unique, and so were the suits and ties that Wall Street wore in 1987 on Black Monday, as were the t-shirts of the early internet as America went online.  But even as creative destruction brings tragedy to people’s lives, there are things to see and learn. Everyone, and I mean everyone, will create stories and reasons for what has happened, and what it means, including me.  The call for regulation will – of course – grow stronger than ever as stablecoins, shadow banks and levered hedge funds wipe out the consumer. The call for rebuilding will intensify, largely from the people looking to deploy sidelined capital. Some will point to Austrian economics and personal responsibility and dig in politically.  Read More: Crypto Market Crash Leads to $1B in Liquidations  Then we will calm down, get bored and forget and repeat things again. The person is a cell, and the crowd is a super organism. There is only so much anyone can do to resist the corpus of which they are a part. And there is no good evidence that we should resist. No Luddite ended up correct in the face of permanent technological change reformatting the nature of human society. But perhaps they were happy about it.  A bright side  If you want a silver lining – and I do – this is where to look. Is there creativity and innovation, among the swirling chaos of capital loss? Is it all recursive financial engineering, or is there some underlying operating economy and progress in the architecture of the world?  This is where we can see the big difference between now and the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) collapse because you’ve been there before, too. Then, there were large amounts of money raised for early-stage venture pitch decks. Billions were raised for promises of things laid out on paper and never actually built or used. It was a collapse of the idea space, catalyzed by regulatory pressure on the token fundraising mechanism.  Fundraising is not the actual thing – if anything it is a liability to your investors before you build. Further, there was very little in terms of a Web3 economy. Ideas about how to organize in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or experiments with NFTs existed, but nobody was earning a living the way artists can this time around.  I am instead reminded of my time in 2008 at Lehman Brothers. We had watched Bear Stearns collapse and be sold in a fire sale, and watched for who would be next. Lehman? Morgan Stanley? Today, the names are different. Celsius? Three Arrows Capital (3AC)? Or rewind back some more. Long Term Capital Management? Lehman went under when its counterparties refused to lend to it because of the perception of its over levered and underwater balance sheet. This was a sacrifice to the god of moral hazard. Every investment bank was sitting on the same exposure.  Innovation endures  The 2022 crypto downturn looks less like a failure to deliver on the promises of an innovative technology, and more like a traditional financial deleveraging across an asset class. The words that people use, like ""a run on the bank"" or ""insolvent,"" are the same that you would apply to a functioning but overheated financial sector.  Read More: FUD or Facts? Terra, Celsius Show Value of Asking Questions  Further, crypto is far more correlated and integrated into the overall macro economy, so the spillover from the Fed raising rates, thereby creating a risk-off environment and tanking tech and crypto valuations, is happening in a way that would not in 2018. We made it to the institutional world, anon.  I’m definitely not saying Web3 is working flawlessly or fully mainstream. Rather, I am pointing to a systemic financial crunch that has global economic structural causes. Yes, there are bad faith actors who engage in ""rug pulls"" and scam, and there are hackers and thieves that break into the equivalent of digital banks. The price collapse is exposing their grift, and in the long run, their names won’t matter other than examples to bookmark a wiggle in a chart.  The machines and robots we are building in Web3, however, are functioning even if their total value locked (TVL) number melts down. That was not true for Lehman, Enron and other centralized corporate entities, whose bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations took years and years to unwind.  Firms, people and DAOs that survive these financial turns change their mental models. Treasuries should not be kept entirely in a proprietary token. Risk management matters most when everyone is ecstatic. Valuation multiples aren’t fundamentals. Leverage accelerates rates of change in both directions. These things are easy to say, but hard to do. Good thing we have no choice but to adapt because here is where we are.

After a weekend where bitcoin saw $7.3 billion in realized losses, the largest cryptocurrency erased all weekend losses and was recently up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours to $21,206.  “This recovery removes some of the extreme oversold nature of the cryptocurrency,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro. “Still, it will be too early to talk about a long-term reversal: All negative fundamentals remain. Until sharp monetary policy tightening becomes the norm, financial market pressures can quickly negate bounces in cryptocurrencies.”  Despite small recoveries in traditional markets following the Juneteenth holiday market closures on Monday, Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for Oanda, advises against becoming too comfortable with market gains.  “Everyone is hunting for the bottom, but there’s a huge cloud of uncertainty over the outlook and the data isn’t yet showing any encouraging signs,” Erlam wrote in a newsletter. “Recession is increasingly becoming the base case, and so equities are vulnerable to further losses.  Tuttle Capital Management CEO and Chief Investment Officer Matthew Tuttle also noted bitcoin’s correlation to equity markets and said that “the stock market really stinks.”  “Stocks are in a bear market,” Tuttle said. “I can't imagine bitcoin getting back up to $60,000 while stocks are still being sold.”  The S&P 500 was recently up 2.61%, and the Nasdaq was up 2.5%.

There has been a steep decline in the price of digital assets. Such has been the meltdown in that the entire market cap has fallen under $1 trillion, which surpassed the $3 trillion mark at the peak of the bull cycle. Being a nascent market means high volatility is a common phenomenon at this stage of growth. That said, this volatility has made crypto so attractive to investors and speculators. However, volatility doesn&apos;t always mean just a significant upside but also a remarkable downside. And that&apos;s what we are seeing in this fourth crypto cycle, so all this carnage is not unprecedented. In fact, a 70% to 80% drop in Bitcoin and Ether prices from their all-time highs can be seen as a golden &apos;buy the blood&apos; opportunity to plan for the future with a focus on research and only investing what you can afford to lose. However, we also witnessed this time that the significant drawdown in the crypto prices was exacerbated by the lack of proper risk management practices adopted by some of the biggest names in the industry.

Key technical points: The AAVE market price has increased 16.50% over the past 24 hours. The price action shows a bull cycle gaining momentum within the falling wedge. The 24-hour trading volume of AAVE is $300 Million, indicating a hike of 63%. Past Performance of AAVE AAVE prices have been steadily declining within a falling wedge pattern with an extremely bearish resistance trendline. The downfall in price pushed the altcoin towards a low of $48 and accounted for an 80% decline in value within the bearish pattern.

Until April 2022, there were no such trading situations on the EGLD chart. With this fall, sellers reached the update of local lows from May 2021. The highest trading volumes during the last fall wave were recorded on the weekly candles of 9 May and 13 June. In the first case, the increased volumes were due to the test of the range of local lows in May 2021. In the second case, the increased volumes were formed by triggering stop orders of buyers who stopped believing in the future growth of EGLD. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/8QzA1axy/ At the time of writing, the $65.29 mark is under the control of sellers. This is the main liquidity level, which buyers can take again to plan the growth of EGLD. However, if during the week of 20 June, buyers are unable to break and fix above the $65.29 mark, the EGLD fall will continue. In this case, the next immediate target is $34. Though, given the uncorrected fall wave of April 2022, we expect buyers to return the mark of $65.29 and continue the correction up to $125. It is from this mark that a new fall wave is likely to begin.

42374588,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvxErD,1655821288,First Mover Americas: Altcoins Lead as BTC Struggles to Stay Above $21K,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Altcoins lead, BTC recovers from weekend lows and fights to stay above $21,000.  Market moves: A large wallet at the center of the governance drama at Solana lending protocol Solend started to move millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies this morning.  Price point  Altcoins are taking the lead Tuesday, with Polygon’s MATIC up 11%, Solana's SOL by 9.5% and Near Protocol's NEAR by 9%.  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 2.6% on the day and hovering around the $21,000 mark. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is 20% higher compared to the 2022 lows around $17,000 reached over the weekend.  This short and sharp downward movement was triggered by liquidations and some miners selling positions around $20,000 to re-enter at a lower price, according to Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the cryptocurrency space in Europe.  Although bitcoin is seeing some consolidation towards $23,000, it still needs to break that resistance to start considering a higher movement towards $30,000, said Jodar. The $19,000 level is still the key support level.  “If the $23K level is broken, we might have a bull summer for cryptos and potentially a good end of the year, but volatility remains quite high to make such an assumption,” Jodar said.  Another reliable metric to test market sentiment is the in-and-out transfers from exchanges to private wallets, according to Jodar. The metric provides insight into what whales (individuals or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrency) are doing with their funds.  Over the last month, there were many inflows in exchanges from whales liquidating their positions, but this has started to change, with big outflows spotted Monday from exchanges to private wallets, according to data from Glassnode.  “You see tremendous outflows when BTC came down to $17.6K, and then net flows being less negative now,” said Jodar.  “This means that some big investors have bought back again and expect to HODL the coins,” said Jodar. ""HODL"" is crypto jargon for the practice of holding assets for the long term with no intent to sell even if the price crashes.  Market moves  By Shaurya Malwa  A large wallet at the center of the governance drama at Solana lending protocol Solend started to move millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies this morning, Solend said in a tweet.  The move potentially averts the risk of contagion in case of a liquidation that could have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.  The anonymous wallet had deposited 95% of Solend’s pool of SOL tokens and represented 88% of USDC borrowing, but came close to a margin call last week as the SOL price dropped more than 40% to as low as $27.  The protocol would have automatically liquidated up to 20% of the whale’s collateral if SOL hit $22.30, and potentially led to damage in the broader Solana ecosystem. A governance vote was floated by protocol developers to take control of the account and take adequate risk management steps.  The wallet’s actions Tuesday came as the SOL price rose by 12% over 24 hours to hit $37. This means the liquidation levels are far below current levels, allowing the wallet’s user to take necessary steps to prevent unforeseen damages in the case of liquidation.

The sale of 3,000 BTC cuts the miner's holdings to 3,349 including month-to-date production.  Bitfarms, based in Toronto, also closed a $37 million equipment-financing deal with NYDIG, announced last week, bringing liquidity to $100 million.  The money raised in the sale helped the miner to reduce a bitcoin-backed credit facility from Galaxy Digital to $38 million. Last week, Bitfarms said it had sold BTC 1,500 to reduce the rolling loan to $66 million from $100 million.  A slouching bitcoin price has spurred miners' profit margins to dwindle – after many of the miners borrowed heavily to fund their operations.  Bitfarms was one of the miners with a strategy of keeping its daily bitcoin production on its balance sheet, using lending and share offerings to fund expansion and day-to-day costs.  Asked about selling bitcoin to improve cash flow or minimize stock dilution, Chief Mining Officer Ben Gagnon said in an interview published on April 22 that Bitfarm's at-the-market offering and borrowing against its BTC holdings were alternative options.  ""We think that bitcoin is currently undervalued"" and the long-term and medium-term potential of bitcoin ""is significantly greater"" than the cost of capital to borrow against the cryptocurrency, he said in April. At the time, BTC was about double today's price.  ""While we remain bullish on long-term BTC price appreciation, this strategic change enables us to focus on our top priorities of maintaining our world-class mining operations and continuing to grow our business in anticipation of improved mining economics,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Lucas said in Tuesday's statement.  Bitfarms shares rose 6.8% on Nasdaq.

42394210,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhfJ,1655818200,"Crypto Industry Is Still 'Embryonic,' WEF Finance Lead Says","Welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De. You’re probably here because you signed up, but in case you're not a fan, you can unsubscribe here.  CoinDesk has written before about the sheer presence crypto had during the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting this past May. This past week, I sat down with Matthew Blake, WEF’s head of the future of financial and monetary systems, to discuss the role the crypto industry might play in future meetings, as well as its presence more generally.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Industry maturation’  The narrative  We’re continuing our conversations this week with one I had in Davos last month.  Why it matters  Crypto’s role at the annual meeting was a signal of sorts. The industry’s presence was loud, visible and intended to say, “Hey, we’re here!” from the moment you stepped off the plane in Zurich. Matthew Blake, the head of the future of financial and monetary systems,, spoke to me about what he’s seen from the industry this year and how he sees industry engagement moving forward. This interview has been edited for clarity.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: Thank you so much for joining us. So let me just set the stage, there have been a number of crypto panels here at the Forum. And if you walk outside on the Promenade, you can't walk more than 50 feet without seeing another crypto company. So I really want to get your sense of, is this a lot of engagement relative to past years? And are [these companies] engaging with the actual Forum itself? Is there productive conversation?  Matthew Blake: Yeah, I appreciate the question. I think it's a story of industry maturation at its core. We've had engagement with the crypto industry as it's evolved. And obviously, it's still embryonic in many ways, and we look to it and look forward to future growth with them. I think the platform of the World Economic Forum, we're working very closely with those companies across a number of different initiatives that we have ongoing. We have a team dedicated to blockchain and digital assets based out of San Francisco. I think we've seen great growth there. There's a real appetite for the type of neutral platform, multi-stakeholder [conversations] that the forum can bring to that industry. They are looking to certainly engage with policymakers, academics and members of civil society, as they further refine and formulate and design protocols and their approach to socioeconomic issues.  As you said, we've seen that a lot of these conversations have been in the Forum itself, there have been conversations about crypto’s carbon impact, and about central bank digital currencies – how do you see these conversations evolving in the years ahead? Are there specific topics or issues you really want to see highlighted during these panels?  We are not a static organization, and in essence, I would if I can, make a prediction. I think we will see an increasing appetite to have crypto-related topics on the agenda. We are building toward that trajectory.  This year, I think we had an amazing selection of topics. There's great familiarity, but for a lot of folks there's a long learning curve, right? And there's such great innovation overall that that curve is pretty steep. So what we're trying to do is help the industry and also help our stakeholders writ large, understand better the nuances of crypto. I think, I'm sure you can appreciate, oftentimes how crypto is portrayed in media and common knowledge is really focused on just certain dynamics, not the whole picture. We're trying to do justice to the whole picture. We're not there yet, but we're doing it in a segmented way and I think an evolutionary way. And so the bottom line is, we see more to come on this.  In terms of crypto itself, just looking at your experience of the Economic Forum and what you've seen over the years, what do you make of crypto itself? Do you think it's meeting the goals it’s set up for itself, or what needs to happen for it to become kind of a global payment system?  I think there's a tremendous amount of potential there. We've studied various aspects of blockchain technology in the context of capital markets. We've done a good amount of work on that front over the years. These days, we're looking at really the nexus of crypto and ESG [environmental, social and governance], actually a collaboration with you guys, CoinDesk, on CISA, which is the crypto impact and sustainability accelerator, which is really all about the nexus of ESG [environment, social and corporate governance] and crypto. We also have a piece of work that's looking at the macroeconomic implications of broader crypto adoption. It's a really hot topic for us, for the industry, but also for policymakers. So we're contributing to those discussions globally.  I feel like our work is really interesting. And there will be aspects that we look to grow. I think it's very fair to say, as an institution we are investing in the space our time, our energy and our commitment. I think we're seeing that interest reciprocated from the industry itself as they increasingly look to the Forum as a way for them to help further hone in how they engage with society, and the meaningful role the sector can play in creating jobs, and deal with some pretty challenging socio economic issues.  Unpacking that a little bit on the regulator front, we've spoken about crypto industry engagement. Have regulators been interested in engaging with the industry or with the Forum on the crypto issues as well?  Yeah, we are. Everything that we do from a thematic and research basis has a multi-stakeholder property to it. That's kind of core to how we operate, and the answer is, absolutely. I think one of the key areas where we've seen keen interest from central banks around the world is on the [central bank digital currency] basis. We've also seen in the regulatory component that I mentioned a moment ago, we're doing interviews around the world with members of parliament, the central banking authorities, ministers of finance and so on. I think there's a combination of trying to understand the evolution of the space and stay on top of it. If you take a step back and put yourself in the policymakers’ shoes, those are tough shoes to fill. Because, on one hand, they have a mandate for maintaining financial stability and protecting customers – that's a big job. And, on the other hand, they have really a sort of economic view toward the benefits of innovation and striking the balance between when to intervene and when to let things go.  The forum, I think, is very well situated because we can help in socializing and educating folks across the board, the concerns of policymakers vis-a-vis the crypto industry and vice versa. It’s very symbiotic in that way. That's really the type of work that we tried to do, that's the type of platform we try to provide. I think we're having success on that.  One of those concerns that you mentioned [was] climate and carbon impacts. Going back to what you said earlier about CISA – how do you see that evolving?  You can sense the debate, and a bit of the ferocity of the debate, around proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work. But also, I think it came through a theme that I keep repeating here, which is that as human beings, we focus on the here and now, but this is very much an evolving story. Different consensus mechanisms, what we have and what we're proving is what we're aware of today, three years, five years, 10 years down the line, most likely that there'll be many more. I think the key answer there is the environmental concern is real … We are, again, as an institution, working with 180 different sectors.  We are working with many of the hard to abate sectors, so aviation, automotive, chemicals, steel, just to use as an example, right on transition paths, right toward net zero. I wouldn't want to just pigeonhole the crypto industry; they have their challenges. I think if I could say something positive there, it's that it's still an embryonic sector. They're very aware of this issue. And I think that bodes well for them to adapt, in a very sensitive way vis-a-vis the environment, in a way that other sectors who have more legacy kind of baggage and just history, it's just more challenging.  What do you see as the next steps? What do you want to see maybe a year from now or at the next Economic Forum? What do you hope to see either related to CISA or just crypto in general?  I think this year we are still on a level-setting stage. We're trying to bring to the participants here an agenda that's both rich, but balanced as it relates to the technical nuances of the crypto space. To those that are steeped in it, it's a technical space, right? It's got its own lexicon, it’s changing rapidly. We're very mindful of putting the pieces in place in a way where it's accessible. I think that benefits the industry. If I can be quite frank, I think, jargon, and sort of being very focused on the nuances [is inaccessible] – most folks are not technologists, so we have to sort of set the stage there. To answer your question, I see us working toward more granularity, so going deeper into the nuances, drawing distinctions between different pieces of the ecosystem and really taking the membership base, and also our participants here at the annual meeting, along for that journey. And that's not just in this environment, that's 365 days a year. We're doing that tactically, as a team, as an institution.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  No news to report.

42423101,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2MhLh,1655815455,"Bitcoin Recovers to $21K, Traders Still Wary of Further Rally Due to Recession Fears","Bitcoin (BTC) continued the second day of gains on Tuesday to hold over the $21,000 level in European hours in early signs of recovery. The surge came even as traditional financial firms Morgan Stanley(MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) stated in client notes that recession risks were “not fully priced in.”  “The bear market will not be over until recession arrives or the risk of one is extinguished,” Morgan Stanley said in its note. Meanwhile, Goldman analysts said stock traders were pricing in a mild recession, “leaving them exposed to a further deterioration in expectations,” as per Bloomberg.  Some analysts like FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said bitcoin managed to hold above the $20,000 round level on Monday amid weak trading activity due to the U.S. holiday. Bitcoin ended up “attracting enough speculative demand” to fuel movement in the past two days, he added.  Kuptsikevich remained unconvinced of a continued rally, however. “It will be too early to talk about a long-term reversal: All negative fundamentals remain. Until sharp monetary-policy tightening becomes the norm, financial market pressures can quickly negate bounces in cryptocurrencies,” he told CoinDesk in an email.  Prices of Bitcoin fell below the $20,000 level last weekend in a move that marked a drop below previous highs for the first time in the asset’s history. The dynamics caused a record $7.3 billion in losses for bitcoin holders over the weekend, as reported.  Tuesday’s gains in bitcoin led to recovery among crypto majors. In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) rose 6.4% to $1,130, while Solana’s SOL jumped as much as 15% amid a spike in transactions. Layer 1 tokens like Avalanche's AVAX and Polkadot's DOT added at least 8%, while total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 5% to $914 billion, as per CoinMarketCap.  The relief, which started late on Sunday, came after volatile trading over the weekend as macroeconomic market conditions remained shaky.  Investor sentiment around risk assets, such as technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, has soured in recent weeks amid rising inflation – and a hawkish Federal Reserve has caused concerns of prolonged economic contraction.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hiked rates by 75 basis points last week, the highest raise in over 28 years as the agency remains committed to combating inflation.  But broader equity and index markets saw a relief rally following Powell’s comments that he did “not expect moves of this size to be common.""  Meanwhile, crypto market observers remain wary of the current relief in crypto markets.  “Everybody kind of feels that Bitcoin needs to wash out and take out all the short positions,” said Chris Terry, vice president at lending platform SmartFi. “This would be probably the full 80% retracement, which is typical in the markets, which would be down in the $12,000 to $13,000 range.”  Lily Zhang, chief financial officer at crypto exchange Huobi Global, said the group remained “long-term bullish on crypto” but showed concerns in the short run.  “Our market indicators show that there is an unprecedented level of fear, uncertainty and doubt in the market,” Zhang said. On-chain liquidations may trigger a cascade of drawdowns as the market sees a large wave of capitulations.”  Zhang added that such dynamics could, however, allow crypto-focused investors to take advantage of a possibly “undervalued market.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOT,BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/21/bitcoin-recovers-to-21k-traders-still-wary-of-further-rally-due-to-recession-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68ac9718565c821312c77715688b0bd49fc25acf-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prince said the move “bolsters our balance sheet and platform strength.” He added that ""the proceeds of the credit facility are intended to be contractually subordinate to all client balances across all account types (BIA, BPY & loan collateral) and will be used as needed.""  This is not the first time FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has stepped in to bail out a major crypto company impacted by the recent market downturn. Last week, crypto broker Voyager Digital (VOYG) secured a revolving line of credit with Bankman-Fried-founded quant trading shop Alameda Research.  Though it is now in the position of backstopping a broader market crash, FTX is reportedly one of the firms that liquidated Celsius – the troubled decentralized crypto lending platform that was forced to halt all user withdraws last week. Celsius, one of BlockFi’s competitors, reportedly ran out of funds to repay depositors due to a series of risky decentralized finance bets.  In the press release, BlockFi said the credit facility is contingent on the execution of ""definitive documents,"" which the two companies expect to be completed in ""the coming days.""  The agreement comes during a downturn for crypto markets and the fall of stablecoin UST and the aforementioned Celsius.  Last week, Prince tweeted that BlockFi had also been forced to liquidate a large client that “failed to meet its obligations on an overcollateralized loan.” The statement – which didn’t name a specific client – came amid speculation surrounding the solvency of Three Arrows Capital, a major crypto investment firm. Just a few days earlier, BlockFi announced it was cutting about 20% of its workforce, or roughly 170 jobs.

The round, announced Tuesday, values the platform at $1.6 billion, putting it on par with the Series B of OpenSea, the leading Ethereum NFT marketplace that went on to command a $13 billion valuation in a Series C round announced earlier this year.  Magic Eden says it plans to use the funds to expand its primary and secondary marketplaces, as well as explore “multichain opportunities,” according to a press release.  “We know that NFTs are the best way to bring people onto the blockchain,” Jack Lu, CEO of Magic Eden, said in a statement. “NFTs are exciting, social and cultural experiences that bring connectivity to the world. We’ve made the conscious decision to support both our creators and users through this tremendous era of growth for both the company and the industry.”  Solana NFT volume  Magic Eden is the current kingpin of the Solana NFT community, handling more than 90% of the ecosystem’s volume and picking up steam in recent months.  The marketplace is now rivaling OpenSea in daily transactions and volume, sometimes surpassing it.  The Magic Eden raise comes in an otherwise pessimistic crypto climate, with prices for such underlying currencies of the NFT ecosystem as SOL and ETH down as much as 80% from their all-time highs in the past year.  Magic Eden previously raised a $27 million Series A led by Paradigm, Sequoia and Solana Ventures in March.  Raises from institutional investors are beginning to taper off given the dismal state of the crypto market. For his part, Lu is unfazed.  “Markets will do what markets do – we are excited to build on a 10+ year time horizon,” he said via email, adding:  “We see this capital as a measure of our investor confidence in Magic Eden and the broader crypto market. The additional investment will allow us to achieve our goal to onboard the next billion users to Web3 without being constrained by market cycles.”",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/21/solana-nft-marketplace-magic-eden-raises-130m-at-16b-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38a7e40ed0f788e022c9485bfe3203d2e3875621-1137x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the NY State Legislature entered the eleventh hour of its 2022 session, an early morning vote in Albany on Friday passed a bill that potentially will impose a strict 2-year ban on all new crypto mining permits. The bill also intends to ban certain existing mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources, primarily set-ups repurposing fossil-fuel burning plants. After being passed by the Assembly in April, the bill languished in the Senate for weeks until it was unexpectedly brought back to life and passed just before the Senate adjourned on Friday morning. The Democrat-controlled state Senate is expected to take up the matter shortly before the bill lands on the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who will determine its fate. NY lawmakers backing the legislation have also provided their reasons behind this sudden move. They have clarified that this is being done to curb New York&apos;s carbon footprint by cracking down on mining companies, especially those employing non-renewable resources. Unless a proof-of-work (PoW) mining company can show evidence that they are using 100% renewable energy, they wouldn&apos;t be allowed to expand or renew their permits.

42423092,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mh3h,1655809200,"CBDCs, Not Crypto, Will Be Cornerstone of Future Monetary System, BIS Says","Crypto’s structural flaws make it an unsuitable basis for a monetary system, according to the Bank for International settlements (BIS). Instead, monetary systems could be built around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are digital representations of central bank money.  The BIS, an association of the world’s major central banks, dedicates a 42-page chapter in its ""2022 Annual Economic Report"" to laying out a blueprint for the future of the global monetary system. In that vision, there is room for only some of crypto’s underlying technical features, like programmability and tokenization, not for cryptocurrencies themselves.  “Our broad conclusion is captured in the motto, ‘Anything that crypto can do, CBDCs can do better,’” said Hyun Song Shin, an economic adviser and head of research at the BIS, during a press briefing on Monday.  The chapter, which will be published Tuesday ahead of the full report, identifies a number of limitations of crypto, including the lack of a stable nominal anchor. In monetary policy that is a variable – such as a currency peg – that can be used to control price levels.  Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of assets like sovereign currencies, are the crypto world’s search for such an anchor, Shin said. Stablecoins attempt to “piggyback on the stability of real money issued by central banks.”  Shin said the recent crash of terraUSD, a dollar stablecoin with a market capitalization of $18 billion in early May that rapidly lost its peg, illustrated how stablecoins, despite their name, are unstable and don’t make good units of account. Unlike other leading stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, which are reportedly backed by dollar-denominated reserves, terraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin backed by another cryptocurrency (in this case LUNA) with an algorithm in place to regulate supply and demand of the stablecoin and maintain its peg.  “The second important finding is that crypto and stablecoins fail to achieve the full network effects that we normally expect of money,” Shin said.  Money, Shin said, is the perfect example of a virtuous circle of greater use and greater acceptance. Crypto’s decentralized nature, on the other hand, achieves exactly the opposite, namely fragmentation.  In early June, BIS economists published a paper arguing that crypto cannot fulfill the role of money because costly transactions and scalability restrictions lead to the crypto world splitting into competing blockchains and ecosystems.  “Network effects mean ‘the more, the merrier.’ Crypto achieves the opposite: ‘the more, the sorrier’.”  CBDCs can do it better  In the BIS blueprint for future monetary systems, CBDCs play the role of stable digital currencies used in settlements, transfers and payments. But CBDC projects are still in early stages in most major economies, with China ahead of the curve with its digital yuan.  At the briefing, Shin responded with optimism to questions on his confidence in CBDCs and the progress made so far in BIS’ own experiments, noting that countries were choosing to issue CBDCs despite having robust payments systems.  “You know, India has one of the best retail fast payment systems in the world. It's called UPI. And it's led the way in actually showing the way on how these systems will actually operate. But India has decided to go to the final step and actually roll out a retail CBDC,” Shin said, referring to a CBDC that can be used by consumers for transactional purposes.  The paper acknowledges crypto’s contributions to technological advances, calling new developments a “radical departure” from existing systems. However, according to the report, technical capabilities that arose from innovations in the crypto space will only serve to strengthen the central bank monetary system.  “Programmability, composability and tokenization are not the preserve of crypto, but can instead be built on top of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), fast payment systems and associated data architectures,” the report said.

Vasil, a network upgrade that would increase scaling capabilities on Cardano, is now slated for a late June release on Cardano's test network. Hard forks refer to a network upgrade in which blockchains validate and produce new blocks with predetermined new rules.  “The IOG engineering team is extremely close to finalizing the core work, with just seven bugs still outstanding to complete the hard fork work, with none currently ranked as ‘severe,” developers said. “After some consideration, we have agreed NOT to send the hard fork update proposal to the testnet today to allow more time for testing,” they added.  Developers said that “few outstanding items” were needed to confirm everything was “working as expected” and that they would “need a few more days” to do that. “This puts us behind schedule on our previously communicated target date of June 29 for a mainnet hard fork,” they said.  The final decision to upgrade the Cardano testnet will be made in consultation with the network’s decentralized application (dapp) development community. The developers must clear any critical issues in testing, conduct benchmarking tests for the software and inform the broader developer community to allow enough time to retest their dapps before the hard fork.

42423090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mgzh,1655796600,European Crypto Unicorn Bitpanda Is Now Regulated in Spain,"Austrian cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda is expanding to Spain, after registering as a virtual currency exchange and digital asset custody service provider in the country.  The company was officially entered into the Bank of Spain’s registry for crypto firms on June 16, according to the bank’s official website, and Bitpanda announced the news on Tuesday.  Bank of Spain opened its registry for crypto service providers back in October 2021, and Spanish crypto exchange Bit2Me became the first company to be added to the registry in February this year.  The European Union (EU) is planning to set up a license that would allow crypto firms regulated in one EU country to operate in others under its upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill. The MiCA framework is in the final stage of the EU’s legislative process.  But Bipanda, which had a valuation of around $4.1 billion as of August 2021, is not waiting around for the EU license to kick in, successfully registering in virtual asset service provider registries in both Italy and Sweden earlier this year. It registered with French securities regulator Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) in 2020.  The firm’s regulatory efforts have not come without incident. In February, Bitpanda announced the acquisition of U.K. crypto custody platform Trustology. On the same day the announcement was made, the U.K. financial conduct authority (FCA) warned it was watching the acquisition closely. At the time of the announcement, Trustology was registered under the FCA’s Money Laundering Regulations (MLR) registry, but according to the FCA that was not enough.  “The MLRs do not include any provisions that allow the FCA to assess the fitness and propriety of beneficial owners or changes in control before a transaction is completed,” the FCA said in its February statement.

The plunge of Luna, which was formerly one of the top 3 stablecoins, far exceeded the price drops of altcoins out there.

Yet, will investors still trust Terra 2.0? Trust can dissipate instantly, but it takes a long time to build. At the moment, Ethereum remains at the center of public chain ecosystems. That said, Ethereum is also subject to multiple flaws. For example, due to its low TPS, a large commercial DApp in the ecosystem can slow down the entire network. Moreover, Ethereum users also have to pay expensive gas fees. During peak hours, a single transfer could cost hundreds of dollars, which hinders the large-scale adoption and growth of DApps.

BTC even touched $17,000 mark this month, however, the king coin has now reclaimed its $20,000. Over the last week, the coin lost 22% of its value but on the daily chart it gained close to 7%. Technical outlook for the coin has picked up bullishness but still reflects signs of weakness. Buyers also have returned to the market, but if buying strength drops again BTC might find support close to $17,000. It is still difficult to say if the coin has bottomed out. Many altcoins also jumped on their chart as Bitcoin showed signs of relief. This also included Ethereum that pushed up by 9% over the last 24 hours. The global cryptocurrency market cap today was at $950 Billion with an increase of 6.1% change in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Analysis: One Day Chart BTC touched its 18-month low as the coin dipped near the $18,000 mark yesterday. Pressure from sellers have constantly pushed the price of the further below. Despite a jump back to the support level of $20,000, sellers are still in control of the market. Overhead resistance for the call stood at $22,000 and a fall from the $20,000 will cause BTC to trade near the $17,000 to $16,000 mark. BTC&apos;s trading volume also fell on the chart.

Key technical points: The DOGE market price has increased 25% over the past 24 hours. The sideways trend continues between $0.05 and $0.063. The 24-hour trading volume of Dogecoin is $654 Million, indicating a drop of 41%. Past Performance of DOGE The DOGE price has been stuck between $0.05 and $0.063 limits for the past week. The consolidation could lead to an upward trend when it breaks through any or both extremes. Moreover, the bullish breakout of the consolidation range increases with the double bottom pattern taking shape. Source- Tradingview DOGE Technical Analysis The DOGE price action shows a bullish engulfing candlestick followed by a Doji candle, warning of an evening star pattern formation. Hence, traders hoping for a bullish trend must wait for a price action confirmation. Since May, the DOGE price has traded between the lower and mid-band of Bollinger band indicators, indicating an aggressive selling market. However, the price has been hovering around that lower support is a sign of the reversal theory. Amid ongoing consolidation and the daily RSI slope moving higher suggests buyers are taking control of the sellers. This means a higher likelihood of breakouts of $0.063 breakout.
