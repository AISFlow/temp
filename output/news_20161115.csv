42378947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfIL,1479247206,Ethereum Sets Date for Fourth Blockchain Fork,"Ethereum's developers have unveiled new details about a technical fork aimed at resolving lingering network issues.  Officially merged into the code of the most popular ethereum client, the new rules will trigger at block number 2,675,000 — likely to occur sometime around Tuesday of next week.  The update will erase empty accounts that unknown attackers used to bloat the ethereum blockchain by way of a hard fork, a process generally seen as a dangerous way of upgrading the software (all miners will need to upgrade to the new network).  But according to some developers, the reality is more complex. Attacks have slowed down block and transaction processing on the network. With details of the fork previously unannounced, users have been asking for an update.  The announcement is likely to lead to the usual criticisms of the platform that have emerged this year. This will mark ethereum's fourth hard fork, the second of which would emerge as its most controversial, altering ethereum's transaction history and splitting the network into two.  Yet, the third went according to plan without any widely known negative side effects in October. Developers argue that since the fourth fork is an uncontroversial technical update, it will likely be as smooth as the third.  The latest fork will also include replay attack protection, which was the source of user frustration over the summer.

42378949,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfKr,1479244539,Sweden's Central Bank Considers Digital Currency Use,"Sweden's central bank is now considering the possibility of issuing its own digital currency, though the exact technology it will use is yet to be determined.  As profiled in The Financial Times today, Riksbank said it is facing pressure to make the switch following a decline in domestic cash use. (According to the report, the amount of notes in circulation has declined 40% since 2009).  Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor at the Riksbank, said the bank is currently considering the tradeoffs of various technologies. Though she did not mention blockchain specifically, the FT cited the technology as one option the central bank might consider.  Skingsley said:  ""We need to do the homework because it’s not an option for the public sector to stay on the sidelines and see the private sector cut off access to central bank money for individuals.""  Notably, Skingsley said that the digital currency could be issued alongside banknotes and coins, but that Riksbank would not want to encourage illegal activity through the offering.  Skingsley is expected to expand on the idea in a speech tomorrow.  With the news, Sweden becomes the latest nation to see its central bank consider a digital currency, a process that for most has included at least some exploration of blockchain-based digital currencies.  In recent months, the Bank of England has openly discussed and explored issuing a digital currency using blockchain, while the People's Bank of China is reportedly investigating the idea.

42378958,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfUv,1479243591,Blockchain Credit Card Trial Puts New Twist on Retail Payments,"Last Monday, 100 Deloitte employees lined up to buy coffee and cupcakes from a selection of vendors.  While unlikely to be news on its own, Deloitte's team just wasn't using any payment method to transact – payments were faciliated via a contactless payment card connceted to a blockchain-based system.  Created and developed by UK blockchain startup SETL, the trial showcased how blockchain technology could come to be integrated into the retail shopping experience – without altering the payment habits of consumers.  For the trial, customer funds were deposited in a Metro Bank client account, issued to individual accounts on the SETL blockchain and tied to user identities created and verified on Deloitte’s own blockchain ID system, formally unveiled earlier this month.  Payments were instantly processed, and the customer and merchant balances updated in real time, features that Anthony Culligan (founder and product CEO of SETL) said could bring benefits to bank and merchant customers if widely deployed.  Culligan told CoinDesk.  ""Merchants are extremely sensitive to the sorts of margins that are being taken out by the card industry. Up until now they haven’t really had a choice in the sort of payment processing methods they accepted, but this offers a third way for merchants which could be done at a fraction of the cost.""  One of the first mainstream examples of the use of blockchain in a retail payment card transaction, the trial could be viewed as taking an alternative route to providing many of the benefits digital currencies may have provided if widely adopted by merchants.  Expected to go into production by 2018, the system was created for UK retail bank Metro Bank and took place under the FCA's 'regulatory sandbox'.  Aimed at encouraging the wider use of financial technology, the scheme allows FinTech companies to test new products and services in a live environment, but under regulator supervision.  A win for merchants  Although the trial was in many ways a small affair, it is perhaps best thought of as a showcase for both SETL's proprietary blockchain technology.  By more effectively creating connections between parties in the value chain, SETL's system could ultimately provide an 80% reduction on fees that merchants currently pay, Culligan said.  But the system could also be of great benefit to so called 'challenger banks' – small banks trying to gain traction in the market, and that often have difficulty competing due to their reliance on contracting card clearing services through their larger rivals at a fee.  Culligan explained that here, SETL and its partners would need a network of participants to see the true benefits of its design.  ""Our idea is to offer something that will be useful not just for one bank, but for many participants…as an alternative to the incumbent big banks, and which is significantly cheaper to use than existing payment networks,"" said Culligan.  Integrating identity  Facilitating the partnership between SETL and Metro Bank is just one of the ventures in which Deloitte has promoted the use of blockchain technology in recent years.  David Myers, head of capital markets at Deloitte, explained that the SETL trial is just one way in which a blockchain identity service could be integrated in more financial systems.  ""On the digital identity side, our findings are that financial services are in a position to lead the charge here,"" Myers said. ""You don’t have to look hard to see this [as an answer to] the AML and KYC related matters which banks have been facing for quite some time.”  Deloitte developed the Smart ID project as a solution to this, Myers said, since many of its banking clients face large costs and technical challenges due to remediation procedures necessitated by KYC rules.  But, even with banks and merchants as the primary beneficiaries from blockchain based card payments, those involved argue reductions in card transaction processing fees should ultimately be passed on to customers.  Greater competition in the banking sector could also be welcomed by UK customers, given that the largest high street banks such as RBS, Barclays and HSBC currently rate among the lowest for customer satisfaction.

Announced yesterday  at the Singapore FinTech festival, the project (a collaboration with KYC startup KYCK!) aims to provide enhanced identity verification services, enabling KYCK!'s customers to more rapidly on-board customers in a secure environment.  The hope is the service will reduce the time and expense financial service providers encounter when on-boarding new customers and complying with KYC regulation. Using a permissioned ledger, many of the existing steps can be streamlined into a one-time process, the partners said.  Built on the open-source Hyperledger project, the service will provide KYCK! customers with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers.  When identity has been confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank checks, though a blockchain-based business network (including banking and governmental entities) would also be leveraged.

42427158,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoZh,1479225540,"Blockchain Won't Just Change Regulation, it Could Reshape the SEC","The day US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Mary Jo White announced she would hand over power prior to President Trump's inauguration, an SEC panel on blockchain began to paint a picture of just how deep the changes could go.  Beyond Trump's planned reversal of regulatory requirements imposed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the panel, moderated by the head of the SEC's blockchain working group, looked closely at how blockchain tech is changing the demands imposed on regulators themselves.  To face an increasingly complicated field of potential problems, financial regulators will need to embrace a new set of skills. Already, the name of a a typical financial regulator is usually followed by a string of letters like CFA, MBA, JD and LL.B.  But based on the discussion yesterday at its headquarters in Washington, DC, the qualifications are only going to get more diverse.  Speaking on a panel about the impact of distributed ledgers on post-trade solutions, professor Emin Gün Sirer of Cornell University explained how technological changes are already resulting in the rise of ""a new class"" of government employee who will take financial technology to a new level.  Sirer told the audience:  ""This can be a daunting field because it's so diverse and so expansive. It ranges from economics on the one end to impossibility results in computer science on the other. Bridging the gap might be difficult.""  Already, the SEC includes on its jobs page an entire section for IT specialists that work in its infrastructure department as well as compliance, examination and enforcement programs.  But if Sirer is right, that's just the beginning of a changing set of technological demands. To acquire these skills, Sirer recommended regulators work with so-called ""centers of excellence"" such as MIT’s Digital Currency Institute and his own Institute for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3), hosted by Cornell University.  A major obstacle these regulators are likely to face in acquiring these skills, according to Sirer, is that some blockchain-based companies known as decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs, also described as DAOs) don’t even bother explaining how their services work in natural language.  ""In such a fast-moving field, proper documentation for many of these systems doesn't exist, in some cases the people developing them actively resist, saying that 'code is law,'"" he said. ""And therefore there is no separate description or definition of what an investor or a user should see. It's expected that you read raw code.""  Notably, topics that were not discussed included token issuance and the recent uptick in public cryptocurrency sales, both of which have been widely expected to fall under the SEC's governing laws.  A new perspective  More than just new skills though, panelists argued that future SEC regulators will need a totally new perspective.  The panel titled ""Impact of Recent Innovation on Trading, Settlement, and Clearance Activities,"" was hosted by the head of the SEC’s Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group, Valerie Szczepanik.  In response to a question about the future role of regulators, PwC capital markets principal Grainne McNamara explained how her company’s work with clients looking to reimagine audits caused a shift in its perspective.  Increasingly, creators of private blockchains are working to build nodes designed explicitly to give some participants insight into the transactions that other members of a private distributed network don't have.  The result of such a change would be that regulators and auditors could ""actually use the blockchain to move themselves into a more proactive vs reactive look-back type of audit arrangement,"" said McNamara.  She added:  ""Instead of having processes and people that are sucking data out of various parts of the ecosystem, it's our view that this process could actually be streamlined and that there could be a node on the ecosystem that they could effectively monitor from there.""  Shot in foot  But even with an increasingly clear path towards implementation, obstacles remain.  Digital Asset Holdings chief business development officer Chris Church argued that there were three obstacles slowing down the adoption of blockchain by financial institutions.  The first is a lack of network effect, he said. Financial institutions don't want to adopt blockchain because of the perception that they won’t be able to use it until other people adopt it. The second obstacle is a lack of standardization, a problem which appears to be slowly disappearing.  The third roadblock, however, was perhaps most pertinent to the SEC audience: regulators themselves.  Regulators, Church said ""are feeling a lot more comfortable with the regulations they've put in place"" and as a result, are unlikely to ""turn around and give up that regulation.""  Church and the other panelists were speaking prior to SEC commissioner Mary Jo White's announcement that she would would resign, paving the way (according to multiple reports) for President-elect Trump's plans to undo many financial regulations.  While Trump may have other plans for the future of regulators, Church volunteered his own possible solution to regulators' own reluctance to change. Regulators should turn to each other, he said.  ""One of my suggestions if you are a regulator is to speak with other regulators. There are a number of them out there who are doing some really good stuff,"" said Church. ""It's great to see the SEC doing this event. Chat with the British, chat with the Canadians, the Singaporeans, the Australians, they’ve got teams of people working on this stuff.""  Running in place  But even as the an impending battle is set between regulators looking to hold onto what they’ve created and the incoming US President, some things are likely to stay the same.  The head of global public policy at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Mark Wetjen, agreed in part with Church that some things at the SEC are slated for blockchain-based upheaval.  But Wetjen drew a distinction between regulation and policy.  Specifically, he said risk management and transparency will always lay at the center of not only what the SEC does, but the CFTC, the US Federal Reserve and other regulatory bodies the world over.  Wetjen concluded:  ""The policies that underlie, that form the foundation of the regulations, that’s what probably will stand the test of time.""

42427170,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoLh,1479216606,"With Vulcan Project, PwC Wants Banks to Rethink Bitcoin","Digital currencies may have launched the blockchain conversation, but it's no secret that they've taken a backseat amid rising interest in distributed ledgers.  Now, with the help of 'Big Four' audit firm PwC's Australia division, a trio of startups are making a play aimed squarely at altering this narrative by convincing financial institutions that bitcoin (and the open network of digital currencies that has sprung up around it) could help them launch new services and better serve existing customers.  Called Vulcan Digital Asset Services, the platform (a joint effort by Bloq, Libra, Netki and PwC), aims to enable the professional services firm's clients to launch digital assets that would be interoperable with and trade alongside bitcoin and its many alternatives.  In interview, Vulcan lead and PwC Australia blockchain leader Robert Allen explained that the initiative grew out of a bid to make bitcoin more accessible to large institutions.  Allen told CoinDesk:  ""Where we started was with digital currency, 'How do we make bitcoin relevant to banks?' It soon became apparent that using identity, using methods to apply compliance and regulatory reporting to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin actually had a wide application.""  Allen explained that a retailer could use Vulcan to issue its own rewards points that could be traded for bitcoin or other digital assets.  PwC's platform would then take care of providing the supporting blockchain infrastructure, enabling clients to create wallets, process payments and, maybe soon, launch merchant services.  In this light, Allen framed PwC's effort as one that would allow clients to meet compliance needs while still leveraging the open-source blockchain ecosystem, but in a way where the digital currency network would only be run by authorized participants.  Libra's Jeremy Drane, a former FinTech lead at PwC, called Vulcan a ""huge"" step in uniting the now divided blockchain and digital currency ecosystems.  ""This stack eliminates the argument that banks cannot allow consumers to buy, sell and use bitcoin, and other types of cryptocurrencies due to technical limitations and the implications on related regulatory schemes,"" he told CoinDesk.  Though driven by PwC Australia, Allen said that Vulcan is rather a product of feedback from the firm's entire ""global network"", and that it could one day launch as a subscription service.  Decoding Vulcan  So, what is a digital asset service under the hood?  As explained by Bloq co-founder Matt Roszak, the new offering isn't all that dissimilar from offerings by so-called ""blockchain startups"", in that users could create a new blockchain and then link it to another public blockchain (like bitcoin).  But Roszak contends Vulcan is best considered as an ""enablement platform"" that would provide businesses with a ""plug and play"" way to launch digital currencies (rather than their own standalone blockchains). This goal is perhaps not a surprise as Vulcan was built by Bloq, a startup that seeks to help enterprises feel more confident in using the bitcoin blockchain.  For the effort, Allen said that Bloq had created the tools for its clients to launch a ""multi-asset blockchain"" that would enable users to issue digital assets. On top, would be identity and compliance services provided by Netki and Libra.  Roszak said Vulcan is already in talks with one central bank to use the service and that a key advantage to the platform is that it would include many of the features needed for a US dollar coin or a UK pound coin out of the gate.  Long term, Allen foresees Vulcan potentially even offering wallet services to users who would hold ""multiple types of fiat and cryptocurrency.""  ""We don't see this as being counter to the principle of cryptocurrency, but taking it to a wider customer base. We have the ability within professional services to educate the regulators, the corporates and the wider population on the benefits of digital currencies,"" he added.  Understanding resistance  According to Allen, the launch represents the culmination of more than two years of work in the space for PwC and his division.  But while the result may be unconventional by today's industry standards, Allen said that he believes PwC has removed real hurdles by bundling its services creatively and leveraging its existing brand recognition.  For example, Allen said PwC has already made inroads in Australia, where he asserted that his firm has had a positive dialogue with regulators, one that has successfully assuaged concerns regarding consumer protection and compliance.  Yet, Allen reported that the learning curve remains steep, and that more progress needs to be made before the service (or those like it) will be widely adopted.  ""There's a lot of education and some of the clients are resistant for obvious reasons, and those have affected the uptake and adoption and digital currencies in the wider sense,"" Allen continued. ""We use our relationships with those clients to try to understand where the resistance is, and overcome it with what we have, the facts.""  In his remarks, Allen offered praise for bitcoin, arguing that it has shown that digital currencies can offer ""huge utility"" as well as a working model for enterprises to follow in launching similar networks.  ""In terms of a digital currency, bitcoin's pretty much the only game in town,"" Allen said.  Path ahead  But while a development that could open more enterprise institutions to public blockchain, the initiative is just entering its first stages.  Allen indicated that the platform is currently operational as a proof-of-concept, and that it will be unveiled at the Singapore FinTech Festival this week.  ""We're using the event as the launchpad to come out of stealth and tell the world what we're doing,"" Allen said.  Allen expects that the announcement will help drive interest and bring more firms to the platform, with a potential for more announcements later next year as various projects mature.  He concluded:  ""We have a strong pipeline of organizations that see the merit of what we're doing and we expect to go into PoC very soon.""

Revealed today, Gemini users are now able to connect to the New York-based bitcoin and ether exchange via a REST API, WebSockets API and a FIX API, upgrades that bring more widely used electronic communications protocols to the platform.  In statements, representatives from Gemini said that the updates would make private order status information more readily accessible to traders.  The exchange wrote:  ""This should prove to be much more efficient than the REST protocol for all of our automated traders, since order status updates and other events are pushed to you rather than requiring you to continually poll for updates.""  Notably, Gemini said the service was inspired by feedback from Whale Club, the popular network for bitcoin day traders, a move that may suggest a shift in strategy at the exchange.  Launched late last year by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini has arguably struggled to attract users from this community, in part due to its original positioning as a service for enterprise institutions and its lack of offerings for more active traders.  However, that market may be becoming more important now that Gemini's initial target audience has proved somewhat elusive.  Data from Bitcoinity indicates Gemini lags behind the two most popular regulated US dollar bitcoin exchanges, Coinbase's GDAX and Paxos' itBit.  Over the last seven days, Gemini has traded 13,913 BTC (nearly $10m), while GDAX saw 40,455 BTC in volume (roughly $28.5m) during the time period.

42427153,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoPh,1479211315,Is a Blockchain Patent Still Possible?,"Ira Schaefer and Ted Mlynar are partners in the intellectual property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York City. They advise on patent and other intellectual property issues relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.  In this opinion piece, Schaefer and Mlynar look at the possibilities for someone hoping to patent a blockchain invention in the face of complex and arcane legal processes.  With so much blockchain technology publicly disclosed already, many are wondering, ""How can we get a patent on a blockchain system now?""  In a previous article, we explored whether Satoshi Nakamoto could have patented bitcoin and whether such a patent would have survived an eligibility challenge.  But regardless of whether a viable bitcoin patent exists, both Nakamoto’s 2008 article describing the bitcoin system and the bitcoin network in operation since 2009 qualify as ""prior art"" against any new attempt to patent a blockchain system.  There are a few legal and practical hurdles facing the aspiring blockchain patentee.  Alice in Wonderland  The Supreme Court’s 'Alice' decision addresses the statutory categories of potentially patent-eligible subject matter articulated in 35 USC §101:  ""[A]ny new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” – Alice Corporation vs CLS Bank International (2014).  Being quite the patent buzzkill, Alice notes that there are long-standing exceptions to those broad categories. ""Abstract ideas,"" in particular, are not patentable. And, according to Alice, in the patent Wonderland, there are exceptions to the exceptions.  We shall explain.  First, when is an idea so ""abstract"" that it is an unpatentable ""abstract idea""? The Supreme Court is not entirely clear in Alice, but it was sure that ""fundamental economic practices"" are abstract ideas. The court specifically determined that a claimed method for mitigating ""settlement risk"" was an abstract idea.  Second, the Supreme Court adapted the two-step analysis it had devised for life sciences patents in Mayo Collaboration Services vs Prometheus Laboratories (2012) to apply to financial technology patents.  The first step in 'Mayo' was to analyze the patent claim as a whole to see if an abstract idea (the exception to patent eligibility) is claimed. If so, then the second step in Mayo was to see if that patent claim recites additional elements to implement the abstract idea that are “significantly more” than the abstract idea itself (the exception to the exception).  If so, then the patent claims are directed to patent-eligible subject matter. If not, then the patent claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea.  Determining what qualifies as ""significantly more"" may seem a bit subjective. The courts have warned that adding well-known activities, routine and conventional activities, or insignificant extra-solution activities do not qualify. Linking a claimed method to a particular field of use is also not adding “significantly more.” Such circular definitions, however, are not particularly helpful guidance.  What has been considered ""significantly more?"" An improvement in another technology or technical field, an improvement to a computer itself, adding a limitation that is not routine or conventional, linking the use to a particular technological environment (other than a computer network), and applying the method to a particular machine (other than a general purpose computer) have generally been found to be “significantly more” sufficient for patent eligibility.  In applying Mayo to technology inventions, Alice created quite a stir at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). USPTO examiners were required to figure out which inventions were the exceptions and which inventions were the exceptions-to-the-exceptions. Those lines proved to be not so easy to draw.  The decision also immediately impacted all patent litigation cases, because Alice has a retroactive effect.  For example, even though Nakamoto could have filed his patent application in 2007 and had it examined under pre-Alice law, any challenge to the validity of that patent today would be reviewed under Alice. The Federal Circuit, the court of appeals for patent cases, has issued several decisions to help the district courts understand and apply Alice.  Just ask Alice  How does Alice impact blockchain inventions? In short, they start behind the eight ball.  Applying Alice to FinTech inventions, the Federal Circuit has held that methods for risk hedging, for creating a contractual relationship, of using advertising as currency, and of processing information in a clearinghouse, are all “abstract ideas”.  In none of those cases did the patent claims recite something sufficiently “significantly more” to qualify as an exception-to-the-exception.  In view of those decisions, there was an understandable concern that the Federal Circuit would classify any method for carrying out a traditional financial transaction performed on a computer (or over the Internet), as an unpatentable abstract idea.  While the prospects for patenting FinTech may have looked grim, the scope of the exceptions-to-the-exception has been expanding and provides an opening for patenting blockchain inventions.  Hold the Mayo  The first hurdle for patenting a blockchain invention is preparing a patent application that will pass muster at the post-Alice PTO.  To convince a USPTO examiner that the invention is not an unpatentable ""abstract idea"", it is most helpful if the application carefully frames the invention in concrete terms.  As an example, consider a hypothetical Nakamoto patent application for bitcoin. Following traditional patent drafting techniques, the invention may be described as ""directed to a method of peer-to-peer payments using electronic cash."" However, under Alice, a peer-to-peer electronic payment is likely to be considered a ""fundamental economic practice"" and, therefore, an unpatentable abstract idea.  If, however, the invention is described as being “directed to an improved ledger data structure (the blockchain) for use in an electronic cash payment method,” it is arguably an improvement in computer technology and should not be considered merely an abstract idea. (Of course, the patent application must also describe and properly claim that improved ledger data structure).  Why should we expect that an improved ledger data structure in the form of a blockchain is sufficient under Mayo to provide something “significantly more”?  Well, it just so happens that the Federal Circuit, held that a claim to an improved data structure, specifically a self-referential spreadsheet, was patent eligible. In fact, the court determined that the improved data structure was patent eligible under the first Mayo step – as being not an abstract idea (Enfish vs Microsoft, May 2016).  Since Enfish, the Federal Circuit has cautiously continued to expand the exceptions-to-the-exception.  In mid-2016, in Bascom Global Internet Services vs AT&T Mobility, the Federal Circuit clarified the patent eligibility of new combinations of old elements.  Before Bascom, it was thought that combinations of well-known functions were likely to be considered abstract ideas. The Bascom decision put an end to that thought.  The court held that:  “The inventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizing that each claim element, by itself, was known in the art. As is the case here, an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.”  Moreover, the Federal Circuit has recognized that certain computer-automated tasks performed by a computer, utilizing a limited set of novel software instructions that do not include all ways of performing the task, can be patent eligible. Specifically, a “claim [that] uses the limited rules in a process specifically designed to achieve an improved technological result in a conventional industry practice” is not an abstract idea (MCRO vs Bandai, September 2016).  And, for the sake of completeness, if Nakamoto applied for a patent by submitting a more traditional description of his bitcoin invention, and had his claims rejected as patent-ineligible subject matter, all may not be lost.  Nakamoto might still find refuge in the second step of the Mayo analysis by showing that his invention was “significantly more” than an abstract idea. In order to do so, the patent application itself would need to describe that “significantly more” technological addition.  Avoiding the rabbit hole  While it is interesting that Nakamoto could have patented the blockchain, the question on many minds is what blockchain inventions remain patentable in view of his prior art?  Without getting into too much detail, the Nakamoto method involves hashing, encrypting with a public key and private key, solving a proof of work hashing problem, and storing the proven transactions in a chain of blocks.  One can argue that the Nakamoto paper and the use of the bitcoin network since 2009 make such hashing, encrypting, solving a proof of work problem and (block)chaining all routine activities that cannot constitute something “significantly more” under Mayo.  Nevertheless, under recent Federal Circuit interpretations of Mayo and Alice, improvements in blockchain data structures, in solving proof of work problems, and in encryption and hashing functions have the potential to be patent-eligible subject matter.  Even new arrangements of the known functions Nakamoto described and implemented may be patent-eligible. Furthermore, it may be possible to patent narrowly crafted software implementations of blockchain technology.  With the right approach, the careful blockchain inventor should be able to avoid the “abstract idea” rabbit-hole and earn a new patent on the blockchain.

42427148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoFh,1479168062,UNICEF Just Invested in its First Blockchain Startup,"The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has invested in a South African blockchain startup as part of a broader technology innovation push.  UNICEF indicated in February that it was looking to fund projects focused on the tech through an innovation fund launched last year. At the time, UNICEF said it was looking at the areas of digital identity and remittances as possible areas of investment, and UNICEF later moved to hire a point person on blockchain.  Now, the organization is starting to cut checks to companies working in areas that enhance its mission to promote child and family welfare. UNICEF has invested in five startups, including South Africa-based 9Needs, which is using blockchain to develop identity tools for early childhood education.  9Needs is receiving roughly $100,000 in investment, which will be used to further scale the platform it has already developed.  Chris Fabian, who leads UNICEF’s Office of Innovation Ventures, said the organization opted to fund 9Needs as it not only promotes social progress, but has what it considers a viable path to profit.  Fabian told CoinDesk:  “The sense of the company we got of the company, in talks with them, they seem like a really cohesive group of people using a sophisticated technology to solve a pressing set of problems.”  Next steps  The work happening at UNICEF isn’t taking place in a vacuum, as the UN has been doing its own trials as well.  The UN’s Alternative Financing Lab has spent the last year testing the tech for uses in microfinance and connected devices, and last month, the UN diplomatic missions from Bangladesh and El Salvador organized a meeting to discuss, in part, how blockchain could help the organization meet some of its global sustainability goals.  But UNICEF’s work isn’t done with this batch of startups, however.  According to Fabian, the initial batch of startups represents just the first step in a broader push to find and fund companies. UNICEF will begin accepting applications for its next round beginning to tomorrow, and Fabian said that UNICEF could invest in as many as five to ten blockchain startups in future rounds.  Perhaps most notably, Fabian suggested that UNICEF’s work with blockchain startups could one day lead to the organization itself integrating aspects of the tech to change how it operates.  “I believe that there is a very near future where we will be using blockchain, the bitcoin blockchain maybe, other distributed ledgers, to do central operational tasks,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “I don’t know what the sum total of those would be, but for us, investing in a company lets us start to see some of that future.”  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the name of the startup 9Needs. This has been corrected.
