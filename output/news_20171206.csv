The former U.S. Congressman from Texas is currently holding a poll on his official Twitter account that asks in which form they would take $10,000 from a ""wealthy person"". The catch: you can't get rid of it for 10 years.      Paul – who earlier this year called for the U.S. government to ""stay out"" of bitcoin – put the question to his more than 650,000 followers, asking if they would take $10,000 in the form of bitcoin, dollars, gold or 10-year U.S. Treasury Bonds. The result thus far – one hour remains in the poll at press time – indicate that of the more than 68,000 responses, 54 percent expressed support for bitcoin.      Gold took the second-highest amount with 36 percent, followed by a mere 8 percent for the 10-year bonds. Just 2 percent indicated that they would take the Federal Reserve Notes if offered.

42428205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6b3h,1512583209,Naval Ravikant: Bitcoin Solves 'Money Problems',"Bitcoin's eye-popping price movements have some observers saying the market is in bubble territory.  But while he's not ruling it out entirely, Naval Ravikant, the co-founder of AngelList, holds a less alarmist view. ""Money is a bubble that never pops,"" he said at yesterday's Token Summit II in San Francisco.  He told attendees:  ""It's a consensus hallucination.""  And speaking to the newfound attention to bitcoin, Ravikant said people are interested in growing the wealth that they have. With most savings accounts returning zero these days – as central banks conduct what Ravikant called their ""grand money printing experiment"" – the general public is looking for alternative places to store their money and watch it grow.  Bitcoin and other protocols seem to offer that, as even the less-developed cryptocurrencies are showing substantial returns.  ""I think people are looking to solve their money problems,"" he said.  Yet at the same time, he warned that some of the cryptocurrency industry has been overhyped. In particular, Ravikant believes the market puts way too much faith in the concept of decentralization.  ""One indicator we are in a very frothy environment is we have a lot of tokens trading at very high values that are junk,"" he said, without specifically naming any. ""Right now, I think the market isn't distinguishing quality.""  Having said that though, Ravikant concluded that the cryptocurrency economy is here to stay.  In fact, he gave the audience some insight into what cryptocurrencies he's interested in. These include bitcoin, for storing value; zcash, for transacting easily; basecoin, to act as a stable unit of account; and tezzies, to access the Tezos smart contract platform.

42428196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6alh,1512579637,Lightning At Last? Bitcoin Scaling Layer Almost Ready,"Bitcoin's long wait for the Lightning Network is almost over.  Announced today, the startups behind the three most active Lightning implementations have revealed test results, including live transactions, proving their software is now interoperable.  The findings, released by ACINQ, Blockstream and Lightning Labs, effectively bring Lightning (the mechanism many see as the best solution for increasing bitcoin's capacity) closer to public launch.  And while admittedly technical, today's announcement offers evidence that makes it seem like enthusiasts will soon get their wish.  Firstly, the Lightning specifications, in progress since last September, have entered version 1. These describe the rules of the network, comparable to the standards that prop up the internet.  While that's not to say the specifications won't evolve over time, they've now been deemed good enough to support the first real Lightning Network.  According to the founder of ACINQ, Pierre-Marie Padiou:  ""This is the Lightning standard we've been working on for more than year. There's been a lot of work from us and from all participants. It's a big milestone.""  Secondly, all the implementations have been shown to be compatible with one another, based on Blockstream engineer Christian Decker's over 70 tests, which he put together over the summer.  And last, but not least, as displayed with the two live transactions, the three main implementations of Lightning are indeed interoperable, a piece of the puzzle that developers have been working on since last year.  ""We've been able to make successful payments on the mainnet that goes all around the world, and which involves different compatible implementations,"" Padiou said. ""That's kind of a big deal.""  Interoperable, at last  While Lightning is still not ready for public use, Padiou emphasized that interoperability between the implementations is key to continuing development.  With the specifications complete, other developers now know what rules to implement to build their own Lightning networks. Bitcoin startup Blockchain's Thunder Network and MIT's Lit, for example, are two other well-known Lightning projects that could one day also implement the specifications.  And this compatibility between implementations has now been demonstrated with two test transactions, showing how Lightning could be used in the future for small value payments.  One transaction was routed through Blockstream's C-Lightning nodes to ACINQ's fake coffee app Starblocks (a play on Starbucks), which sells ""Blockaccinos"" for 0.015 mBTC.  The other transaction unlocked a blog post on the content platform Yalls. The process used ACINQ's Eclair wallet to send a tiny fee through C-Lightning to Yalls, which runs on Lightning Labs' LND software.  The engineers conducted both of these Lightning payments with nodes scattered across the globe, Padiou said.  ""It's a very small network, but it demonstrates how the interoperability works,"" Padiou said, adding that this highlights a live proof-of-concept for the scaling mechanism.  No rush  But there's still one more step before users can take advantage of Lightning: releasing mainnet software.  According to Padiou, each implementation needs to release beta software for the mainnet that allows bitcoin users to make real payments over the Lightning Network for the first time.  And while many are excited about the opportunity, that software will need plenty of work before the dream of paying for morning lattes (and everything else) using bitcoin is realized.  In conversation, Lightning developers stressed there are kinks left to work out with the user experience before they recommend businesses adopt it.  Padiou argued that this cautious approach to development shows developers are making sure they get the technology just right, so as to eliminate the chance of users losing funds.  ""It also demonstrates the approach has been very conservative. We're not going to rush anything,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We're almost there.""

42428182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6aXh,1512579606,Encyclopedia Blockchainica: Wikipedia Co-Founder to Disrupt His Own Creation,"A co-founder of Wikipedia doesn't like what Wikipedia has become.  Dr. Larry Sanger has been an outspoken critic of the online encyclopedia he helped found for some time, but his latest move, joining venture-backed startup Everipedia as its chief information officer shows just how serious he is about disrupting the model.  Revealed today alongside news of Sanger's hire, Everipedia is moving the entire process of approving articles, making edits and storing information to the EOS blockchain.  According to the Everipedia team, using smart contracts to record the editing workflow and store articles stands to create a truly censorship-proof system. And by incentivizing contributors with a cryptocurrency token, the company hopes it can create a platform for more accurate information.  In interview, Sanger explained his decision to join the startup as part of what he considers the next evolution of online encyclopedias.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The biggest problem with online information today is that it is centralized and controlled by a very few players, that it benefits to have the most salacious and hype-ridden information. We can do much better.""  Tradeable IQ?  In an unpublished draft of Everipedia's white paper provided to CoinDesk, the company details how this move to blockchain might create an improved Wikipedia.  Instead of a centralized server, content would be hosted by nodes – similar to how bitcoin's ledger of transactions is held. But as has been clear throughout this year's scaling debates, many of the largest blockchains in the space would face significant challenges storing the amount of data needed for an online encyclopedia.  In an effort to steer clear of those hurdles, Everipedia explored a number of platforms to host the smart contracts that execute the logic around contributing and editing articles, including the Plasma framework designed for ethereum.  In the end, however, the startup settled on a combination of the EOS blockchain unveiled in June and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) — a sort of decentralized server — that will be used to store the more data-heavy files including video and images.  Also using the EOS blockchain, the company plans to develop a cryptocurrency token called IQ to incentivize the creation of content. Editors and curators will then ""mine"" that cryptocurrency by making accurate, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia.  ""Just like miners who find blocks get newly minted bitcoin, these editors who are voted to have a very good state-change proposal get newly minted tokens,"" said Everipedia co-founder and white paper co-author Sam Kazemian.  According to the white paper, which hasn't been formalized, 50 percent of the total 100 million ""IQ"" tokens will be distributed in an initial coin offering (ICO) and 30 percent will be ""minted"" over 100 years to pay out editors and validators for their work.  To supplement $1 million the company previously raised from Mucker Capital, an additional 20 percent of the tokens will be set aside to pay development costs.  Ground to cover  Similar to the mission of many blockchain startups, Everipedia set out to eliminate the bureaucracy the startups' founders thought allowed a relatively small number of people to be gatekeepers on Wikipedia.  The founder and CEO of Everipedia, Theodor Forselius, argues that contrary to Wikipedia's original mission to tap the wisdom of the crowd, the online encyclopedia's editorial hierarchy has resulted in a slanted view of history and a decreasing number of editors.  ""Essentially, a doctor from the 1800s that gets five searches a month on Google could have a Wikipedia article,"" said Forselius. ""But bloggers, social media stars and up-and-coming rappers that are getting hundreds of thousands of searches a month were not seen as notable enough.""  Yet, Everipedia's ostensibly more democratic process hasn't always resulted in numbers or accuracy to compete with Wikipedia. For instance, whereas Wikipedia offers 43 million pages and has about 136 million active users, Everipedia only has about six million pages and 2.3 million unique users.  While there's a long way to go, Sanger believes the company can implement a blockchain solution to rival Wikipedia in as little as nine months.  ""The vision that I have for the next stage of the evolution of encyclopedias is what this team is implementing,"" he said, adding:  ""It opens up so many doors when information is truly decentralized and offered in a protocol such as blockchain.""

According to Reuters, the bill cleared the Mexican Senate on Dec. 5, setting the stage for its consideration and potential passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the legislature. Citing sources familiar with the process, Reuters reported that the bill is expected to clear the Chamber of Deputies on Dec. 15.  As previously reported, the measure, as currently written, would clarify that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Mexico. Further, exchanges and other companies that handle cryptocurrencies would be officially regulated by the Banco de Mexico, Mexico's central bank.  The goal of the change is to provide legal clarity for companies, including those working with bitcoin, that are creating new kinds of products and services.  Yet, as Reuters highlights, the finer details of the bill are still being ironed out, as so-called secondary laws are expected to further build on the measure.  Statements from officials at the Banco de Mexico offer insight into how the central bank might go about regulating cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, Agustin Carstens, the institution's governor, was quoted by local media as saying that bitcoin should be considered more akin to a commodity than a currency.

42428186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6abh,1512561660,Coders Beware: Licensing Issues Abound for Ether Apps,"Matt Savare and John Wintermute work at Lowenstein Sandler LLP, where they practice intellectual property, digital advertising, technology, blockchain and privacy law. Shailley Singh is the senior director for product and R&D at IAB Tech Lab.      Despite the incredible amount of attention blockchain technology has garnered in the last year, very little has been reported on the open-source licensing issues and related risks developers face when using ethereum as a foundation for their own applications.  Many developers may not understand (or willfully ignore) the unique risks when utilizing open-source software. (These risks are not present in bitcoin, because the bitcoin blockchain, unlike the ethereum blockchain, is not a platform upon which developers can easily create decentralized applications using open-source code.)  The Ethereum Foundation currently utilizes a variety of open-source licenses for ethereum's different components. To make matters more complicated, the body has indicated that it has not yet selected a final open-source license on which the core of ethereum will be made available in the future.  For this reason, developers of ethereum-based applications should identify, understand and address these risks and limitations.  Utilization of ethereum involves a number of business and legal issues, but perhaps none are more pressing for an ethereum-based app developer than what is usually a straightforward question: what are my rights to use ethereum?  The answer, it turns out, is not so simple.  When 'free' isn’t free  The Ethereum Foundation promises that ethereum ""is both open-source software and Free software after the definition of the Free Software Foundation (so-called FLOSS)."" In other words, licensees will generally receive broad rights to run, copy, distribute and improve the software.  Beyond this basic premise, however, things get uncertain.  As any seasoned open-source software developer knows, ""free"" software does not mean ""free of restriction,"" neither does it necessarily mean ""free of cost,"" though it often is. Those restrictions, which can disrupt the core of a downstream developer's business model, are particularly complicated when it comes to ethereum.  Open-source software, which is premised upon the notion that every software licensee should receive a program's source code and the ability to modify the software for its own purposes, generally falls into one of two broad categories: ""permissive"" and ""restrictive.""  Permissive-type licenses, which include MIT, BSD and Apache, contain minimal restrictions and grant broad rights to licensees to use and modify the covered software and to re-distribute the modifications on the licensee's own preferred terms.  For commercial developers, permissive licenses are generally considered safer than restrictive licenses, because they do not run the risk of ""tainting"" any developments or modifications with the open-source terms of the in-licensed software.  The MIT License, for instance, requires only a copyright notice, a disclaimer, and that the disclaimer and notice be passed along to any downstream licensees. A developer is free to take software that is licensed pursuant to the MIT License and to re-license any modifications or derivative works as part of a standard commercial offering.  Infectious licenses  Restrictive-type licenses, or ""copyleft"" licenses, include the Mozilla Public License, General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL and Affero GPL.  In contrast to permissive licenses, these licenses restrict a licensee's ability to distribute modifications and derivative works under commercial or non-open-source terms.  Copyleft licenses are also called ""viral licenses,"" because they may potentially ""infect"" a software product with the open-source terms of the underlying copyleft program, leaving a licensee unable to distribute a modified or derivative version for a fee or in non-source form.  Depending on the copyleft license, there may be ways to utilize the open-source software in a way that does not infect the overall product, and the manner of use that will trigger the terms of the viral license is often a complicated and fact-specific question.  Thus, the use of open-source software, while tremendously valuable, carries levels of risk that must be parsed before in-licensing any open-source product.  At the highest level of risk, a developer may jeopardize the entire proprietary value of a project.  Conflicting views  For developers seeking to understand the implications of licensing ethereum for use in their businesses, the Ethereum Foundation complicates this already sensitive issue in two ways: first, by leveraging a variety of open-source licenses for ethereum's various components; and second, by remaining indecisive as to the future licensing scheme of ethereum, particularly the ethereum core.  According to the licensing section of ethereum's GitHub page, applications will be distributed under GPL, and the middleware will be made available under a version of the Affero GPL. Both licenses are restrictive in nature, and therefore limit a licensee's ability to re-license modifications or developments on commercial terms.  They differ, however, in the definition of ""distribution"" that triggers the viral restrictions in each license. Affero's wrinkle is that remote interaction via the web is sufficient to trigger a requirement that an Affero licensee make generally available the source code of its own developments and modifications.  In other words, a licensee of an Affero-covered software product might wish to make modifications or improvements to the underlying software and to make that improved product available as software-as-a-service, but in that case, the source code of the entire derivative work must be made available to users interacting with it. Obviously, this requirement is often prohibitive for a developer wishing to retain the product's proprietary value.  The Ethereum Foundation explains that ethereum ""is distributed under several licenses"" in part ""to reflect the different thinking of the minds behind different pieces of software.""  These conflicting views are also apparent in that the Ethereum Foundation indicates that it has not selected a final license for the core of ethereum, which includes the consensus engine, the networking code and supporting libraries.  Unresolved questions  Although the Ethereum Foundation states that the ""core of ethereum will be released under the most liberal of licenses,"" it cites the MIT License, Mozilla Public License and LGPL as the three leading candidates – the latter two of which are actually copyleft in nature (albeit generally considered to be ""weak copyleft"" licenses).  The goal, according to the foundation, is to make the core ""available for use in any commercial environment, closed or open source.""  To make matters more complicated, cpp-ethereum, which contains all of ethereum's core libraries, appears to be currently licensed under the GPL.  Not only does this conflict with the foundation's indication that the final core licenses are undetermined, but it is not even among the options listed by the foundation for consideration. The GPL is neither a permissive license nor a ""weak copyleft"" one. Rather, it contains significant restrictions on downstream modification and redistribution.  The current utilization of a strong copyleft license and the apparent uncertainty as to the final licensing scheme pose potentially material risks for developers.  Until the final license is determined, developers of ethereum-based applications are subject to any shifts or divisions in the philosophy behind the licensing of ethereum – a philosophy the Ethereum Foundation freely admits already contains rifts among the various stakeholders.  Tread carefully  None of this is to say that developers should not utilize ethereum or that the Ethereum Foundation is doing anything wrong in its approach.  Rather, commercial developers need to understand the complications of open-source licensing and the unique wrinkles in the context of ethereum.  The downside of underestimating or misjudging the risks is far too great.

Bank Indonesia's head of transformation, Onny Widjanarko, said yesterday that the bank is seeking the ban due to concerns over bitcoin's potential use in terrorism financing, money laundering and drug trafficking.  The central bank, which has the authority to decide policy on monetary affairs, is currently conducting a review to determine whether bitcoin would be regulated under existing e-money rules or in a separate framework addressing cryptocurrencies.  According to a report by The Jakarta Post, he stated:  ""Currently, there is no single regulation for those who carry out transactions using bitcoin.""  The official further appealed to merchants not to accept bitcoin as a payment, saying Bank Indonesia would not be responsible for the losses incurred via bitcoin transactions.  Should Indonesia follow through with the plans, it would join other nations such as China in cracking down on cryptocurrencies.

42428181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6aVh,1512550817,The Next CryptoKitties? The Blockchain Might Not Be Ready,"If CryptoKitties didn't come up in every single session at Token Summit II, it came close enough.  But the insanely viral trading game running on ethereum was most often cited, not as a success, but as an example of industry challenges. As put forward by developers and entrepreneurs, the world's second-largest blockchain just isn't ready to handle the buying, trading and mating of the crypto felines en masse.  As the panels proved, though, the problem is bigger than ethereum and CryptoKitties alone.  Scaling issues also influenced Earn.com's decision to create a token this year, and onstage, CEO Balaji Srinivasan spoke to a ""philosophical split"" in approaches to bitcoin that led to the decision.  Brian Hoffman, CEO of OB1, the startup that manages the e-commerce platform OpenBazaar, struck a similar chord in a talk in which he announced his company's plans to launch a token that will be used in conjunction with bitcoin.  Hoffman told the audience:  ""You have to have a transactional currency that really works. Bitcoin fees are super high. It's really slow.""  And developers largely agreed.  ""Everyone in this space should be putting the pedal to the metal on experimentation,"" said Joseph Poon, co-author of the ethereum scaling proposal Plasma (as well as bitcoin's Lightning proposal).  User experience  But rapid growth on blockchain networks creates other kinds of choke points as well, and MyEtherWallet founder Taylor Monahan spoke to the challenges that have come from the company's rocket-like growth over the last year.  ""We were not ready to scale at that level,"" Monahan said.  In January, MyEtherWallet was seeing about 5,000 transactions per day. The last time she looked, it was more like 150,000.  Some are pointing to this increased adoption as a sign of positive momentum, and while they're right, it's not that easy, according to Monahan. For one, these new users don't exactly understand the product – the company gets requests on a regular basis from people who don't understand that MyEtherWallet doesn't hold their keys and doesn't have the ability to recover lost funds, she said.  Despite the company's efforts to educate new users, it hasn't been able to overcome the hurdle that these new users just assume the provider can restore anyone's access to any service.  Monahan said she's had to reorient her thinking to new people, not the hacker or the crypto-enthusiast she built the service for.  ""I'm no longer our user,” she said. The statements help illustrate ways in which blockchain infrastructure isn't ready for growth, even with users now hooked on CryptoKitties.  Long arm of the law  Regulation may be another choke point, and crypto attorneys assembled for the event seemed to generally agree that the U.S. wouldn't roll out a crypto-oriented regulatory framework anytime soon.  Coinbase board member and Stanford Law School professor Kathryn Haun said, ""I think the odds of a new regulatory regime are pretty slim.""  Instead, she predicted the SEC would go after specific tokens in the event investors lost significant funds. Other panelists offered similar predictions. This, in turn, will put entrepreneurs in the position of interpreting court cases about bad actors rather than rules written for well-intentioned actors, much as a former SEC attorney recently warned.  But, Nancy Wojtas of Cooley LLP, a law firm that has represented a lot of crypto efforts, threw a little shade on the SEC chair's recent comments in which he suggested most ICOs were securities.  ""How many has he looked at? Three?"" she asked.  Follow the money  More formal regulatory guidance, though, isn't the only lagging necessity. Naval Ravikant, CEO of AngelList, summed up 2017 by saying that he doesn't believe innovation has caught up with sky-high cryptocurrency prices.  ""It may take five or 10 years before many of these problems get solved,"" he said.  Even worse, he argued, the industry may eventually learn that some of the protocols are inevitably centralizing.  For example, he said, ""It may just be that the proof-of-work function forces centralization.""  So, as bitcoin increases block difficulty, it could make oligopolies of miners inevitable. If that proves to be true, it would fundamentally call into question the virtues of the original cryptocurrency, and many others.  ""There are still things that could go catastrophically wrong,"" he said.  That perspective helps to illustrate some of the urgency developers feel as they build out structures they hope can lighten these networks' loads.  In fact, while Jae Kwon of blockchain project Cosmos said he wants to see CryptoKitties succeed, he eventually admitted helping expand blockchains for digital cats isn't his top priority.  He concluded:  ""All I care about is making sure we have a viable, scaleable alternative to the fiat monopoly system.""

42428189,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6adh,1512543646,Nokia Trials Blockchain in Bid to Secure Health Data,"Finnish communications giant Nokia has announced a new blockchain pilot aimed at developing new ways to store healthcare data.  In a press release on its website  , Nokia announced that it had begun the project with OP Financial Group. One hundred participants are taking part in a bid to test how they could store and share their health data while also enjoying a degree of privacy around that information.  The companies are using a blockchain due to the security features it offers, according to Nokia’s website. The software allows the company to control access to the data being collected, ensuring that only verified parties can access it.  As Nokia explained in its announcement:  ""While the value of connected health data is widely recognised, it is often not leveraged to its full potential due to authenticity, availability and privacy concerns. Trust is a vital requirement in order for health data to provide the greatest benefit to individuals, families and our global society.""  The program uses wearable devices to track daily steps and hours of sleep, storing this data on a blockchain. These results are compared to users’ fitness goals. Users who meet or make progress toward these goals will receive loyalty points depending on their participation in the pilot.  Nokia said that it believes this program can help develop ""insights on global health issues"" – provided that users trust the systems being used, that is.  OP Financial’s laboratory head, Kristian Luoma, said this pilot program is an example of how blockchain can be applied to health programs in the future, particularly to applications which require trust from users.  Nokia was one of a number of technology firms to join the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project in late 2016.

In a short statement published on Dec. 5, the central bank expressed caution to ""users, holders and traders"" of cryptocurrencies, naming bitcoin in particular. It echoes remarks issued in February, a release that came several years after it first warned Indian citizens about the tech in late 2013.  As with those prior releases, RBI said that it had not moved to license any company in India to work with cryptocurrencies, stating:  ""...RBI has clarified that it has not given any licence/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any digital currency.""  The new release, in a departure from the previous statements, includes a warning regarding initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales. It also highlights a ""significant spurt"" in the value of the overall cryptocurrency market.  ""In the wake of [the] significant spurt in the valuation of many VCs and rapid growth in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), RBI reiterates the concerns conveyed in the earlier press releases,"" the central bank said.  The move also comes amid a period of uncertainty around cryptocurrency regulation in India. As reported last month, the Indian Supreme Court asked the government there to respond to a petition seeking clarity on the matter. Officials from several government agencies have been working on a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, but to date, no official policies have been made public.  RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the new release.
