42403917,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1cU,1580421615,"Few Banks Will Touch Crypto Firms, but Silvergate Wants to Touch Bitcoin Itself","Silvergate Bank is venturing even further into a field where few financial institutions dare to tiptoe.      The La Jolla, Calif., lender made a name for itself providing hard-to-come-by U.S.-dollar banking services for businesses that deal in cryptocurrency. But now Silvergate wants to handle digital assets themselves.      While the bank has no such services on its roadmap yet, it has applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto. One example of this might look like “providing settlement services for their bitcoin trades,” Silvergate CEO Alan J. Lane said.      In this scenario, Silvergate would be the intermediary ensuring settlement of a fiat-for-bitcoin exchange between two participants on its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a payments platform that allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges.      ""In order for us to be able to be that trusted intermediary, we have to be able to touch the digital assets ourselves,” Lane said. ""Think about it as if Silvergate also had the ability to be the SEN for bitcoin.""      The service, almost certainly the first of its kind offered by a U.S. commercial bank, wouldn’t apply to retail investors or institutional investors that are already comfortable with bitcoin as an asset class.      “It’s folks that aren’t quite ready to be in the business, and part of the reason is because this doesn’t exist,” Lane said, emphasizing the bank doesn’t yet have a product in mind to solve the problem. “Our current customers, they’ve already figured out a way to get comfortable with this, but they tell us there are other counterparties out there that they’re not yet doing business with because they don’t have a trusted way to settle.”      Lane spoke to CoinDesk Wednesday after Silvergate’s first conference call as a publicly traded company. Earlier in the day it had reported fourth-quarter results, including a 6 percent increase in crypto clients and a 4 percent decrease in deposits from those clients.    Coming soon    Silvergate Bank’s 2020 will be characterized by staff getting the bank’s bitcoin-collateralized margin lending running well and solving other pain points in the digital asset industry, Lane said.      Salary expenses climbed nearly 6 percent from a year earlier to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of this went toward customer service and software engineers, Lane said when asked what share of the expenses was from compliance costs.      The bank does spend money on compliance, of course: Silvergate uses both Chainalysis and Elliptic, Lane said. These vendors analyze the public blockchains to flag suspicious activity, which banks are required under Federal Reserve regulations to report.      With $2.1 billion in assets, Silvergate is a relatively small institution, 0.07 percent the size of JPMorgan. The asset side of its balance sheet looks like a traditional community lender, composed mainly of real estate loans. But that may start to evolve soon.      In the immediate future, Silvergate's biggest focus is its pilot of the SEN Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin.      Since the 90-to-180-day pilot will include only SEN participants, the bank will be able to monitor SEN Leverage loans more closely than it could other types of loans.      “We will be able to monitor the loan, the collateral underlying the loan and the balance of the loan, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Lane said. “We’ll be able to monitor this much more closely than we can monitor just about any other loan we make.”      In response to questions from analysts in the company’s earnings call about yield on SEN loans, Lane said, “The way we’ve thought about this initially is this would likely be a high single-digit type of cost to the borrower.”      In the interview, Lane emphasized the bank wouldn’t take advantage of crypto customers on SEN loans just because other banks aren’t offering the same product. “We’re certainly not going to poke their eyes out on what we’re charging them,” Lane said.      Silvergate is also working to increase the number of fiat currencies it supports for foreign exchange transactions on the SEN to include at least the top five to 10 major global currencies. From fourth-quarter 2018 to fourth-quarter 2019, volume on the SEN increased by 150 percent to an all-time high of 14,400 transactions handling $9.6 billion.      “Our customers are saying, ‘We’d love to have the SEN for the euro and the SEN for the yen,’” Lane said. “That involves having correspondent banking relationships with banks in those areas where those currencies are predominant and then being able to create a similar type of network as to what we’ve created with the SEN.”    Dry powder    Taking Silvergate public has given the crypto industry a clearer window into the bank's business. It also positions Silvergate to more easily raise capital should the need arise.      Currently, Silvergate has a 10.5 percent leverage ratio, meaning the bank has more than twice the amount of capital required by banking regulators (5 percent).      ""On that metric alone, we could double the size of the bank and not run out of capital,"" Lane said. ""That's just one metric, and I'm not suggesting we would do that … but if we saw that leverage ratio going down to 8 percent, we would look to raise additional capital.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/30/few-banks-will-touch-crypto-firms-but-silvergate-wants-to-touch-bitcoin-itself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b0bd7ae795e0499d0e1f82008185751bed3de84-2560x1910.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If convicted, Griffith would face a maximum of 20 years in jail.      Assistant U.S Attorney Michael Krouse said Thursday the government has already produced an initial set of documents for discovery, including statements Griffith made to the FBI. The government anticipates making a second production within two weeks.      Klein, Griffith's attorney, asked Judge P. Kevin Castel if the defense would be able to obtain records pertaining to any interviews the FBI held with other conference attendees, particularly any attendees who might be able to refute the allegations. ""We anticipate these other attendees will exonerate our client,"" Klein said.      Krouse said the defense had no basis to make the request, but the government would comply withproduction requirements under federal rules of civil procedure.      Judge Castel did not make a firm ruling on the request, instead telling Klein, ""If there's an application under [the rules], I would expect you and encourage you to make it as soon as possible.""      Klein and Krouse declined to comment after the hearing.      A status update hearing is tentatively scheduled for March 17.

For early access to new episodes, subscribe today via Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or your preferred platform.      The best way to fund open-source projects remains a question,and one that - in the context of crypto protocols - has never had higher stakes. Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen live action experiments in a number of different approaches.      Gitcoin Grants used a quadratic funding program to match grants to technology builders and media creators in Ethereum.      After months and months of concerted community debate and conversation, Zcash will implement a new Dev Fund of 20 percent of the block rewards after the Founders Reward runs out in November, splitting it between the Electric Coin Co (7 percent), Zcash Foundation (5 percent) and third-party developers (8 percent).      A consortium (cartel?) of the four largest bitcoin cash (BCH) mining pools tried to insist upon a 12.5 percent block reward diversion to a new dev fund, with a threat to orphan blocks that didn’t comply. The plan ran into a barrier when Roger Ver’s bitcoin.com backed away.      Also in this episode, @nlw looks at the latest in CBDCs - including Japan’s continued hedging that it is preparing for the possibility of needing to move quickly and Cambodia’s announcement it will be implementing a CBDC this quarter.      Finally, Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang took a few minutes to talk about cryptocurrencies and why regulation with the intent to stop them would be doomed to fail.

42403902,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzKo,1580413528,Listia Raised $15M With Its XNK ICO. Now It's Ditching the Token for Props,"Listia is discontinuing work on the Ink protocol, a cryptocurrency built for marketplaces, CoinDesk has learned.      The project was funded with a $15 million token sale for the XNK ERC-20 token, which announced results in January 2018. Listia, a used-goods marketplace, is now shifting entirely to the props network, created by Union Square Ventures–backed startup YouNow.      ""We are not shutting down anything like the team, operations or any of the new tech that we have built but, yes, we have decided to move our apps and tech on top of Props,"" Gee Chuang, Listia CEO told CoinDesk in an email.      XNK's design ""still has not been able to fulfill all the things we set out to achieve,"" Chuang wrote. After working on the technology extensively, the company began talks with Props PBC about making the switch. Chuang told CoinDesk that Listia ultimately saw an advantage in props' larger community and more advanced functionality. Additionally, everything built for XNK will work with props, he said.      ""We believe a staking token like Props could be more effective in empowering our users compared with a medium of exchange token like XNK, and that the Props setup and scale could be beneficial,"" Chuang added.      The XNK token sale was backed by ConsenSys Ventures and Tetras Capital, among others. Listia is a venture-backed company with investors including SV Angel, Founders Collective, General Catalyst and the Andreessen Horowitz Seed Fund, according to Chuang. XNK was listed on Coinbase Wallet in August 2018.    One of many?    This places XNK at the beginning of what may be an emerging trend of ICO projects winding down.      Digix DAO, a tokenized precious metals project, voted to liquidate its $64 million treasury earlier this month.      ""All XNK users will be able to convert their XNK to Props within the app as part of the integration,"" Chuang told CoinDesk in an email, adding that it ""should be quite seamless for users.""      The conversion rate will be 114 XNK for one props token. At current prices for XNK, that values props at about $0.068 per token‬. ""They are giving us a bunch of props to use,"" Chuang said of his deal with YouNow.      Listia will also be exchanging the XNK held in its reserve at the same conversion rate, using the pool of props it received from YouNow. According to the Ink white paper, 66 percent of tokens from the generation event were retained by Listia to fund network growth.      XNK is most actively traded on the Bibox crypto exchange, according to CoinMarketCap, as well as Upbit, IDEX and over the Bancor protocol. Props is not yet tracked by Messari or CoinMarketCap because it has not yet been listed on exchanges.      There is very little ETH remaining from the XNK token sale, in USD terms, according to Chuang. The sale was conducted at the market peak in late 2017. ""We are huge believers in the whole ecosystem,"" Chuang said. ""We've been holding all the way down,"" except for when it was necessary to sell to fund business operations, he said.      So far, XNK has been used on Listia and another site the company created called Replin. Chuang said the cryptocurrency was also integrated with another e-commerce site, Everyday Carry.      ""Using Props, I think we can realize the goal of spreading our tech and token usage to more outside partners and apps much more quickly than we have been able to,"" Chuang wrote.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/30/listia-raised-15m-with-its-xnk-ico-now-its-ditching-the-token-for-props,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71e0c05bcb36a3a7e52902c6adb115289e46f32d-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403911,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzTf,1580411813,Exchange Tokens: Neither a Great Investment Nor a Great Market Indicator,"They're definitely not equity, but could ""exchange tokens"" be bellwethers for one of crypto's best use cases? (Spoiler: Probably not)      Among thousands of venture-backed startups, tokens, coins, blockchains and open-source technology projects, exchange operators now stand out among the top revenue getters in the crypto asset category. Coinbase, not the largest by trading volume even among exchanges whose trade data is trusted, reported $173 million in 2018 non-U.S. revenue, leading Reuters to estimate Coinbase’s global revenue as north of $500 million.      If crypto has proven itself in one use case, it is as a volatile asset for investors hungry to speculate. Our estimate of exchange operators’ fee-based revenue shows this to be true.      As such, crypto tokens issued by the exchanges themselves could be among the most useful digital assets in circulation. ""Exchange tokens,"" as they are called, offer holders discounts on trading fees and other benefits. This doesn’t make them anything like equity claims on exchange revenue, which several analysts have pointed out, no matter what buyback mechanisms are employed. It does make them much like the ""utility tokens"" issued in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 and 2018 - or like air miles - and some investors in these tokens embrace that narrative.      Unlike air miles, exchange tokens trade freely on a variety of venues. As such it’s surprising that, despite the success of their issuers, the tokens themselves have not been more successful as investments. The table below shows the one-, three-, six-, nine- and 12-month returns of Binance's BNB, Huobi's HT, Bitfinex's LEO and OKEx's OKB, the four exchange tokens that make up the exchange token index provided by FTX, a derivatives exchange operator, as of Jan. 28 (data via Nomics).      The benefits to traders, however, can be significant. According to Binance’s fee schedule, the top tier of BNB token holders must today hold about $176,000 worth of the token and trade about $1.2 billion per month on the exchange (with BNB and BTC at current prices of about $16 and $8,000 respectively). For users trading in these volumes,top-tier BNB holdings provide fee discounts that would save them about $720,000 each month, off the standard trading fees - more, if these traders pay the fees themselves in the Binance token. They also provide access to “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs), a new asset issuance operated by the exchange.      As such, BNB and other exchange tokens might be expected to serve as indicators as to the relative success of the issuing exchanges. After all, if an open market for air miles existed, you might expect one airline’s miles to trade at a premium to another’s, depending on flyers’ perceptions of their service.      At one time, that was true of exchange tokens, but over the course of the past year it's become less and less so. For most of these exchange tokens, the correlation between price and the issuing exchanges' reported volume is weakening over time. (Unlike the exchanges in the revenue chart, not all these exchange token issuers' reported volume is rated trustworthy.)      Even as a more general metric, providing an indicator of the broad demand for crypto assets as a speculative investment, exchange tokens are a weak signal. Or, at least, they are no better than the price of bitcoin. At the same time as their prices have drifted from the reported volume of their parent exchanges, exchange tokens' daily returns have hewed more closely to those of bitcoin itself.      It's been 11 years since bitcoin was operational and you can make a case that speculation is the best-proven user narrative for the entire asset category. And it is a real use: not everyone in the world has access to volatile assets (and for some, perhaps no asset is volatile enough). For now, exchange tokens appear to be just another flavor of that volatility. Their price movements don't yet support thinking of exchange tokens as a meaningful innovation in use or ownership.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/30/exchange-tokens-neither-a-great-investment-nor-a-great-market-indicator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72142277c8924ff35a1bdd6cf131e44d9971680a-1506x904.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Camfrog is a video chat app. SimilarWeb shows its website reaching more than a million people per month. “We expect that Camfrog users will become more engaged and loyal, driven by the incentive of earning a financial stake in the network,” Jason Katz, CEO of PeerStream, the app's owner, said in a statement.      YouNow also claims it has reached over one million YouNow accounts that have earned or used props in some way, according to its block explorer.    Props' origin    As CoinDesk previously reported, YouNow raised $24 million pre-selling its props token in December 2017.      In an unusual move, the company announced in July 2019 it had received SEC approval not to sell additional props tokens, but to give them away as programmatic rewards for YouNow’s users.      This gave the ethereum-based token the distinction of operating as an SEC-approved token used by consumers.      According to SEC filings in October, the creation of props boosted YouNow's revenues, though it wasn’t enough to make the company profitable. We reported at the time the company was in talks with other social media sites to integrate the technology.      The cryptocurrency is technically governed by a Delaware public benefit corporation called Props PBC. The platform rewards third-party apps in props with new token emissions each day. Each app can then choose how to distribute those tokens to its users.      “Apps recognize that better aligning with their users is a key for business success,"" Props PBC co-founder said in a statement. ""Props is a highly effective, free and open-source tool to do that, by providing a stake in the network to the users who contribute value. We are thrilled that developers operating in different verticals – social, e-commerce, gaming – are recognizing that and are integrating Props into their apps.”      On YouNow, users can hold onto props in order to increase their status and influence on the site and to earn free gifts. Users presumably want these gifts because the more gifts they earn, the more props tokens YouNow awards them.      Neither Camfrog nor Listia have released information on how they plan to architect their props incentives.      According to a YouNow spokesperson, video sites Paltalk and XSplit Gamecaster, have also committed to incorporate props, but no details have been released on a timeline.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/30/two-social-networks-announce-plans-to-integrate-younows-props-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7ddca65c51e233b068161355d9565f463cd8ec4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403903,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzLn,1580406309,Zap's New Product Lets Merchants Take Dollars Over Lightning Network,"“You get to talk to lightning nodes with dollars.”      That’s how Zap CEO Jack Mallers described his lightning wallet’s new U.S. dollar clearing system in a phone interview with CoinDesk. Announced Thursday, the upgrade aims to address a number of hurdles faced by current cryptocurrency payment options.      “You can download it, link your bank account, your debit card and you can scan any lightning payment you want,” Mallers said. “Then it will turn around and it will debit your account so that you're using U.S. dollars to interact with the lightning protocol.”      “We're using lightning to physically clear and settle the value behind the hood,” he added.      Mallers compared Zap’s new infrastructure development to swiping a Visa card, but using Zap’s web of lightning nodes to settle charges. Since users never interact with the digital asset, evergreen crypto concerns such as taxes and volatility melt away, Mallers said.      “Merchants can accept bitcoin and lightning payments with the same infrastructure, except they never touch the asset. Soon as we get the cryptographic proof that the lightning payment was made, we just credit their bank account immediately. They're still dealing in dollars,” Mallers said.    Balance sheet exposure    Zap itself handles additional risk by operating as a quasi-clearing system. While Zap does not collect private keys to operate and maintains the same privacy standards as before, Mallers said, the startup is inherently “short” bitcoin when users transact with its new product.      “If you are wanting to send a $100 lightning payment with your Chase bank account, someone has to send that bitcoin for you and then in return we're getting dollars from your Chase account. That means that we're inherently short $100 worth of bitcoin,” he said.      In other words, for every transaction in which Zap accepts dollars, the startup’s objective book position expects bitcoin’s position to go down in price. If Zap scales to thousands of users or more, the balance sheet becomes heavily tilted. As such, Zap uses algorithms in real time to hedge its position, Mallers said.      “You don't want to have millions of dollars of bitcoin exposure one way or the other because your balance sheet would get crushed,” he said.    Lightning strikes twice    Zap’s lightning clearing system is the startup’s second major product upgrade in less than six months, with Zap integrating a fiat-to-bitcoin buying feature into its wallet last September.      As Mallers told CoinDesk, that product was misguided for commercial use cases – citing tax regulation, bitcoin’s infamous volatility and low consumer adoption for its failure. Mallers said he began looking for a change during the Lightning Conference in Berlin last October.      “Pretty much every assumption of mine was just flat out wrong,” he said of the fiat-to-bitcoin product.      As a merchant service for lightning, Mallers said Zap sits in a product niche compared to other crypto firms, fraught with its own difficulties. While Coinbase and Square’s Cash App bank on retail investors’ appetite for volatility and speculation, commerce applications demand stability, Mallers said. In its decade-long existence, bitcoin has yet to lend itself to commercial activity. Who wants to pay in bitcoin only to see the price jump 5 percent moments later?      Mallers said Zap’s wallet is positioned to bring “normies” into the crypto space for the first time, mainly because of this dollar-denominated front end.      For example, marijuana dispensaries in Boulder, Colo., are already using Zap’s new clearing service, offering discounts for joints purchased with lightning-backed dollars. (Mallers’ mother, Brooke, runs a bitcoin-accepting dispensary in Colorado.)      “[Dispensaries] are giving up to 10 percent off for people that make these payments, because marijuana businesses typically get charged around 10 percent to process a card payment or they're just not banked at all,” Mallers said.      As for his crypto-friendly alternative, Mallers said, “Merchants find it pretty easy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/30/zaps-new-product-lets-merchants-take-dollars-over-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90efe2b8edf1d49268f0cd708c65d7d26d77cf5c-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403904,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzMm,1580404542,"'One Network, Many Chains' – The Case for Blockchain Interoperability","The man who wrote Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulos, is anything but a bitcoin maximalist.      At the Blockstack Summit in San Francisco in October, he spoke about a subject that's already proving to be one of the most-watched topics going into 2020: inter-blockchain communication (IBC).      ""I find it astounding after all this time that people still try to follow this idea of ‘winner takes all.’ One coin to rule them all. One chain above all else. We're coming for ya. The flippening,"" Antonopoulos said.      The ""flippening"" is the conviction that ethereum's $19 billion market cap will one day best bitcoin's $170 billion (which is the basic idea behind any maximalism for any other cryptocurrency – ETH-heads just have a name for it). ""The data just doesn't support that hypothesis,"" Antonopoulos said.      Still, it's not a position crypto OGs love to embrace, which explains why the very first thing Antonopoulos says in his talk is: ""I bring you heresy.""      In short, he argues there will be many distributed blockchains in the future and that many of them will be quite useful.      And he is not alone in that conviction.    A multichain future    ""We're going to continue to see blockchains get built with very specialized ideas in mind,"" Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz told CoinDesk. Just look to bitcoin owning value and ethereum owning smart contracts, he said. ""Mass adoption will be more likely in the future of interconnected blockchains,"" Lallouz added.      In short, look for developers to choose between distributed networks in the same way they choose between coding languages like Haskell and Python today.      ""As a company, we're pretty bullish on this idea and bullish on protocols like Cosmos and Polkadot that are being built directly to service the interconnected blockchain nature of the future in our ecosystem,"" Lallouz wrote.      There have been other developments in the space, too, such as ETH-oriented Loom reaching the Tron and Binance chains and Summa providing interoperability solutions. So much investment has gone into this category of solutions that the IBC future is probably something like a consensus position across the industry.      In fact, if Antonopoulos had a contrarian take it was this: The optimal interoperability solution is already here, and it is bitcoin's most popular Layer 2 technology, the lightning network.      It could be years before it's clear which solution companies rally around, but broadly speaking, IBC is like every big trend in crypto: Not everyone sees it the same way.      ""Personally, I believe that the rising tide lifts all boats and that many projects can benefit from the efforts of each other,"" Bruce Fenton, founder of the Bitcoin Association and the Satoshi Roundtable, told CoinDesk. Fenton is now focused on a new cryptocurrency, ravencoin.      Keld van Schreven, a co-founder of crypto investment firm KR1, argued IBC yields an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.      ""Without IBC we will just have a limited horizon of possibility,"" he said.      Van Schreven sees the shift to IBC as a sort of enlightenment moment for the technology, even taking it so far as to suggest that it might “reduce the tribalism” that plagues the crypto ecosystem.      But it's one thing to propose interoperability and another thing to actually get it built. It also introduces a new level of complexity.    One idea, many puzzles    ""The ethereum world has benefited tremendously from the composability of smart contracts, where one protocol can make use of another protocol in order to build up and up towards something higher-level and more useful to the end-user,"" Doug Petkanics, of Livepeer, a decentralized video transcoding service, told CoinDesk. “But to date, composability has been halted at the boundaries of ethereum.”      Composability is the idea that software can be put together like Lego blocks in ways that its creators might not have anticipated.      It’s a nice idea, but it starts to get complicated in practice.      Aliaksandr Hudzilin is part of the team behind Near Protocol, which is using sharding to build a highly scalable blockchain. He told CoinDesk that one of his developers participated in a conversation about IBC at Devcon 2019 in Osaka, Japan, including the Ethereum Foundation, Cosmos and Polkadot.      Hudzilin’s interpretation of the conversation was that ""none of them had sat down and talked about it,” he said. “It's kind of the beginning of the dialogue.""      From the vantage point of the Devcon developers, blockchains sharing tokens and data starts to look much easier discussed than executed.      And then there's the question of why teams should even bother plugging in.      ""You have an adoption challenge to convince people to refactor in order to support interoperability standards,"" Stephane Gosselin of the engineering team at Numerai told CoinDesk. “From my experience, the latter is an uphill battle.”      Gosselin said the business case just isn't there yet to justify teams doing the work.      Electric Capital's Avichal Garg sounded a similar note: The wait for IBC will be long, he said.      ""Interoperability only matters if there is real activity happening on multiple chains and right now there are really only two that have significant activity (BTC and ETH), and several that have the beginnings of activity,"" Garg wrote.    Why bother?    And, of course, there are those who don't see much point in interoperability to begin with.      Spencer Bogart, a general partner at Blockchain Capital, diverges from Antonopoulos on one point, believing only a very few chains will matter in the end.      In fact, it could be just ethereum and bitcoin, Bogart said. ""I think the area of intrablockchain communication will be a far more important and salient topic going forward than interblockchain communication – that is, solving for compatibility and functionality 'up the stack' of winning protocols.""      Ben Waters, of the multi-asset Nervos Network, thinks it might be simpler than all that. It could be that every blockchain that survives only needs to talk to one other blockchain, and that's bitcoin.      ""Interoperability of PBNs [public blockchain networks] that serve very similar functions and tend to have the same apps, programming models and economic models is largely pointless,"" Waters wrote in an email. ""Additionally, if PBN tokens are largely interchangeable, everyone will want to hold the hardest, most secure token.”      But some bitcoin maximalists take it further than that.      ""Blockchains are waste,"" Udi Wertheimer, a well-known skeptic of Satoshi's descendant technologies, told CoinDesk. ""Interoperability between blockchains makes as much sense as interoperability between polluting gases.""      But, in a way, the idea that one machine will dominate squares with the view Antonopoulos espoused in October.      ""I'm really fascinated by the strong possibility that while we will have many chains, in the end, they will all come together under one network,"" Antonopoulos said. ""One network, many chains.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | ETH | CKB,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/30/one-network-many-chains-the-case-for-blockchain-interoperability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dec5a105fe25d5a6b2aef129f09bdf997ca0542-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzRh,1580403624,Cambodia Readies a Blockchain-Based Digital Currency,"The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is readying a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to be launched at some point during the current fiscal quarter.      Chea Serey, NBC's director-general, told the Phnom Penh Post this week the central bank was developing ""the national payment gateway for Cambodia"" as a blockchain-based, peer-to-peer platform with its own specially designed cryptocurrency. She did not give a definite date on when the CBDC would be launched.      Known as ""Project Bakong"" and first trialed by NBC in July 2019, the CBDC will work on a closed system supported by its banking members, one of them, Phnom Penh Commercial Bank (PPCBank) President Shin Chang Moo, told The Post.      Compared to conventional payment and transfer methods including credit and debit cards, Bakong is cheaper and more convenient, Chang Moo said. His bank is rolling out the system at all branches.      “We are in the final stages of the deployment,"" he told The Post. ""It has taken a little longer than expected because we were ensuring that the system is as useful and convenient for the users as possible. We will offer the service as soon as it launches,” he said.      There is ""zero possibility of speculation"" using the CBDC, Chang moo added.      Users will be able to set up a Bakong wallet that will be automatically linked to their bank accounts, allowing easy fiat currency exchange into the new CBDC in real time. NBC says it will store all transaction data from the platform, suggesting payments may be fully traceable.      Users will be able to use the ""quasi-form"" CBDC for everyday payments from their mobile devices. The initiative is expected to support the government's push to introduce QR-based transactions throughout the country.      Bakong was designed by the Japanese blockchain company Soramitsu. CEO Makoto Takemiya told CoinDesk that the CBDC ""is simply a tokenized version of the USD and Riel fiat money in NBC's reserves.""      ""[T]he system can support any type and number of currencies, including cryptocurrency,"" he added. Soramitsu is currently working on implementing similar systems for other countries around the world.      Although Cambodian authorities have cracked down on cryptocurrency trading, NBC had been testing blockchain technology for an interbank payment solution since at least 2017. In October, the bank signed an agreement with a Malaysian bank to begin experimenting with digital wallets for cross-border transactions.      Designed initially for domestic payments in Cambodia, NBC plans to integrate a cross-border payments facility into the Bakong platform, Serey said.      Bakong already has the support of 11 national banks, with others expected to join soon, according to Serey. “Bakong will play a central role in bringing all players in the payment space in Cambodia under the same platform, making it easy for end-users to pay each other regardless of the institutions they bank with,"" she said.      Although this could hit the banking business in the short term, Cambodia's financial system is ""relatively immature,"" Chang Moo told The Post. Bakong will ""create financially inclusive ecosystems that all the stakeholders in the industry can benefit from.""

The new service, announced on Thursday, is aimed to provide users of the platform a less technical and more secure way to hold and control their security token investments. Effectively a digital wallet, the product offers automated dividend distributions and built-in reporting for token issuers. Multi-signature security is provided too, using a key model used by wallets currently holding over $1 billion in investments.      “We’re excited to bring a multi-signature wallet security packaged in a self-controlled, easy to manage brokerage-style experience to the over 100,000 investors using our platform,” said TokenSoft CEO Mason Borda.      Regulatory compliant security token standards such as ethereum's ERC-1404 and Tezos' FA1.2 are supported.      Jordan Davis, director of business development at the firm, said wallets like TokenSoft Investment Accounts will ""put pressure"" on financial institutions to offer better services and management tools to investors.      “People will be able to add or remove service providers from accessing their assets the same way you can add or remove profiles from your Netflix subscription, he said.      In December, TokenSoft's subsidiary, DTAC LLC, was registered as a transfer agent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – an important regulatory step on its path to bring tokenization to traditional institutions. TokenSoft also owns an interest in a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.      Setting out to provide the tech for firms to ""go straight to IPO"" by putting their shares on a blockchain, Borda said in a previous report that TokenSoft is “building all the things you need for an automated investment bank.""

42403893,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzAy,1580395920,"Compared to Traditional Banks, Crypto Lenders See Booming Growth","A lukewarm U.S. economy is making big banks like JPMorgan Chase struggle to produce fast loan growth - even with interest rates close to historic lows. Yet, in the white-hot cryptocurrency industry, lenders are burgeoning.      The Commerce Department reported Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, on par with the third quarter’s clip, even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times earlier in 2019 to stimulate growth. For the full year, the economy expanded 2.3 percent, a slowdown from 2018's 2.9 percent, according to the report.      If there's any softening in the economy, it hasn't been felt by lenders like Genesis. The New York-based trading firm that lends cash alongside cryptocurrencies like bitcoin said Thursday in a report that loans increased by 21 percent during the fourth quarter to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe.      Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent - roughly the same pace as the economy - during the period to $959.8 billion.      Only a few lenders can be found in the decade-old digital asset industry, and they are starting from a smaller base. There’s also a dearth of competition from established banks for loans to crypto traders and businesses, due to conservative risk-management policies and restrictions imposed by regulators. Since a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be a highly volatile collateral for loans, more traditional lenders are rare.      But crypto lenders are seeing strong demand from borrowers who want loans denominated in bitcoin, cash or “stablecoins” - digital tokens like tether and USD Coin whose price is linked to the U.S. dollar or other government-issued currencies. And there are plenty of investors willing to pledge cash to lenders like Genesis in exchange for interest rates of 7 or 8 percent.      BlockFi, a big crypto lender backed by the investment funds Galaxy Digital and Winklevoss Capital, said earlier this month it planned to add five to 10 new assets to its platform, including the cryptocurrency litecoin and a dollar-pegged digital token, USD Coin. Later this year BlockFi plans to launch a credit card that offers rewards in bitcoin.      Celsius Network, another crypto lender, said in December large institutional clients were becoming an increasingly key contributor to the platform’s loan growth.      “Obviously the crypto sector is not even a beauty mark right now compared with the banking sector, in terms of the size and maturity,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in a phone interview. “But there is rapid growth in this new market, and it’s not just us. There are other companies trying to accomplish similar things.”      Genesis is controlled by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.      Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 94 percent in 2019, more than three times the gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks over the period.      So far in January, bitcoin is up another 30 percent to about $9,300, the best start to a year since 2013. Earlier this month, the professional-network website LinkedIn named blockchain - the cryptographically-enabled computer-network technology underpinning cryptocurrencies - as the most in-demand skill among employers.      Silvergate Capital, one of the few banking companies serving crypto-related businesses, said Wednesday total assets were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.13 billion. But the La Jolla, California-based publicly traded company said it added 48 digital currency customers during the period, bringing the total to 804, while transactions on its digital Silvergate Exchange Network rose by 17 percent from third-quarter levels.      A recently announced initiative at Silvergate will allow customers to obtain U.S. dollar-denominated loans collateralized by bitcoin.      Genesis said in its latest report a new source of demand for cash loans in 2020 could come from ""mining"" companies that need capital to build, expand or upgrade data centers used to process transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.      “We will likely see miners leverage their existing balance sheet and treasury to source the cash necessary to invest in their operation,” according to the report. “Those unable to source cash will be stuck mining on old-generation machines and might face serious profitability issues if the price of bitcoin doesn’t rise substantially.”",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/30/compared-to-traditional-banks-crypto-lenders-see-booming-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edda34cae8539a17dc039b54c771567cf24b8fed-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzPj,1580392800,Bittrex Takes Out Record $300M Insurance on Crypto Held in Cold Storage,"Bittrex has insured digital assets held in its cold (or offline) storage to up to $300 million, the highest coverage yet offered by a cryptocurrency exchange.      The company announced the news Thursday, saying it has obtained digital asset insurance that will protect users' holdings in cases of ""external theft and internal collusion.""      Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara said the cover, which has a limit of up to $300 million, offers ""peace of mind"" and would show clients the exchange is ""committed to prioritizing security throughout all of our decisions and forward-looking blockchain technologies.”      The insurance was underwritten by Arch Syndicate 2012, which provides specialized insurance for corporations. The policy was approved after the exchange demonstrated its internal security and compliance protocols, and was supported by other syndicates based out of Lloyd's of London, one of the world's largest insurance markets.      The term ""external theft"" is likely to mean a theft via a physical intrusion into Bittrex's crypto vault, as cold wallets are not generally vulnerable to hacking. The cover is a tailored version of Arch's Blue Vault, which provides limits of up to $150 million and covers the loss of digital assets due to internal and external theft (via direct access to the storage media) and also includes employee collusion.      CoinDesk has contacted the exchange to clarify the cover more precisely.      Sarah Downey, the co-leader of the Digital Asset Risk Transfer (DART) team at Marsh, the insurance broker that assisted Bittrex in drawing up the policy, said: “Insurance plays a critical role in the growth and development of any business, including those that work with blockchain technology and digital assets.""      Insurance coverage is a growing trend among businesses that hold users' cryptocurrency. Custodial solution KNØX has insurance, also from Lloyd's, which covers losses of up to $100 million. The Winklevoss brothers created their own insurance company earlier this month to guarantee losses up to $200 million for Gemini exchange users.      Coinbase previously held the record for the largest insurance coverage in crypto, insuring against third-party attacks of up to $255 million for digital assets held in the exchange's hot wallets. With Bittrex's news this week, the bar has been raised by a cool $45 million.

Announced Thursday, the lobbying group said having the two companies on board adds weight to its mission of advancing the proof-of-stake (POS) industry. Other members of the group include Tezos, the Interchain Foundation and the Web3 Foundation.      Coinbase, based in San Francisco, is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the U.S., while Bison Trails provides blockchain infrastructure tools. Both companies are members of the Libra Association, the Facebook-led global stablecoin project.      Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus algorithm by which a blockchain network can mint new coins and advance the chain. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) mining, in a PoS network, holders with more coins have more power to validate transactions and process consensus.      According to a press release, the alliance believes there is not sufficient legal or regulatory clarity in the U.S. around staking yet, including how staking rewards are taxed and how entities should interpret securities laws for validation relationships.      The group will encourage policy makers and regulators including the U.S Securities and Exchanges Commission to address tax and compliance challenges for staking services providers.      “Proof of Stake is an increasingly important innovation that the crypto space as a whole is rapidly trending toward,” Sam Mcingvale, CEO of Coinbase Custody, said in the statement.

42403901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzHr,1580385600,Andrew Yang: US Has to Fix Its 'Hodgepodge' Crypto Regulation,"Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang said the U.S. needs a consistent legal framework for cryptocurrencies if it is to be a market leader.      Speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday, Yang said the current regulatory situation is confusing and potentially harmful to individuals and businesses working in the space. ""Right now we're stuck with this hodgepodge of state-by-state treatments and it's bad for everybody. It's bad for innovators who want to invest in the space,"" he said.      ""The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies is very, very high potential and we should be investing in it,"" Yang continued. ""We need to have a uniform set of rules and regulations around cryptocurrency use nationwide.""      The U.S., as a country, does not have a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies. While some states, such as New York, have created a licensing framework for crypto businesses, most regulators rely on a combination of decades-old judicial precedents, international conventions and occasional guidance from federal regulators.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified all initial coin offerings (ICOs), regardless of a token's nature, as securities sales based on a precedent from a 1940s ruling over a Floridian orange farmer. Despite issuing updated guidance for cryptocurrencies last year, legal experts have criticized the regulator for underspecifying key areas such as failing to define what an ""active participant"" in a token sale really is.      The regulatory status quo has also created conflicting guidance. In 2018, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a letter stating that token issuers were money transmitters and required to comply with existing regulation. The letter came days after a federal court backed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) definition that cryptocurrencies are, in fact, commodities.      Yang's campaign has run on a pro-technology ticket and he is the only candidate so far to have an official policy on cryptocurrency. He has repeatedly advocated for a clear U.S. policy on cryptocurrencies and, if elected, said he would introduce ""clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift.""      During his Bloomberg interview, Yang, named to CoinDesk's Most Influential list in 2019, said people will continue to use cryptocurrencies regardless of whether they are regulated or not. Attempts at a ban would simply force cryptos underground. ""You couldn't impede it with regulation if you tried,"" he said.

42403912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzSg,1580383565,"Bitcoin Reinforces Latest Rally With Defense of $9,200 Price Support","View    Bitcoin's defense of the former hurdle-turned-support at near $9,190 has strengthened the case for a continued rally toward higher resistance levels.  Longer duration charts are aligned in favor of a move to $10,000.  A channel breakdown on the hourly chart would shift risk in favor of a deeper pullback to the 200-day average at $8,900.    Bitcoin defended key price support early on Thursday, strengthening the case for another move higher.      Having faced rejection above $9,400 multiple times on Wednesday, the top cryptocurrency by market value came under pressure during the Asian trading hours today. Buyers, however, absorbed the selling pressure at $9,188, keeping the former resistance-turned-support intact.      Bitcoin had reversed lower from the same $9,188 hurdle on Jan. 14, aborting the short-term bullish view. So as the cryptocurrency bounced up strongly from $8,250 earlier this week, traders wondered whether bitcoin will again fail at $9,188 and form a double-top bearish reversal pattern or cross the hurdle with conviction.      The latter case won the day and the bulls managed to push prices well above $9,188 on Wednesday, flipping the resistance into support and establishing a new higher high.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,350, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin is moving in a sideways channel on the hourly chart. A move above channel resistance at $9,452 would likely accelerate the recent rally and open the doors to $9,600 (channel range added to breakout price). A violation there would expose the psychological resistance at $10,000.      The RSI is no longer reporting overbought conditions and is currently in bullish territory above 50.      With the longer duration charts also biased bullish, the odds appear stacked in favor of a range breakout. Should the range be breached to the downside, a deeper pullback to the 200-day average at $8,900 may be seen.    Daily chart    BItcoin rose past $9,188 on Wednesday with a positive ""marubozu candle,"" indicating that bullish sentiment is quite strong.      Further, the five- and 10-day averages are trending north so dips, if any, are likely to be short-lived.      A bearish reversal would be confirmed only if prices print a UTC close below $8,213 (higher low created on Jan. 24). Currently, that looks unlikely.

As per a Reuters report on Thursday, Masayoshi Amamiya said at a Tokyo seminar that if advances in payments technology arrive quickly, there may be more demand for a central bank digital currency (CBDC). As such, it's “very important” the bank should lay the groundwork of the technology.      “The speed of technical innovation is very fast. Depending on how things unfold in the world of settlement systems, public demand for CBDCs could soar in Japan,” Amamiya said.      Amamiya said the central bank does not yet plan to issue a CBDC because potential issues need more research, such as the the ramifications for monetary policy and how to ensure security for a possible digital yen. Even so, the BoJ must be ""prepared to respond.""      The comments come just days after politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party said they would propose the BoJ issue a digital currency. About 70 lawmakers from the party are united in the belief a digital yen is needed to counter the approaching launches of Libra and China's digital currency.      Previously, Amamiya has played down the idea central banks could make negative interest rate policies more effective by issuing their own digital currencies.      If the BoJ issues a digital yen and set a negative interest rate, individuals and businesses would effectively be charged for holding the CBDC, he said last July. As a result, holders would drop the digital currency and instead hold cash, meaning central banks would need to eliminate cash. ""No central bank would do this,” the official said.      In today's report, Amamiya further said the issuance of a CBDC would likely not have a great effect on the BoJ's control of interest rates, asset prices and bank lending, but monetary policy could become more complex if ""the transmission mechanism"" changes, he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/30/japan-must-be-ready-if-demand-for-digital-yen-soars-central-bank-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae91648322a5b46e767b63c56e1a1e44309e041e-1000x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzNl,1580378400,Ethereum-Based Ad Firm Bidooh Sues Founders in Tech Ownership Dispute,"Digital advertising company Bidooh has taken two of its former co-founders to court on accusations they stole company software.      Bidooh COO Vicki Simms said in the group's official Telegram chat on Jan. 20 the platform had been ""seriously tampered with"" and that the company had taken legal proceedings against former CEO Abdul Alim and former CTO Shaz Mughal.      ""We continue to press on with the remaining legal steps necessary to obtain final judgment against the defendants, Abdul Alim and Shaz Mughal, and reimbursement of our costs,"" Simms said.      Bidooh is a digital advertising platform, based in Manchester U.K., that allows companies to broadcast tailor-made ads to anyone who walks past one of its interactive billboards. Advertisers pay by the second using fiat currency or the protocol's native DOOH tokens, which are built on the ethereum blockchain.      Launched in January 2017, Bidooh raised more than $5 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018. By October 2018, the company operated 27 screens across the U.K. and had just struck a deal for 3,000 more screens across central and eastern Europe, according to a Financial Times report.      Alim was reported as saying at the time that he had taken inspiration from ""Minority Report,"" a 2002 sci-fi movie where a talking screen changes to address Tom Cruise's character as he walks past.    'Hijacked'    Alim confirmed to CoinDesk that Bidooh was ""accusing us of copying the software."" He added the remaining company board members, which include Michael Edelson, a non-executive director of Manchester United football club, also accused him and Mughal of trying to steal existing Bidooh clients for their new venture, called Flydooh.      Alim and Mughal are contesting the allegations, claiming Bidooh's remaining board members, executive chairman Edelson, Gary Partington, Howard Simms and Paul Althasen, had been ""completely screwing us over"" by awarding unsustainable salaries to staff.      While Alim and Mughal each received £30,000 ($39,000), Alim claims the CFO had a £120,000 ($156,000) salary, a sales member was paid £115,000 ($149,000), the chief treasurer took home £200,000 ($260,000) and the COO was on £80,000 ($104,000). ""Michael [Edelson] even hired all his staff on our payroll, he had a guy cleaning his car, a guy doing his garden, his PA, his bookkeeper on our pay,"" he said.      Despite raising $5 million in the ICO, Alim claims the board moved to reduce Shaz's and Alim's salary from £30,000 to £17,000 ($22,000) – having already had their shares diluted to 13 percent. Bidooh ran out of money, Ali said, and could no longer afford screens. The platform and protocol were then subsequently removed from the website.      When Alim and Mughal refused the salary cut, the other board members reportedly threatened to liquidate Bidooh and pull their loans from the company. ""No sane founders would want to leave a company they've built up for any reason,"" Alim said. ""[But] basically they've just taken our company from us ... [they] totally hijacked it.""      In February 2019, Alim said Partington had created a platform, called Promokio, with ""the exact same colors and, in essence, the exact same platform but better."" Bidooh had originally paid Partington's software development company £1.6 million ($2 million) to help build the platform.      Alim and Mughal are now countersuing Bidooh, accusing the company of not paying a total of £320,000 ($415,000) in salaries. ""We're saying either give us the software or our company back,"" he said. ""In essence, we still own that software, that's our argument.""    In a 'vulnerable state'    In a statement to CoinDesk, Bidooh's interim CEO Hannah Eames denied Alim's allegations, saying it was ""frustrating to hear the unsubstantiated accusations,"" adding both defendants had admitted in court to having copied the software.      Describing Alim's comments as ""not consistent in any way"" with their admissions, Eames said the company ""cannot afford to become distracted by them, nor to be drawn into a war of words via the media."" On the advice of counsel, she added, Bidooh would not make any further comment until the case had been resolved.      In a High Court order seen by CoinDesk, dated and signed by Mr Justice Richard Arnold on Sept. 11, 2019, Alim and Mughal were ordered to hand over all software, source code and documents relating to Bidooh and their new venture Flydooh, access to their email accounts, with the right to examine any technical equipment and electronic devices capable of storing documents.      In her Telegram announcement, Simms said the order gave Bidooh an injunction that ""prevents Abdul Alim and Shaz Mughal from infringing copyright in Bidooh’s computer code.""      She added that both had been removed as directors of Admoments Holdings, the registered company name of Bidooh. Companies House, the national registrar for businesses in the U.K., confirmed the appointments of both Alim and Mughal were terminated Oct. 14.      ""The business is in a particularly vulnerable state,"" Simms said, ""However, the remaining management team [is] working with the current shareholders to determine a viable strategy for the future of the business.""      Gary Partington said he could not comment on the court case for legal reasons. Michael Edelson could not be reached for comment.

In a recent tweet, Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, said stablecoin transfer value had “flipped” ethereum’s native currency, ETH.      “This is largely the story of tether (USDT) transitioning to ethereum. On a weekly basis, the flip occurred mid-2019. Since then the change is striking,” Watkins said.      The outstripping of ETH by stablecoins on its own network signifies a major step towards trust in cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged 1-to-1 to a major currency like the U.S. dollar.      The ethereum network allows for numerous tokens to operate within its ecosystem amid the backdrop of interoperability, enabling seamless transactions between multiple parties.      ERC-20 stablecoins, however, are by far the most sought-after token on the ethereum network in part largely due to the rise of the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USDT, as Watkins notes.      USDT flipped ETH sometime during the months of April and May 2019, with the transfer value outstripping ethereum’s native token and USDT maintaining its dominance ever since.      The company behind the stablecoin, Tether Ltd, began migrating tokens to ethereum in April 2019.      A few months later, the amount of USDT on bitcoin’s Omni layer started rapidly declining. Tether has since started issuing new tokens on the Tron and Liquid blockchains, with an influx of USDT in November 2019 far outstripping ETH.",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDT,BTC | ETH | USDT | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/30/stablecoins-flip-ethereums-native-currency-in-transfer-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c389e4726d4d0ac2fdc80d2553f8774ea4b56243-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzJp,1580342462,Coinbase Custody Goes International With New Entity in Ireland,"Coinbase has launched Coinbase Custody International Inc., a European entity for handling cryptocurrency deposits.      Based in Dublin, Ireland, Coinbase said in a blog post that client demand for institutional-grade custodial services drove the move. Separately, a spokesman for the exchange said Coinbase Custody now has $8 billion in assets under custody, up from the $7 billion announced in November.      “While Coinbase Custody has served European-based clients in the UK, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and more since 2018, our dedicated presence in Europe will allow us to offer these services in a completely localized way, with local staff, localized [service-level agreements] and in compliance with local laws,” the company wrote.      As part of the transition, ""all staking activity performed by Coinbase"" will also migrate to Coinbase Custody International, the firm said. According to a source with knowledge of the regulatory landscape, there is still ambiguity regarding the tax implications of staking, where asset holders are rewarded in crypto for helping to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks such as Tezos and others. Some investors outside the U.S. are therefore hesitant to stake with U.S.-based firms, the source added.      Coinbase, a separate entity from Coinbase Custody International, received an Irish e-money license in October 2019. The company announced the creation of its Dublin office in October 2018.      Coinbase is not alone in expanding its custodial offerings. French startup Ledger recently announced a partnership with South Korean blockchain platform FLETA to provide compliant custody services across Asia.
