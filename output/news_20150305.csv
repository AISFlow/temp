42398254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1CB,1425596788,Deutsche Bank Veteran Starts Institutional Bitcoin Exchange in Brazil,"There's no shortage of theories as to why Brazil has yet to become a hotbed of bitcoin adoption in Latin America.  Popular ideas include everything from the language barrier (limited access to Portuguese bitcoin resources) to past incidents with exchanges (the mystery surrounding Bitcoin Rain). However, the most likely culprit may be a lack of fundamentals in its market, according to one entrepreneur.  ""The problem with liquidity in Brazil is we have natural buyers, we have people who want to trade, but we don't have natural sellers,"" explains Marcelo Miranda, a nine-year Deutsche Bank veteran who is launching a local bitcoin exchange, FlowBTC, on 6th March.  Miranda told CoinDesk:  ""We don't have mining, we don't have a lot of merchants – these are natural sellers and hedgers.""  To alleviate these problems, Miranda has struck a partnership with bitcoin exchange software provider AlphaPoint that will connect FlowBTC to other exchanges around the world, including Canada's Cointrader and Mexico's meXBT.  AlphaPoint CEO Vadim Telyatnikov characterized the development as a positive one given Miranda's background, and what he suggested was the untapped potential of Brazil's market.  ""We believe his expertise and experience trading securities, including on Deutsche Bank's equity desk, will incentivize trading professionals to become more engaged in Latin America's digital currency space,"" Telyatnikov said.  Early interest  Miranda indicated that his interest in bitcoin began while he was working with Deutsche Bank, seeing it as an evolution of the growing influence of technology on trading activities.  ""Trading in all markets became very high tech, so it was natural to me to look for something that was at the forefront of technology and trading, and for me bitcoin and digital currency was a perfect fit,"" he explained.  The interest lead him to eventually part ways with the German bank. ""They were restructuring and there was an opportunity to move on,"" he said.  From there, he built IXBTC, a pricing index for the local market that launched last October, and began thinking of ways to bring his expertise more fully to the market.  ""I started to realize, there was a lack of a professional grade exchange in Brazil,"" Miranda said. ""I think there was a big lack of an anchor exchange, some platform that institutional investors could relate to.""  ""That was the whole idea behind FlowBTC,"" he added, noting the team now includes five employees.  Miranda suggested that his former colleagues have been largely supportive of the move.  ""It's not that they think it's something dumb or silly. I think that most of them can see the bright side of bitcoin and digital currency in general, I think they lack knowledge,"" he said.  Focus on products  Tapping into this larger source of liquidity, Miranda said, will be just one of the competitive advantages for his endeavor.  FlowBTC aims to also focus on products, including a research report with market intelligence aimed at FX and equities traders.  Miranda indicated that FlowBTC considers itself a FinTech company, and that it plans to expand into payments more fully soon, entering a market served by competitors such as BitInvest, which has the highest-profile merchant partnership in Brazil to date.  Still, FlowBTC plans to evolve differently, citing more widely known institutional bitcoin platforms as companies with similar models.  ""At some moment, when the Latin American market is mature enough, our idea is to become something closer to Coinsetter or LedgerX,"" he added.

42398250,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT18F,1425594924,Police Arrest Five in MyCoin Bitcoin Exchange Scheme Case,"Five individuals have been arrested by Hong Kong police forces in connection with the collapse of MyCoin, an alleged bitcoin trading platform.  The arrests were made as part of a broader hunt for individuals associated with MyCoin, which is believed to have cost investors millions of dollars in losses for fraudulent activities. The five were arrested for conspiracy to defraud, according to the South China Morning Post.  The individuals taken into custody on 5th March were allegedly involved with soliciting funds for the scheme and holding events to attract potential investors. Hong Kong police searched the home of at least one of those arrested the same evening, the newspaper said.  The Morning Post reported those arrested have not been charged with any crimes:  “One of the women was picked up when officers boarded a casino ship anchored off North Point yesterday morning. Police caught the other four at their homes in Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai, Wong Tai Sin and North Point.""  The arrests come weeks after news first broke that Chinese investors were defrauded by MyCoin.  The Hong Kong Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB) has since announced that 43 investors may have lost roughly $8.1m as a result of attempted business with Mycoin.  Investigation continues  Hong Kong law enforcement officials continue to look for individuals connected with an investment company named Rich Might Investment, including its former director William Dennis Atwood.  It remains unclear whether MyCoin, marketed as a bitcoin exchange for local investors, ever actually held deposits of the digital currency. Early reports suggest that MyCoin may have functioned as a pyramid or Ponzi scheme.  At least one investor has claimed that the company promised payouts if more investors were referred to the scheme.

42398249,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT16H,1425590718,Study: Bitcoin Becoming Less Attractive Target for Trojan Malware,"A new report from security firm Symantec claims the number of Trojan malware programs targeting bitcoin users has fallen in the past year.  The conclusion was included in a report published on 3rd March entitled ""The State of Financial Trojans 2014"". The drop reflected an overall decline in the proliferation of financial Trojans, which Symantec said slid by 53% in 2014.  Specific attack types, the report noted, include methods by which a bitcoin addresses is changed prior to a transaction without the user's knowledge.  However, the firm acknowledged that it doesn't know why the number of bitcoin-focused Trojans has seemingly fallen:  ""We can only speculate on the reasons why the attackers did not adapt more to target cryptocurrencies. Perhaps cryptocurrency’s usage is still too low to be attractive for the scammers or the attackers are still making enough profits with their other targets and don’t want to change their plans to include cryptocurrencies yet.""  Other studies  have found that as much as one-fifth of financial malware attacks in 2014 targeted holders of bitcoin.  The Symantec report did not focus on attacks utilizing ransomware, though the firm has touched on the subject in the past. Late last year, another study found that nearly all targets of bitcoin ransomware refuse to pay.

42398248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT19E,1425585644,Third US Marshals Bitcoin Auction Sees Increase in Bidder Interest,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced that 14 bidders participated in today's auction of 50,000 BTC, worth $13.4m at press time, placing 34 bids over the course of the six-hour event.  The figure was up slightly from the 11 bidders and 27 bids entered in December's auction, but down from the 45 bidders and 63 bids during the first auction in June.  A spokesperson for the USMS indicated that the auction is currently being evaluated and that bids are being reviewed.  The spokesperson said:  ""No further information will be released until the conclusion of the auction process, when financial transactions have been completed and bitcoins have been transferred to the winner(s).""  The earliest the winner could be revealed would be Monday, the agency added.  The spike in interest notably coincides with increased activity in the bitcoin markets. After a period of relative stability, the price of bitcoin was trending up this week, hitting a high of $284.14 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At press time, this figure had fallen to $266.79.  The trading desk at SecondMarket, the firm that entered the winning bid in December's auction, was among the confirmed participants.  More auctions in store  This is the third auction of bitcoin seized in the shutdown of illicit black market Silk Road, and the second involving bitcoins confiscated from site operator Ross Ulbricht.  In total, roughly 144,000 BTC were taken from Ulbricht at the time of his arrest. The 30-year-old was subsequently convicted of operating the website in February.  A remaining 44,000 BTC, worth roughly $11.8m at press time, is set to be auctioned off in a final auction at a time to be determined later.

42398256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1F8,1425574871,Bitcoin Exchange Quadriga to Go Public in Reverse Takeover,"Canada-based bitcoin exchange Quadriga has announced it has entered into an agreement that, if executed, will find the company debuting on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CES) as soon as next month.  The news follows a shareholder meeting on 2nd March and a decision by the Supreme Court of British Columbia to allow Quadriga to conduct a reverse takeover of the shell company Whiteside Capital Corporation.  Co-founder Michael Patryn indicated that the move will provide Quadriga with increased capital while satisfying what he called the public demand for bitcoin-related investment opportunities in the Canadian markets.  Patryn told CoinDesk:  ""I believe that the audit is an important direction for an exchange. The people want to invest in bitcoin infrastructure.""  Quadriga will merge with Whiteside to become a public company called Quadriga FinTech Solutions Corp. Quadriga will be the 100% owner of Whiteside Capital and Quadriga CX, its bitcoin exchange subsidiary. As a result of the deal, Quadriga will no longer be owned by Blueprint Corporate Services, a firm that assisted Quadriga in raising capital.  The maneuver to take the company public has been in the works for some time, with Quadriga entering into a private placement with Whiteside in November 2014.  Launched in 2013, Quadriga has since emerged as a potential market leader in Canada's beleaguered bitcoin exchange sector. In the past few months, both CAVirtex and Vault of Satoshi, the oldest and most visible bitcoin exchanges, closed down operations.  Business details  The public plan included details about Quadriga's planned business operations, including insights into how it plans to expand its exchange, remittance and merchant services.  Of note are portions of the report that provide details into Quadriga's exchange business which suggest the company has 5,000 clients and processes C$60,000 in daily trade on its platform.  Quadriga also disclosed it is in negotiations with two unnamed online casinos to become their sole processing provider.  The exchange indicates it raised $908,650 in six issuances of common shares.

42398258,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1I5,1425569114,Research Tracks Bitcoin Mining from Hobby to Big Business,"Nearly all bitcoin miners have been transferring their rewards within 36 hours of obtaining them, researchers at New York University have found.  Luqin Wang and Yong Liu's paper, an analysis on the ""evolution"" of pool mining, found that less than 1% of miners left their rewards untouched in 2012 and 2013.  Those who did transact with their rewards did so within a week in 2012, and within 36 hours the following year. The researchers did not perform the analysis for 2014.  Miners' hasty transfers in recent years contrasts sharply with the behaviour of early miners. In 2009, 66% of miners left their rewards untouched. Those who did make a transaction did so about four months after obtaining the reward.  The following year the share of ""frozen miners"" fell to 20%. By contrast, in 2011 just 2% of miners didn't perform a transaction with their mined rewards.  Early miners locked out  The paper suggests that one reason early miners haven't moved their bitcoins is because they have lost access to those wallets, locking them out permanently. These early miners probably got involved in bitcoin not for financial gain, but because it was a ""fun technology"" that could be played with casually, the authors write.  ""When bitcoin became valuable, they might have, unfortunately, lost their [access] so they couldn't cash out! This suggests that lots of bitcoins mined in the first two years might have been lost permanently!""  From 2009 to 2013, the bitcoin price exploded, from several cents a coin to $1,128 at its height in December 2013. This price surge was accompanied by a rise in the number of miners joining the bitcoin network. As the number of miners grew, miners went from going ""solo"" to joining pools, in order to share their computational power while maintaining their chances of capturing a reward.  ""Computation power [was] evenly distributed among miners at the early stage, then became highly skewed with a small number of very powerful miners as the bitcoin network evolved ... those top miners are indeed mining pools.""  The authors analysed miners' profitability as the bitcoin price rose over the years. They then looked at two pieces of mining hardware – a Radeon graphics card and a Butterfly Labs ASIC miner – and compared their performance to the bitcoin price and network difficulty in 2011 and 2013.  The paper will be presented at the Passive and Active Measurements Conference, which discusses network measurement and analysis techniques, in New York on 19th March.  Discus Fish surge  Wang and Liu found that the early miner with the graphics card, if paying the average United States electricity price, broke even on their investment in just under two years. The owner of the ASIC miner, however, could have broken even in less than a month, if the hardware was purchased in July 2013. Profits would have continued to accumulate well into the following March, where the researchers' analysis stops.  The pair also dig into the mechanics of the Discus Fish mining pool, which consistently had the biggest chunk of the network hashrate in the second half of last year, a title it recently ceded to Antpool.  Discus Fish, which also goes by F2Pool, saw a surge in the number of miners in its pool at the end of 2013, the authors find. The figure rose from a few hundred miners in October to 5,000 just five months later.  An analysis of the distribution of rewards within the Discus Fish pool is able to estimate the hashrate of the top 10% of miners within the pool compared to the pool averages. The top 10% of miners in Discus Fish have a hashrate that is about a thousand times greater than the pool average, the paper found.  Since the pool employs a 'pay per share' model, miners are rewarded in direct proportion to the number of shares, or computational power, they contribute to a pool. Therefore, the authors conclude, the most powerful miners in a pool also reap most of the rewards.  An independent analyst of mining pools, who goes by the pseudonym Organ of Corti, said the paper had implemented a method to quantify the average hashrate of individual miners within a pool for the first time.  ""They implemented a method to determine a miner's average hashrate by monitoring F2Pool's output transactions,"" the analyst said. ""It's not a new idea, but it's the first time I've seen it done.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/05/research-tracks-bitcoin-mining-from-hobby-to-big-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb450cb47e6d3cb9e297f02f25b9030201af5c7e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
