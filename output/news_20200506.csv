The private, for-profit Bitfury Group has raised $170 million, accepting six funding rounds spanning from 2014 to 2018. The company was founded by CEO Valery Vavilov and CTO Valery Nebesny in Amsterdam.  Bitfury initially started as a bitcoin mining operator and hardware manufacturer, and it was estimated in 2017 the firm possessed the third-largest bitcoin mining operation behind Bitmain and F2Pool.  In 2016, Bitfury announced it signed a memorandum of understanding with multinational consulting firm Ernst & Young (EY) to develop blockchain solutions for a variety of sectors. In 2017, the company launched Exonum, an enterprise blockchain software that enables businesses and governments to secure private data on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The product anchors verifiable data to the Bitcoin blockchain, costing only the transaction fees needed to store the information.  Additionally, in 2017 Bitfury launched a payment network with payments provider Ripple for the second-layer Bitcoin scaling solution Lightning Network. Bitfury’s Lightning Peach platform offers tools for developers to build on lightning, a bitcoin wallet designed for lightning that is available to users and a suite of hardware and software solutions enabling merchants to accept lightning payments.  In 2018, the Lightning Peach team tested the feasibility of lightning-compatible vending machines by creating a coffee machine connected to the Lightning Network. The device integrated a Raspberry Pi computer and a unique circuit board that successfully processed microtransactions.  In 2018 Bitfury launched Crystal, an analytics platform that assists with the identification of criminal activities carried out through the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform can help businesses comply with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regulations and can aid law enforcement agencies in tracing criminal transaction data and criminal networks.  In 2019, Bitfury launched Surround, an open-source music platform meant to solve the challenges of musicians and stakeholders in the entertainment industry. The product is intended to provide a means of securely transferring intellectual property, provide transparency in the exchange of money and rights related to intellectual property, and eliminate unauthorized usage of copyrighted material. The platform will be built upon Bitfury’s Exonum.  In February 2019, Bitfury announced it would open multiple mining operations in Paraguay utilizing hydropower in plants Itaipu and Yacyreta. Later that year, Bitfury announced that it had started an artificial intelligence (AI) division, and said it would eventually offer hardware and software geared toward AI that would involve the blockchain.  In 2020, Bitfury was one of many companies to donate some of its GPU-based computing power towards coronavirus research.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/bitfury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2d2d500ed87b0c7306d5d08e9a68a964040bb29-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Bvh,1588798904,Bitcoin Revenue in Square's Cash App Tops Fiat Revenue for First Time in Q1,"Bitcoin has flippened USD on Square’s Cash App, sort of.      As reported in the publicly traded fintech company’s first-quarter earnings Wednesday, Cash App brought in $222 million on all its other fiat-powered services in Q1. Meanwhile, revenue from bitcoin was $306 million, the first quarter in which bitcoin revenue surpassed all other revenue on the app.      “In the first quarter, Cash App gross profit grew 115% year over year,” the shareholder letter reported.      Gross profit on Cash App, however, remains to be found primarily outside of crypto. Of Square’s $222 million in non-bitcoin revenue, $178 million of that was profit. The Cash App saw one of its best quarters yet for new users in the first quarter of 2020, across its many different services.      Bitcoin profit through Square’s Cash App was $7 million in the first quarter of 2020. It earned $8 million in bitcoin profit through the whole of 2019.      Still, on the revenue side, the year-over-year growth in bitcoin sales was steep.      In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company noted:    “Bitcoin revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased by $240.6 million or 367%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was due to growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand.”    Total revenue from bitcoin in the first quarter was $306 million, versus $65 million in the first quarter of 2019. Square earned $178 million in bitcoin revenue through the prior quarter, the last of 2019.      Total revenue for Square this quarter was $1.38 billion, roughly 43% over what it earned in the first quarter of last year. Square had $535 million in gross profit for the quarter, but a $105 million net loss.    Earnings call    Square CEO Jack Dorsey described a few of the ways that the Cash App has found growth during the COVID-19 crisis.      For example, by making it easy to do direct deposits into Cash App, the firm saw enormous growth, Dorsey said in Wednesday's earnings call. Direct deposit users were more likely to use more of Cash's other services, such as peer-to-peer payments and bitcoin purchsaes. Further, Square collaborated with companies like Twitch and Spotify so fans could directly support their favorite creatives.

42431884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7CLh,1588797455,Market Wrap: Derivatives May Reduce Miner Selling Pressure After Bitcoin Halving,"With less than a week to go before the expected May 12 halving event, bitcoin's price is swinging upward. The crypto derivatives market is helping to hedge the uncertainty on which way the bitcoin market will go when miners have less revenue after the halving.      In early trading at 00:00 UTC, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency was around $8,957 before jumping as high as $9,399 at 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. EDT) on spot exchanges including Coinbase. It was changing hands at a price above its 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages, signaling bullish sentiment Wednesday. At press time bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 3.8% over 24 hours at $9,258.      Big-name bitcoin investor Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital has been making the rounds this week, talking about how he views digital scarcity driving bitcoin prices higher after next week’s expected halving event. “Next Tuesday we have the bitcoin halving where the inflation rate gets cut in half,” Novogratz said on CNBC’s Closing Bell program Monday. “You talk about inflation in fiat currencies where the [Federal Reserve] is printing money like a money-printing machine and in the bitcoin space the money supply gets cut.""      Read more: Bitcoin Breaches $9.2K as CME Futures Hit 10-Month High      This may be true, but it also means a smaller reward and thus smaller revenue for miners to pay labor, rent and electricity. That’s because they will have fewer bitcoin inflows they can sell for cash. However, in July 2016, the last time bitcoin supply was cut in half, the market was much different.      Garrick Hileman, an economist and a long-time researcher in the crypto space currently at wallet provider Blockchain.com, says things have changed since the previous halving halving event. For example, CME didn’t start offering bitcoin futures until late 2017. Ahead of this halving, bitcoin miners can purchase futures contracts, locking in bitcoin prices to pay for their expenditures.      June futures for bitcoin are priced at $9,395 on CME Wednesday, above current spot prices.      “While in theory a decreasing supply and stock-to-flow models may suggest a surge in price, the reality is a lot more complicated,” Hileman told CoinDesk. “A far larger, broader spot and derivatives market means that miner selling is simply less impactful.”      Read more: Bitcoin Halving 2020 Explained      Open positions on CME futures recently hit a 10-month high. However, the U.S.-based platform takes up only a small fraction of the market. The biggest players in the crypto derivatives market — such as Huobi, Binance BitMEX and OKex — are based in Asia and don’t accept U.S. customers.      Vishal Shah, derivatives trader and founder of exchange Alpha5, says futures play a bigger role in crypto than most realize. According to Shah, due to March’s sell-off that triggered $700 million in liquidations on BitMEX, the subsequent reduction in open interest could lessen downside risk caused by post-having selling pressures.      Read more: BitMEX Is Making the Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone      The reduced number of leveraged open interest, which still hasn’t returned to February levels, means fewer automatic liquidations on price movements.      “If there is to be any fallout due to lower rewards, at least the leveraged open interest is not there to ‘domino’ the system lower,” Shah told CoinDesk.    Other Markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the green Wednesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was off less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

42431877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7CBh,1588791407,Bitcoin Node Count Falls to 3-Year Low Despite Price Surge,"The number of computers running the Bitcoin program fell to its lowest level in almost three years, according to data calculated by one prominent Bitcoin developer.      Bitcoin’s total node count fell below 47,000 on Monday, a level not seen since 2017, based on estimates determined by well-regarded Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr. His numbers show a steady decline in the number of operational nodes from a peak of over 200,000 in January 2018.      A decline in total node count means fewer people are participating in validating new transactions and storing copies of the network's shared transaction history. The new lows count comes at a time of recent surges in price and mining power.      Tallying the number of Bitcoin nodes typically relies on estimates instead of concrete data, and opinions on the best methodology for deriving these estimates differ. Dashjr’s estimate relies on a tedious and undisclosed proprietary methodology that could compromise the reliability of the data if it was released, according to its creator.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before Halving      Another well-known Bitcoin node count tally, provided for free by Bitnodes, shows fresh multi-year lows in the number of Bitcoin IPv4 nodes in mid-March. This helps to corroborate Dashjr’s data. However, since November Bitnodes data has shown a spike in nodes using onion services, which make the node operator more difficult to locate.    Why are nodes turning off?    Curiously, the last bitcoin bull cycles were preceded by significant spikes in new Bitcoin nodes coming online, according to Dashjr.’s estimates. But since April 2019, the total node count estimate has steadily fallen despite periods of relatively bullish price action. Underwhelming price action or recent market crashes may have caused some investors and node operators to simply lose interest and shut off their nodes.      After price crashes, plenty of Bitcoin users “lose interest and stop opening their wallets or running their nodes,” said Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of Casa, a bitcoin storage security company. Lopp considers Bitcoin nodes that continue to run despite market behavior to be “nodes of last resort.”      More people also may be shutting off their Bitcoin nodes because, for them, running the software is just too hard. According to Dashjr, “Running a [Bitcoin] node continues to get harder and harder with block sizes exceeding the rate of technological improvement.”    How many nodes is enough?    Full Bitcoin nodes don’t mine for new bitcoins. Instead, they store individual copies of the blockchain to protect the universal ledger’s accuracy and they allow users to verify transactions issued on the network.      See also: Bitcoin Wallets Are Adopting This Tech to Simplify Lightning Payments      A dropping node count might not be a problem for the network, provided that “enough” nodes are still operating, said Matt Corallo, full-time open-source bitcoin developer at Square.      “Ultimately, the raw number is unimportant. What matters are two things: Are users who transact materially with Bitcoin checking transactions against their own full node, and are there enough nodes to service chain downloads for new nodes,” Corallo explained.      But the definition of ""enough"" is “super hard,” he said.      Note: This story originally referred to the developer as Luke Jr., his original moniker.

42431879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7CDh,1588789256,'Black Thursday' Distortion Makes Bitcoin Options Look Cheaper,"With a key metric declining to record lows, bitcoin’s options market may be underpricing cryptocurrency’s future volatility. Analysts say the data is being distorted by “Black Thursday’s” 40% drop.      The spread between bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility (IV) and historical or realized volatility (RV) fell to -47% on Wednesday, the lowest since the crypto derivatives research firm Skew began tracking the data 18 months ago.      The spread turned negative in March and has continued to drop ever since. “Historically, RV has been lower than IV for bitcoin over the last 18 months, except for a short period in the months around September 2019,” noted analytics resource Arcane Research in its monthly report.    What the IV-RV spread usually signifies    Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset will be in the future. It is computed by taking an option and the underlying asset’s price along with other inputs such as time to expiration. Realized, or historical, volatility is the standard deviation from the average price of the underlying asset. It measures volatility actually realized in the past.      Volatility has a positive impact on options price. Higher volatility (uncertainty) leads to stronger hedging demand and a higher price for both call (bullish bet) and put options (bearish bet).    Bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility is hovering near its lifetime average of 4.2%, a sign options appear to be fairly valued.    Traders often expect volatility to be mean reverting, meaning it typically rises after it gets too low and falls after it gets too high, in the process influencing options prices. As a result, seasoned traders keep track of changes in the IV-RV spread, the differential between implied volatility and its lifetime average.      Options prices are considered to be cheap if the IV-RV spread suggests the implied volatility is too low compared to the realized volatility or the average implied volatility. Alternatively, options are considered to be overvalued if the implied volatility is too high compared to its lifetime average or historical volatility.      Put simply, options traders buy calls or puts when implied volatility is too low, the logic being that IV will rise back toward its mean, making options dearer. Meanwhile, traders sell options when implied volatility is too high on hope that IV will fall back toward its mean, making options cheaper.    The March 12 effect    Investors may read the recent drop in bitcoin’s three-month IV-RV spread as a sign the expected volatility is too low and options prices are very cheap compared to historical standards.      However, that is not necessarily the case because the three-month realized volatility is distorted and being held high by bitcoin’s 40% drop registered on March 12.      Read more: What's Next for Bitcoin After March's Crash – CoinDesk Quarterly Review      “The three-month realized volatility still includes that 12th of March point where bitcoin sold off around 40% in a single day,” said Skew’ CEO Emmanuel Goh, while adding that after mid-June the realized volatility would fall as the March 12 data point will be excluded from calculations.      Validating Goh’s argument is the fact that short-duration realized volatility metrics have come down sharply from March’s lofty heights.      The 10-day realized volatility is seen at 80% at press time, down significantly from the high of 321% registered on March 21. Meanwhile, one-month RV stands at 72%, having topped out at 200% on April 21.    Options look fairly valued    Bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility is hovering near its lifetime average of 4.2% at press time, a sign options appear to be fairly valued.      However, both volatility (uncertainty) and option prices are likely to rise as we head closer to next Tuesday’s mining reward halving. The programmed code will reduce rewards per block mined to 6.25 BTC from 12.25 BTC.

Wood, who wrote Ethereum’s technical paper in 2014, created Polkadot with the intention of allowing users to send transactions across blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in what is commonly referred to as making them interoperable.      Polkadot functions under the guidance of the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies, both of which were founded and are led by Wood. The network conducted a $145 million token sale in 2017 and launched its canary network Kusama in July 2019. Since then, Polkadot has focused on integrations with other networks such as Chainlink and Polymath.      Read more: Web3’s Gavin Wood Launches Kusama Network to Test Polkadot Protocol      Like Kusama, Wood told RL1 attendees Polkadot will roll out in five or six stages, beginning with a “chain candidate” launched by the Web3 Foundation. The candidate operates as a de facto genesis block for the network, but under the guidance of Web3 Foundation developers. If the candidate does not meet the team’s requirements during this initial phase, it will be replaced by another, Wood said.      Notably, the network will launch under a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm that Wood invented, which will initially give all on-chain authority to the Web3 Foundation, the non-profit behind Polkadot. As such, the Polkadot network will have limited functionality, Wood said.      “It allows us to start the chain without having to have a set of validators already assembled and having to trust in our potentially unfulfilled governance structures to move the chain forward,Wood said.      The PoA structure is not dissimilar to the NEAR protocol, another Ethereum competitor that announced the launch of its mainnet earlier this week. NEAR is likewise rolling out in a heavily restricted form.      Read more: NEAR Protocol Launches Following $21M Token Sale Led by Andreessen Horowitz      Subsequent stages of the Polkadot rollout will issue the network’s DOT tokens to holders and form validators for the planned switch to PoS. This work will be overseen by a “Sudo module,” Wood said, that will govern how the blockchain structure is initially formed. This module will eventually be dissolved, with DOT token holders taking over the network’s governance toward the end of Polkadot’s launch.      The Sudo module and overarching rollout structure are a “staging ground as much as a proposal” for evolving the chain from something that is restricted to something that is permissionless, Wood said.

42431866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Bph,1588783981,Ohio Lawmakers Propose Blockchain Voting in Elections Overhaul Bill,"Democrats in the Ohio House of Representatives have proposed launching a blockchain voting pilot for overseas military voters registered in the Buckeye State.      Introduced Tuesday as part of the Democrats’ elections law overhaul, the bill calls on Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to “establish a pilot program” of blockchain voting specifically for uniformed service members stationed outside the U.S.      The bill was introduced by Reps. Beth Liston and Michele Lepore-Hagan, and cosponsored by 16 other Democrats.      The proposal is unusually detailed on blockchain’s role. If passed, it would see military members transmit their ballots to election officials via “encrypted blockchain technology” that “protects the security and integrity of the process and protects the voter's privacy.” The receiving board of elections would then print out that ballot “for counting purposes.”      “The Secretary of State shall select the boards of elections that shall participate in the pilot program,” the bill reads.      No technology vendor is named in the bill but multiple companies, including Cleveland-based Votem, build blockchain-based voting platforms that fit the Democrats’ bill. Others outside Ohio also build well-known blockchain voting tools, including Voatz, which has been used in Utah County, Utah, and in West Virginia military voting pilots.      The Democrats’ proposed pilot comes as all internet-reliant voting systems, including those using a blockchain, receive heavy scrutiny from security researchers and experts who argue such systems are impossible to make fully secure.      “Internet voting should not be used in the future until and unless very robust guarantees of security and verifiability are developed and in place, as no known technology guarantees the secrecy, security and verifiability of a marked ballot transmitted over the Internet,” according to signers of an American Association for the Advancement of Science April 9 letter to election officials.      Blockchain only adds more possible attack vectors, they said.      Read more: West Virginia Ditches Blockchain Voting App Provider Voatz      Nevertheless, blockchain systems continue to be part of the conversation around U.S. voting administration. A number of states already have limited blockchain pilots underway, and the tech even made it into a recent U.S. Senate subcommittee memo on ensuring the continuity of Senate operations. Notably, Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, chairs the subcommittee issuing the memo.

The Facebook-created consortium announced Wednesday that Levey would be joining ""later this summer"" and will be overseeing its efforts to ""combine technology innovation with a robust compliance and regulatory framework."" He has been at HSBC since 2012.      Levey previously served the U.S. government as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and has a background in combating illicit finance.      He oversaw sanctions enforcement through the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control and anti-money laundering regulations through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), according to a press release.      Levey had already taken on the HSBC role by the time the bank was fined nearly $2 billion by the U.S. Department of Justice for failing to stop the transmission of funds from drug-running by its customers. The bank was required to take steps to mitigate this risk moving forward but was otherwise not heavily penalized.      Read more: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      ""I am honored to join the Libra Association as it charts a bold path forward to harness the power of technology to transform the global payments landscape,"" Levey said in a statement. ""Technology provides us with the opportunity to make it easier for individuals and businesses to send and receive money, and to empower more than a billion people who have been left on the sidelines of the financial system, all with robust controls to detect and deter illicit financial activity.""      Levey said he looks forward to working with governments and regulators in building out the Libra project.      Libra has made a number of public moves recently, announcing new members including global nonprofit Heifer International and ecommerce site Checkout.com. The consortium, unveiled by Facebook last June, has also begun the process to receive a payments license through the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.      The group did not announce a revised launch date for the libra stablecoins, which were originally set to go live within the first half of 2020. Libra revamped its original vision last month, scaling back plans for a global stablecoin in favor of a series of fiat-backed stablecoins.      Read more: Facebook’s ‘Scaled Back’ Libra Proposal Is More Dangerous Than You Think      In a statement, Libra Association board member and Andreessen Horowitz partner Katie Haun said, ""Stuart brings to the Libra Association the rare combination of an accomplished leader in both the government, where he enjoyed bipartisan respect and influence, and the private sector where he managed teams spread across the globe.""

On the other hand, it also proves that the TRON team is recognized at home and abroad.”      However, when reached Wednesday, a spokesperson for Tron in the U.S. was more ambiguous, telling CoinDesk: “We are a private company and this being a financial matter, we are unable to comment. I am happy to share, however, that our first priority is to always follow laws/rules/regulations of the governing bodies wherein we build our worldwide community.”      The Small Business Administration (SBA), the agency overseeing the Paycheck Protection Program, declined to comment.

Announced Wednesday, the spot and derivatives marketplace joins a select group of well-known cryptocurrency firms including Coinbase, Robinhood and Bitstamp as well as crypto brokerage Tagomi that have all met the required NYFDS standards for the so-called BitLicense.      “We are pleased that the New York Department of Financial Services recognized our commitment to the high standards we borrowed from existing capital markets structures and applied them to the cryptocurrency space,” said Thomas Chippas, CEO of ErisX, in a press release.      See also: New York Grants Bitlicense to Institutional Crypto Exchange Seed CX      In 2019, ErisX was also awarded a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its futures market and clearinghouse.

Formally launched in June 2015, the BitLicense was designed by the NYDFS to provide a framework for companies looking to services relating to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as trading or custody.      The NYFDS requires any businesses conducting cryptocurrency transactions with New York residents to be licensed to operate within the state even if the companies are based elsewhere.    Towards the end of 2019, the BitLicense came under review from NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewellhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/about_the_superintendent, who said it was ""good to take a close look"" at the platforms operating in the emerging cryptocurrency industry and to reflect the changes to the space since 2015.

The regulated STO platform announced Wednesday that it struck a licensing deal with its eponymous European partner, who now has exclusive continental distribution rights for TokenSoft’s tokenization software.      Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft Inc., told CoinDesk the agreement was a natural fit for the crypto-friendly Swiss. Regulators there have been far more straightforward about security token oversight than watchdogs in the U.S.      “Due to the regulatory clarity in Switzerland and due to the comfort that the regulators have there with blockchain-based assets, the pace of innovation has been a little bit faster in Switzerland and so that's why we do see more activity out in Switzerland,” he said.      See also: Beyond the Red Tape: The Path Ahead for Token Sales      TokenSoft retooled its STO software to comply with Swiss regulations as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the omnibus data privacy law better known by its acronym, GDPR, Borda said.

A press release said the company is “uniquely positioned” to the Swiss market.      “We’re seeing increased demand in the European markets and we’re proud to partner with TokenSoft International AG to help meet that demand,” Borda said in a statement.

42431855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76hh,1588775263,"Irish Crypto Firms Squeezed by Bank Account Closures, Regulatory Delays","An Irish crypto company said its business suffered after one of the country's largest banks shut down its account.      Bryan Tierney, founder of bitcoin ATM operator Boinnex, told CoinDesk Allied Irish Banks (AIB) notified the firm last August it was closing its account – initially without any official reason. It was only when Tierney put the account into an arranged overdraft – which precluded the bank from closing the account – that AIB sent an explanation in writing.      Dated Oct. 10, AIB's letter said the account was being closed because ""the market for Cryptocurrencies in ROI [Republic of Ireland] remains unregulated"" and remains unrecognized as money or legal tender by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).      While the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) – which requires crypto companies to register with local regulators and hold information on clients' source of funds – would ""impose new requirements"" on crypto businesses, according to the letter, it hadn't been implemented at the time. ""This type of business activity [emphasis theirs] is outside of our risk appetite at this time,"" AIB concluded.      Although Ireland was set to transpose 5AMLD over into local law along with the rest of Europe in January, this still hasn't taken place. A tie among three of the main political parties in a general election earlier this year has left the country without a government majority. With the coronavirus now a national priority, it's unlikely 5AMLD will be transposed until much later this year.      For Irish cryptocurrency companies like Boinnex, the delay in 5AMLD means they are left without access to mainstream financial services. A legislative draft has been publicized, but until it's enacted businesses will remain stuck in a kind of regulatory limbo.      Boinnex spent thousands of euros making sure they were compliant with the 5AMLD requirements, according to Tierney. Although the team is only three people full-time, they still had to bring on a part-time compliance officer to assist those efforts.      See also: India’s Supreme Court Lifts Banking Ban on Crypto Exchanges      Boinnex had been forced to close for six weeks after AIB closed its account. While he had hoped to find a local banking partner, Tierney said he came to the conclusion that ""you can't bank if you're a cryptocurrency company in Ireland at the moment.""      In the end, the firm reluctantly went to a specialist bank in Lithuania, called Mistertango, and set up a relationship there. Soon, though, Lithuanian regulators fined the bank €250,000 for ""systemic"" violations to AML and counter-terrorist financing laws, which led Mistertango to close its doors.      “I was quite reluctant to use Mistertango, basically because I’d heard bad things in terms of their reputation. At the time it was the only show [crypto-friendly bank] in town so we ended up paying a couple of thousand and then within a couple of months it was closed.”      Boinnex said it now has a reliable banking partner for the crypto business, as well as a Bank of Ireland (BOI) account allowing the payment of salaries and anything else that doesn't touch the crypto part of the business. ""I know three other companies that had Bank of Ireland accounts that were closed,"" Tierney said, ""we wouldn't take that chance.""      In a statement to CoinDesk, an AIB spokesperson said the bank didn't have a policy against crypto companies. They added that they required all clients to follow local AML and know-your-customer requirements. ""We cannot open accounts for customers who are unable to comply with these regulations,"" they said.      See also: Facebook Affirms Libra Commitment With 50 New Job Openings in Ireland      This isn't an isolated incident; other Irish crypto businesses have faced similar issues.      Fellow exchange BitIreland said it also had an AIB account closed back in 2018. A spokesperson said the firm was now forced to pay ""insane monthly amounts"" to use a payments account from an offshore bank, and is now planning on selling the business.      Crypto exchange Bitcove told CoinDesk it has held accounts with all the major Irish banks, including AIB and BOI, but they had all been closed down. ""We were actually awarded a start-up business award by Bank of Ireland, only to have our account closed a few short months later,"" a spokesperson said. ""The Irish banks were never interested in our AML policies, even when we tried to show them how our operations were fully compliant.""      One business owner, who asked he and his business remain unnamed, said they had considered setting themselves up in Ireland but had gone elsewhere because he found banks weren't willing to work with crypto firms. ""We looked a couple of years ago and went elsewhere as all the vibes in the market were that it was too difficult,"" he said.      See also: Coinbase Custody Goes International With New Entity in Ireland      Tierney is still annoyed by AIB's decision to close the Boinnex account because it caused disruption to his business. What makes it worse, he said, is the Irish government has been trying to promote the country as an ideal destination for crypto businesses but has done little to work with existing industry players.      In an interview with the Irish Times last year, Irish Finance Minister Pascal Donoughue said the government “fully supports the development and adoption of new technologies like blockchain, as a way to encourage digitalization and foster innovation.”      At the time, Lory Kehoe, managing director of ConsenSys Ireland, accused the government of failing to take the new technology seriously.

42431848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76Rh,1588770000,"Bitcoin Can Boost Portfolio Returns, Even if Bought at All-Time High: Bitwise Study","With the right management strategy, bitcoin almost always boosts the value of a mixed portfolio, according to Bitwise research – even if bought at the all-time high.      Based on a test portfolio using historical data, the San Francisco-based asset manager found investors who allocated a small percentage of bitcoin to a portfolio made up of stocks and bonds would have made a notable increase to cumulative returns, even in the past three years.      Bitwise said in its Wednesday report – co-written by its head of research, Matt Hougan – that a 2.5% allocation of bitcoin in January 2014, rebalanced on a quarterly basis, would have boosted portfolio returns from 26% to almost 45% by March 31, 2020. A 5% allocation would have pretty much-doubled returns on a traditional portfolio to 65% over the same timeframe.      That's not altogether surprising. After all, the price of bitcoin has moved from $750 to $6,500 over the past six years. Considering bitcoin was the best-performing asset of the last decade, investors would expect outsized returns for holding something that saw a price increase of 766%.      But what's interesting is returns still increased, albeit marginally, even when bitcoin was allocated at the all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017 and continued to be held at the same portfolio weighting until March 31, even as the value dropped by some 66% to just under $6,500.      On the same timeframe, and assuming quarterly rebalancing, an allocation of 2.5% or 5% contributed returns of either 0.05% or 0.40% to a portfolio of 60% world equity and 40% bonds. Without any bitcoin allocation, the value of the portfolio would have actually decreased by 0.54%; more than a 1% bitcoin allocation would lead to a 0.51% drop in a portfolio's overall value.      In its report, Bitwise explains these seemingly paradoxical results stem from the nature of bitcoin as an asset: it's highly volatile, but largely uncorrelated to other assets.      See also: Bitwise Looks to Retail Market for Its Crypto Index Fund      This secret sauce makes it an ideal component for volatility harvesting – a wealth management strategy that only came about in 2012 – whereby rebalancing boosts returns by skimming value off the top of well-performing but volatile assets, such as bitcoin, and locking it into something more stable, like a blue-chip stock.      ""Adding bitcoin to a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds would have consistently and significantly increased both the cumulative and risk-adjusted returns of that portfolio over any meaningful time period in bitcoin’s history, provided a rebalancing strategy is in place,"" the report reads.      There are some caveats. Bitwise stresses that it depends on a disciplined and consistent rebalancing strategy. Those who rebalanced too often suffered from lower returns, and those who just held and never rebalanced, significantly increased their downside risk.      Bitwise found that between 2014 and March 2020, with a 2.5% bitcoin allocation, a monthly rebalancing led to returns of only 38% and actually raised drawdowns to 22.3%; holding made returns of 42.1%, but came with drawdowns of 32%. An annual rebalancing presented the best of both worlds, with cumulative returns of 67% and maximum drawdowns of only 22.3%, all other things being equal.      The asset manager also said that piling too much bitcoin into a portfolio, say more than 5% allocation, actually raised volatility so drawdown risk would begin to outweigh potential gains.      See also: Cryptocurrencies Are Still the World’s Best Performing Asset Class This Year      Of course, the report works on the basis bitcoin will continue to show the same characteristics and same upside, going forward. Eliezer Ndinga, a research associate at Swiss-based crypto product provider 21Shares, told CoinDesk that market uncertainty could ""potentially put on pause the adoption of cryptoassets from high-profile traditional financial institutions in the foreseeable future.""      But, he added, ""the digital nature of cryptoassets with a finite and predictable supply uncorrelated to traditional monetary and fiscal policies with transportability that do not require social contact, have the chance to increasingly become an attractive asset.""

42431861,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76rh,1588765200,"First Mover: US Arms of Binance, FTX Push Into Margin Trading, but Likely Not at 100x","Cryptocurrency exchanges based outside the U.S. are pushing to fill what they see as a competitive gap in the world's biggest economy – offering more leverage to traders who have limited alternatives due to a strict domestic regulatory environment.      Antigua and Barbuda-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX plans to launch its newly established U.S. unit this month. Margin trading, in which users can buy and sell assets using borrowed money, could become a key feature of the U.S. operations, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      “The crypto exchange ecosystem as a whole has been in need of competition for a while, and we're excited to be able to offer liquid order books, tons of features, margin trading for qualified customers and a constantly evolving product in the States,” Bankman-Fried said.      Catherine Coley, CEO of the U.S. unit of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, told CoinDesk the company is “actively working toward implementing margin trading.” The business, Binance.US, launched last year.      Outside the United States, traders can get leverage on purchases of cryptocurrencies and derivatives via exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex and BitMEX, in some cases enabling bets of up to 100 times the money down. All three exchanges initially welcomed traders in the U.S. but later started turning some customers away under pressure from local regulators.      “U.S. traders have limited access to margin trading because it's more tightly regulated here than in other jurisdictions,” said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel for Compound, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency lender.      The dearth of margin-trading venues for U.S. cryptocurrency investors highlights the balkanized nature of the fast-evolving international digital-asset marketplace: It’s nominally a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week realm that crosses sovereign borders, but in reality rules are applied differently by financial authorities across multiple jurisdictions.      Jim Harper, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former counsel to U.S. congressional committees, said in an email that domestic regulators are applying a consumer-protection lens to rules governing domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. That may not comport with the mentality of crypto traders who don’t mind taking bigger risks, with less protection.      “Every aspect of the cryptocurrency world is high risk, high reward,” Harper said.      CME, the Chicago-based exchange that has offered regulated bitcoin futures contracts since late 2017, allows trading on margin but at a much lower level than international exchanges beyond the reach of U.S. regulators.      For example, the CME's May bitcoin futures contract requires a maintenance margin of $14,743 per contract, according to the exchange's website. That works out to about 33% of the five-bitcoin contract's closing price on Tuesday, based on a quote of $9,030 per bitcoin. The leverage equivalent is 3x.      The CME is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which imposes strict rules on the use of margin.      “To protect people from getting burned, the CFTC is arguably inhibiting the development of a U.S. market and capacities among U.S. investors to exercise the kind of caution they'll need in what is truly a global financial services market,” said Harper.      At least two U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken and Coinbase, offer margin trading, but also at a lower level than the high-octane levels on some of the overseas venues. At Kraken, the limit is 5x leverage, and at Coinbase it’s 3x.      “Of course, margin trading in crypto specifically is ultra-risky given the tendency for major daily moves, and that might be why U.S. exchanges have been wary to roll it out in a meaningful way,” said Kinjal Shah, senior associate at Blockchain Capital.      Some investors say the availability of leverage can deepen a market by attracting additional traders, in turn helping to assure a good price and execution.      “Margin products available to U.S.-domiciled investments funds are highly limited mainly because of the regulatory hurdles here in the U.S.,” said Justin Yashouafar, managing partner at Los Angeles-based Blockhead Capital.      According to Chervinsky, any exchanges looking to bolster their margin trading offerings are likely to bump into limits imposed by U.S. regulators.      They still wouldn't be able to offer “the high leverage ratios that offshore exchanges have popularized with crypto traders,” he said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,222 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,290 | 24-Hr Low: $8,811      Trend: Bitcoin is trading above $9,200 at press time amid mixed signals on the technical charts.      While the above-70 reading on the 14-day relative strength index indicates overbought conditions and scope for a pullback, the Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, is still hovering above zero – a sign buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure.      More importantly, Tuesday's UTC close above $9,000, the first in two months, validated dip demand near $8,500 observed on Monday, and restored the immediate bullish bias.      The outlook had turned neutral following the cryptocurrency's repeated failures to keep gains above $9,000 over the weekend. The pennant breakout seen on the four-hour chart also indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      With price charts showing bullish patterns, the overbought reading on the RSI takes a back seat. After all, indicators follow price. As such, one can expect bitcoin to revisit the April 30 high of $9,485. The bullish case would be invalidated if prices drop below Tuesday's low of $8,760.      At press time, that looks unlikely, as futures on the S&P 500 and major European stocks are flashing green.

42431859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76nh,1588763876,Bitcoin Breaches $9.2K as Open Positions on CME Futures Hit 10-Month High,"Bitcoin is quickly gathering upward momentum alongside a surge in open positions on futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).      The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to a high of $9,220 at 10:20 UTC on Wednesday, having settled (UTC) above $9,000 on Tuesday to register its first above-$9,000 daily close in two months.      Meanwhile, open interest – or the number of futures contracts outstanding on the CME – rose to $351 million on Tuesday, the highest level since July 10, 2019, according to the data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Open interest hit a bottom of $107 million on March 12, when bitcoin’s price fell by over 40% amid the coronavirus-led crash in the traditional markets. Since then, open positions have risen by 228%.      ""The uptick in the CME open interest is indicative of professional traders returning to the bitcoin market,"" noted analytics resource Arcane Research in its monthly report. CME open interest is widely considered to be a proxy for institutional activity.      While that may be the case, retail investors, too, could be trading CME futures through TD Ameritrade, an online broker.      Further, the latest open interest figure may have been distorted due to the rumored entry of Renaissance Technologies’ into CME futures trading. In March, the quantitative analysis-heavy firm gave the green light for its Medallion fund to trade the CME’s cash-settled bitcoin futures market.      Some observers argue that only U.S.-regulated institutions are required to trade on the CME while the rest may be trading on other major exchanges like BitMEX.      See also: BitMEX Is Making Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone, Researcher Finds      Put simply, the uptick in the CME open interest does not necessarily represent institutional activity, more so as the exchange accounts for a small portion of the global futures open interest.      “It’s still small relative to the rest of the market and the overall market open interest is still quite low,” said Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.      Total open interest in futures listed on major exchanges across the globe stood at over $2.5 billion on Tuesday, the highest level since March 11, when the tally was around $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, CME’s contribution to the global tally was 14%.      Nevertheless, the uptick in both the CME and global volume is likely to bring cheer to bulls as a rise in open interest alongside an upward move in prices is said to confirm an uptrend.

42431860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76ph,1588759200,Why Binance and Akon Are Betting on Africa for Crypto Adoption,"In advance of her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed on May 11, Leigh Cuen is writing a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world. The first installment explored bitcoin adoption in the Middle East.      The future of money will be defined by African markets, where cryptocurrency awareness and usage surged dramatically over the past year.      Aspiring entrepreneurs like Ghanian high school student Emmanuella see bitcoin as a tool for international trade, not just speculation. He plans to buy some as soon as he turns 18 and can apply for a local mobile money account.      “I will use it to open up a business,” he said.      Ghanian exchange founder Nawaf Abd of eBitcoinics said local demand for bitcoin increased since the coronavirus crisis began, even though his physical stores in Accra and Kumasi are both closed. Through trading online, he continues to supply local buyers with bitcoin. He said his sales were up 70% in March, so much that some days he sells out of bitcoin, but declined to say how many users that entailed. His servers briefly went down in April due to overwhelming traffic on the site.    CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.    According to researcher Matt Ahlborg, Ghanian volume at peer-to-peer exchanges LocalBitcoins and Paxful increased to roughly $6.2 million over 90 days of the lockdown, up from roughly $4.2 million the previous 90-day period. Yet another Ghanian student, 18-year-old Derrick Bannerman, bought his first bitcoin during the last dip.      “I already had interest but the period seemed like the perfect moment to do something about my interest in bitcoins since we're at home doing nothing,” Bannerman said from Accra. “The thing that interests me the most is its increasing value, popularity and security.”      And Nigerian bitcoin market activity is nearly 10 times Ghana’s. Ahlborg’s metrics showed roughly $63.9 million worth of Nigerian bitcoin trades during the lockdown.      With some 60% of Africa’s 1.25 billion people under the age of 25, local traders, as well as crypto behemoths, are placing their bets on future growth.      More coverage of cryptocurrency in Africa:  Wala Was Africa’s Perfect Crypto Success Story – Until It Collapsed  Even If It Fails: Why Dash Could Have a Lasting Impact on Crypto Adoption  Binance and Others Are Rushing to Provide Stablecoins to Nigerian Crypto Users  Nigeria    For example, Yele Bademosi, co-founder of the Binance-backed social payments startup Bundle, said thousands of Nigerians downloaded the Bundle app since it launched in late April.      There’s been some traction in Ghana as well, where Bademosi said the startup is looking to expand. But so far Nigerian demand is overwhelming enough. Roughly a 1,000 people signed up for an introductory Zoom webinar about bitcoin, he said, although there was only room for 100 to attend.      “It’s about making it easy to move value, regardless of whether it’s cash or crypto,” Bademosi said. “You can send [money] to any [smartphone] number in your contacts, even if they’re not on the app yet.”      For now, the app offers a fiat on-ramp to users with Nigerian bank accounts and supports bitcoin, ether, BNB, plus will soon support Binance’s dollar-denominated stablecoin BUSD.      “We have users who were interested in bitcoin but felt it was a little too difficult to get,” he said. “People use cryptocurrency as a remittance gateway as well as a hedge against any devaluations of local currency, plus speculative trading.”      And local entrepreneurs aren’t the only ones to notice the opportunity on the continent.    Akon City    Senegalese-American hip-hop artist Akon is the latest celebrity to join the cryptocurrency industry, setting his sights on Africa.    He created a startup and corresponding foundation, both called Akoin, advised by Bancor co-founder Galia Benartzihttps://www.akoin.io/static/wp/Akoin-WP.pdf, to issue a pan-African currency. He’ll start in Senegal, where President Macky Sall sold the performer 2,000 acres of land to establish Akon City, and an industrial tech park in Kenya, Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC). The latter jurisdiction is expected to start using Akon’s cryptocurrency in the next few months.    “[Akoin] will be the primary digital payment solution and currency within the city … for all kinds of things that are city-related, like paying utility bills. They will ultimately pay employees in the hospital and the supermarket in Akoin,” said Akoin co-founder and Hollywood producer Jon Karas. “The government has asked people to go digital and not be using physical currency, overall, throughout the country.”      Register: Akon appears on May 11 at Consensus: Distributed      This Stellar-based token will launch within the next few months through a token sale aimed at raising $6.75 million. According to the project’s white paper, the sale represents 10% of the total token supply. Another 10% of the tokens will go to the founding team, plus an additional 5% will go to advisors.      “When it comes to growing vendor relationships in each country, we look at Dash in Venezuela as an example,” said Akoin co-founder Lynn Liss, an active promoter of token sales since 2016. She added government-endorsed Akoin systems will also offer civilians a stablecoin for “something relatable to savings.”      In Latin America, the Dash team has been criticized for overstating adoption metrics and marketing to vulnerable populations. There appears to be organic demand for cryptocurrency in Kenya, at least, with Ahlborg’s research indicating Paxful and LocalBitcoins traction in the country doubled over the past year to roughly $44 million worth of annual volume.      It remains to be seen which assets will gain traction across the continent, which includes a variety of jurisdictions with unique circumstances.      “We look for ways that we can help the people in Senegal, provide more tools, services to help the population, all the way to COVID-19 relief efforts we are currently looking at with the Senegalese government,” Karas said.      Regardless of their stance on any specific asset, all the above-mentioned entrepreneurs, across borders, agreed there’s an immeasurable opportunity to be found in Africa’s young and underserved populations.      “I got involved [with bitcoin] because I think it's a currency of the future,” said Ghanaian student Albert Kwame Grant, who purchased his first cryptocurrency stash in April.",POSITIVE,BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/06/why-binance-and-akon-are-betting-on-africa-for-crypto-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a4634d4694db8e24373a3c7a037ef6b605ddbac-1500x1187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76lh,1588756022,Amun Launches Token Tracking the Inverse of Bitcoin's Price,"A new token lets traders make gains whenever bitcoin's price falls.      Swiss fintech firm Amun launched its BTCSHORT (BTCS) daily inverse token Wednesday, which returns gains based on inverse price movements of bitcoin (BTC) in a given 24-hour period. The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January and now overseen by sister firm 21Shares following a March rebranding.      ""Typically, these purchases are short term in nature, usually on a daily basis, as the holder aims to move in quickly to leverage a near-term decline in bitcoin to make a positive return,"" the firm said in an announcement.      Designed as a stablecoin, BTCS is built on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard, meaning it's as easy to purchase as any other token and will be available on secondary markets beginning with Liquid, HitBTC and Bitcoin.com, Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun and 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an interview.      ""Demand for these leverage and inverse tokens is tremendous,"" Rashwan said. ""The users want the ability to buy these kinds of products in an easier and safer way.""      Rashwan said BTCS was purpose-built for traders of all stripes: retail to institutional. Moreover, the token was released before the May 11 bitcoin halving in order for traders to hedge against potential volatility, Amun said.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The token was designed under the practices and standards developed by 21Shares, Rashwan said. The firm currently lists 11 ETPs on multiple European stock exchanges including the SIX Swiss.      For compliance reasons, minting and burning BTCS is conducted on the Amun platform in exchange for the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC and remains off-limits to U.S. and Swiss investors, along with internationally sanctioned nations.      Rashwan said Amun will roll out similar inverse tokens, including one for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ether (ETH), in the coming weeks.    Simplicity sells    With BTCS, the firm is primarily catering to the risk-averse side of the crypto market, investors who would rather trade regulation-compliant products, Rashwan said.      ""Regulations are important and it is just astounding to me how that's now a contrarian opinion,"" he said.      Alternative derivatives markets such as BitMEX, Binance and FTX often stand on the other side of the moat. For example, BitMEX and FTX operate out of the lightly regulated Seychelles and Antigua and Barbuda, respectively, while Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao frequently reminds his Twitter followers of his firm’s decentralized work environment and is somewhat hazy on where the company is based.      Either way, new products are chasing the money flowing into crypto derivatives platforms, which Rashwan said would likely overtake spot cryptocurrency trading in the near future.      One new product that perhaps best highlights this innovation would be FTX's (i)BVOL financial instrument, which made its debut late last month.      (i)BVOL comes in both a long and an inverse form – hence the (i) – and generally ""tracks market implied volatility,"" FTX and Alameda Research CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in an email.      Like the BTCS token, the (i)BVOL token is built on the ERC-20 standard and a separate in-house contract called MOVE that gives ""traders the ability to buy and sell bitcoin volatility over different time periods on margin,"" Bankman-Fried said.      Notably, these tokens free traders from margin maintenance, known to be a sticky issue in crypto derivatives trading.      FTX and Amun's tokens perhaps suggest ERC-20-based, wrapped derivatives are a good solution for retail users who can struggle with complex derivatives products.      Rashwan pointed to the March delisting of a different set of FTX tokens from Binance's derivatives platform as a salient example for Amun. As CoinDesk reported, Binance's CZ removed the BULL and BEAR leverage tokens from his platform, arguing that ""users don't understand"" the products and were therefore taking unrealized losses.      See also: CFTC Approves Bitnomial to Offer Futures Contracts Settled in Real Bitcoin      For Rashwan, simplicity sells. ""I'm financially quite literate and it's not always clear what I'm buying with these products.

42431851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76Xh,1588741200,ASX Accused of Trying to 'Crush' Rival Blockchain Trading System,"The CEO of fintech firm iSignthis has accused the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) of abusing its market-leader position by trying to delay the launch of ClearPay, a blockchain-based trading system on the rival National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX).      A joint venture between iSignthis and the NSX, ClearPay uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) to facilitate same-day settlements and up-to-date accounting between trading participants, the share registry, and the exchange. Although it was only publicly unveiled in February, the CEO of both iSignthis and NSX, John Karantzis, said the news was leaked beforehand and claimed the news led to ASX suspending trading in ISX shares on Oct. 2.      Karantzis told CoinDesk the ASX has held a ""public inquisition"" into ClearPay and how it would compete with its settlement service, Austraclear, as well as its own in-the-works DLT-based trading system.      ""To be perfectly honest, [the ASX is] doing a pretty good job trying to crush us at the moment,"" he said.      ASX has been working on a DLT-based replacement for its ageing clearing system for nearly five years. Although it had originally been scheduled for April 2021, the exchange said in late March it would delay the launch date over the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus. At the time, Karantzis said ClearPay was on track to launch sometime in early 2021.      See also: Sweden’s Central Bank Finally Embraces DLT, but Only in Simulation Mode      For its part, ASX said it suspended iSignthis shares – which had risen tenfold over the course of 2019 – so it could conduct a review after a market research group raised concerns about the company's disclosures, governance and shareholder structure.      In December 2019, iSignthis began legal proceedings against the exchange, claiming the suspension was unlawful. Then, this April, it requested an injunction that would block the ASX from releasing a 41-page report alleging iSignthis had broken the law. This was rejected by the court.      In the report, released April 30, ASX said iSignthis issued 336 million performance, or ""milestone,"" shares to company directors and managers after it had signed four unusual contracts, outside of its core business, that were not publicly disclosed until much later.      ""[I]f ASX were to reinstate ISX shares to trading now, it would allow the holders of the Milestone Shares to immediately sell them on-market and walk away with the proceeds in circumstances where there are serious questions to be answered about the legitimacy of their issue,"" the report concludes.      In a statement, Karantzis said: ""the board of ISX rejects the ASX’s Statement of Reasons, which it considers to be a fundamentally flawed document that forms a number of erroneous conclusions based on factually incorrect information and assumptions.""      Karantzis added that iSignthis was continuing their suit against ASX.      See also: State Street: 38% of Clients Will Put More Money into Digital Assets in 2020      CoinDesk approached ASX for comment on Karantzis' new allegations that the trading suspension was an attempt to delay the development of the ClearPay trading system.      A spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations, but said the exchange was only made aware that there was any sort of relationship between iSignthis and the NSX in February, more than five months after ISX shares were suspended.

The firm will initially allocate $5 million to help the startups bring their products to market while providing them with access to major crypto venture capital firms including Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital, Dragonfly Capital and 1confirmation.      According to Nervos, any startup with an existing minimum viable product could apply for, and potentially receive, up to $100,000 in equity-free capital plus join a four-month program designed to help the teams get a deeper understanding of the Nervos’ infrastructure and the resources needed to launch or scale products on the network.      Founded in 2018, the San Francisco-based Nervos has raised over $100 million. It secured a $28 million Series A funding led by Polychain and Sequoia China in July 2018 and a $72 million token sale in November. Its two-layer open network aims to maintain as high a level of security as the Bitcoin network, while increasing scalability through a side chain.    Meet the new boss    CK Labs will be headed by Ben Morris. Morris comes from Status, an Ethereum-based messaging platform where he headed its incubator program. He led investments into Matrix, Pixura and LeapDAO, three startups focused on improving the scalability of Ethereum-based networks.      Before that Morris worked as Head of Treasury Specialists at Thomson Reuters out of Dubai and was eCommerce business development manager at Bloomberg from Singapore.      “The CK Labs program was specifically designed to accelerate teams focused on ushering in the first wave of adoption,” Morris said. “Given the versatility of Nervos, we want to invite founders from all business verticals to apply.”      The firm said applications for the first batch of CK Labs are now being accepted. The program will run several times every year with two to four teams each to ensure they get personalized support.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/06/nervos-aims-to-spur-blockchain-development-with-new-incubator-headed-by-industry-vet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9161f5dd53c9feeccc52e283917e7291ff7d2faf-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
