However, the hard fork has been the victim of multiple postponements, which have caused some shifts in the price of ADA. The first time the hard fork was postponed was back in June due to bugs that were found in the network. The next date had to be moved once more when the developers of the network were still not done with the bugs, as they wanted to make it safe to interact with. That has seen the launch date of the hard fork moved to August.

42393787,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzYZ,1660340818,Crypto Privacy Protocol Monero Is Getting a Major Upgrade,"Monero, the popular privacy-focused cryptocurrency protocol, is preparing for a major network upgrade this weekend (targeted for Saturday, August 13). Monero, whose native token is monero (XMR), is an open-source project that launched in 2014 as “Bitmonero.” It claims XMR is a secure, private and untraceable cryptocurrency that keeps financial transactions confidential.  The upgrade will be implemented via a hard fork – a permanent change to the blockchain that isn’t backwards-compatible (nodes either accept the change or split off onto a separate blockchain).  “Upgrade your software today to Monero v0.18,” said one Monero developer in an interview with CoinDesk on Friday. He added that users should familiarize themselves with the Monero blog post published in April that explains the upgrade in detail.  Read more: Monero: The Privacy Coin Explained  How does Monero work?  Monero uses innovative cryptography to offer a high level of privacy and security to its users. Some of the cryptocurrency’s key features include:  Ring signatures: digital signatures that can be produced by any member in a group. It should be computationally infeasible to determine which key (from that group of keys) was used to create the signature. Ring signatures make it impossible to trace the origin of a Monero transaction (untraceability).  Stealth addresses: one-time addresses that are automatically generated for each new transaction. A Monero user can publish a single address yet receive all incoming funds in different addresses. Those different addresses can’t be linked back to the user’s published address (or any other transaction address for that matter). Only the sender and receiver know the address the payment was sent to (unlinkability).  Bulletproofs: zero-knowledge proofs that enable confidential transactions on Monero and other protocols. A confidential transaction is one where the amount being transferred has been cryptographically concealed.  Dandelion++: a feature in Monero that hides the connection between transactions and node IP addresses. This increases transaction privacy.  Wallets and exchanges: Several key exchanges such as Bittrex and Kraken (in the UK) have delisted monero (and similar privacy-protecting cryptocurrencies). Other exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) won’t even list monero. The reason for this revolves around the inability to conduct know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks on monero users.  Wallets that support monero include Ledger and Trezor, two popular hardware wallets. Cake wallet is a hot wallet that was originally exclusive to monero but now also supports bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and haven (XHV).  Read more: Bittrex to Delist 'Privacy Coins' Monero, Dash and Zcash  The upgrade  Saturday’s scheduled upgrade will introduce several features. Here are some of the expected changes and improvements:  The number of signers for a ring signature will increase from 11 to 16 for every transaction.  Bulletproofs+, an upgrade to the current Bulletproofs algorithm, will be introduced. Bulletproofs+ reduces transaction size and increases transaction speed. Overall performance is expected to improve by 5%-7%.  View tags will be a new way to speed up wallet syncing by 30%-40%.  Fee changes will minimize fee volatility and improve overall network security.  Multisignature functionality will be improved and critical security patches will be added.  Monero use cases  According to Monero community site, Monero Outreach, people in regions with oppressive regimes or depressed economies benefit the most from a private, secure and low-fee cryptocurrency like XMR.  Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer for the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) has praised bitcoin (BTC), monero and other cryptocurrencies as financial tools for journalists and activists. He wrote a blog post in 2018 titled, “Why Bitcoin Matters for Freedom.” Gladstein’s article describes how Bitcoin protects citizens in countries like Zimbabwe against hyperinflation. He also praises Monero’s privacy-enhancing features, hailing them as a “countering force” against censorship by oppressive regimes in Venezuela, Iran, and North Korea.  Read more: Zimbabwe Halts Mobile Transactions as Hyperinflation Spurs Currency Flight  Privacy is, of course, a double-edged sword, and Monero has seen its fair share of illicit use. Chainalysis, a blockchain security company, reported that XMR is the most popular cryptocurrency with “cryptojackers” – a form of malware that hijacks computing resources from unsuspecting users and exploits those resources to mine XMR (the cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work for consensus).  “...Funds are moving directly from the mempool to mining addresses unknown to us, rather than from the victim’s wallet to a new wallet,” wrote Chainalysis.  The article by Chainalysis reports that 5% of all monero in circulation was mined by cryptojackers, representing over $100 million in illicit gains and making cryptojackers the most popular cryptocurrency-focused malware.  The Monero community  Riccardo Spagni, also known as “fluffypony,” may be the person who comes to mind when the name Monero is mentioned. He joined the project in 2014 and stepped down from the lead maintainer role in December 2019. Spagni is currently dealing with legal problems from a 2021 fraud charge.  Read more: Monero’s Ricardo ‘Fluffypony’ Spagni to Surrender to US Marshals on July 5  The Monero project is obviously much bigger than Spagni alone. More than 300 developers worldwide have contributed to Monero. This latest upgrade was a collaborative effort involving 71 developers, which speaks to the robustness of the Monero developer community.  Other privacy-focused projects such as Tornado Cash have had at least one developer arrested. Tornado Cash was recently blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury Department. Could Monero suffer a similar fate?  “At the moment, I'm not concerned about immediate legal action,” one Monero contributor told CoinDesk in an interview. “There is no direct financial incentive … for developers, unlike [the situation with] the Tornado Cash developer.”  He also advised all open-source contributors working on privacy-preserving projects to seriously consider protecting their own personal privacy and identity.",POSITIVE,BTC | XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | XMR | FORKS,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/12/privacy-protocol-monero-is-getting-a-major-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65a83f42aa2e45279cf0c8243b87e851e1b8780a-5445x4084.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It will also be cutting jobs, according to a blog post Friday.  CORRECTION (Aug. 13, 22:52 UTC): Clarifies Skynet's relationship to Siacoin, which wastaken over by a completely separate non-profit organization, the Sia Foundation, in 2021.  In 2020, the startup formerly known as Nebulous, raised $3 million in a funding round led by crypto investing giant Paradigm. Skynet Labs was formed as the company sought to focus on Skynet, a decentralized storage and app hosting platform to buildout a decentralized internet.  “It is with regret that we announce Skynet Labs has been unable to complete its next round of fundraising and will be shutting down,” CEO David Vorick wrote in the blog post. Skynet, however, will continue to operate as a platform, he said, adding that user files will stay online, and key portions of the infrastructure will continue to be actively developed.  ""Not the outcome we wanted, but not the end of the road for Skynet either,"" Vorick also said in a Tweet on Friday.  Read more: Blockchain File Storage and the Fight Against Ransomware  Skynet Labs has cut headcount by half and will decrease the number of employees even more over the next month. “Much of what Skynet has accomplished, including its ability to continue operating in the face of Skynet Lab’s dissolution, and including its ability to provide value to the wider Web3 ecosystem, is owed to the efforts and contributions of the Skynet Labs team members,” Vorick added.  On July 26, Vorick laid out road map for Skynet in a blog post and said the team has been focusing on decentralization and Web3 user experience similar to Web2.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price reclaimed $24,000 after falling earlier in the day. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading sideways and just over this threshold. Bitcoin rose 3% over the last week, continuing recent momentum.  Ether’s (ETH) price increased 0.6%, surpassing $1,900 for the second time this week. ETH’s price has increased 9% over the past seven days as investors eagerly await the Ethereum Merge, which will shift the protocol from proof-of-work to the faster, more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  This year, BTC and ETH have fallen 50% and 48%, respectively, and have been tightly correlated with each other. Correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former indicating a direct relationship, while the latter implies a completely inverse relationship.  Traditional markets finished the week on an up note, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes up 0.61%, 1.12%, and 0.85% respectively.  The rally was broad-based, with about 70% of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, closing higher.  The price of crude oil declined 2.6% while natural gas fell 1.17%. The price of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, increased 0.53%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC’s weekly RSI signals growing momentum in prices.  BTC’s weekly chart illustrates a continuing trend higher for bitcoin. After sliding 42% between March 28 and June 27, the price has increased 25% to above $24,000, albeit with a few switchbacks.  A spike in volume starting June 13 implied that sellers were increasingly motivated to exit BTC positions. A question for investors is whether the selling pressure was based on the perceived value of bitcoin or driven by market-wide contagion, leading to forced selling.  The slide in BTC prices during that week coincided with a pause in customer withdrawals by bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, and equally bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital facing $400 million in liquidations.  Technically, the narrowing of weekly candles and the decline in BTC’s ATR (average true range) since June 13 implies both a decline in volatility and selling conviction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely regarded crypto markets indicator measuring price momentum on a range between “overbought” and “oversold,” underscored investors’ aversion to digital assets but also an opening for those willing to embrace risk.  While a reading of 70 implies that an asset is potentially overbought (i.e., overvalued), a reading of 30 implies that the asset is potentially undervalued. BTC’s RSI of 25.72 for the week starting June 27 coincided with a low last approached in 2015.  This RSI implies that BTC was the most oversold as it has been in almost seven years. Investors who used the chart to generate entry and exit positions saw this trend as an opportunity to add BTC,, triggering its move upward this summer.

42411392,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXit,1660335324,An Alleged Tornado Cash Developer Was Arrested. Are You Next?,"Should Tim Cook of Apple be thrown in jail for manufacturing a phone that’s used by criminals to plan heists? Should the CEO of Boeing be punished for building the planes that hijackers flew into the World Trade Center? Is the inventor of the pressure cooker criminally responsible for making something that can be turned into a bomb?  On Friday, news broke that Dutch authorities have arrested someone who allegedly contributed to the open-source Tornado Cash cryptocurrency tumbler on Ethereum. The full story is not yet known, though many crypto and privacy advocates were immediately troubled by the prospect of criminalizing code.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  We know the person arrested was a 29-year-old male, and apprehended in Amsterdam. We know Tornado Cash is a service used to anonymize crypto transactions that was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday. We know Dutch financial regulators opened a criminal investigation into that service in June.  The coder, however, was only “suspected” of helping to code Tornado Cash. And, likewise, only “suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering,” according to the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD).  We do not know the full implications of this move, how wide the probe is or what it might mean for crypto in future. “Multiple arrests are not ruled out,” the Dutch financial investigators said in a statement.  Depending on how things shake out, how Tornado Cash’s founders are “dealt with” by criminal investigators and for what justification, the case could have a significant chilling effect on crypto development – especially projects or updates related to privacy.  For years, crypto coders have acted under a cloud of uncertainty. There are real differences between how a truly decentralized program operates in the wild and other software projects, differences that are not yet fully understood under the law. But there’s also something like self-denial at play by the crypto industry, which may lead to a false sense of security or confidence.  There are certain things about writing code that are pretty cut and dry. At least in the U.S., merely publishing code on Github is almost always legal if it’s an original idea – even for controversial things like ghost guns and crypto mixers. That’s a legacy of the so-called cryptography wars 30 years ago: Code is a language, cryptography is speech and the government is constitutionally prevented from banning its production under, say, munitions regulations.  The situation gets dicier when you move beyond the act of writing. “Without commenting on Tornado Cash specifically, acts like providing help to someone who wants to use the code, uploading a mixing smart contract to a protocol or operating a web app which can hook into a user’s MetaMask wallet strays into potentially criminal territory,” Preston Byrne, a lawyer who specializes in cybercrime and crypto, told Motherboard this week.  See also: What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins | Interview  This is not the first time a privacy-app developer has been arrested. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Roman Sterlingov, the owner and operator of crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog, for allegedly assisting money laundering. That was a few months after Larry Dean Harmon pleaded guilty for running the unlicensed money-transmitting business Helix and to conspiracy charges related to money laundering on the crypto mixer.  See also: How Popular Are Crypto Mixers? Here's What the Data Tells Us  (The difference between Tornado and Helix or Bitcoin Fog is that the latter two were “custodial,” meaning they took possession of users’ funds – a distinction that may no longer matter when it comes to facilitating money laundering or operating a money transmitter.)  On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control took the unprecedented step of designating a smart contract as a Specially Designated National. This is a classification typically reserved for terrorist organizations and nation-states. It’s a bit like arresting a robot – one that no one can power down or keep others from using.  Tornado Cash is an open-source protocol, meaning that anyone can contribute to or deploy its code. It’s non-custodial, meaning it doesn’t hold onto user’s funds, nor did it have administrators that could see who was using the application or freeze transactions. Its founders burned the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt anonymous transactions on the platform.  That doesn’t mean its founders didn’t attempt to comply with financial regulations, when asked. In April, Tornado began working with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to block addresses sanctioned by OFAC following a particularly high-profile hack orchestrated by the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group. But they were limited by what they could do beyond basically screening the protocol’s “front-end” website.  Once deployed on Ethereum, a smart contract is immutable. This is at least part of the reason why crypto boosters have been so enraged by the recent international actions taken against Tornado. MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen was right to call the sanctions “useless,” because anyone – smart enough to use the command line, and dumb enough to break the law – can still transact with the robot.  In other words, Tornado is a system that operates autonomously. It’s just something that exists in the world – ready to be put to use like an iPhone, a plane or a pressure cooker. And how often are inventors held liable if their systems are misused? As Mike Dudas pointed out, Mastercard (MA) and SWIFT help process fraudulent transactions everyday.  But this argument is not enough. You won’t get far calling cops hypocrites. Although Tornado was clearly used for more than crime – Elliptic and Chainalysis both estimated upwards of $1 billion worth of crypto can be tied back to hacks or malware, out of the $7 billion deposited since 2019 – it was still a system designed specifically to shift some financial flows outside of the purview of financial regulators.  Cops don’t like that. Shifting financial flows without their knowing much about it. Crypto users can say it’s none of the cops’ business how they use their money, but that’s not how the world works. The world isn’t interested in knowing how or why these systems actually operate.  For goodness sake, the U.S. Treasury said that Tornado was used to launder $7 billion worth of crypto, vastly overestimating that amount, according to the data – either meaning they don’t care about the data or are comfortable saying all money that flows by outside its sights is definitionally laundered.  The question for coders might be where this stops, where contributing to a privacy-preserving app crosses the line into facilitating money laundering. Is contributing to Bitcoin’s Taproot part of a conspiracy to assist money laundering, if it eventually improves bitcoin’s privacy? What about contributing to Monero’s upcoming upgrade?  Bloomberg’s Matt Levine has a catchphrase, “everything is securities fraud,” because anything could be considered securities fraud under the broad definition under which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission operates. Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman, applies what he calls a “duck test” to determine what is or isn’t a security – essentially a gut call. The same is true for “wire fraud,” or a financial crime “involving the use of telecommunications or information technology.”  See also: Gary Gensler Isn't Buying Your Decentralization Theater | Opinion  Again, we don’t know why this “supposed” Tornado coder was arrested. He could have been working directly with criminal entities or sanctioned governments to tumble ill-gotten gains on Tornado. Or, he could have been like Virgil Griffith, the Ethereum Foundation developer who traveled to North Korea and was charged with sanctions violations for sharing publicly available information about crypto at a conference.  But Griffith was warned by U.S. state officials before traveling, and he went to North Korea anyway. He may have only been giving an idiot’s guide to Ethereum, but he knew that information was interesting because it was framed as a way to bust sanctions.  When it comes to crypto mixers, the warning is clear enough. There’s little hope remaining that someone can deploy an app, let it run and wash their hands of ownership. Even if it’s strictly up to users what to do with the app, there’s still a person behind the code. And it’s probably better if we don’t know their name.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/12/an-alleged-tornado-cash-developer-was-arrested-are-you-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c059259ca411f2760d1751f00dc5588c60eaea9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum products are receiving more attention from big-shot investors. Though there is no stated period for the Merge, most developers anticipate the upgrade by September 19. However, most Ethereum derivatives are getting more investment deals as the final phase details are revealed. James Butterfill, the Head of Research of CoinShares, stated that investors&apos; sentiment for Ethereum products is changing. Butterfill made this known in the latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. He noted that the sudden intensity and desire from the investors is due to the Merge approach. According to the report, most institutional investors make preferential investments in Ethereum products. Hence they are pushing in more funds as they believe in the great possibility of the Ethereum network. To them, upgrading the global second largest cryptocurrency would create a more positive and profitable impact. Due to the change in sentiment, the report noted that Ethereum had seen more inflows amounting to about $16 million. This resulted in a seven-week pattern of inflows that accumulated up to $159 million.

Canada’s Largest Blockchain Conference Beamed With Bullish Energy,"Bears be damned – the bulls geared up as thousands of participants in the crypto world descended upon Toronto this week for ETHToronto and the Blockchain Futurist Conference.  Billed as Canada’s largest blockchain conference, the three-day event was held at two of Toronto’s most prominent nightclubs – Rebel and Cabana – which are known to be frequented by many A-list celebrities.  The conference had a hackathon, panels, several fun activities, afterparties and a keynote by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who poked fun at monkey JPEGs. To top it all off, Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman rapped about interoperability and use cases for the ecosystem.  Read more: ‘Hey, Look, It’s a Monkey!’ Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Pokes Fun at Ape NFTs, Expresses Optimism About the Merge  Maybe it was the party atmosphere or the beautiful summer days of Toronto but, judging by the mood of the participants, it seemed like the audience felt that the crypto rout has bottomed out.  Of course, it also helped that, during the conference, Ethereum network native token ether (ETH) hit its highest price since June, ahead of the network overhaul known as the Merge, which looks likely to happen next month.  “For the first time in a long time, people were inspired again,” said attendee Greg Gopman, chief marketing officer of crypto infrastructure provider Ankr. “Maybe it was Vitalik showing up. Maybe it's news of the Merge nearing reality. Or maybe it was just the beautiful indoor-outdoor venue during two perfect Toronto summer days – but for the first time in a while, things felt bullish again.”  The main focus of the conference, aside from the obvious discussions on the Merge and decentralized finance (DeFi), included privacy and regulations, real-world applications of blockchain, interest in crypto from traditional finance (TradFi) and new technologies as well as a rare feat in crypto – female empowerment.  The Merge and beyond  Between the many bars at the conference and plenty of schmoozing at side events, the conference was buzzing with the excitement of the upcoming Merge, which will see Ethereum move from its proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake, as well as the improvements to the network that will be made beyond the upgrade to a more energy-efficient system.  While Vitalik Buterin was upbeat about the Merge, Anthony Di Iorio, another co-founder of Ethereum, told the audience about the white-list opening of Andiami, a global tech project designed to add value to leading decentralized networks, which will be launched on Nov. 3 of this year, about 10 years to the day after the first Bitcoin meeting he hosted in Toronto.  (Fun fact: Vitalik Buterin is Canadian and many people consider Canada the birthplace of Ethereum.)  Di Lorio excitedly left the audience – not because of his new project but rather because he was in a rush to the hospital to welcome his newborn.  Aside from talks about Ethereum, other layer-2 representation also made its way around the conference.  “There was a very optimistic crowd present in Toronto with layer 2 and the Merge at the forefront of discussion. It was great to see the level of collaboration between the variety of ecosystems and projects that were present, said Zack Gall, VP of communications at EOS Foundation.  A layer-1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1.  Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 rollup platform, also shared that participants in the conference seemed enthusiastic about layer-2 products, especially in a post-Merge world.  Kevin Liu, a co-founder of Metis, mentioned that there was “a lot of hype over Ethereum. We spoke about so many projects and we were excited to speak with everyone about Reputation Power on Matrix [Metis’ Web3 identity system], which will help drive mass adoptions of Web2 to Web3.”  Meanwhile, interoperability among the blockchains was a big topic of discussion. In fact, after his keynote speech, Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman rapped about “interoperability and sovereignty.” Cosmos – described as the ""internet of blockchains,” a network of blockchains able to communicate with one another in a decentralized way – was pitched by him as one interoperability solution.  “An interoperable, multichain ecosystem will be crucial to unlock growth for the crypto and blockchain industry,” said Viveik Vivekananthan, CEO of Swing, a Web3 liquidity infrastructure provider company.  Privacy  What’s a blockchain conference without debate on privacy? There were plenty of discussions on the topic.  During a panel discussion on privacy, Warren Paul Anderson of Discreet Labs, a blockchain research and development company building out Findora and other privacy protocols, said that there’s been a real push in the industry to put everything on the chain, because it protects “the ethos of decentralization.” But what is missing in the privacy space is trust, he said.  Anderson believes that zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, which ensure that data can be shared without releasing personal information, will be able to solve this problem. This will be the next phase of innovation around privacy issues in blockchain, he said.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  Anderson’s comment came right before the sanctioning of Tornado Cash, which made the need for privacy and regulations a much-debated topic. “Given the recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash, privacy seemed to be a hot topic of conversation at the Blockchain Futurist Conference this year,” he told CoinDesk.  Crypto and everyday uses  On the more educational side, the opportunities to interact with blockchain and crypto in real life were endless at the conference.  By competing in dead hangs to win $1,000 in bitcoin, using cryptos via Flexa (a crypto-payments app to pay for food) and arriving by helicopter at the venue using payments in crypto, participants had ample opportunity to use crypto for “mainstream"" activities.  Tracy Leparulo, the main organizer of ETHToronto and the Blockchain Futurist Conference, spoke to CoinDesk about the conference’s launch of a real-life engagement token “to bring people close to real life and drive actions on site.”     ‘Won’t be caught dead’  Meanwhile, TradFi interest in crypto was very prominent at the conference.  Leparulo said that she has been running the conference since 2013, and before, the TradFi crowd wouldn’t even “be caught dead” coming to a crypto conference – the complete opposite of this year’s conference turnout.  “The largest audience of this event this year is [made up of] people within traditional capital markets,” she said, adding that there were people from investment groups and stock exchanges at the conference, showing a shift in mindset about the crypto industry.  It's not surprising to see the intersection of TradFi and crypto, as recently there has been a continued push from the institutional investors to expand into the industry. Most recently, BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, has formed a partnership with publicly traded crypto-exchange Coinbase (COIN) to make crypto directly available to institutional investors.  Female empowerment  In a more surprising twist, the conference had a strong female representation, not just crypto bros.  Maybe it's because the organizers were led by some prominent women in crypto.  “The most inspiring part is that we had the largest submission to CryptoChicks bounty for the hackathon. A total of 13 projects led by women were submitted,” Metis and Cryptochicks CEO Elena Sinelnikova told CoinDesk.  “We at Metis are so grateful that we were able to help organize this conference with Untraceable and CryptoChicks,” she added.

42421839,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAQf,1660331694,NBA Top Shot 101,"NBA Top Shot is an NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace that allows people to collect and trade video clips, known at NBA Top Shot as Moments, from National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association games. These digital collectibles are stored on the blockchain and are comparable with a digital version of a trading card. You can buy, sell or trade these Moments just like you can with other NFT collectibles.  The project is a collaboration between the NBA, the NBA Players Association and Dapper Labs and was launched in 2020.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  What are Moment NFTs?  Moment NFTs are official NBA digital collectibles that capture epic highlights from NBA games and of players. These NFTs consist of short videos that show an amazing highlight from the court, such as a half-court 3-pointer or a buzzer-beating jump shot, along with details on the team, player and any other info that makes that Moment special.  Each ""Moment"" is like a digital version of a trading card. Simply put, a Moment NFT is licensed by the NBA and minted with a unique serial number that includes game and player stats. You can buy, sell or trade these Moments just like any other collectible. NBA Top Shot Moments are digital collectibles that live on the blockchain.  Apart from the core collection, a Moment can also depict a historical event for one of the teams in the NBA or WNBA.  All Moment NFTs are minted on the Flow blockchain with a link to a special-event video, although the videos themselves are stored off-chain.  What are Moment tiers?  Moment NFTs are categorized into a tier representing their status and scarcity. There are five ""Moment tiers"":  Common: Common Moments are the most available NFTs as the circulation count often starts from 4000-plus. These are readily available in either packs or the marketplace.  Fandom: This tier is the most exciting collection experience for fans. The circulation count is driven by dynamic demand rather than by a specific mint number. This tier of NFTs can be found during special promotional activities.  Rare: The originality of these Moments is marked by neon corners on the front. Rare tier Moments have a circulation size from 250 to 2,022.  Legendary: Legendary Moments are the most prestigious among all the tiers. The circulation count ranges from 50 to 125 with neon corners. Because of their scarcity, these are the most sought-after Moments.  What are NBA Top Shot packs?  NBA Top Shot packs are randomly selected Moments bundled into a pack, usually by a specific theme such as WNBA and the NBA summer league.  Three categories of packs:  Common packs: These packs, which contain a variety of common Moments, are the most widely purchased packs. The names of common packs might vary, but a base set pack, like the starter pack, is the most prevalent type of common pack.  Rare packs: Between common and legendary packs, rare packs are in the middle and can distribute Moments anyway they see fit. They will typically include a mix of several common Moments and one uncommon Moment.  Legendary packs: Legendary packs are the most expensive and in-demand packs. They typically contain one legendary Moment, three rare Moments, and numerous common Moments.  What you need to get started  You will need to create an account on the NBA Top Shot website to get started. Once you have done that, you can start buying, selling or trading.  Read more: Why NFTs Are So Appealing – And How Anyone Can Start Learning for Free  How to open an account on NBA Top Shot  Go to nbatopshot.com and register with an email account or choose your Google account for a quick sign-up.  The default wallet for NBA Top Shop is the Dapper wallet, which is linked directly to NBA Top Shot from the navigation bar under the profile icon in the top right. The Dapper wallet is the easiest choice and allows users to gain rankings and points that make up internal rankings like “Top Shot Score,” but you can use any wallet compatible with the Flow blockchain to store your NFTs.  Read more: How to Transfer NFTs Between Wallets  For payments, you will be able to use either fiat currency, credit card or cryptocurrency such as ETH and FLOW.  NBA Top Shot uses the Flow blockchain to record each Moments transaction.  1. After signing up using your specified email address, click the button wherein you are to the terms and conditions of the website.  2. Don't forget to review and agree to the terms and use privacy policy, and NBA privacy policy.  3. Choose your favorite NBA or WNBA team.  4. After that, you can see the available products and start collecting.     Buying NFTs on NBA Top Shot  There are a few ways to obtain NFTs on Top Shot The most common methods are through packs under drops (as shown in the red box below) or by purchasing packs or Moments individually in the marketplace (as shown in the blue box below).  You can get Moments in three ways:  Pack purchases  Packs are blind purchases that offer a chance to get random Moments. As we outlined earlier, packs have different tiers and some will be more expensive than others. Just like with physical trading card packs, the contents of each pack are not made public until they are opened and the Moments are revealed.  Read More: Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game  A marketplace is a place where you can buy and sell Moments with other members of the community. All transactions on the marketplace are done using flow, the cryptocurrency that powers NBA Top Shot.  Challenges  You can opt to complete a challenge to obtain a Moment NFT. Challenges comprise of tasks that you need to complete to enter the challenge to be qualified for a reward. For instance, the screenshot below shows the tasks associated with this Donovan Mitchell challenge.  Farther down the page, the tasks are defined more clearly, like the screenshot below for the Donovan Mitchell challenge.  NFT marketplace  Apart from buying packs, you can search for individual Moments according to subcategories like rookies and top sales. For example, the homepage of the marketplace lets you choose which subcategory you like, as seen in the screenshot below.  When you buy or sell Moments on the marketplace, you do so directly with another community member. There is no mediator involved in the transaction.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike Up Following Rally Above $24k As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the BTC whales with between 1k to 10k BTC seem to have sent a large stack to exchanges recently. The &apos;exchange inflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transferred to wallets of all centralized exchanges (both spot and derivatives). When the value of this metric spikes up, it means a large number of coins are being deposited to exchanges right now. Depending on how many of these are being moved to spot exchanges, such a trend can be bearish for the price of BTC as investors usually send to these exchanges for selling purposes. Related Reading: Bitcoin aSOPR Fails Retest Of Historical Bull-Bear Junction On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest there is little selling going on in the market at the moment.

Because gold prices are related to the US dollar value due to gold being dollar-denominated, a stronger USD keeps the price of gold down and more controlled. A weaker USD drives the gold price higher due to increasing demand. Ultimately this means that more gold can be purchased when the dollar is more vulnerable, protecting investors against economic events like currency devaluation and providing a safety net during periods of political instability. Gold gained popularity for its ability to be an inflation hedge when governments attempted to protect their economies, like in 1879 when the US introduced a gold standard that began backing the US dollar with actual gold to combat inflation, and in 1971 when President Nixon decided to end the gold standard to gain better control over gold-to-dollar conversions and improve inflation. While the asset has become a go-to for many investors who wish to hedge against inflation due to its apparent low risk of price crashes, one study from Duke University found that the asset class was most successful at combating inflation when invested for periods of over a century.

42374045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCYd,1660325310,CFTC Accuses Ohio Man of Running $12M Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"The U.S. Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken legal action against an Ohio resident it says ran a $12 million Ponzi scheme involving bitcoin, a complaint filed at a district court in the state on Thursday shows.  A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud whereby original investors are paid with funds collected from new investors.  The complaint, filed at the Southern District of Ohio, is a cease-and-desist order against one Rathnakishore Giri and his two companies: SR Private Equity LLC and NBD Eidetic Capital LLC. The CFTC also wants the court to make Giri pay back his wronged investors.  Giri is accused of engineering and perpetuating a scheme designed to dupe investors interested in digital assets, according to CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson.  ""Under the guise that he operated a private equity investment fund with a focus on investing in digital assets, Giri seized upon the contemporary fervor for digital asset investment opportunities and lured unwitting investors to contribute over $12 million in cash and bitcoins to his funds with the promise of exceptional returns without the risk of financial loss,"" Johnson said in a statement published Friday.  The complaint was filed a day after the CFTC, alongside the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to advance a proposal that seeks to broaden reporting requirements of private funds and large hedge funds to include crypto holdings. The proposed rules are part of a joint effort by the regulators to increase transparency of how private funds in the country operate and what assets they manage.  The CFTC alleges Giri violated commodities laws and regulations that prohibit the manipulation of information and ""deceptive devices."" Johnson, in her statement, said that Giri used investors' money to fund a lavish lifestyle ""characterized by use of private jets, yacht rentals, an extravagant vacation home, a luxury car and expensive clothing.""  In addition to ordering Giri to cease all activities related to the fraud, the CFTC wants him to disgorge any monetary benefits ""directly or indirectly"" attached to the violation of regulations, including and not limited to salaries, commissions, loans, fees, revenues and any trading profits.  In her statement, Johnson said the CFTC ""rigorously surveys markets and enforces regulations"" but new financial products like digital assets can ""create new challenges.""  ""This case illustrates these dangers, underscores the ever-present threats, and demonstrates that – no matter the asset class – effective enforcement and customer protections must be among our highest priorities,"" Johnson said.

42411410,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYTB,1660323600,Issues Crypto Should Watch For in the Tornado Cash Sanctions,"What a week huh? Tornado Cash got sanctioned, hedge funds might soon have to report their crypto holdings and we haven’t even had a chance to look at the latest push to give the CFTC spot market oversight.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Storm’s here  The narrative  Tornado Cash getting sanctioned raises all sorts of questions. Are other privacy-focused projects likely to face a similar fate? Was the Tornado sanctioning inevitable? And what’s the deal with North Korea?  Why it matters  Something I’ve been hearing a lot recently from lawyers and regulatory-adjacent folks is that the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) is one of the few federal agencies you absolutely do not want to mess with. Whereas anyone can fight a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit or duke it out in court against the Department of Justice, OFAC can go hard.  Breaking it down  Tornado Cash developer Roman Semenov told Bloomberg News in March that it would be “technically impossible” to enforce sanctions against decentralized protocols like the privacy mixer he helped build.  Earlier this week, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, a sanctions watchdog operating under the auspices of the U.S. Treasury Department, said, “Bet.”  The fallout was swift: Circle immediately froze about $70,000 worth of its USDC stablecoin on Tornado, crypto exchange dYdX blocked accounts that may have once interacted with Tornado, GitHub suspended not only Tornado’s account but also Semenov’s and now everyone’s trying to determine what constitutes an interaction with a sanctioned address.  Perhaps the most interesting outcome was that someone decided to send small amounts of ether (ETH) through Tornado to various celebrities, presumably to try and demonstrate that sanctioning a protocol would not be as effective. (Related note: I casually asked a few lawyers what they thought about this and all of them seemed to think it was not a great idea.)  There are a few different issues I think we need to unpack.  First, there's the North Korea angle. In its press release announcing the sanctions, the Treasury Department said Tornado “has been used to launder … over $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-sponsored hacking group that was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019, in the largest known virtual currency heist to date.”  This same week, but separately, Deputy National Security Adviser Anne Neuberger told an audience that she was “very concerned” about North Korea and its cyber work.  Also, the United Nations reported earlier this year that it estimated North Korea used some $50 million in stolen crypto to fund its nuclear weapons program.  In other words, Treasury’s not just saying that North Korea’s been stealing crypto, it’s that North Korea has been stealing crypto for its weapons program, and Tornado Cash has played a key role in helping it transmit these funds in a way that could evade scrutiny.  As TRM Labs’ Ari Redbord told me, “It’s not just money laundering, it’s money laundering that’s going to be used for weapons proliferation.” So it seems understandable that the U.S. government might be a bit freaked out by this.  This brings me to point number two: the technology angle. Tornado Cash is a protocol, one that was open source to boot and built on a decentralized framework. Unlike when OFAC sanctioned Blender.io, another mixer, Tornado doesn’t exactly have a business to shut down. It has a governance token. The token holders are responsible for voting to accept or reject various possible forks and whatnot. If those holders are not beholden to U.S. sanctions (i.e., they’re not U.S. persons or they feel really really confident in their privacy setup) they may feel more comfortable continuing to operate business as usual.  A senior Treasury official told reporters ahead of Monday’s announcement that following the Blender sanction “we have not seen evidence to suggest that it has remained active” when asked about Tornado being an open-source decentralized project.  The official did not rule out further action in the event Tornado continues to be used for money-laundering purposes, though they did not specify what that action might be.  Where things get weird is when you consider the whole open-source nature of Tornado Cash. As I mentioned, someone (and, I’ve been told, possibly several someones) has been sending small amounts of ETH through Tornado to people who have public Ethereum addresses, including comedians Jimmy Fallon and Dave Chappelle, or crypto folks like Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong and (I guess) Logan Paul and companies like Puma. Because their addresses are public, on the blockchain and not necessarily tied to a specific exchange, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to block these incoming transactions.  I doubt OFAC is going to drop the hammer on celebrities for receiving sanctioned ETH, but I could see the watchdog going after someone openly defying sanctions if they make enough noise. The main issue may be in identifying the sender(s).  Which brings me to point three: the privacy angle. A lot of folks used Tornado for innocuous reasons. The Treasury Department said about $7 billion in crypto flowed through the mixer over the past three years or so since Tornado launched. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic estimated that some 20% of this was illicit, which, to be clear, is a lot. But it also means that over $5 billion was not used in illegal activity but may have just been used by individuals hoping to preserve some privacy while transacting on a digital ledger known for recording every single transaction conducted on it.  A huge chunk of the crypto world is calling the Tornado sanctions an attack on privacy.  Fight for the Future suggested in a statement that the sanction was overly broad, saying that while “hackers and cybercriminals … should be stopped,” the execution may infringe on First Amendment constitutional rights.  “This is a rough equivalent to sanctioning the email protocol in the early days of the internet, with the justification that email is often used to facilitate phishing attacks. Tornado.cash is code, and rather than identify those who were aiding and abetting criminals the Treasury simply sanctioned that code. Code is speech,” the statement said.  Likewise, crypto think tank Coin Center likened the move to trying to restrict speech prior to it occurring.  “In this case, the sanctions laws are being used to create a limitation on spending money not merely with some person who has been found guilty of a crime or even suspected of terrorism. This is a limit on any American who wishes to use her own money and a freely available software tool to maintain her own privacy – including for otherwise entirely legal and personal reasons,” Coin Center said.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tried to illustrate the potential beneficial uses of Tornado Cash, saying he used the mixer to send crypto to Ukraine in its battle against Russia.  I think whatever happens next will largely be defined by Tornado itself. If, after a few weeks, volume continues to stay high, we might see more action from Treasury. If volume drops, maybe not, and people will move on to the next big fight. Admittedly, this seems obvious but this is such a novel case it’s hard to point to any specific precedents.  On Friday morning, after the first draft of this newsletter was written but before it was sent out, Dutch officials arrested an unnamed developer of Tornado Cash on money laundering allegations. That is a really interesting decision. The Fiscal Information and Investigation Service did not detail the specific charges or say if it arrested the person because of the U.S. sanctions or on its own initiative.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Hm. I think we’re basically set now? It doesn’t seem like we’re getting any new nominations.  Elsewhere:  Master of Anons: How a Crypto Developer Faked a DeFi Ecosystem: One single individual built a huge chunk of the protocols powering various tools on Solana, which at one point became responsible for what sounds like around three-quarters of the total value locked (TVL) on the network.

42411389,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXfa,1660318800,Let Ugly Ducklings Grow: Why Crypto Needs a Safe Harbor,"Asked for his views on cryptocurrencies, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler likes to quote the poet James Whitcomb Riley, who wrote, “When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”  The point of Gensler’s “duck test” is that he believes the vast majority of crypto projects are in fact unregistered securities, with little ambiguity. In Gensler’s mind, almost all meet the more conventional Howey Test measure for that.  It’s a nice line but perhaps not the best analogy. After all, a more famous literary reference also draws on the duck image to remind children that first impressions are not always reliable.  In Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairy tale “The Ugly Duckling,” a newborn cygnet is mistakenly thought to be a member of a barnyard mother duck’s brood and is teased for being so plain-looking compared with the other ducklings. Eventually it flees the farm and grows into a beautiful, graceful swan.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Let’s face it, lots of cryptocurrency projects are pretty ugly in their infancy.  In 2013, when Bitcoin was four, its blockchain suffered an accidental hard fork as a failure to reconcile two versions of its code led miners to unknowingly start building two separate chains. One year later, an attacker exploited the so-called “malleability bug” to launch a crippling denial-of-service attack against the Bitcoin network while others used the same exploit to steal bitcoin from the doomed exchange Mt. Gox. Then, in 2016, two-year-old Ethereum faced a massive crisis when an attacker found a bug in the smart contract code for the decentralized investment project The DAO and drained it of $60 million worth of ether.  In all three cases, the issues were resolved with the decisive leadership of core groups of Bitcoin and Ethereum developers. In the first and third instances, the interventions involved coordinating a rollback in the blockchain, with the consensus of users, to cancel transactions occurring after the attack. This speaks to the presence of some degree of centralization in these early phases of protocol development, when bugs and performance problems that clearly hurt the network need to be resolved efficiently.  Notably, as Bitcoin and Ethereum’s networks have grown, both have become increasingly decentralized, making coordination of core code upgrades more challenging. A key indication of this is the years of development work and consensus-building it has taken for Ethereum developers to migrate the blockchain from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which is now poised to happen next month.  It is this evolved state of decentralization that, according to SEC pronouncements, appears to have made the current iterations of Bitcoin and Ethereum exempt from securities registration. Both now fail the part of the Howey Test that says an investment scheme is a security if returns for investors hinge on the work of a small group of people. Bitcoin’s founder and earliest adopters are out of the picture, and Ethereum’s founders don’t have the influence they once had to unilaterally push through changes.  Read more: As Government Takes on the Tornado Mixer, It May Reap a Whirlwind  Here’s the problem: The SEC’s approach to these issues implies that Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s transitional experience are the exception, not the rule. Gensler has said he concurs with his predecessor Jay Clayton’s statement that “every ICO I’ve seen is a security,” referring to initial coin offerings, the means by which many crypto projects attracted their initial funding.  He has also urged decentralized exchanges (DEX) to register with the SEC. This poses a challenge for these protocol-based systems: Who, among their decentralized communities of users and developers, would make the call to file the documents? Under what authority?  Such semantics won’t stop the SEC from taking action – likely against the founding developers of DEX – if it so wishes. Meanwhile, actions such as the recent insider-trading case against a former Coinbase (COIN) employee, which simultaneously described nine Coinbase-listed tokens as securities, are a reminder that, under the blanket “duck test” view, all token projects other than Bitcoin and Ethereum are vulnerable to SEC enforcement.  Watch: Coinbase Executives Issued ‘False Statements’ Ahead of Public Listing, New Lawsuit Alleges  It’s a Damocles Sword threat, and it forces many potentially valuable projects to exercise excessive caution – such as blocking customers that use U.S. IP addresses – which means innovation in this space is inherently constrained.  But if Bitcoin and Ethereum could grow into swans, what’s to say others can’t in the future? And shouldn’t policy incorporate the prospect of that transition from unavoidable centralized structure at initiation to a later decentralized structure that no one can effectively control? Enforcement actions can cripple otherwise high-potential projects; they can condemn them to permanent ugly duckling-hood.  This prospect of transition is precisely what SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s proposal for a safe harbor provision for crypto projects is intended to achieve. It would give crypto projects a three-year grace period within which to develop a robust, decentralized functionality that would render them exempt from securities registration requirements.  Sadly, Peirce’s approach has gained little to no traction among her fellow commissioners.  It’s important that we ask why. After all, the pass that Ethereum has received appears to be based on a notion developed by former SEC Director of the Division of Corporate Finance William Hinman, who in a June 2018 speech suggested that the Ethereum network had over time become “sufficiently decentralized” and so had lost the security status it held at launch.  In its case against Ripple Labs over its XRP token, the SEC has tried to distance itself from what it described as a “personal errand” by Hinman, suggesting that his thesis on transition does not necessarily represent agency doctrine. But Judge Sarah Netburn delivered Ripple a big victory last month, ruling that a draft of the speech, which may well show SEC staff helping to shape Hinman’s thinking, can be admitted as evidence in the case. The popcorn is ready on this one.  Let’s assume the Hinman doctrine is a thing, then. Why would there be a resistance to giving token projects a grace period to become sufficiently decentralized? Perhaps because U.S. regulators don’t see the benefit of decentralization. They like having someone they can hold accountable. Without that, they reason, how can they protect U.S. citizens from bad actors?  What they’re missing is that decentralization is central to the core value proposition for cryptocurrencies. Without it, they’re worthless.  Decentralization enables censorship resistance for bitcoin, so funds can be sent peer-to-peer. For example, a donor in the U.S. can send BTC to an activist in Russia, without Putin’s government, or another central authority, interceding. It’s also a necessary condition to attain the programmability with which decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can automatically execute settlement and collateral contracts. If a third party has control over the system, it has the power to intervene, which means there’s no guarantee of automaticity. Programmability is lost.  If we want a more open, fluid and equitably accessible financial system, one that’s not subject to the political and economic manipulation by Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail intermediating institutions, decentralization is a worthy goal. After all, the recent big failures in crypto-lending projects were concentrated in centralized finance (CeFi) providers such as Celsius and Voyager while broadly decentralized DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound survived the industry’s de facto stress test remarkably well.  It’s quite simple, really: If there is a centralized entity with custody of its customers’ funds, it can lose or otherwise impair those funds against its customers’ interests. If there is no custody, only the customer can lose funds. In that case, there’s literally no one to regulate.  If regulators keep imposing rules that favor centralization – as with the demands placed on crypto providers to block accounts using the Ethereum-based mixing service Tornado Cash (see The Conversation below) – they will simply build the same risks into the system and hinder the development of viable decentralized models.

42421835,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAJR,1660318709,Top Questions About Proof-of-Stake and Staking Answered,"With Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) expected as early as September 2022, a multitude of questions and misconceptions around staking ether and the workings of the consensus layer are all the more relevant to clarify.  What are validators?  One of the core components of proof-of-stake is a validator. Like miners on proof-of-work, validators are responsible for processing transactions on Ethereum and, by doing so, helping secure the network. Anyone can become a validator on PoS by depositing (staking) a minimum of 32 ether (ETH) into the specific contract. The protocol then randomly selects participants to propose and vote on new blocks. Three pieces of software are required to become a validator on Ethereum: an execution client, a consensus client and a validator.  There are more than 400,000 validators on the Beacon Chain, the foundation of Ethereum's future proof-of-stake network. Slots for new validators occur every 12 seconds to create a new block and send it out to other nodes (participants) on the network.  What are epochs?  In blockchain networks, an epoch is a period of time that dictates when certain events will occur. Examples include the rate at which rewards are distributed or when a new group of validators will be assigned to validate transactions. Blockchain protocols that utilize epochs vary in what time period defines an epoch. With PoS Ethereum, an epoch occurs every 32 slots (6.4 minutes). Each slot in an epoch represents a set time for a committee of validators (groups of at least 128 validators) to propose and attest to (vote on) the validity of new blocks.  How do committees work in Ethereum?  In order to ensure fairness in the validating process, the Beacon Chain randomly groups stakers together into committees of at least 128 validators and assigns them to slots. It is important to note, however, that the block proposer may or may not be a committee member for the specific slot – it’s independent.  How do validators get rewarded?  Now that you understand validators, committees and epochs, you can start to unpack how validators earn what’s known as a block reward. In each epoch, there are 32 sets of committees. After a committee is assigned to a block, one random person out of the 128 in the committee is selected as the block proposer. That person is the only one who can propose a new block of transactions while the other 127 people vote on the proposal and attest to the transactions. Once a majority agrees, the block is added to the blockchain and the validator who proposed the block receives a variable amount of ETH based on a formulaic calculation.  See also: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  How are validators penalized for bad behavior?  There are penalties if validators behave dishonestly or go offline. For example, proposing multiple blocks (equivocating) or submitting contradictory attestations (votes) results in punishments called slashings, which means validators lose a percentage of their staked ETH. The amount of ether slashed depends on the number of validators being slashed around the same time, otherwise known as the ""correlation penalty."" It can range from 1% for a single validator to 100% of a validator's stake slashed.  How is finality determined on PoS?  Finality is the concept that transactions on a blockchain become immutable. It guarantees that data cannot be altered, canceled or lost once included in the canonical chain. The time to reach a state of finality depends on the blockchain's latency level.  Finality with PoS Ethereum is organized through a deterministic method and what’s known as ""checkpoint"" blocks. The first block in each epoch (every 32 slots) is a checkpoint. Participants then vote on pairs of checkpoints that are considered valid.  Once a checkpoint gains a supermajority vote (two-thirds of the total staked ETH), it becomes justified. When its child checkpoint gets justified, it is upgraded to finalized and all previous epochs are also finalized. In essence, the difference between justified or finalized checkpoints depends on where it sits in the timeline.  As finality on PoS requires at least two-thirds (supermajority vote), an attacker could prevent finality by voting with at least one-third of the total ETH staked. But this is where the inactivity leak comes in. If the chain doesn't reach finality for more than four epochs, the inactivity leak will reduce staked ether from validators voting against the majority, and allow honest validators to finalize the chain.  Can a 51% attack happen when Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake?  A 51% attack is when a group of miners, or nodes, have enough ownership over a blockchain's hash power to alter how it functions. While it is still possible to do this with PoS Ethereum, an attacker would need to have 51% of the total staked ETH, which would mean controlling billions and billions of dollars' worth of ETH.  However, even if an attacker could use his or her influence to create an altered version of Ethereum (due to a majority voting power), with PoS, the community could mount a counterattack. Honest validators and participants could keep building on the minority chain, and encourage others to do the same.  Overall, despite being extremely expensive to launch and maintain, the higher the number of participants on a network, the more difficult it becomes to launch a successful cyberattack.  Can I participate in staking without setting up hardware?  Yes, you can do so with SaaS providers.  SaaS, short for Software as a Service, helps validators run and operate their clients (hardware) for a small fee. This service allows users the benefit of earning block rewards without worrying about hardware specs, setup, node maintenance and upgrades. While validators do not have to provide access to keys that allow withdrawals or transfers of staked funds, validators are still at risk of SaaS operators acting in a malicious way or being subject to strict regulation – and therefore requiring a higher degree of trust in a third party.  Why is solo staking considered the “best”?  Solo staking is viewed as the gold standard as it allows users to retain complete autonomy over their hardware and funds. Alongside solo staking, however, there are other methods such as SaaS and pooled staking. While all validators are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, staking as a service or pooled staking are more suited to people who are either uncomfortable handling the required hardware or can’t meet the 32 ETH threshold. Here’s what you should consider when deciding if you want to start solo staking.  How can I participate in staking if I don’t have 32 ETH?  You can join what’s known as a staking pool. Pooled staking is a method suited for anyone unable to deposit 32 ETH. While it also removes the need to maintain hardware, as with SaaS, risks still involve trusting a third party to run and maintain the node, and will cost you some sort of fee. Along with giving rewards for staking ETH, numerous staking pools offer a liquidity token that represents a claim on staked ETH and the rewards generated. Another benefit is that staking pools allow users to retain control over their funds and use staked ETH as collateral in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications.  When the Merge takes place, what will happen to my staked ETH?  Although it depends on the provider, unstaking ETH will not be allowed until after the Shanghai hard fork. Nonetheless, a derivative token called stETH (staked ether) is freely tradable in the meantime. In addition, once withdrawals are enabled, the exit rates for validators will be staggered by the protocol to help prevent any market fluctuation or security risks. According to the Ethereum website, only six validators may exit per epoch (every 6.4 minutes, so 1,350 per day, or only ~43,200 ETH per day out of 10 million ETH staked). Furthermore, although ETH will still remain locked for a period of time post-Merge, validators will have immediate access to the fee rewards/MEV (miner extractable value) earned during block proposals.  Is staked ETH the same as staking ETH? How are they connected?  No, staking ETH is the process of depositing and locking up any amount of ether to help validate and secure the consensus layer (the Beacon Chain) and receive rewards for doing so. On platforms like Lido Finance, users can stake their ETH and receive stETH, which can be traded or used for other DeFi applications like lending. In essence, it allows users the option to continue trading or transacting while their ETH currency is locked in the deposit contract. Holders of stETH can also redeem their tokens for an equivalent, or 1:1, amount of ether (along with accrued yields) once the transition to proof-of-stake is complete.  Other versions of staked ETH include: aETHc (Ankr), BETH (Binance), and rETH (Rocket Pool)  See also: From stETH to wETH to Gwei: Understanding the Different Shades of Ethereum  Why isn’t staked ETH (stETH) pegged to ETH?  Unlike wETH, which is tradable for ETH on a 1:1 basis at all times, parity between stETH and ether was never assumed. To prevent larger players (like Lido) from rapidly selling stETH and negatively affecting the price of ETH during market volatility, stETH is not pegged to ETH. This is also because – according to a June 16 report by Coinshares – unlike a stablecoin, stETH does not need a 1:1 correlation to function correctly. Rather, its value is backed by the inflexible nature of ETH that is locked for a set duration of time.  Does PoS give preferential treatment to people who stake more ETH?  Validators are selected via a pseudorandom process through RANDAO. Because RANDAO is part of the infrastructure in the Ethereum ecosystem, the basic premise is that at every epoch, the Beacon Chain utilizes RANDAO to assign block proposers to each slot and shuffles validators around to different committees.  Although RANDAO is still subject to potential bias or manipulation when generating the final number, for now, it’s considered secure enough. With that said, Ethereum might integrate what’s known as a verifiable delay function (VDF) in the future that makes the calculation time longer, more difficult to predict, and able to eliminate any last-level random deviation. As randomness is foundational to the Beacon Chain and is inspired by Dfinity's concept of a randomness beacon, despite larger entities like Coinbase being able to propose more blocks, every validator has exactly the same expected payout and an equal probability of being selected for duties.  See also: Will a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum Lead to More Centralization?  Does PoS help the rich get richer?  A common argument amongst proponents of proof-of-work is that proof-of-stake favors the rich and reduces the rewards for those with less ether. Although users earn a higher return proportionate to the amount of ETH staked (and some can run multiple validator clients), the fixed annual yield of 5% to 15% will apply to all participants regardless of whether a single validator stakes 32 ETH or an institution stakes 100 ETH + across multiple accounts.  Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake have levers that can be pulled by investing more money in one way or another. By buying more mining rigs or finding cheaper sources of energy, miners on proof-of-work can increase their computational power. By staking more ETH in proof-of-stake, people will have more chances to be selected to validate transactions.  The main advantage, in terms of investment, of PoS is that unlike with PoW, it offers lower ongoing costs. It is less energy intensive and does not require constant upgrades to the mining setups that proof-of-work demands. But ultimately, supply and demand determines many of the costs to participate in both consensus mechanisms, and those costs will always fluctuate.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | RPL | FORKS,Mason Marcobello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/top-questions-about-proof-of-stake-and-staking-answered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/938833ed693de9e6ae685d0f5675835064b508c9-4147x3110.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The loan, which was granted by a North Dakota bank, is expected to have an interest rate of 1.5% for the first 13 months after including ""state-based economic incentives"" and 6.5% for the remainder of the term, according to a company press release on Friday.  Debt has been a sore spot for some crypto miners, some of which have faced margin calls on their loans as the value of their collateral, usually bitcoin or equipment, has diminished during the past few months' market rout. Given the capital-heavy nature of the mining business, however, raising funds through debt has been one of the few ways miners have been able to build during the bear market.  “The new credit facility doubles our loan-to-value on our Jamestown facility and provides us with additional capital to fund our growth plans and deliver on the increasing demand from our customers,” CEO Wes Cummins said in the press release.  In March, the company signed a $7.5 million five-year loan with Vantage Bank Texas with 5% interest to build the site in Jamestown, North Dakota.  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market  The hosting firm has 100 megawatt (MW) worth of bitcoin mining capacity at its Jamestown facility, which has been partially offline ""due to unexpected equipment failure at the substation powering the facility,"" but which was expected to be back up and running early in September, according to a July 18 press release. The company didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on any progress on the facility.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves. In recent months, demand for hosting crypto miners has seen an uptick as infrastructure and power supply-related delays – as well as the lack of capital – have caused bottlenecks for miners that are often now finding themselves with more mining rigs than available power.  Most recently, Applied Blockchain has signed a deal to host 200 MW of Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) mining rigs in the North Dakota and Texas facilities. Applied will supply Marathon with 90 MW of hosting capacity at its Texas location and at least 110 MW at a second facility in North Dakota.

Crypto entrepreneurs Sam Bankman-Fried and Justin Sun are in talks to buy a majority stake of Huobi Global in what could be one of the biggest deals ever in crypto.  Market Moves: The value of crypto derivative contracts traded rose 13.4% last month from June. That was the first uptick since March.  Chart of The Day: The broadest tightening cycle in history signals pain for risky assets.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Despite the crypto market showing some strength this week, bitcoin (BTC) was trading down on the day by 4%, while ether (ETH) declined by 2%.  Bitcoin hit a two-month high of $24,900 on Thursday, but now appears to be struggling for momentum.  Ether was up 10% on the week after the Ethereum blockchain had its third and final testnet ahead of the Merge. Ethereum Classic (ETC) and OKEx’s token, OKB, were both up 6% in the last 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s slower upward movement is in line with its declining dominance against altcoins. BTC dominance stands at about 40%, a decline from its recent high of 47% in June.  The decline in price for BTC on Friday might encourage some profit-taking over the weekend, according to Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.  “What's interesting about bitcoin at these levels is how little momentum there is in the rallies, which is going to make $25,000 very difficult to overcome,” Erlam wrote in a note on Friday.  “Is that a sign that we're seeing some profit-taking or that the correction has run its course and further downside pressure is on the horizon?” he added.  Traditional markets also had a good week, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both set to post their longest sequence of weekly gains since November.  In the news, Leon Li, founder of crypto exchange Huobi Global, is in talks to sell a majority stake in the company in a transaction that would value the firm at $3 billion or more, Bloomberg reported on Friday.  Li is looking to sell almost 60% of the firm, and has held preliminary talks with Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain network, and FTX, the crypto exchange founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, CoinDesk’s Parikshit Mishra and Oliver Knight reported.  In a tweet, Sun denied any involvement.  Coinbase was in the news on Thursday, too, as credit ratings agency S&P Global said in a note that the outlook for the crypto exchange was ""negative.""  On Friday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the exchange has frozen or recovered $450,000 in funds stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) Curve.Finance earlier this week.

The London-based data aggregator and index provider said $3.17 trillion worth of the contracts changed hands in July, while turnover in the spot market fell 1.34% to $1.39 trillion, the lowest level since December 2020. Spot trading volume on the Coinbase (COIN) crypto exchange, a venue preferred by institutional investors, declined 12.8% to $51.5 billion.  Unlike spot trading, trading derivatives offer leverage. While that allows investors to control a sizable contract value with a relatively small amount of money and increase their potential profits, it also increases their risk. Market observers consider derivatives market activity as a proxy for traders, or speculative interest, while the spot market is seen as representing long-term investors.  ""The rise in derivatives trading volume indicates an increase in speculative activity as traders believe there is room for further upside in this rally, with no Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for next month,"" CryptoCompare said in its monthly report. The rate-setting FOMC will meet in September, but not in August.  ""The increase in derivatives trading volume was also amplified this month as traders speculated on the impact of the Ethereum Merge and potential hard forks on Ethereum,"" the report said of July.  The use of leverage, not spot market trading, fueled a crypto market rally in July that restored $240 billion in market capitalization. While leverage boosts returns, it exposes traders to forced liquidations by exchanges if the traders can't meet margin shortages. Therefore, derivatives-led rallies like July's often inject volatility into the market. That said, overall leverage still remains low compared with early 2021.  Another key takeaway from the report is that there was no shortage of people chasing stablecoins despite the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin in May and the ensuing volatility in other cryptocurrencies with values pegged to the dollar or other fiat currencies.  CryptoCompare's report shows the volume for bitcoin-to-stablecoin tether (USDT) spot trading increased 31.5% to 8.78 million BTC in July. Bitcoin spot trading into binanceUSD (BUSD) surged 80.2% to 2.13 million BTC, surpassing bitcoin-to-U.S. dollar turnover for the first time on record.  ""Investors continue to prefer safety under macroeconomic conditions,"" CryptoCompare noted about the pickup in bitcoin-to-stablecoin volume.  The crypto market valuation on Thursday rose to a two-month high of $1.17 trillion, extending July's recovery. Volume could pick up further in coming weeks as the supposedly bullish Ethereum Merge is due in mid-September.     Chart of the Day  Broadest Tightening Cycle in History Signals Pain for Risk Assets  By Omkar Godbole  The historically unprecedented synchronized monetary tightening across countries indicates that the path of least resistance for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, is to the downside.  Markets haven't seen this kind of global tightening in decades. During the previous Federal Reserve rate hike cycle of late 2015 to late 2018, other major central banks held on to low rates and liquidity-pumping asset purchase programs, providing a cushion to risky assets.

42374051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCcP,1660312900,"A Crypto Bro Walked Into a Wall Street Bar, and It Went Just Fine","NEW YORK — It’s easy when walking around the financial district in lower Manhattan to be struck by the oldness of it: the winding streets carved out long before the nearly perfect grid farther north, the cobblestones in front of the New York Stock Exchange.  You could clearly spot the old days Tuesday night inside Broadstone Bar & Kitchen, a few minutes’ walk south of the NYSE. Attendees included employees of T. Rowe Price, the stalwart money manager founded in 1937, as well as folks from the Chicago Board Options Exchange and investment bank RBC Capital Markets, neither of which were born yesterday. Many wore suits adorned with NYSE name tags.  But there were signs at the weirder, burgeoning cryptocurrency culture that, at least among the biggest optimists, aims to upend the old ways of doing finance and trading. You could spot the crypto folks immediately in their standard attire: jeans, T-shirts and FTX hats.  They had all gathered for a happy hour held for sponsors of Wall Street Rides FAR, which raises money for the Autism Science Foundation, not long after they had rung the 4 p.m. NYSE closing bell.  Celebratory vibes filled the room as the old and the new mingled, just as the old and new had come together days earlier in an even bigger way when BlackRock, the $10 trillion asset manager, agreed to give institutional investors who use its Aladdin platform access to crypto through the Coinbase exchange. The week before that, crypto exchange FTX.US had switched on its stock brokerage service, stepping into NYSE’s centuries-old turf.  Read more: BlackRock to Offer Crypto for Institutional Investors Through Coinbase Prime  Crypto attendees at the happy hour included FTX.US employees as well as representatives from Talos, which develops software that helps conventional investors trade crypto, and blockchain infrastructure firm Blockdaemon. The Blockdaemon folks quickly occupied the same circles as employees from IEX, the stock exchange made Wall Street famous by Michael Lewis’ 2014 book “Flash Boys” that's now crypto-adjacent after FTX.US bought a stake this year.  Mike McCoy, a senior product manager at Blockdaemon who attended the event wearing the company's logo on a cycling shirt over a formal button down, has witnessed the crypto climate shift since he entered the industry in 2015. He told CoinDesk that the industry's techy developer culture has turned its focus to traditional financial players – a group Blockdaemon is courting.  “Your habits and a lot of things kind of change, you know? You dress up in the morning, you work more trading desks, who are particularly providers, traditional custodians, like the major banks of the world,” he said. “Watching crypto democratize the wealth that is in some of these larger banks shows a better financial system.”  But not all TradFi natives are comfortable yet. Blockdaemon sales director Melissa Moo Harkins attributes any hesitation to a lack of regulatory clarity. Harkins told CoinDesk that once that comes, innovation and creativity in the crypto industry will further bridge the gap between the old and new worlds.  “A lot of my customers on the institutional side, they’re moving forward, forging ahead with their crypto adoption,” she said. “To me, that’s an indication that the money is going in that direction.”  Because crypto grew so much during the social-distancing days of the pandemic, the two sides are only just beginning to hang out together. But who’s to say there will never be a decentralized finance (DeFi) mogul – wearing something that’s decidedly not an old-school suit – one day ringing the NYSE bell and hanging out in Wall Street bars?  Anton Katz, CEO of Talos and former head of trading technology at quantitative investment firm AQR, told CoinDesk that there’s a growing sentiment that digital assets are here to stay and the future foundation of finance is being built.  “It seems like there is growing consensus around that idea, which is why I think you’re seeing so many events like Wall Street Rides FAR where the lines between crypto and TradFi are eroding so significantly,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/12/a-crypto-bro-walked-into-a-wall-street-bar-and-it-went-just-fine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04e8d79c67dec0a3a2ae46d0ac33eb4ebf62ed26-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Merge will result in a change from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model. Merge Of The Year Is About To Occur The software upgrade, called Merge is expected to occur in September. It will transform the Ethereum blockchain by shifting from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model. As a result, it will lead to improved network efficiency and faster transaction speeds and curb negative environmental impacts. According to a Consensus Layer Call, the stakeholders are working on the Merge and dropped hints that the upgrade is about to happen very soon. The possible dates could be September 15 and 16. Although, the timing is still not finalized. The dress rehearsal of Ethereum went smoothly on Goerli Testnet. The software upgrade has been in development for a long time and is said to revolutionize the way Ethereum transactions operate. Transactions will definitely become more energy efficient. After years of working and delays, the Merge had a smooth sail in the Goerli merge test. However, developers on the call reported a few problems during the merge. Nevertheless, the final release of Merge is set to occur in the mid of September, according to the developers.The post The Most Awaited Ethereum Merge Schedu...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/the-most-awaited-ethereum-merge-scheduled-for-september/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-most-awaited-ethereum-merge-scheduled-for-september,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42374062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCqF,1660308156,Bitcoin $24K Breakout Elusive as Treasury Yields Balk at Peak Inflation Narrative,"Traders looking for an explanation for bitcoin's (BTC) latest failure to stay above $24,000 may want to look at what the bond market is saying.  The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to a three-week high of 2.90% early today, extending the recovery from the low of 2.67% hit after Wednesday’s inflation data. The two-year yield held steady at around 3.20%, having put in a low of 3.08% on Wednesday, per data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  The continued rise in yields is perhaps a sign that traders of risk assets, including bitcoin, might be wrong to conclude that inflation in the U.S. has peaked and the Federal Reserve will probably slow liquidity tightening in the coming months.  ""If Thursday's news meant it was time to celebrate victory over inflation, then the market response should have been straightforward,"" John Authers, Bloomberg's opinion columnist, said in an article published Friday. “Bond yields should fall, as the Fed would logically seem unlikely to keep rates either as high or as long as had been feared.""  However, yields have risen, which means fixed-income investors expect higher interest rates and are selling their bonds. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin is sensitive to the Federal Reserve policy and has taken a beating this year with the central bank embarking on its most aggressive tightening cycle in decades.  Thursday's price move for BTC above $24,000 was short-lived. In the past three weeks, bitcoin has failed seven times to notch a price above $24,000 as of 0:00 coordinated universal time – used by many traders and charting tools as the unofficial end of the trading day in crypto markets that are always open.  The latest failure comes on the heels of world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock (BLK), announcing a new private spot bitcoin trust for institutional investors. So it’s not like there’s no bullish news.  Bitcoin found buyers on Wednesday after data released in the U.S. showed consumer prices jumped 8.5% in July compared with a year earlier, down from a 9.1% year-over-year jump in June. The soft inflation figure offered hopes that price pressures may have peaked. The Producer Price Index released Thursday told a similar story, lifting bitcoin to a two-month high of $24,929.  Some observers foresee a continued rise in bond yields. ""Interestingly, we have seen a 'peak' inflation narrative, and despite a miss on CPI and PPI, we are now seeing rates rise,” Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in a market update published Thursday.  ""Could this indicate that rates have stopped decreasing and will be heading higher from here? I believe so because if weaker than expected inflation data can't send rates down, they have one way to go, which is up,"" Kramer added.  Analysts told CoinDesk on Thursday that bitcoin's post-inflation rally could be a bull trap. The market may see plenty of volatility ahead, as the Fed is scheduled to accelerate its balance sheet shrinkage from September.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/12/bitcoin-24k-breakout-elusive-as-treasury-yields-balk-at-peak-inflation-narrative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9aeb1ff64d54efec2c0c18cd9048294686329ff1-1669x1252.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an email, abrdn declined to disclose the size of the stake or say how much it paid.  Asset managers in traditional finance are increasingly looking for ways to tap into the digital-asset industry. Friday's announcement comes after BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, unveiled a spot bitcoin private trust for U.S. institutional investors. Last week, BlackRock announced a partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) to offer digital assets to institutional investors.  Archax aims to provide access to blockchain-based digital assets for institutional investors, acting as a bridge to traditional finance. It received registration from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in August 2020, becoming the first exchange to offer digitized securities – which are tokenized versions of real-world assets – to do so.  “Archax is one of the most promising U.K. players in this next expected high-growth area in finance – the use of digital and tokenized securities with same-day settlement. In that sense, the growth of the digital investment market is about much more than cryptocurrencies,"" abrdn CEO Stephen Bird said in the statement.  Abrdn, which manages 464 billion British pounds ($564 billion) in assets, said it expects investors to use Archax as a means to invest in digital securities and for Archax to be able ""tokenize"" traditional assets.

42374056,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXCev,1660292828,Crypto Derivative Trading Volume Rose for First Time in 4 Months as Market Rallied in July,"The value of crypto derivative contracts traded rose 13.4% last month from June, the first uptick since March, CryptoCompare said.  The London-based data aggregator and index provider said $3.17 trillion worth of the contracts changed hands in July, while turnover in the spot market fell 1.34% to $1.39 trillion, the lowest level since December 2020. Spot trading volume on the Coinbase (COIN) crypto exchange, a venue preferred by institutional investors, declined 12.8% to $51.5 billion.  Unlike spot trading, trading derivatives offer leverage. While that allows investors to control a sizable contract value with a relatively small amount of money and increase their potential profits, it also increases their risk. Market observers consider derivatives market activity as a proxy for traders, or speculative interest, while the spot market is seen as representing long-term investors.  ""The rise in derivatives trading volume indicates an increase in speculative activity as traders believe there is room for further upside in this rally, with no Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for next month,"" CryptoCompare said in its monthly report. The rate-setting FOMC will meet in September, but not in August.  ""The increase in derivatives trading volume was also amplified this month as traders speculated on the impact of the Ethereum Merge and potential hard forks on Ethereum,"" the report said of July.  The use of leverage, not spot market trading, fueled a crypto market rally in July that restored $240 billion in market capitalization. While leverage boosts returns, it exposes traders to forced liquidations by exchanges if the traders can't meet margin shortages. Therefore, derivatives-led rallies like July's often inject volatility into the market. That said, overall leverage still remains low compared with early 2021.  Another key takeaway from the report is that there was no shortage of people chasing stablecoins despite the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin in May and the ensuing volatility in other cryptocurrencies with values pegged to the dollar or other fiat currencies.  CryptoCompare's report shows the volume for bitcoin-to-stablecoin tether (USDT) spot trading increased 31.5% to 8.78 million BTC in July. Bitcoin spot trading into binanceUSD (BUSD) surged 80.2% to 2.13 million BTC, surpassing bitcoin-to-U.S. dollar turnover for the first time on record.  ""Investors continue to prefer safety under macroeconomic conditions,"" CryptoCompare noted about the pickup in bitcoin-to-stablecoin volume.  The crypto market valuation on Thursday rose to a two-month high of $1.17 trillion, extending July's recovery.

Li is looking to sell almost 60% of the firm, and has held preliminary talks with Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain network, and FTX, the crypto exchange founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  In a tweet, Sun denied any involvement.  Seychelles-based Huobi is one of the world's largest crypto exchanges with a daily trading volume of over $1 billion, according to CoinGecko.  The deal would be one of the biggest ever in the crypto industry. The downturn in the crypto market has forced many of the biggest firms in the industry to cut costs and jobs, but this could be the first instance that one of those firms sells a majority stake.  Huobi's existing investors, which includes ZhenFund and Sequoia China, were informed about Li’s decision during a shareholder meeting last month, the report added.  A deal could be completed as soon as the end of this month, the report noted. Li is seeking an overall valuation of $2 billion to $3 billion, which means that the stake sale could fetch upward of $1 billion, the report said.  FTX has made a slew of offers to acquire crypto companies during the recent market downturn, snapping up Japanese exchange Liquid in April before agreeing to acquire Canadian trading platform Bitvo two months later. It also has a deal in place to purchase lending platform BlockFi for up to $240 million.  FTX has also been eyeing up purchases of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, both of which filed for bankruptcy in July.

1207267,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=498471,1660281267,Future of Content: How Web 3.0 Revolutionizes Approach to the Creator Economy,"More than 50 million people worldwide consider themselves to be creators of some kind of content. The content creator economy is a fast-evolving market niche that is experiencing exponential growth. Its current size is estimated to be a little over $100 billion, showing an 8-fold increase year-on-year. This new economic sector requires new approaches and instruments, as large corporate platforms exercise great power over the creators&apos; content, and personal websites and blogs have limited reach. The problem with Web 2.0 In the current state of the Internet, known as Web 2.0, content is stored on a particular server or computer and accessed via a web address known as a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. This means that the owner of the computer or the server where content is stored has complete control over whether and how it can be accessed and can limit access or even delete content at any time. At present, if the creators of video content, photographs, or blogs want to get their material out into the world, they have little choice but to post it on major social network platforms like Alphabet&apos;s YouTube, Meta&apos;s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, Tumblr, Snapchat, and the like. While this provides access to huge audiences, this benefit comes with major drawbacks.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Ether's Fine Day  By James Rubin  Bitcoin climbed most of Thursday. Ether climbed faster.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued a two-month surge to crack $1,900 for the first time since late May. Ether was recently trading at about $1,850, about flat over the previous 24 hours as investors continued an early celebration of the Merge, which will shift the Ethereum protocol from a proof-of-work to less energy-sapping, more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake protocol. The token price has jumped more than 85% since dipping below $1,000 in mid-June.  On Wednesday, developers completed the third and final test environment network (testnet) merge. The mainnet Merge is expected to occur sometime at the end of September.  ""I'm bullish on Ethereum,"" Dan Weiskopf, portfolio manager for Amplify ETFs, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Bitcoin  Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was recently trading at roughly $23,800, down slightly from the previous day but still near the upper end of the roughly $19,000 to $24,000 range its occupied since June. Crypto investors have responded favorably to the latest economic indicators suggesting that the worst of inflation is behind us and the global economy may not plummet into a steep recession.  ""People are excited about taking on risk again because it seems as if inflation is under control,"" Weiskopf said. ""We'll see if that actually proves out. That bitcoin bottomed and now we're at $24,000, a lot of people are excited about that.""  Equities  Crypto prices veered from major stock indexes, which were flat a day after gaining enough ground for the tech-heavy Nasdaq to re-enter bullish territory. The Nasdaq, which is still down 18% for the year, fell 0.6%, while the S&P 500, declined 0.1% as investors seemed to discount the latest evidence of waning inflation, a drop in the Producer Price Index (PPI). The 0.5% drop was the first negative turn since April 2020.  Crypto news  The crypto industry's latest indignities included a report that India regulators were investigating at least 10 crypto exchanges for allegedly assisting foreign firms launder money via crypto. Separately, Canadian bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) posted a C$88.1 million (US$69 million) loss for the second quarter, compared with a loss of C$4 million in the same quarter a year ago and withdrew its revenue estimate for next year that it had made in its first-quarter earnings report, saying it was reorganizing parts of its business.  And Coinbase, which has suffered its share of knocks this week including a disappointing second quarter earnings report, saw credit ratings agency S&P Global drop the crypto exchange giant's long-term issuer credit rating and senior unsecured debt ratings to BB from BB+ and call the company's outlook ""negative.""  S&P Global cited ""weak earnings and competitive pressure"" in its note.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Ethereum ETH +0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −6.0% Entertainment Polkadot DOT −5.3% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA −5.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  SOL's Price Rebound  By Sam Reynolds  Dylan and Ian Macalinao built an elaborate network of, in their own words, “protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times” on top of a Solana stablecoin exchange called Saber. They used 11 aliases in their scheme.  At its peak, their double-counting protocols amounted to $7.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) at a time when the TVL of Solana was $10.5 billion. One has to wonder how much of the ""Solana Summer"" – last year’s meteoric rise of the protocol – was actually authentic or artificial.  But the market doesn’t seem to care.  Ever since CoinDesk reported that a good proportion of Solana’s TVL was effectively a blockchain version of a Russian nesting doll, Solana’s token is up. SOL is up 15% over the last week and was most recently trading at about $43.  All this comes as the Solana TVL – the actual TVL – has decreased significantly. As a result of CoinDesk’s reporting, decentralized finance (DeFi) data service DeFiLlama switched off its default display of protocols’ double-counted crypto assets.  DeFiLlama “will spend the next few days reviewing all protocols again to check again against double counting,” its founder told CoinDesk.  Right now, Solana’s TVL is $1.94 billion while its double-counted TVL is $2.48 billion. As the year began, on Jan. 1, its double-counted TVL was $11.2 billion while its actual TVL was $8.1 billion.
