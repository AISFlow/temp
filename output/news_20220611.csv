42394053,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buckEl,1654990669,Who You Really Are: A Conversation About Pseudonymity With Default Friend at Consensus,"AUSTIN, Texas — Katherine Dee, also known as Default Friend, isn’t even her “day job name.” That begins with Katya, she said in an interview with CoinDesk at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  Dee is something of an internet anthropologist, someone who dives deep into the subcultures that form on social media, message boards and in private digital channels. She’s studied the “new right,” ex-Mormons, accelerationists, the “proana” (pro-anorexia) community, incels and then some. The deepest corners of the web deserve to be understood and documented, she said.  “Internet culture is just culture at this point,” she said.  Lately, she’s turned her attention to the crypto scene. Like the financial side of the digital asset industry – which is both a subset of the larger economy and an attempt to rebel against a monetary system backed by fiat – crypto culture is its own thing and also part of something larger.  There’s energy here – clearly on display in the halls of the Austin Convention Center, where mustachioed men with mohawks mingle with women in power suits. Another dimension of the crypto industry primarily exists online: the bevy of builders, investors and influencers who pick their own names.  See also: Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms  Crypto has a unique relationship with pseudonymity, it’s not only tolerated but celebrated. Because so much of blockchain is about changing our notion of trust, people who are able to build reputations from the ground up show how meritocracy is supposed to function.  Crypto is open for all to use – even if you’re a “wassie.”  CoinDesk caught up with Default Friend to discuss the history of “alts,” why true anonymity is so hard and why so many people claim to have dissociative identity disorder on TikTok.  How did you get interested in pseudonymity as a research topic?  Actually, the topic was suggested to me, but it's something of a recurring theme in internet history. So it sort of flowed nicely with stuff I was already doing.  Do you consider yourself to be like an internet historian?  Historian … well. I don't even really know what I am. My beat, if there is one, is internet history and internet culture. I sort of “memed” myself into becoming a journalist. I published a lot.  Why do you think web culture is a beat worth covering?  It's the water that we swim in. For the longest time, things have happened on the internet outside of academia – if it was covered in the media, it would be a trend piece but wasn't taken very seriously. Sometimes subcultures were labeled as dangerous, or whatever, if it was politically expedient. But it influences our whole lives. Internet culture is just culture at this point. There's no real differentiation – its culture spins out online into the physical world.  Do you think there's a danger of falling into the communities that you’re interested in – that you cover and analyze?  I mean, some of them I don't think I would fall into, and other ones would keep me out even if I did. I don't think they'd want me to be part of the club.  See also: Consensus Conversations 2022: Day One at ACC  It’s like the famous Groucho Marx quote –  I wouldn’t want to be part of any club that would have me. The funny thing is – I remember someone once said to me, “nobody knows who she is. She’s so overnight.” It's like, you may not know who I am because I was under an anonymous [identity] for the past 10 years. I wasn’t advertising I was a woman, I definitely wasn't going by my legal name, I wasn't going by my “Default” brand – so Katherine Dee and Default did come overnight. I just changed my handle.  You’ve argued that true anonymity is impossible online. Why is that?  It's really difficult to remain truly anonymous for a lot of reasons. The technical hoops you have to jump through make it hard, but also like you release so much personal information by just the things you say. There's so many clues you give away as to who you might be. For a person who isn't super paranoid, doesn’t have pristine OpSec (operational security) doesn't realize what counts as identifying information.  For example, someone's “y'all” – if it flows naturally and seems actually part of their vocabulary – that says something about that person. Terminology, technical information – those can be revealing details.  In terms of data leakage, have you ever looked into who [Bitcoin creator] Satoshi Nakamoto might be?  I'm not super into it. So no.  CoinDesk respects alts in our articles and won’t publish someone’s real name without significant justification. At what point does a pseudonym become a public person, and the needs of society are greater than the desires of pseudonymous people?  It really depends. I think it can be acceptable in certain situations. For example, if you live in a small town and you know for a fact someone is distributing child porn – the FBI isn't going to do anything about it – and you know that this person has contact with children in your community. In a case like that, where there’s clearly a danger, and law enforcement isn't helping.  I also understand that a lot of people have doubts about law enforcement. What underpins a lot of doxing is a desire for vigilante justice, but there's so many competing values. It's really telling that we think of doxing often in terms of public shaming and not really about protecting people.  I learned recently that the United States has really robust laws protecting pseudonyms. And the burden of proof for saying someone is a danger and that there’s a legitimate demand to reveal their identity is really high. I think that's why doxing happens because your only choice really is this, like, mob justice.  See also: Ukraine to Use NFTs to Save Its Cultural ‘DNA’ Amid Russian Invasion  There's always pros and cons. The cons are that there are instances where someone might have dangerous or unsavory political beliefs, but it's just something they do in the privacy of their own home. I won't want to be friends with that person, but I don't know if it's my business to ruin their life because I find their values suspect.  That's an interesting framing – ruining someone's life. As someone who writes under a few different alts, are these characters an extension of yourself?  For me, it's more like compartmentalizing different parts of my identity. It's been a long time since I've experimented with my identity online. You know, when someone Googles my “day job name,” ideally, I want only generic tech stuff to come up. My day job name has been released so many times because people are sort of angry that I don’t write anything controversial. There’s Katherine Dee the, like, journalist, and then Default Friend. The two have become sort of blended recently.  There's so many reasons why people use alt names, if they don’t want to associate ideas with their everyday, tax-paying identity. And it can be pretty mundane. Lewis Carroll was a mathematician or something, and he also wrote “Alice in Wonderland.” He used a pseudonym partially because he wanted his literary work not to be mixed in with his academic work.  Do you think the internet complicates identity?  What’s most surprising to me is that the idea of a fixed identity is actually fairly new – it's from the digital. You’d think the opposite. But there's a lot of pressure now to like jumble your whole identity into one identifiable character. We think the internet allows us to have many different identities – like on social media – but it really, really doesn't.  What do you think of the trend on TikTok of people claiming that they have dissociative identity disorder?  That's a weird one. It might be a product of wanting to have multiple lives, wanting to experiment with multiple identities and struggling to integrate it. So you think that there's many different people inhabiting you.  Do you think it's possible to ever know who you are?  I don't really know what that means. I think you can know certain things about yourself.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/11/who-you-really-are-a-conversation-about-pseudonymity-with-default-friend-at-consensus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f11cdcd29136b98311530ea61991d4bad074ab9f-5504x4128.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393967,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwauH,1654987216,Wanna Bet? Crypto Prediction Markets Could Be a New ‘Source of Truth’,"AUSTIN, Texas — Will Monkeypox lead to the next major global pandemic? Will Russia and NATO engage in direct conflict before 2023? Will inflation rise above 8.6% this year? These are some of the questions a prediction market has a reasonable idea of answering.  Though future events are always unknown, you can make reasonable bets about what may happen based on research, data and an understanding of trends. Crypto-based prediction markets make this “bet” explicit, by offering an opportunity for anyone to stake money on what they think will happen.  Andrew Eaddy and Clay Graubard, founders of Baserate.io, discussed just this on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, on Saturday. Their platform, called Baserate.io, is a media and information company leveraging forecasting technologies and prediction markets.  See also: How Crypto Transforms Prediction Markets | Opinion  For example, one user raised the question whether NATO will expand in 2022. Right now, the open market is voting no – shares predicting NATO’s expansion are currently trading hands at 53 cents.  Though if these people are wrong, and NATO does expand, those that bought a “yes” vote (currently worth 47 cents) would have a greater economic return when the market closes and winners win the pot while losers lose their money.  ""These are generally winner-take-all markets, and your probability of ‘crowd consensus’ is what people are willing to buy shares,"" Graubard said. He added that you can think about cents as a rough approximation of probability. ""They’re saying there's a 53% chance that NATO does not expand.""  Although the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may think otherwise – often shutting down prediction markets for violating regulations of binary markets – Eaddy and Graubard think these tools could do good for the world. If allowed to operate openly and publicly, they could help people make the right decisions.  ""Blockchain technology will allow forecasts to be transparent, secure, immutable and more easily tracked,” Eaddy said.  “Some of the other accouterment with blockchain, like DeFi technology, yield farming and liquidity provision, will also help to get more users on the platforms and also help the platforms generate this sufficient liquidity and volume actually to produce good, high-quality information,"" he added.  At the end of the day, prediction markets are about accountability. Markets can reduce bias and opinions, they say, by allowing people to put “skin in the game.” You will only bet on the outcome you think will happen, not that you want to happen.  See also: Why Crypto Whales Love This Prediction Market  ""Being accurate is more important than saying the right thing for a particular audience,"" Graubard said.  This has big implications for our messy, uncertain world, where trust in institutions is waning, Graubard said. It allows for new forms of trust to arise, primarily from the community on up. And, although prediction markets may or may not be just another form of crypto speculation, learning about the world is worthwhile.  ""What's a better way than the process of finding out good information? I think having fun and also in the case of prediction markets, making money and forecasting.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/11/wanna-bet-crypto-prediction-markets-could-be-a-new-source-of-truth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f09f6f404c507d82bbe13e1d9629632296790a74-4265x3199.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415257,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhEz,1654980614,JPMorgan Wants to Bring Trillions of Dollars of Tokenized Assets to DeFi,"AUSTIN, Texas — JPMorgan (JPM) hopes it has found a way for decentralized finance (DeFi) developers to leverage the yield-generating potential of non-crypto assets.  Speaking to CoinDesk at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan, described in detail the bank’s institutional-grade DeFi plans and highlighted how much value in tokenized assets is waiting in the wings.  “Over time, we think tokenizing U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares, for example, means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools,” Lobban said. “The overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi, so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading, borrowing [and] lending, but with the scale of institutional assets.”  Institutional DeFi generally means imposing know-your-customer (KYC) strictures on crypto’s permissionless lending pools, which has started to happen in pockets of innovation such as Aave Arc, as well as in a recently announced project involving Siam Commercial Bank and Compound Treasury.  JPMorgan’s plans incorporating the tokenization of traditional assets point to a much larger scale. Onyx Digital Assets sees two complementary parts to bringing bank-grade DeFi to fruition, Lobban explained.  One component is JPMorgan’s blockchain-based collateral settlement system that was extended last month to include tokenized versions of BlackRock’s money market fund shares, a kind of mutual fund invested in cash and highly liquid short-term debt instruments. That kind of application on the Onyx Digital Assets blockchain, which is settled in the bank’s in-house digital token JPM Coin, has had $350 billion in trading volume, Lobban pointed out.  The second piece of the puzzle is a recent pilot that is being led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and includes JPMorgan, DBS Bank and Marketnode and is dubbed “Project Guardian.” It tests institutional-friendly DeFi using permissioned liquidity pools that are made up of tokenized bonds and deposits.  These ventures into DeFi will involve public blockchains and have a permissioned structure similar in many ways to what is being done by the likes of Aave Arc and Fireblocks. One difference, Lobban noted, is that verifying customer information in Project Guardian is being done by large financial institutions that are participating, as opposed to DeFi platforms and crypto-native custody firms. In other words, a JPMorgan trader has to prove he has the rights and entitlements to trade on behalf of the Wall Street bank.  Verifiable credentials  Another difference is the novel approach to permissioned DeFi done using digital identity building blocks, such as W3C verifiable credentials.  “We want to use verifiable credentials as a way of identifying and proving identity, which is different from the current Aave model, for instance,” Lobban said. “Verifiable credentials are interesting because they can introduce the scale that you need to provide access to these pools without necessarily having to maintain a white list of addresses. Since verifiable credentials are not held on-chain, you don’t have the same overhead involved with writing this kind of information to blockchain, paying for gas fees, etc.”  JPMorgan hasn't decided what DeFi platforms and counterparties it will work with, Lobban said, but it will be among the recognized offerings. “It’ll be from the bench of protocols that you’d expect, battle-tested with high TVLs (total value locked). But we haven't yet worked out which ones yet.”  Lobban explained that for the past two and a half years, JPMorgan has quietly been exploring digital identity in the context of blockchain and digital assets.  “If we can put this identity layer in front of DeFi that enables KYC-based access, then each of those protocols should just naturally be able to support institutions without necessarily having to make too many changes to what they’re doing,” Lobban said. “Do we have to set up separate permissioned pools and make changes to the existing protocols? Or can these things work out of the box?”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/11/jpmorgan-wants-to-bring-trillions-of-dollars-of-tokenized-assets-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6822509245ec28ff7f840b8c1b239d94a7b4273-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415262,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhI8,1654978882,Ukraine to Use NFTs to Save Its Cultural ‘DNA’ Amid Russian Invasion,"AUSTIN, Texas — Amid the clear and present danger of Russia's military destroying Ukraine's architectural marvels, museums and other cultural sites, Ukraine plans to digitize ""every single piece of art or history"" it can, announced Michael Chobanian, President of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine, at Consensus 2022 on Saturday.  ""Today we are announcing a new project [aimed at] how we can save the DNA of the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian history,"" Chobanian said. ""Right now, they are bombing museums, churches, and cultural sites. So before they are destroyed...we're going to digitize every single piece of art or history that we have in museums. We're going to NFT it and put it on the blockchain,"" Chobanian said.  Ukraine has already leveraged crypto and blockchain to finance its defense against Russia's invasion, raising over $135 million in crypto from donors around the world by mid-May, analytics firm Crystal Blockchain told CoinDesk.  Chobanian made the NFT plan announcement alongside Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine's deputy minister in the Ministry of Digital Transformation and the de facto crypto spokesperson for the government, on a panel entitled ""Crypto at War: Behind Ukraine's Historic Crypto Fundraiser.""  However, the project is not a government initiative, but rather an effort by Ukraine's blockchain community.  NEAR Protocol's co-founder, Illia Polosukhin, who was also on stage, revealed later that NEAR will be the first blockchain partner of the project.  ""It is extremely important to bring all the Ukrainian heritage on-chain and offer it to the world and preserve it forever,"" Polosukhin said.  Ukraine's historic NFT-ization of its artifacts will also reveal ""what is being held"" where, in order to prevent corrupt government officials from stealing items during unpredictable times like these, Chobanian added.  Digitizing and placing an artifact as an NFT on a blockchain will be proof that an artifact existed. The project will aim to provide a digital window into Ukraine's cultural DNA because anyone from anywhere will be able to view the items as NFTs all in one place.

Even so, the NXS token is under pressure if it trades below May 11 highs. Past Performance of Nexus From the NXS technical analysis, the primary trend remains southwards despite recent gains. Nexus token prices are up three percent versus the USDT and BTC at spot rates. However, the NXS token is up a massive 13 percent against ETH. The immediate resistance lies at $0.16, while support is at $0.13. Nexus Technical Analysis The Nexus token is trading within a $0.03 trade range, reading from the formation in the daily chart. Even though there are hints of gains, the general trend is bearish. Bulls have failed to confirm gains of early this week as prices trend within the wide-ranging bear bars of May 11 and 12. Technically, this places the NXS crypto under bears. Accordingly, sellers may unload on every attempt to retest $0.18. A high volume drive above the $0.16 level and later May 11 highs would mark a turnaround for NXS coin prices. At present, losses below $0.13 and last week&apos;s lows may see further losses toward $0.10 in a bear trend continuation pattern. What to Expect from NXS coin? NXS token prices are consolidating below $0.18 and $0.16. If sellers force the Nexus crypto price below last week&apos;s lows, it could tank to May 2022 lows.The post Nexus Technical Analysis: NXS Sellers Are in Charge Below $0.16 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/nexus-technical-analysis-nxs-sellers-are-in-charge-below-0-16/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nexus-technical-analysis-nxs-sellers-are-in-charge-below-0-16,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42415266,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhLH,1654970779,"Edward Snowden Says Use Crypto, Don't Invest in It","AUSTIN, Texas –— Edward Snowden, a famous whistleblower and president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, sees more value in cryptocurrencies in their use than as an investment.  ""I use bitcoin to use it. In 2013, bitcoin is what I used to pay for the servers pseudonymously,"" Snowden said Saturday in a virtual appearance at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas. He gained fame in 2013 when he leaked classified information on the National Security Agency's surveillance of U.S. citizens.  ""Generally, I don't encourage people to put their money in cryptocurrencies as a technology, and this is what distances me from a lot of people in the community,"" he added.  Snowden also defended the crypto industry in the face of criticism earlier this month by a group of tech experts who knocked cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in a letter to U.S. lawmakers to counter the industry's lobbying efforts.  Snowden said he believes the signatories were deliberately misunderstanding the crypto industry, recycling a number of the same legacy arguments that have been made repeatedly in the past.  ""The letter is an argument for the status quo,"" Snowden said. ""There are so many ways to address all of their concerns. All the people who have signed this latter could understand this industry. They certainly should.""  Snowden did express admiration for cryptographer Bruce Schneier, who was one of the lead signatories of the letter, for his work on cryptography. But Snowden described many of the people who signed the letter as ""prolific public trolls.""  Privacy progress  Addressing the current state of privacy on the internet, Snowden said he believes great progress has been made on encrypting the content of communications, but is still concerned about metadata – the records that show communications took place.  ""Think of it like a van with dark windows driving down the highway,"" Snowden said. ""You can't see who the passengers are, but you can still see where the van left from, where it ended up, how long it took – that type of thing,"" he said.  ""We need to make sure no one can observe that level,"" Snowden argued. ""We need to make more transactions similar, so everyone is driving the same kind of vans and gets lost in the crowd.""  Snowden was charged by the U.S. with espionage and given asylum in Russia following his leak in 2013. He was granted permanent residency rights there in 2020.  Asked about his thoughts on the war in Ukraine, Snowden was forthright in saying he wished it hadn't started and hopes that it will end as soon as possible.  ""I haven't talked about the Ukraine crisis in depth is because I know my comments are not going to be covered appropriately. They're not going to cover the context,"" he said.  He added that he is writing about the war and will publish his work eventually.

According to the sources, France, which now holds the European Union presidency, and the European Parliament are optimistic about addressing the remaining difficulties holding up the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) package and reaching an agreement this month. On June 14 and June 30, negotiators are expected to meet. NFTs, Stablecoins, and Large Crypto-Asset Service Providers MiCA was first used in 2020, and a unified accord will usher in a new age of European Union legislation. The recent events surrounding the collapse of UST, on the other hand, have heightened the need to protect investors and examine the influence of cryptocurrency on the region&apos;s financial stability. As a result, the European Parliament&apos;s member states hope to reach an agreement on the following controversial matters shortly.

But after the first bombs hit Ukrainian cities, enthusiasm to help the country skyrocketed, said the co-founder of the Palianytsia charity fund, Anton Kosheliev.  Kosheliev is also running a couple of brick-and-mortar businesses in Ukraine, a logistics firm called Joule and a coffee roasting company, Marco. With a community of like-minded Ukrainian entrepreneurs, many of whom are a part of the local crypto community, he co-founded a humanitarian aid effort, which has raised over $2 million.  “We also accepted donations from bank cards, but successful transfers made only about 70% of all,” Kosheliev said. Many people tried donating from abroad; for many countries Ukraine, as well as the whole Eastern Europe region, is a risky area. So the local banks looked at transfers to Ukraine with particular scrutiny, he said, adding, “A significant amount of money failed to reach us.”  Europeans “saw the news and rushed to post offices” to send over packages of help to Ukraine, Kosheliev said. “Everyone wanted to do something so that it all ends.”  Some days up to 30 trucks full of humanitarian supplies would arrive during the day, he said, and all of it needed to be sorted and sent to those who needed them. Palianytsia decided to work only with big aid recipients such as city administrations and hospitals.  “There was a lot of clothing, which needed to be sorted. We hired a bunch of volunteers. Many people were ready to deliver the aid in their cars, even to dangerous places,” he added.  Kosheliev and his fellow entrepreneurs rented a big warehouse and started building a refugee shelter in Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine where the bombs weren’t expected to land as often as in the Eastern part of the country bordering Russia.  “We agreed at the start that we’re a humanitarian organization, not a militant one,” Kosheliev said. “We understood that Lviv is an important hub between Ukraine and Europe, and we need to get the infrastructure ready here to help supply the whole Ukraine.”  The government crypto stash  “More than a half of all merchants agree to accept crypto,” said Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. The Ministry of Digital Transformation initiated a fund called Aid for Ukraine, which is raising funds for non-lethal aid for the armed forces.  Bornyakov said that the ministry itself neither accepts donations to its wallets nor spends them; rather, it helps volunteers to fund their purchases. In some cases, volunteers already know what and from whom they are buying but need additional funding to pay the bill, he told CoinDesk. And the crypto treasury is held by the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna.  Since the beginning of the war Aid for Ukraine has raised over $60 million in crypto, according to the official website. This consists of over 477 BTC ($14.3 million), 9,587 ETH ($17.1 million), $9.9 million in stablecoins running on Ethereum (USDT, USDC, DAI) and more in other cryptocurrencies.  Most of the donations were large ones from big donors, most of them Ukrainians and entrepreneurs doing business with Ukraine from around the world, Bornyakov said.  It’s impossible to buy weapons with crypto, Bornyakov said, because such deals run on special, stricter terms. However, Aid for Ukraine has successfully bought drones, bulletproof vests and medical supplies. “No one minded receiving crypto as payment. It’s quite normal in the U.S. and Europe now,” Bornyakov said.  Some merchants told the fund they were going to open a Coinbase account and then receive payments to it. Some gave their personal wallet addresses, Bornyakov said, and then decided what to do with the crypto received. Donations in fiat have been much larger, he said, with about 40% coming in crypto.  According to Michael Chobanian, founder of Kuna and Aid for Ukraine’s main treasurer, over half of all crypto donations have been spent in crypto. U.S. merchants sold about 500,000 food kits for crypto. Protective vests, thermal goggles, gunsights and surveillance drones were paid for with crypto.  In some cases, merchants already had crypto wallets or exchange accounts; if not, Kuna helped them go through fast-track verification with the FTX crypto exchange, another partner of Aid for Ukraine. But some “especially stubborn” merchants only agreed to accept fiat, and for them the fund converted crypto to fiat via FTX and then sent it to the seller, Chobanian said.  Wartime DAO  For smaller charity funds with no direct coordination with the government, using crypto as a payment method proved trickier, said Oleg Kurchenko, founder of the Binaryx.com exchange and co-founder of the Unchain.Fund. According to its official website, the fund raised over $9,5 million in bitcoin, ether, various stablecoins and other tokens, such as SOL, NEAR and AVAX.  Unchain works like a distributed autonomous organization (DAO): Donations come to multisignature wallets on 14 blockchains. To spend them, four out of 10 publicly known signers must confirm the transaction. Being a DAO for the real world, especially at war, is a challenging task, Kurchenko said, because there are no oracles that can fully control the distribution of funds among those in need, and decentralized decision-making can take a long time.  Read more: 'Absolutely Surreal': Inside a Fund Raising Millions in Crypto for Besieged Ukraine  Unchain helps volunteers working on the ground in Ukraine buy food, medicine, electric generators, bulletproof vests and other survival supplies. In most cases, merchants would only accept fiat, so Unchain would cash out its coins via one of the Ukrainian exchanges: Kuna, WhiteBit or Wield.money.  “There were merchants who agreed to accept crypto, but that was rare; often, companies wouldn’t do it because of the regulations” in their countries, Kurchenko said, adding: “If you’re working with a European merchant, how would you explain to them they should report their taxes in crypto?”  Unchain also launched its own debit card for mothers in partnership with Ukraine’s Unex bank. A mom with one child can receive 50 euros a week and with two children, 75 euros. This means each family member would receive about 100 euros a month to support basic needs. According to Kurchenko, about 6,000 people are now using such cards. The grants are in fiat, he said.  Sometimes, non-Ukranians apply for the card to take advantage of the situation, but Unchain’s team can verify whether an applicant is Ukrainian or not, Kurchenko said. He refused to explain the verification process so that fraudsters don’t use this information.  Kurchenko admits that the verification process is running partly on trust: During a humanitarian crisis it’s hard to verify that every single applicant for help actually needs it.  Now, with the war over three months old, the flow of fresh funds is weakening.  “First two months the support was huge, but now it’s dying down. It’s becoming a kind of mundane situation and people don’t feel like donating much to support the initiative,” Kurchenko said. The fund is running out of money, and the bear market for crypto doesn’t help.  Crypto medicine  “When we needed an ambulance car we were searching all over Europe and we came across a British company that went bankrupt. It had 26 cars, and we bought them for $200,000,” Kosheliev said. The money came in crypto: An intermediary who helped the fund buy the cars accepted crypto to his own wallet. How he later transferred it to fiat money, Kosheliev doesn’t know, he said.  “It was just someone’s cold wallet, and they told us they found a way to cash the crypto out,” he added. The person who arranged the deal from the U.K. side did not want to comment, even anonymously, he said.  The ambulances, he said, ended up in the parking lot of the Healthcare Ministry of Ukraine, after some checks and tuning in local auto repair shops.  Some merchants were open to receiving crypto for medical supplies, including first aid kits and tourniquets (blood-stopping devices) that the Palianytsia fund has been purchasing at scale, Kosheliev said. “Sometimes, people just sympathized with us and were motivated to help us,” he said, so people agreed to receive crypto. These were more special cases than a regular occurrence, he said.  “We actually thought there would be more merchants ready to accept crypto,” he said, adding that in his ordinary business, he dealt with Turkish counterparties a lot, importing food and clothing, and in Turkey, “every merchant knows what crypto is” and would likely agree to accept it. However, this wasn’t the case with the medical supplies, he said.  In Ukraine, when merchants routinely accept crypto, they cash out first and then write it down in their accounting ledgers as cash, Kosheliev said.  Abroad, it’s always peer-to-peer transfers when people on the other side accept crypto and then decide what to do with it.  Keeping it informal  Informal arrangements prevail when smaller, private funds are trying to spend crypto they raised.  Volunteers, who buy supplies to help the army and civilians, have to rely either on cash dollars and euros or crypto, because private bank transfers of large amounts of money across the border simply aren’t possible for ordinary citizens: The National Bank of Ukraine limited sending money out of Ukraine to prevent capital flight, said Matvii Sivoraksha, CEO of blockchain startup MadFish.Solutions. (The restrictions have been recently softened.)  Sivoraksha told CoinDesk he personally convinced a shop in the Netherlands selling surveillance drones to accept crypto just because doing so was faster and easier than fiat alternatives. Legally turning bitcoin into euros on a European Union (EU) bank account took so long that the drone seller had time to discuss accepting crypto with its legal counsel and decide in favor of it.  In Ukraine, “any volunteer or merchant would accept crypto now,” Sivoraksha added.  Palianytsia, which received $500,000 from leading crypto exchange Binance, is using Binance to cash out most of its funds: in most cases, the donations are being spent in fiat, Kosheliev said. To cash out crypto donations, Palianytsia’s operational director sells crypto on Binance through his own account, then puts it into the fund’s treasury as a donation, Kosheliev said.  Palianytsia is also working with Binance on a refugee crypto debit card, Kosheliev said: The fund is verifying aid beneficiaries, who would each receive three tranches of $75 in crypto. Since the project launched in late April, Palianytsia’s volunteers have verified and onboarded about 1,000 people, Binance told CoinDesk.  “The team has put in place an on-the-ground verification process to identify the most vulnerable populations including single mothers, those suffering with illnesses and ethnic minorities. We are grateful for their and our other partners' unrelenting efforts, which means we're able to reach more people, quicker,” a Binance spokesperson said in a written statement.  Kosheliev said he has met with refugees in Ukrainian shelters a few times and helped them set up the Binance mobile app. His colleagues shot a video on their phones: Kosheliev is sitting on a bench with a group of women crowding around him, listening and looking at his phone.  “My friends were joking that I’ve never been that popular with the ladies before,” he said with a giggle.  Ultimately, crypto offers a way for individuals to coordinate and help outside government control, while staying transparent, Kosheliev said: “We trust the community more than we trust the government. The community helps check and validate people.”  CORRECTION (June 11, 2022, 09:01 UTC): Corrects amount dollar amount in headline to $135 million.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/10/where-the-coins-go-inside-ukraines-125m-wartime-fundraise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1991ab3d26f33f260b40d01419b05711ab655164-3000x2001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The requirement, which will take effect in 2024, requires U.S. taxpayers who receive over $10,000 in cryptocurrency to report the Social Security numbers and other personal information of the sender. The provision was one of several included in last year's infrastructure bill, which also included a controversial crypto tax reporting requirement that applied to brokers. That provision galvanized a massive industry backlash, although the prevision was ultimately unsuccessful.  ""The reporting mandate would force Americans using cryptocurrency to share intrusive details about themselves, both with each other and with the federal government,"" the lawsuit said. ""Under the terms of the mandate, everyday senders and receivers of cryptocurrency would be forced to reveal their names, Social Security numbers, home addresses another personal identifying information.""  According to the suit, Coin Center is concerned that the rule would require Americans to store sender information for up to a year in case any given set of transactions could be deemed ""related,"" if the total ultimately reaches $10,000 or more.

This means that users can now conduct transactions on the network to ensure privacy. MimbleWimble is a decentralized protocol that prioritizes privacy and uses a novel method to organize and store blockchain transactions. An anonymous developer named Tom Elvis Jedusor created and released it in the middle of 2016. He was a French version of &apos;Voldemort.&apos; He used the MWEB, or MimbleWimble Extension Block, to add MimbleWimble to Litecoin so that users could engage in anonymous transactions.

As a result, they can use it for everyday transactions, such as paying staff salaries and purchasing real estate. MimbleWimble employs various cryptographic techniques to conceal the sender and recipient of a transaction. Previously, Litecoin developers had a projection that MWEB would be operational by February 2022. However, in March, a new version of the Litecoin Core 0.21.2 client with improvements to MWEB and the Taproot was released to the testnet. How Does MimbleWimble Work?
