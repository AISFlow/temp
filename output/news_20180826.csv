42401853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2eFt,1535296112,Who Needs a Bitcoin ETF? Crypto Scoffs at SEC Rejections,"Over the past two days, the narrative on bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has felt like a rollercoaster.  Up until Wednesday, all eyes were watching for a final decision on two futures-backed bitcoin ETF proposals set to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and created by ProShares.  However, the resulting decision not only shot down ProShares' twin proposals, but five others like it by Direxion and another two by GraniteShares, with the latter to be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe).  Then, as if matters had not been rousing enough, the SEC announced the following day a petition to review all nine disapproval decisions in accordance to Rule 431(e) of the Commission's official ""Rules of Practice,"" noting that until such a time the review is complete all such decisions would be stayed.  In truth, it isn't as if the SEC has never turned around to re-examine their rulings in a similar manner before. Just last month, the results of one such review over the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF was released, ultimately re-affirming the initial rejection.  Still, the fallout from this week's events on the matter of regulatory approval over a bitcoin ETF has left many in the crypto community jaded over what feels to be a continuing uphill battle.  In fact, some have taken to Twitter in accusing the agency, in part jokingly, of using their powers of regulatory disapproval then review to ""stress test"" the bitcoin markets.  To be fair, market manipulation was a key reason specified for the initial disapproval of all nine ETF proposals, though to the wider crypto community this decision was taken primarily as a barrage of attacks by the agency deliberately meant to hinder the growth of the industry.  Interestingly enough, the SEC did stop just short of handing down a rejection on all ten bitcoin ETF proposals said to be decided upon in the next two months. One remains in this respect put forth by VanEck and SolidX for a physical bitcoin ETF that commentators in the past have touted as being the strongest candidate of the batch.  As such, coupled with the reality that technically the other nine disapprovals are now pending under SEC review, certain commentators on Twitter see the culmination of this week's events as reason to believe there might just be a major reversal of fortune in coming weeks.      Who really cares?  Yet, important to note in the midst of the discussion, is a strain of bitterness expressed by some regarding all the hubbub and attention bitcoin ETFs have been sparking as of late. The reoccurring critique by such commentators being that bitcoin ETFs aren't all that interesting, let alone, necessary for the continued growth of crypto markets.  As such, to the ones that hold bitcoin as an asset otherly in nature from mainstream financial assets and not compatible in the guise of institutional investment vehicles such at ETFs, the rejections by the SEC have been touted as ""a blessing in disguise"" and a decision for review as nothing more than ""overrated"" news.

42421896,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwpCf,1535288459,Crypto Trading 101 - Calculating Moving Averages,"Maybe you're the type of trader that keeps metrics to make important life decisions?  If you fit the description, you may want to add moving averages to your arsenal to discover just how much they can improve your trading strategies.  Not sure where to begin? Moving averages are a useful tool for tracking the direction and strength of a trend by capturing specific price data points over a specified period of time (as defined by the timeframe you are looking at) to constantly update the average price as it moves along the chart.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Indeed, the position of the moving averages depends upon the nature of the asset you are looking at.  Generally, when prices are below a particular moving average, it signals to traders that the price has lost momentum and the trend has turned bearish (meaning price and sentiment are trending down).  Conversely, if prices are above a moving average it can generally be considered bullish, as long as prices remain on top and have the backing from other indicators such as the Stochastic Oscillator or Relative Strength Index to add to your layers of confirmation.  Simplifying your averages  A good introduction to moving averages and your journey to understanding the basic concepts begins with the simple moving average, which is calculated by taking the mean of a given set of values and plotting it on the chart.  For example, let's say you were looking at a simple 5-day moving average. You take the closing price of each day, add those values then divide by the number of days, in this case, 5.  It would look something like this:  5, 2, 3, 5 + 4 + 9 + 7 + 5 / 5 = 6 ← Ignoring previous datasets from past days and taking only the recent 5 sets, hence the term moving average.  The average result of 6, takes into account the previous 5 data points and provides a general idea of how an asset is priced relative to the last 5 days.  Take the bitcoin chart above, for example. The blue line mapped on the chart is the simple moving average representing 5 days or 5 sets of data points.  We can assume, at least in the short-term, that prices turned bullish as the blue line passed underneath the close on August 16 and remained so when prices broke another $100 higher.  We can also spot when prices began to turn bearish back in July as the line moved above the candlesticks' closing periods, signaling to traders a bull-to-bear trend change and a loss of momentum for any further upside action.  As prices dipped below the line, the bulls were unable to 'break' above it and a short-term downtrend ensued lasting 16 days until prices shifted back above, signaling once more, a change in the short-term trend.  The most common periods used amongst traders are the 50, 100 and 200 averages as these have proven and predictable results due to their ability to collect a larger portion of data points.  However, there is no perfect solution for your simple moving average setup, analysts usually devise their own strategies, often employing multiple moving averages in order to provide greater understanding and depth to their analysis.
