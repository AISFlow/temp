42378813,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmeN,1467323970,Abra Launches Blockchain Remittance App in US,"After months of small-scale testing in the Philippines, blockchain payments app Abra launched in the US market today.  The expansion comes after CoinDesk learned details of an aggressive expansion plan in place at the startup, which to date has garnered $14m in venture funding to expand to more than 20 markets by 2017. The firm raised $12m in a Series A funding round last fall.  CEO Bill Barhydt pointed to the US market as ""the hub"" from which the startup plans to connect to other markets worldwide, a factor that made it the next logical place for expansion.  Barhydt told CoinDesk:  ""It’s really the hub for us for going global. The initial focus for Abra is on cross-border, phone-to-phone transfers. The US is a key hub for that. We have worked diligently and make sure we’re ready to go, and we’re launching the bank in and out.""  Barhydt said the launch was made possible through a relationship with Synapse, a firm that enables users to connect bank accounts to the app.  Initial reports following the release of the app in the US suggest that some users have had trouble signing up by enrolling through Facebook – an issue that CoinDesk experienced when testing out the app.  Barhydt said that his team would look into the issue, noting that the app is the same as the one that the startup has been operating in The Philippines, its initial test market.  The announcement coincides with the release of a report by Citi Research issued today that named Abra as one of several startups with business models that should be watched closely by the financial industry.

42378807,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmZL,1467311217,"As Block Size Debate Flares, Bitcoin Scaling Solution Enters Next Phase","As attacks against the group intensify, the volunteer community that develops the code for bitcoin's open-source software has entered a new phase of testing for Segregated Witness, its proposed scaling solution.  The merge, which took place last weekend, comes nearly seven months after the proposal was by Pieter Wuille, co-founder of bitcoin startup Blockstream and a major contributor to the Bitcoin Core open-source development community, during the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong.  Since then, the upgrade, commonly known as SegWit, has seen broad testing by both the Core community as well as various companies operating in the bitcoin space. More recently, Core contributors met for a face-to-face meeting in Zürich for a hands-on review of the code.  To recap, SegWit has been proposed as a means of effectively increasing the capacity of bitcoin transaction blocks by changing how the space within them is used, rather than outright increasing the size of the data blocks on the blockchain. Further, the upgrade addresses issues like transaction malleability, or the ability for transaction IDs to be changed before they become confirmed by the network.  With the merging of the initial code for SegWit into the master branch of the bitcoin codebase, a new phase of testing can begin that developers say will provide more opportunities for stress-testing the upgrade and identifying any lingering bugs. Developers say it enables SegWit testing in conjunction with other features in bitcoin’s code.  A key caveat: SegWit still has a ways to go before it becomes a live part of the network.  For starters, the merged code doesn’t contain the necessary elements required to actually activate it. This, according to the Core team, will be written and added after more testing takes place.  Wuille told CoinDesk:  ""The near-term steps are backporting and more testing of real world usage on testnet. After that, defining the activation parameters and doing releases with SegWit active in it, and hope it gets adopted by miners and the community.""  The process of moving SegWit from the drawing board to the testing that hasn’t been without controversy.  Advocates for increasing the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network have said that SegWit is far too complex a way to scale the system, and some have gone as far as accusing the Core team of ignoring the interests of bitcoin users – a claim that contributors have pushed back on. It's resistance to the way in which Core functions that has given rise to alternative implementations like Bitcoin Classic.  Recent comments  from members of China’s mining community, as well as rumors that some miners might adopt a network hard fork of their own, further illustrate the tension that has defined the scaling debate.  Question of timing  A question no doubt at top of mind for some bitcoin community members and stakeholders is when, exactly, SegWit will become an active part of the network, though it's currently live on the bitcoin testnet.  In conjunction with the testing that continues to take place, developers will backport SegWit into Bitcoin Core 0.12, the version released this past February. In layman’s terms, this means taking new elements of the code and applying them to older versions.  Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan suggested that this process could take place as early as next month, though this decision is dependent on how the next phase of testing goes.  According to Wuille, ""depending on timing, activation may end up in [Core] 0.13.0 or 0.13.1"".  It’s also during this state that developers involved with the initiative hope to spot any bugs that exist in the code. Given bitcoin’s $10bn-plus market cap, there’s a built-in risk with any major change to how the system functions.  Wuille told CoinDesk that these risks are real but recognized by Core contributors and others who are testing SegWit.  ""Segwit is undeniably one of the larger changes to bitcoin's consensus rules and implementation, so there are inherent risks,"" he said. ""However, it's also the change which has the most attention, review and testing ever due to its impact. I'm confident that if bugs are left, they'll be minor and found during the testnet phase.""  Step toward future development  In some ways, SegWit is a kind of stepping stone toward other proposed changes to bitcoin’s code.  Van der Laan, who called last weekend’s merge ""a huge step forward"", indicated that the roll-out of SegWit gives developers the opportunity to add further functionality to bitcoin.  The release of SegWit would dovetail into other aspects of bitcoin development, including a proposal by contributor Matt Corallo to reduce network block propagation times.  ""It is especially needed as the witness discount results in a block size increase, which makes the question of propagation delay even more urgent,"" said Wuille.  Though the proposal is likely to still draw criticism from Core detractors, the merge signals that development is moving forward amid arguments that the team is resistant to change.

42378810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmfd,1467305699,"Citi: Bitcoin is an Opportunity for Banks, Not a Threat","A new research report by Citi Research asserts that bitcoin and other digital currencies should not be viewed as a disruptive threat to banks, credit card networks or traditional remittance providers, but rather as a potential complement to existing services.  Published today, the 56-page report argues bitcoin and digital currencies are better equipped to open up new markets and reach new consumers, and that today’s centralized payment systems are already efficient enough for today's commerce.  Still, Citi does see opportunity in using a public blockchain.  The report reads:  ""The power behind an open network like bitcoin is the possibility of incorporating it with other technologies to bring about true innovation, such as applications that support the Internet of Things (eg machine-to-machine payments).""  Notably, the report found bitcoin and digital currencies could be impactful in emerging markets, where payments systems are not as developed.  ""In countries where there is no quality payments infrastructure, we do think there could be some opportunity for an open decentralized network like bitcoin,"" the report states.  Elsewhere, the report sought to apply a critical eye in determining whether bitcoin’s characteristics have benefits for payments. For example, the authors stated that they don't necessarily believe immutability, or the incorruptibility of bitcoin’s blockchain, is well-suited for money movement.  The report went on to mention a number of specific blockchain and bitcoin startups, while providing overviews digital currency and blockchain networks including Ripple, bitcoin and ethereum.  TranserWise advantage  In remittances, long claimed as one of the biggest areas of impact by enthusiasts, the report found that the UK-based money transfer service TransferWise remains cheaper to use for cross-border payments today.  Of note, however, is that the report graded bitcoin against account-to-account remittance option and TransferWise in 10 remittance corridors, finding that it was only the lowest-cost option in one corridor, money transfers from the US to New Zealand.  In outbound corridors from the US, bitcoin was found to be cheaper than account-to-account options only in US-to-China transfers.  The report estimated fees on these transactions at 3.86% for account-to-account transactions and 3.38% on bitcoin transfers. By contract, fees for TransferWise payments cost just 1.48%.  The researchers also pointed to the high cost of converting bitcoin into fiat currency and the low liquidity in existing markets as challenges it believes the system will need to overcome.  Larger critiques  More broadly, the report sought to challenge popularly held conceptions about the bitcoin network, including its use in existing financial business models.  ""We believe an open network like bitcoin combined with mobile, machine learning, big data and the Internet of Things has the potential to create radically new models,"" the report reads.  Citi, for instance, said there is a ""misperception"" that bitcoin provides a system for frictionless transactions, while disputing that running payments through its blockchain would continue to be low-cost long term.  ""Since the network incurs substantial energy-related costs due to proof-of-work, we believe that these costs will eventually be borne by the users through high transaction fees, which will make it more expensive than centralized networks,"" the report contends.  In other areas such as speed, scalability and resiliency, the report argued bitcoin and digital currencies don’t necessarily have advantages.  It went on to call payment systems “resilient”, while questioning that bitcoin’s network could scale to support a larger number of transactions.

42378797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmO1,1467301526,"Outside the Spotlight, Stellar is Pulling Banks Into Orbit","Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb hit a roadblock in his mission to serve the global underbanked when earlier this month his co-founder resigned, leaving him with her responsibilities, including more frequently engaging with the public.  For a computer programmer whose career has been largely under scrutiny since he founded defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, the idea of taking on a more public role at Stellar was intimidating. But, he says it was a necessary step for the startup.  After years of building a payments rail system designed to make it cheaper to offer banking services to developing nations, McCaleb said it was time for him to make the case that Stellar should be considered a leading blockchain platform for enterprise customers.  McCaleb told CoinDesk:  ""We've spent the past two years building a product, and now we're showing it to the world.""  Founded in 2014 after McCaleb and his then-girlfriend and co-founder Kim left another startup he founded, Ripple, the two companies have always been equated in the blockchain community, despite their differing business models.  Stellar has raised a little over $3m from Stripe to build a new distributed ledger payments rail similar to Ripple’s, but aimed specifically at serving clients in developing nations.  In contrast, Ripple has raised more than $38m from investors as diverse as Andreessen Horowitz and Santander.  Barclays in South Africa  In his first public appearance, McCaleb spoke onstage at the Exponential Finance conference with Barclays Africa's CEO of corporate and investment banking, Stephen van Coller.  In interview with CoinDesk, van Coller described how his company is testing its prototype on the Stellar payments rail at a high school in Johanessburg, South Africa. About 100 students aged 16-years-old to 18-years-old are currently testing a minimum viable product (MVP) designed so feature phones can be used to pay for goods.  To be profitable in Africa, where the margins per customer are small, van Coller says they’ll need to be able to reach massive scale, serving customers that conduct few transactions, for smaller amounts than in more developed regions.  Coller said that to reach such efficiency his team searched for a scalable service that didn’t use existing payments rails ""because that’s where the cost is today"".  But even with a streamlined onboarding process and more efficient back-end, Coller believes the work with Stellar alone won’t be enough to serve Africa’s unbanked population.  Coller said he is currently in conversations with other financial institutions interested in financial inclusion.  ""Our belief is that this needs to be an open platform, rather than run by just a single bank,"" he said. ""Every government should be building this. They should be building cheap payment rails within their country.""  Wholesale with Deloitte  But, Barclays isn't the only bank interested in Stellar.  In May, consulting firm Deloitte announced that it was using the startup's technology to build a blockchain-based service for a bank outside of North America, but it didn’t share the name of the bank or in which region it is based.  In conversation, Deloitte Digital principal Gys Hyman revealed more about how his company has worked with Stellar to build a prototype for retail transactions. Specifically, Hyman said Deloitte is using the Stellar payments rail to build a prototype aimed at wholesale transactions that must reliably move with additional information, including invoice numbers and tracking numbers.  Throughout the construction of the prototypes, Stellar’s role has changed, according to Hyman.  While Stellar played a very hands-on roll during the creation of the retail prototype, Hyman said the startup is now more involved with oversight and quality assurance.  Hyman says there are now other customers, ""mainly banks"" with which he is currently in discussions, adding:  “From a Stellar integration point, we’re ready. If a customer were to come to us tomorrow, we’re ready.”  One country at a time  As part of his increasing presence in the public eye, McCaleb has spent the past two weeks touring around Nigeria to visit with partners and demonstrate the new technology.  Otherwise, he said the company's strategic plans are unchanged.  In May, Stellar published a company ""roadmap"" for how it plans to achieve its goal of serving the roughly 2.2 billion people in Africa currently without adequate banking services, one country at a time.  ""We're mainly focused on Nigeria because I think it’s important to start in one particular region and achieve ubiquity there,"" said McCaleb. ""Because we’re starting a network and you need to be able to send money to people you know.""  The first phase of the roadmap, to build a codebase for developers, was completed last November. The second phase, to integrate with money services providers licensed in each nation, was formalized on Tuesday with a challenge aimed specifically at attracting banks and licensed money-service transmitters.  The third phase is to bring the product to end users.  McCaleb told CoinDesk that this means Stellar will continue to eschew the sort of high-value, developed market use cases that have attracted his peers in the blockchain space.  He concluded:  ""I think that one of the most powerful things that this technology is going to do for the world is actually get everybody into the same financial network.""

42378802,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmRn,1467294505,5 Takeaways from CoinDesk’s 'Understanding Ethereum' Report,"Last week, CoinDesk Research released its newest report, ""Understanding Ethereum"", a 48-page deep dive into the emerging blockchain platform, its major players, its startup community and technological building blocks.  Our longest report to date, ""Understanding Ethereum"" also includes analysis on the ethereum ecosystem that seeks to illuminate how users are leveraging the platform today, and whether this matches with the intent of the platform’s creators.  Released at a time when many in the broader community are heatedly debating the merits of ethereum and its long-term viability, the report is a must-read for those who want a condensed yet comprehensive overview of why the platform has captured interest in the blockchain industry and beyond.  In the following sections, we highlight some of the major findings:  1. Exchanges are driving volume; what this means is less clear  One aspect of the ethereum ecosystem we sought to study was how much of the market was being driven by real users, given the platform was meant to be used for building applications rather than currency or investment vehicle.  In practice, however, trades facilitated by ethereum exchanges are still the dominant form of transactions on the network.  Data analysis reveals exchanges account for just under 15% of the total number of transactions, but over 50% of the volume that passes through the network daily.  var embedDeltas={""100"":535,""200"":454,""300"":427,""400"":427,""500"":427,""600"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},chart=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-3u5XZ""),chartWidth=chart.offsetWidth,applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math.min(1000, Math.max(100*(Math.floor(chartWidth/100)), 100))]||0,newHeight=applyDelta;chart.style.height=newHeight+""px"";  // ]]>  As for whether this activity could be qualified as ""speculative"", remains a matter of interpretation. For example, it remains unknown whether exchange users are making ether purchases to invest in the network’s future or otherwise prepare for running decentralized applications (dapps).  However, it’s worth noting that, today, the amount of ether sent to dapps, defined as collections of one or more smart contracts, remains comparably lower.  Funds sent to smart contracts, including dapps, account for 6.39% of the daily transaction total and roughly 12% of total volume.  2. Ether’s price could rise on one big factor  Of note for traders is that the market for ether in China is still relatively small, which means its $1bn market could be in for a boost should it successfully appeal to Asia-based traders.  Overall, just under 2% of ether is exchanged for CNY, while 85% of all bitcoin trades on the BTC/CNY trading pair.  This differential is due, in part, to the fact that ether has not yet been added by major China-based exchanges Huobi or OKCoin, both of which account for over 90% of bitcoin volumes due to their fee-free trading models.  Representatives from the exchanges told the report that they have no plans to offer ether trading yet, but that they continue to observe developments in the technology’s community.  3. If a lot of people are pissed about The DAO, 100 people are super pissed  Prior to the collapse of the $160m ethereum fund known as The DAO, the project was shaping up to be a key area of study for the report. As fate would have it, however, The DAO’s sudden collapse curtailed such efforts.  Still, there were a number of metrics collected on the project prior to its failure that illustrate just how popular the ethereum-based fund was during its short lifespan.  At peak, trades meant to exchange ether for DAO tokens represented about 3% of ethereum exchange volume, yet, the number of DAO tokenholders was relatively small.  As of mid-June, 1.17bn DAO tokens were held by 23,574 users. Ownership of these tokens was also relatively consolidated.  var embedDeltas={""100"":576,""200"":488,""300"":444,""400"":427,""500"":400,""600"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},chart=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-9wh7u""),chartWidth=chart.offsetWidth,applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math.min(1000, Math.max(100*(Math.floor(chartWidth/100)), 100))]||0,newHeight=applyDelta;chart.style.height=newHeight+""px"";  // ]]>  Such figures provide evidence to critics who allege that actions to fork the ethereum blockchain in an effort to recover the funds may be motivated by conflicts of interest.  Due to the large overlap between ethereum owners and DAO investors, speculation remains high that those involved with the technology’s leading non-profit, the Ethereum Foundation, were perhaps among those most affected when The DAO lost control of 3.6m ETH earlier this month.  4. Dapp development in consolidating in four areas  Elsewhere, CoinDesk Research found that roughly 230 decentralized applications (dapps) are in various stages of development, a figure that includes projects in concept, stealth mode, demo or working prototype stage or live.  Notably, CoinDesk Research observed development is mostly concentrated in four key areas:  Smart contract services, utilities and analytics  Gambling and games  Information validation and oracle services  Registry and governance.  The groupings provide insight into how the open-source technology’s early adopters are using smart contracts and how they believe they could best be applied to market challenges.  5. Ethereum is really best considered a beta platform  As illustrated by the sudden and ongoing collapse of The DAO, ethereum, while billed as “production ready”, is very much an early stage technology that is not recommended for enterprise use.  Our report outlines major challenges for ethereum, including its migration to a new proof-of-stake blockchain; its development of payments channel technology; its plans to introduce sharding; and the challenges posed by the continued development of its scripting language Solidity.  While coverage on ethereum of late has largely focused on the institutional interest and rising price of ether, such technical challenges are likely to be brought to the fore in the coming months and years as development on the platform advances.  Today, ethereum remains the most high-profile platform for smart contract development, however, this could change should technical challenges persist.

42378814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmd7,1467286625,IBM Completes Blockchain Identity Trial With Crédit Mutuel,"IBM has completed its latest blockchain project with French bank Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, an effort that found the two firms using the technology to create a system for identity verification.  The companies said the proof-of-concept uses the Hyperledger blockchain fabric to enable customers to provide proof of identity to third parties, such as local utilities and retailers. IBM and Crédit Mutuel further sought to label the proof-of-concept as one that provides evidence of how blockchain is being applied in non-financial applications.  In statements, Crédit Mutuel COO of innovation and operations Frédéric Laurent said:  “This project offered a complete view of customers' documents across our distributed network and helped us to understand and master blockchain for other client uses.”  Going forward, Laurent said that the bank is now ready to “incorporate” the technology into its ecosystem, though it did not provide more details on how it may move forward on this objective.  The announcement comes as France-based financial institutions become more active in their explorations of the technology despite the more negative views of some prominent politicians.  Last week, BNP Paribas and Caisse des Dépôts, for example, were among several French and European financial institutions to reveal they are working on a post-trade blockchain platform aimed at small businesses.  Further, the news comes as IBM has become increasingly active in showcasing work completed with its clients as part of its blockchain services offerings, first revealed in February.
