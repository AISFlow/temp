42426502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtIlh,1442872852,Russia's Qiwi Proposes Commodity-Backed Bitcoin Alternative,"A Russian payments company seeking to launch its own digital currency has proposed backing its market value with real-world commodities.  Russian state-owned news service TASS quoted an interview conducted by RBC TV during which Qiwi CEO Sergei Solonin built on previous comments about how his company – one of the largest of its kind in Russia – might issue its own cryptocurrency next year.  According to Solonin, the cryptocurrency could be backed by ""some [kind of] security in the form of energy"" produced domestically in Russia. He added that such design might give the digital currency a competitive edge against bitcoin, which he argued ""is not secured by anything"".  Solonin went on to say that he hopes the Russian Central Bank will warm up to the idea and suggested cooperation on the initiative, telling RBC:  “We are ready, we encourage the Central Bank to cooperate. We would like some kind of open discussion in the working group. We are very keen that we have moved in this direction. We understand, of course, the concerns of the Central Bank.”  He later called such dialogue “simply necessary” for the fruition of the project, according to TASS.  The proposal has since drawn condemnation from at least one Russian government official, who branded the idea ""illegal” last week.

42426517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJBh,1442872090,Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Operator Pleads Guilty to Securities Fraud,"Bitcoin Ponzi scheme perpetrator Trendon Shavers has plead guilty to securities fraud, a decision that reverses plea of not guilty submitted in March.  Shavers faced up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors out of an estimated $4.5m while operating Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T). The investment scheme, which promised investors 7% returns on bitcoin market arbitrage activity in 2011 and 2012, became the object of a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in July 2013.  According to a report by Bloomberg, Shavers will now serve anywhere from 33 months to 41 months in prison as a result of the plea deal, and pay a $5m fine.  “I know what I did was wrong and am very sorry,” Shavers said in a court hearing, according to the news source.  Shavers was ultimately found to be engaging in a Ponzi scheme whereby money from new investors was used to issue ""interest payments"" to new investors. Further, he exchanged bitcoin into US dollars to pay personal expenses, investigators found.  As a result of an initial inquiry, Shavers was forced to pay $40m in penalties for violating anti-fraud and securities laws in September of 2014. He was subsequently arrested again on criminal charges in November of that year.  A 9th September filing in the case previously revealed that US Attorney Preet Bharara had postponed a pre-trial conference on the basis the parties were working toward an agreement.  Shavers is scheduled to be sentenced on 3rd February, 2016.  For more information, a full copy of the plea agreement can be found below.

42426513,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJ3h,1442866337,21 Inc Announces 'Bitcoin Computer' for Developers,"21 Inc has announced it will begin accepting pre-orders for the 21 Bitcoin Computer, its first consumer product, on Monday.  Retailing for $400  , the 21 Bitcoin Computer will include a custom mining chip, a datacenter backend and a custom Linux-based operating system. The product, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal, is expected to ship in November.  In statements  , CEO Balaji Srinivasan laid out the broad vision for the product, which he hopes to one day be ""available by default on every new computer"".  Srinivasan wrote in a blog post:  ""We want to make it possible for you to turn your bright idea into passive income by selling bitcoin­-payable goods, games, and services over the Internet through a 21 Bitcoin Computer.""  Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz, one of the startup's principal investors, told the Journal that the 21 Bitcoin Computer is designed to enable easier machine-to-machine payments, something he called ""amazingly hard to do right now"".  Horowitz suggested it's not immediately clear what the 21 Bitcoin Computer would allow developers to build, but he strived to point out the similarities between it and early web browsers. ""These things can’t happen without some enabling technology,"" he told the source.  In a separate blog post, Srinivasan said the product could be used to mine bitcoin from the command line, sell API calls for bitcoin and rewarding peers for posting social media links, among other use cases.  ""The reason you can do these things so quickly is because the 21 Bitcoin Computer includes a built-in 21 mining chip (so you can easily buy things for bitcoin) and a built-in 21 micropayments server (so you can easily sell things for bitcoin), all accessible from the 21 command line interface,"" he wrote.  The product will include a Wi-Fi adapter, RPi 2, power supply, USB-to-laptop cable and 128GB SD card, and come equipped with a ""factory-installed"" copy of the blockchain. The machine, according to teh company, will produce between 50 and 125 GH/s with an effiency rate of roughly 0.17 Joules per GH.

42426515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJ7h,1442854832,Bank of America Files Patent for Cryptocurrency Wire Transfer System,"The US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) has published a patent filed by US financial services giant Bank of America that seeks to protect a system for wire transfers using cryptocurrency technology.  The patent  , filed on 17th March, 2014, and published 17th September, seeks to protect a system by which electronic funds could be sent between customer accounts using the underlying blockchain of a given cryptocurrency as the rails for payment.  The system described, for example, would enable customer funds to be converted at a cryptocurrency exchange and then sent to a second cryptocurrency exchange to be converted into a foreign currency before the value is moved to a recipient.  Speaking to the goal of the invention described, authors Thomas Edward Durbin and James Gregory Ronca write:  ""Enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis. As technology advances, foreign transactions have become more common. For some customers, it may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.""  Durbin and Ronca suggest that such a system would be designed to ""bypass"" traditional wire transfer services, ""reducing dependency on third-party networks"" and ""increasing the reliability of fund transfers"".  ""Initiating fund transfers using cryptocurrency allows for the technical effect of conducting a foreign fund transfer in less time than a foreign fund transfer currently, as it avoids delays that may be caused by relying on third-party systems and services,"" the filing continues.  Further, it suggests that fund transfers using cryptocurrency would reduce the need to transfer customer information to a ""third-party system"", thereby ""increasing control and security of customer data"" during such transactions.  While the filing uses the term ""cryptocurrency"" generally throughout, it does name bitcoin, litecoin, Ripple and dogecoin as specific examples.  Representatives from Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Assessing need  One of the more interesting aspects of the filing is the way in which it envisions the method by which cryptocurrency would be selected as the preferred option for transmitting funds.  For example, Bank of America states that its transaction module may choose from a number of available cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges based on factors such as price and market volatility.  ""For example, transaction module 136 may choose a particular cryptocurrency exchange because the cryptocurrency is priced favorably (eg, cheap if purchasing, expensive if selling) or because the cryptocurrency exchange has a relationship with the enterprise,"" the filing reads.  OKCoin  , Bitstamp, BTCC (formerly BTC China), Cryptsy, CoinMarket and Justcoin (since purchased by ANX) are named as examples of cryptocurrency exchanges that could be used.  The filing goes on to state that the module would seek to initiate the buying and selling of cryptocurrency near simultaneously in an effort to facilitate a cost-effective transfer.  A separate module would then initiate the transfer of funds, handling the security aspects of the transaction.  For more information, read the full filing here.

42426507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtIzh,1442851451,"IPO and Insurance Projects Win £2,000 at Blockchain Hackathon","Two ideas aiming to disrupt the IPO and insurance markets came top at 'Hack The Block' this Sunday, bringing London FinTech Week to a close.  The two-day blockchain hackathon, sponsored by Lloyds Banking Group, IBM and Thomson Reuters, took place inside the latter's flagship building in Canary Wharf, the capital's banking hub.  Four teams competed in the hope of scooping two £1,000 prizes – the first themed around trade authentication, the second around programmable assets – and the chance to work as a 'labs project' with the three event sponsors-come-judges.  The event, which saw the teams present for 12 minutes followed by a Q&A session, was marked by a diverse mix of development and business talent looking to tackle real-life use cases.  ""We started from absolutely zero, we didn't even know if we were going to participate,"" Shanshan Fu, a member of winning team Issuefficient told CoinDesk.  Fu, alongside Nawaz Imam and developers Mihai Cimpoesu, Tim Nugent and Andrei Baloiu, created a solution aimed at streamlining the IPO process, which it described as ""high cost, low efficiency"". Using blockchain tech, Issuefficient would siphon control from the investment banks currently sitting between investors and issuers, and make auditing far easier.  Nugent added:  ""It's all very well jumping on a new paradigm, but you have to differentiate it from what already exists and highlight what the distinct advantages are. Otherwise it's jumping on a bandwagon.""  Team Insureth also came away successful. Citing data from the UK Civil Aviation Authority that 558,000 airline passengers did not claim on their insurance for delays to their journey in the 12 months leading up to May, the team of three presented a smart contract system that would provide instant compensation for affected customers in a ""provably honest"" manner.  In their demo, developers Francesco Canessa and Kristina Butkute showed how Insureth connected Ethereum's smart contracts with the oracle service Oraclizehttps://www.oraclize.it/home/features, created by team member Thomas Bertani.  ""Checking flight data is very easy, there are tons of data feeds – and other use cases we didn't even think about: oystercards [London's travel cards], stolen bikes,"" Bertani told CoinDesk, adding: ""If you can trust the internet you can trust this system,"" he said.  Both teams told CoinDesk they had been up coding until 11pm kick out on Saturday evening, putting the final touches to their demos before judging took place on Sunday afternoon. Though programming on several blockchains was allowed, the majority of teams opted to use Ethereum, despite having little to no experience.  ""You don't have time to read the [Ethereum] docs, so you have to think 'How can I leverage my existing IT skills to learn it without really learning'. That's a proper hack,"" Nugent said, adding:  ""You have to get your hands dirty: look at the code, run it, break it. That's how you get on top of it.""  The other entries were Blockathon Swaps, a smart contract platform aiming to increase swap liquidity, and SmartBond, a so-called 'transformation engine' aiming to split corporate bonds into smaller chunks – again, to increase liquidity.  Collaboration  The event comes as blockchain technology is gathering momentum in financial services, even at the top. While the subject featured heavily at London FinTech Week, this month has seen a flurry of announcements from the biggest names in finance.  Last week it was revealed that nine of the world's biggest investment banks have pledged to collaborate on a set of blockchain standards. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon – once notoriously anti-bitcoin – also came forward to ring the praises of the technology last week.  Max Kalis from Lloyds Group tolds startups ""the door is open"" from the bank: ""Exploring blockchain is just something we have to do because it looks like very fertile ground to make things better for [our] customers.""  Speaking on behalf of IBM, Sean Barclays revealed the company – and its clients – had been researching and experimenting with blockchain technology ""for a while"".  Amanda West, senior vice president of innovation at Thomson Reuters, told the audience that the financial services firm was eager for startups to use its content, including its various APIs:  ""We want to start collaborating more with what we would describe as the 'fringes' of innovation. There's only so much innovation that's ever going to happen within our company.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/21/ipo-and-insurance-projects-win-2000-at-blockchain-hackathon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f1b6cb53ca03f3684f9e49fb6ee3e26680672d6-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJHh,1442843726,Verizon Ventures: Blockchain's Future is Brighter Than Bitcoin's,"Visa, Capital One, JP Morgan.  While it may be expected that the world's leading financial firms would be interested in bitcoin and blockchain tech given its association with currency, the technology's range of potential use cases is attracting perhaps more surprising names.  For example, Verizon Ventures, the venture capital arm of US telecommunications giant Verizon, recently invested in Filament, a Nevada-based startup seeking to use the bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum to enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to both be tracked, and to transact, on a public ledger system.  The investment was Verizon Ventures' first in the industry, but according to director Ed Ruth, it's unlikely it will be the last. Ruth believes blockchain tech has the ability to solve problems facing technology applications in the IoT and beyond.  In an interview, Ruth indicated Verizon Ventures had been studying bitcoin for a year without much interest, but it was the larger implications of the blockchain, the digital currency's distributed ledger, that changed his mind about the available opportunities.  Ruth told CoinDesk:  ""As we started looking at the protocol, it became apparent that blockchain had a bigger potential than the specific bitcoin or cryptocurrency use case. We started to see some convergence around Internet of Things, and we started to seek out companies leveraging the technology.""  While he suggested the use of cryptographic tokens as digital currency might find a fit in the third world, Ruth suggested the firm doesn't believe this use case is as compelling in developed markets like the US.  Still, Ruth cautioned that his firm doesn't have an operating thesis on the technology, calling it a ""living and breathing"" project, adding that Verizon is paying attention to all aspects of the developing technology.  ""I think the market is incredibly nascent,"" he continued, ""but we're interested and paying attention and we're learning through companies we're investing in.""  One of the largest cell phone carriers in the US, Verizon generated $87.6bn in wireless revenues in 2014, and boasts 6.6 million Internet subscribers.  All in on IoT  Ruth explained that, while Verizon Ventures is interested in blockchain tech, it's still a very general interest. As such, it was Filament's use of the technology for IoT, he said, that made the startup a compelling investment.  ""We think of IoT as an extended new vertical for network infrastructure. We know it's going to be the backbone for a lot of the data that needs to transact in the cloud for smart cities, fleet management, and so on and so forth,"" he explained.  Filament, he recently wrote, stood out for the way it combined IoT technology with its use of end-to-end encryption and ability to ""securely collect and consolidate data"" with its devices. The startup is set to release two devices in Q4 of this year, both of which advertise an ability to securely communicate, execute smart contracts and send microtransactions.  Ruth said IoT has become a bigger point of emphasis for Verizon as it has recently sought to expand beyond telecommunications. For example, he noted Verizon's recent acquisition of AOL saw it entering the media business.  ""We've been traditionally a telco company and about a year and a half two years ago, we transitioned into a technology company,"" he continued. ""I think IoT is a means by which we can transform ourselves.""  Cautious approach  Despite a heavy focus on IoT, Ruth said he does believe blockchain tech will impact other verticals, though he's not sure exactly which will be affected.  For example, he suggested there may be use cases for digital currency in financial services and shared databases in regards to roaming agreements, where Verizon will extend voice and data services to customers by way of a local telecom partner.  While Orange Telecom has honed in on the former use case for extending financial services, Ruth said the model doesn't quite make sense for Verizon yet given its US focus.  ""For emerging markets, it's a bigger value than in stable markets with stable currencies,"" Ruth continued. ""Our initial thinking was that it didn't solve a large enough problem domestically.""  Going forward, Ruth predicts bitcoin and blockchain tech will continue to garner attention from major brands, given the support and capital leading VC firms such as Andreessen Horowitz have already extended.  Still, he said incumbent companies are likely to be cautious as they explore the tech, concluding:  ""I think a lot of companies have been looking at bitcoin and blockchain for at least as long as we have. But, when you're a big company and you're publicly traded, it takes you a little bit longer to make those choices.""

42426500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtIhh,1442832627,Bitcoin as a Commodity: What the CFTC’s Ruling Means,"Jared Marx is an attorney at Washington, DC law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings. Here, he discusses a recent ruling by the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which saw it label bitcoin as a commodity.  Last Thursday the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) settled charges against a small and now-defunct operation in San Francisco called Coinflip, which marketed bitcoin derivatives. In the process, the CFTC asserted for the first time that bitcoin is a “commodity”.  What does that determination mean for the bitcoin ecosystem and what does this new kind of enforcement action portend for the future?  First, before getting to the nitty-gritty, recall that in the crazy mixed-up world of overlapping American regulation, this determination means almost nothing for how other regulators treat bitcoin. The BitLicense, for example, will soldier on unaffected, as will other state regulators and FinCEN.  The formal classification probably does put to final rest the idea that ordinary bitcoins are securities, as Prof. Shadab told to CoinDesk last week, but the SEC has been acting that way for a long time.  What the classification tells us about the CFTC  As an initial matter, it comes as no surprise that the CFTC is calling bitcoin a commodity. The CFTC had signaled its views on the subject nearly a year ago, and I wrote about its potential implications around the same time. Companies like TerraExchange have been working with the CFTC under the same presumption for even longer.  TerraExchange and others have taken to heart the most obvious upshot of the CFTC’s classification, which is that, to legally run a market for bitcoin derivatives for US users, a company must first jump through a bunch of hoops with the CFTC. (For financial newbies, a financial derivative is essentially a contract to buy, sell, or pay, contingent upon the price of a something else.) Coinflip didn’t do this and the result was this recent enforcement action.  More broadly, the classification also now means it is more likely the CFTC could, under its market manipulation authority, police fraudulent activities on exchanges where bitcoins – and not just bitcoin derivatives – are traded.  However, the CFTC has suggested it is not particularly interested in going down that path, and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets.  This leaves the primary impact of the enforcement action itself to be felt by companies like Coinflip, which offer bitcoin derivatives to users in the US.  Before getting to that, though, keep in mind the importance of bitcoin derivatives themselves.  The importance of bitcoin derivatives  Bitcoin derivatives provide the primary vehicle by which a holder can stabilize the fiat value of their bitcoins even when markets remain turbulent – if you’re not familiar with the concept, check out how you do this using a “costless collar”.  That’s a big deal when many complain bitcoin is not a dependable store of value. Using derivatives to stabilize value is awkward on a one-off basis, but commercialized and regularized through smart contracts, it gives holders the experience of owning bitcoins with a stable price, even when the market price for bitcoins continues to fluctuate.  [post-quote]  As for legal implications, the most pertinent message from the enforcement action itself is the CFTC’s signal that it will expend resources to shut down unregistered platforms, including very small ones.  The CFTC didn’t make any money on this settlement, as Coinflip didn’t have to pay a fine, and likely could not have afforded to pay a big one anyway. Likewise, Coinflip’s platform, Derivabit, apparently never had more than 400 users, which, even in the world of bitcoin, is still very small.  It is worth pointing out, as I’ve mentioned before, that non-US based companies who sell derivatives to US persons are subject to this same enforcement risk – though whether the CFTC will go so far as to conduct extraterritorial enforcement actions in this area is not obvious.  Likewise, violation of any CFTC rule is, somewhat amazingly, punishable with jail time.  Here, Coinflip cooperated with the CFTC, and the fact that they didn’t even pay a fine likely reflects this. (Recall, though, that while cooperation with an investigation is sometimes a good strategy, willy-nilly and lawyer-less discussion with government investigators almost never is.)  Still, this enforcement action suggests that, without something more flagrant, criminal punishment for these types of offenses is not especially likely.  In the end, the takeaway is that the CFTC’s action is exactly the sum of its parts. Bitcoin is now officially a commodity.  Even small unregistered sellers of bitcoin derivatives are wise to make plans to deal with potential enforcement actions.
