42378756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7liob,1466454924,Investor Tim Draper is Still Buying Bitcoin and Now Owns Ether,"The recent rise in the price of bitcoin shows ""people are coming around"" to the digital currency, according to investor Tim Draper.  Long one of the ecosystem’s most active investors, Draper is perhaps best known for buying roughly 30,000 BTC as part of the first government auction of the digital currency held in 2014. In keeping with this view, Draper said has continued to buy bitcoin and that he now owns ether, the native cryptocurrency powering the ethereum blockchain.  Draper told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin will continue to lead because it has become the standard, but ethereum and others will also have an effect on various verticals like smart contracts or bank transfers.""  Two years later, Draper believes the recent increase in the price of bitcoin is due to the fact that more people are now believers in the system like him.  Of note is that with the price hovering above $700, the last few weeks have marked the first time that Draper’s bitcoin holdings would be worth more than he paid, should he have paid at or above market value for the purchase. (The exact buying price is still unknown).  As to how his thesis on the industry has changed during this time, Draper said that he believes bitcoin ""will prevail"" but that other blockchain systems will become widely used.  Despite a recent slowdown in the number of investments at his VC fund Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Draper said he is eager to invest in more companies, but that the quality of recent applicants has perhaps been lacking.  However, Draper indicated he believes this could soon change, concluding:  ""A lot of the early companies were breakthroughs. We should have a new wave of them here soon.""

42378762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lizv,1466445647,Why the Wrong Response to The DAO Attack Could Kill Ethereum,"Edan Yago is CEO of Epiphyte, a company that provides financial institutions with the ability to perform transactions on the open blockchain. He is also a founding board member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA).    In this opinion piece, Yago discusses the ongoing crisis at The DAO, and he believes the future of blockchain platform ethereum rests on how its development community will seek a solution.  On 8th July, 2011, bitcoin’s first big bubble burst. It would go on to lose an astounding 94% of its value, eventually dropping from $31 to a mere $2.  As you may have noticed, it has since recovered quite nicely. Ethereum is now in a moment of crisis. The DAO has been hacked, destroyed and a big chunk of funds have been stolen. Like bitcoin did, ethereum can recover – but a panicked response could kill it forever.  Unfortunately, we seem to be heading toward that panicked response.  Ethereum has value for one reason and one reason only – it is the Turing-complete, smart contract protocol. In other words. ether’s value is a direct result of the value of smart contracts and ethereum’s position as the premier protocol for them.  On 17th June, The DAO, a smart contract running on Ethereum was savaged. We must now choose to respond in one of two ways: We can learn a lesson and build better smart contacts in the future, or we can reverse the flawed smart contract and pull the rug out from under ethereum forever  There is something far bigger than The DAO, or even ethereum, at stake here: the very idea of immutable smart contracts.  The core promise of smart contracts was brilliantly articulated by The DAO. They are designed to operate ""solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code"". The core idea here is that the code is the contract, and that it does not require or allow human intervention or interpretation.  It is automatic and ""autonomous"". Deterministic outcomes based on code – that is the value.  This value is 100% dependent on the ability of smart contracts to run on a protocol that can be trusted to operate according to deterministic rules known in advance. That is what ethereum must be. What is being now suggested is to go and change the protocol-level rules, retroactively, because of an exploit discovered in one contract on the application level.  To do so, would destroy the very trust that makes all contracts on the application level possible.  Misleading history  A lot of people have been pointing out that bitcoin also forked in the early days. This is true but also very misleading. Bitcoin only forked when the protocol was broken, never when the protocol worked as intended but the results were uncomfortable.  Another argument made in favor of forking is that consensus is created ""by the community"", that ""the miners can vote"". This is even more subtle and misleading. Miners are not meant to be the final arbiters of transactions and contracts. By design, they are supposed to be dumb slaves of the protocol rules. A dumb lottery validating transactions according to deterministic rules.  If they need to employ good judgment, we are at the mercy of their good sense.  It comes down to is this. If smart contracts must be interpreted by humans for their ""intent"" instead of by code for their programming, then smart contracts cannot be autonomous and automatic, and instead can be retroactively reversed by the community, the courts or governments.  If this is the case, it's hard to see what value smart contracts actually have, which means that it's hard to see that ethereum should have any value at all.  The only way for ethereum to be able to recover from this event and thrive in the future is for it to stick to its principles.  This is the hard choice. And it is the only choice.

42378766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lixP,1466441286,The Man Who Claims to Be Bitcoin's Creator is Seeking Blockchain Patents,"A new report has shed details on the story of Craig Wright, the Australian academic and businessman who earlier this year sought to prove he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.  The mammoth 35,000-word piece by journalist and novelist Andrew O’Hagan captures the behind-the-scenes effort of Wright’s controversial reveal earlier this year, when he sat for interviews with The Economist, GQ and the BBC as part of an effort to bolster his claim. That move came months after tech publications Gizmodo and Wired published reports in December connecting Wright to the Satoshi identity.  The story contains a number of interesting facts and anecdotes, including the claim that Wright lost funds in the collapse of Costa Rican digital currency firm Liberty Reserve and once had a face-to-face meeting with Ross Ulbricht, the convicted operator of the Silk Road online dark market. It also offers new details on Dave Kleiman, who was reportedly an early force in the project before passing away in mid-2013.  One running theme of the story is Wright's effort to patent aspects of the technology underlying bitcoin as part of a reported deal with a company called nTrust, which offers a money exchange app and, according to the LBR report, had struck the foundations of a deal that would see the filing of a number of patents related to the blockchain and digital currency under the auspices of a new firm, nCrypt.  The patent development process appears to have been driven by a desire to sell big – and soon. According to the LBR, ""the hurry for the patents was to help with the giant sale to Google or whomever"".  Work, the story outlines, had already begun at a new research center based in London, and movements toward meetings with Google and Uber had begun, nTrust executives told the publication. O’Hagan spent months working closely with Wright for his story depicting the run-up to the big reveal, and at one point Wright asserts that there had been hundreds of bitcoin and blockchain-patents waiting in the wings.  He told the publication:  ""We have hundreds of patents and papers in progress – research from the beginning – and in the next year we’re going to start releasing them.""  Perhaps most importantly, part of the deal entailed Wright proving that he was actually Satoshi Nakamoto. The company was the driving force behind the process, with nTrust spearheading the effort to source public relations staffers and journalists to manage the reveal.  As part of the deal, nTrust would settle Wright’s problems with the Australian Tax Office, which had launched an investigation into Wright and his business holdings after he sought business tax credits. In the wake of the December publications, Australian authorities raided his home in the country as part of that investigation.  Yet those efforts were scuttled by Wright’s aborted reveal, the LBR report shows. After Wright’s initial reveal sparked broad criticism about the signature details published on his personal blog, the plan shifted to one that would see the alleged bitcoin creator move a stash of early bitcoins from one address to another. Former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen would act as recipient, according to O’Hagan’s report.  This plan, too, would fall apart, after Wright published a terse, final blog post stating that he would not provide any further evidence to bolster his Satoshi claim. This was reportedly the final blow to any deal between Wright and the nTrust team.  But a new report from Reuters suggests that the patent effort explored in O’Hagan’s story isn’t finished.  According to the news agency, a business venture called EITC Holdings Ltd that is tied to Wright has submitted 50 patent applications in the UK related to digital currencies and blockchain tech, and that it may seek to submit as many as 400 total.  Data provided by the UK Intellectual Property Office shows that the EITC has submitted a range of patent applications focused on the technology filed this year, including ones for ""implementing logic gate functionality using a blockchain"", an ""operating system for blockchain IOT devices"" and ""methods and systems for the efficient transfer of entities on a peer-to-peer distributed ledger"".

42378757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lipr,1466439124,Deloitte Blockchain Leads Depart to Launch New Startup,"UPDATE (20th June 22:10 BST): This piece has been updated with a statement from Deloitte      Three members of Deloitte’s blockchain team specializing in building custom distributed ledger products for enterprises have left the organization to found what could be seen as a competing product.  But, far from a radical departure, the co-founders of the newly launched startup, called Nuco, say the real reason they've departed is to raise more capital faster than they could have with Deloitte.  Instead of competing against his former colleagues at Deloitte, Nuco CEO Mathew Spoke said they’ll be one of his earliest partners.  Spoke told CoinDesk:  ""We’re essentially continuing on the track of what we started doing at Deloitte. We recognized the need for more capital and realized that we could move more quickly if we were a standalone company.""  Based in Toronto, Spoke said his team of six is currently building a customizable technology stack that would allow users to build blockchain services that can help streamline across a wide-range of possible use cases.  Nuco’s business model is to build, license and deploy customized private blockchain networks for clients across industries. Specifically, Nuco will begin building tools for tracking compliance duties for firms accountable to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal environmental regulators.  The spin-off  Founded in 2015, Deloitte's Rubix blockchain division played an integral role in positioning the company at the forefront of global financial institutions working to tap the emerging technology for new efficiencies.  As the effort progressed Deloitte wanted to focus its efforts on blockchain app development for its clients, while spinning off the Ethereum-based network on which the apps might be built to Nuco. Deloitte already works with at least five other blockchain companies.  ""The subtlety on this,"" said Terry Stuart, Deloitte Canada's chief innovation officer, ""is that we’ve taken the Rubix kernel and we said lets put that over in Nuco for Matt and his team to drive that forward.""  As part of an agreement with Deloitte Jinius Tu, Rubix's lead blockchain developer and a Nuco co-founder, is staying at Rubix for the next two weeks to three weeks as part of the formal hand-over of intellectual property developed by the team, but owned by Deloitte.  Spoke and co-founder Kesem Frank, a blockchain specialist at Deloitte, are now working on Nuco full time.  The first steps  In the weeks and months ahead, Nuco will work to develop a strategy that will allow it to gain market share.  Apart from its technology stack, Spoke said another option currently ""on the table"" is to add its offering to Microsoft's Azure platform, designed to help streamline the creation of enterprise blockchain tech.  Nuco is currently in the process of raising its first round of capital, which Spoke expects will close soon.  Spoke said the company is not sharing the amount it plans to raise, but that his co-founders have already proved valuable in the negotiation of terms. Stuart said Deloitte plans to be a minority investor in the company.  Spoke said:  ""This is my first foray into the entrepreneurship world, but our history of working together has made for easy conversations with investors.""

42378764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7liyf,1466431222,Bitcoin Foundation Names South African Investor as New Director,"Bitcoin’s oldest trade organization has voted in a new executive director.  Weeks after outgoing executive director Bruce Fenton notified the board his term was nearing conclusion (rumors suggested he had resigned), the Bitcoin Foundation has named Llew Claasen to the position.  A relative unknown in the bitcoin and wider blockchain community, Claasen is a venture capitalist from Cape Town, South Africa and the managing partner of Newtown Partners, who primarily has a background in online and mobile infrastructure. Fenton will remain a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation.  The vote reportedly took place on 14th June. Notably, board member and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham did not vote due to a ""long business relationship"" with Claasen.  The appointment follows news the Bitcoin Foundation had received new funding, months after continuing to operate with close to no reserves.  Though it once boasted a nearly 10-person full-time staff, the Bitcoin Foundation shed all of its paid employees over the course of 2014. Entering 2015, the organization reorganized as a primarily volunteer organization focused more on software development, thought its relevancy in this space has recently been challenged.

42378760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lisN,1466428169,$19 Million in Bitcoin Hits the Auction Block in Australia,"More than $19m worth of bitcoin is now being sold at auction in a public sale overseen by professional services firm Ernst & Young.  Announced on 30th May, the auction finds E&Y auctioning 24,518 BTC (worth roughly $19m at press time) over a 48-hour period that began at 12:01am AEST today. As previously reported, the bitcoins were confiscated by law enforcement officials from an Australian native in late 2014 in connection with a narcotics investigation.  But with bitcoin trading at two-year highs, just who is interested in the auction and whether it draws the same number of high-profile participants as major US auctions, remains to be seen.  So far, CoinDesk has only been able to identify one auction participant who has come forward to indicate they will be entering bids as part of the event, Silicon Valley-based bitcoin buying service Binary Financial.  US auction participants including itBit and Pantera Capital said they will not be entering bids, while New York-based trading firms Genesis Mining and Cumberland Mining had not responded to requests for additional information at press time. (E&Y declined to provide insight into the number of participating bidders).  While the high price of bitcoin at auction may seem a likely deterrent, Binary managing partner Harry Yeh indicated that the auction blocks could prove enticing to over-the-counter bitcoin trading firms like his own, who he said have been struggling to source demand stemming from bitcoin’s recent gains.  Yeh told CoinDesk:  “We want to help our clients accumulate more bitcoin. Right now, getting any access where you can buy bitcoin without a huge premium is an advantage.”  Sources suggested OTC buyers are now paying as much as 2% above market prices, meaning at $748, bitcoins sold off exchanges would be trading at above $760.  The price of bitcoin has seen rapid appreciation in recent weeks ahead of a long-planned network change called the halving. Though experts debate the exact impetus of the price increase, the halving has long been of interest to speculators as it marks the start of the amount of new bitcoins minted daily declining by 50%.  While the first bitcoin auction drew global interest due to the participation of the US government, subsequent auctions have largely failed to draw strong bidder and media interest.
