42405584,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedW8W,1608332500,Here's What Happened at Crypto Lender Cred's Latest Bankruptcy Hearing,"Crypto lender Cred will still be in control of its business as it heads into bankruptcy.      In an omnibus preliminary hearing on Friday, Judge John Dorsey of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court rejected a motion to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to oversee Cred’s restructuring.      The judge made the ruling with the caveat that if Cred equity holders Dan Schatt and Lu Hua attempt to fire Cred board member Grant Lyon, who’s in charge of Cred’s restructuring, then the court will step in and appoint a trustee to oversee the bankruptcy. Dorsey also appointed an examiner, who will provide an independent investigation into Cred’s business.      “There’s no evidence that anybody has done anything wrong since the [bankruptcy was filed],” said Paul Hastings LLP partner James Grogan, the attorney representing Cred in the case. “We’re not here to sprinkle holy water on what the debtors did pre-petition. Nobody thinks that this company was well-run or was a model for business schools.”      Cred froze withdrawals and deposits in October and declared bankruptcy in November. According to several former Cred employees, the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing doesn’t tell the whole story.      Read more: Bad Loans, Bad Bets, Bad Blood: How Crypto Lender Cred Really Went Bankrupt      The motion to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee was filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unit that oversees the administration of bankruptcy cases. In denying the DOJ’s request, Dorsey offered his thoughts on Cred’s mismanagement.      “There’s no doubt in my mind that there were shenanigans going on [before the bankruptcy case was filed],” the judge said before deciding not to enlist a Chapter 11 trustee.      Dorsey decided to delay a motion to allow one creditor to retrieve its crypto before the rest. The motion was filed by UpgradeYa, an investment firm that participated in Cred’s borrowing program. The company wants the 478.17 BTC (now worth around $11 million) it used to secure a $2 million loan from Cred (in fiat) before other creditors get their assets back.      The company believes it’s entitled to the bitcoin now because it’s UpgradeYa’s property and not the estate’s. The judge may have to rule on whether the common bitcoin meme “not your keys, not your crypto” applies.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/18/heres-what-happened-at-crypto-lender-creds-latest-bankruptcy-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73fc1d7bfa28de08cad619940d865a40f568c16d-1200x673.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405583,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedW6Y,1608328437,US Floats Long-Dreaded Plan to Make Crypto Exchanges Identify Personal Wallets,"U.S. cryptocurrency users hoping to transfer their holdings from an exchange to their own personal wallets may need to comply with new know-your-customer (KYC) requirements under a rule proposed by the Treasury Department Friday.      Under the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, users who want to send cryptocurrencies from centralized exchanges to a private wallet would need to provide personal information about the owner of that wallet to the exchanges, if the amount sent is greater than $10,000 in one day. The exchanges would also need to submit and store records involving such transactions with a total value over $10,000 in a given reporting period, or just maintain records for transactions over $3,000.      In other words, users of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges who want to move their holdings onto their own private wallet, or to someone else’s, would have to provide detailed personal information for transactions greater than $3,000, and exchanges would be required to report either individual or groups of transactions that add up to more than $10,000 to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).      Along with another recent proposal, the move would increase the amount of work individuals and exchanges must put into transferring cryptocurrencies, as well as increase the amount of personal data exchanges must hold onto or report to the Treasury Department.      This would bring crypto closer in line with the traditional banking system, perhaps giving greater comfort to institutional investors who are increasingly considering the asset class, but undermining the technology's early promise of privacy and self-sovereignty.      At a minimum, privacy would require jumping through more hoops:      In a press release, the Treasury said the rule would close “loopholes” around virtual currency transaction reporting.      The general public will have until Jan. 4, 2021 to provide comments or feedback (although another part of the document says feedback can be submitted within 15 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, the national logbook, on Dec. 23).      “FinCEN assesses that there are significant national security imperatives that necessitate an efficient process for proposal and implementation of this rule,” the document read, adding:    “U.S. authorities have found that malign actors are increasingly using CVC to facilitate international terrorist financing, weapons proliferation, sanctions evasion, and transnational money laundering, as well as to buy and sell controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals.”    Rumors that this rule was in the works circulated last month when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that the Trump administration was preparing a rushed rule that would require exchanges to verify know-your-customer information for the recipient of a transfer to a self-hosted wallet.      The move would introduce a large amount of friction for crypto users, Armstrong warned at the time.      The rule would be largely in line with guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last year that required its member nations to implement KYC rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), a term for crypto exchanges and other startups, as well as the so-called “travel rule.”      At the time, FATF’s guidelines suggested that individual crypto wallets could be designated VASPs, saying:      “In cases where the VASP is a natural person, it should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction where its place of business is located – the determination of which may include several factors for consideration by countries.”    Public comment period    Any time a VASP customer sends $10,000 or more in crypto to a self-hosted wallet in a single day, their VASP would be required to verify their identity, collect the identity of their counterparty, and file a report with FinCEN, under Treasury's proposed rule.      The rule would force banks and money services businesses (MSBs) to compile and verify the same information for all unhosted wallet transactions over $3,000. They would not need to file a report with FinCEN for these four-figure transfers, however.      As has been rumored for weeks, the rule’s main target appears to be self-hosted wallets (FinCEN calls them unhosted wallets). These are wallets that grant their users access to the private keys, giving them full control over the funds, just like the leather wallet in your pocket or purse.    See also: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data    Treasury also intends to apply the reporting rules to foreign wallets tied to countries on FinCEN’s money laundering watch list. This means Myanmar (which FinCEN calls Burma), Iran and North Korea to start.      FinCEN suggested that a large portion of crypto transaction activity might be suspicious, writing that “despite significant underreporting due to compliance challenges in parts of the CVC [convertible virtual currency] sector, in 2019, FinCEN received approximately $119 billion in suspicious activity reporting.”      “A significant majority” of these transactions might relate to possible legal violations, the document said.    Central bank digital currencies    The document also references “digital assets with legal tender status (LTDA),” a term apparently referencing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The term first appeared around the end of October in government documents.      LTDAs have legal tender status, but are not currencies, according to a footnote. They can be treated as being similar to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers’ checks, bearer negotiable instruments” or other financial instruments.    See also: Self-Hosted Bitcoin Wallets Become Front Line in Fight Over Crypto Regulations    Another note says that at present, “only a limited number of transactions occur involving LTDA,” though several countries are developing LTDA systems.      LTDAs are referenced as being distinct from CVCs in the advanced notice.    Widespread pushback    Marta Belcher, a civil liberties and technology attorney, told CoinDesk that in her view, “one of the most important things about cryptocurrency is that it imports the civil liberties benefits of cash into the digital sphere by allowing for anonymous transactions.”      The ANPR is part of a trend where the U.S. government seeks to implement traditional banking system surveillance tools in the crypto space, said Belcher, who is also special counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.      “There are photos from the Hong Kong protests of long lines at the subway stations as protestors waited to purchase tickets with cash so that their electronic purchases would not place them at the scene of the protest,” she said. “These photos underscore that a cashless society is a surveillance society; that is why the ability to import the anonymity of cash to the digital world is so important for civil liberties.”      The rule received pushback from the crypto community well before details were officially announced. Armstrong criticized the rule, saying he believed there may be unintended consequences.      Part of the concern stems around the rapid pace at which Mnuchin – and agencies that report to Treasury – are implementing new rules. FinCEN, a bureau of the Treasury, moved to lower the threshold for applying the travel rule to international money transfers, including cryptocurrencies. While that rule change proposal did see a public comment period, it was shorter than typical by at least 30 days.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said in a statement, ""Undercutting that ability with last-minute rulemaking in the twilight days of an outgoing administration is not the way to make the type of long-lasting, responsive regulations that will support the safe growth of this industry in the U.S. Whether regulators acknowledge it or not, crypto is here to stay and should be considered a pro-growth part of the national economy, not something to be brushed aside quietly at the midnight hour.""    See also: Industry Pros Weigh In on Rumors of New Crypto Wallet Regulations    Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, likewise called Friday's proposal ""rushed,"" saying some of the recordkeeping requirements might be ""infeasible in the context of cryptocurrency transactions.""      FinCEN does not appear to be bothered by these fears. In fact, the agency asserts it has no legal requirement to hold a comment period of any length but is giving the public a shot anyhow. Delaying implementation could spur individuals to move their funds fast, FinCEN warned.      The moves increase the amount of work individuals and exchanges must put into transferring cryptocurrencies, as well as increase the amount of personal data exchanges must hold onto or report to the Treasury Department.      Republican lawmakers even decried the move, with a public letter signed by U.S. Representatives Warren Davidson (Ohio), Tom Emmer (Minn.), Ted Budd (N.C.) and Scott Perry (Penn.) asking Mnuchin to discuss the move with elected officials. Earlier on Friday, Senator-elect Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said she was concerned by the move.      Other industry representatives criticizing the move include Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who wrote an open letter to Treasury Department staff saying the proposed rule “would inadequately address the actual risks that are at issue,” and harm the industry overall.    International restrictions    The U.S. follows a number of other nations in implementing stricter identity verification rules around crypto wallets. France, the Netherlands and Switzerland have all created their own form of stringent wallet rules this year.      De Nederlandsche Bank, the Netherlands’ central bank, apparently began requiring exchanges to ask its customers what they intend to use their cryptocurrencies for as well as verify that they were the owner of the wallets they were trying to transfer funds to.      Similarly, Switzerland has required exchanges to “prove ownership of non-custodial wallets” since the start of the year.    See also: FinCEN Encourages Banks to Share Customer Information With Each Other    Prior to the U.S., France was the latest country to force such identification requirements on crypto exchanges, barring anonymous accounts and hinting at further digital ID rules.      Unlike the other countries, however, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire cited concerns around crypto being a potential source of terrorism funding rather than FATF in the rules’ rollout.      Van Valkenburgh noted that the U.S. proposal differs from the overseas variants, writing, ""We are, nonetheless, gratified that the U.S. has not chosen to repeat the mistakes made overseas, and, instead, policymakers have proposed an extension of rules that already apply to traditional financial institutions dealing in cash.""

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $22,783 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.68% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $22,357-$23,261 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price steadied Friday, ranging around $22,400-$22,800 for most of the past 24 hours and was at $22,783 as of press time.      “Bitcoin continued its ascent, supply has decreased, bears are not particularly resisting and institutions are buying all the coins very quickly,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at investment firm Wave Financial.      Read More: Ruffer Investment Used Coinbase to Execute $745M Bitcoin Buy      “The $24,000 mark is not far off,” Kogan added. “There is a growing perception among analysts that the demand of institutional investors can overwhelm the supply of whales [large crypto holders] and miners, whose sales in the past have had a tangible impact on the market.”      Thursday was the highest-volume day in 2020 for the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20, with over $4.7 billion in volume. That day Coinbase led the way with $1.6 billion in volume, significant given Friday’s volume tally for the eight exchanges as of press time was only $1.7 billion.      The huge price jump has cleared many sell orders on exchanges as they were filled on the run-up, said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant firm Efficient Frontier. “On exchanges, sell-side liquidity is much thinner than buy-side liquidity because we are in uncharted territory,” Tu told CoinDesk. “The lack of liquidity on the sell side means that bitcoin's price can rise faster, as we've seen since it broke the $20,000 figure.”      However, inevitable exhaustion seems to have taken place Friday. “While there are some early signs of fatigue and profit-taking, what's notable is the record volumes,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin.      In the derivatives market, open interest and volume have surged on futures venue CME, well-known as an institutional tool for hedging out traditional commodities as well as bitcoin.      “Dec. 17 is registering as the highest volume day on CME, with open interest climbing at its highest,” noted Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      Read More: Deribit’s New Options Allow Bitcoin Traders to Bet on Rally to $100K      Excitement abounds to cap off a wild ride for bitcoin in 2020, though momentum may subside in the holiday weeks ahead, according to analysts.      “I’m feeling very bullish although there is only so fast we can go up before we see a correction,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quant trading firm Global Digital Assets. “It will be exciting to see what happens now that we are in price discovery mode and the mainstream media is starting to take notice once again.”    Just five protocols have $10 billion locked in DeFi    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was up Friday, trading around $648 and climbing 1.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Five brand-name protocols – stablecoin Maker, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), lenders Compound and Aave along with decentralized exchange Uniswap – make up $10.5 billion of decentralized finance's (DeFi) $16 billion total locked, according to DeFi Pulse.      George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, says the growth in DeFi value locked is highly correlated with the rise in crypto prices in general.      “The increase in total value locked (TVL) is from the appreciation of crypto versus [the U.S. dollar]. Deposits are hanging around, not increasing,” Clayton told CoinDesk. However, he’s bullish on DeFi, particularly if some scaling growth pains can be resolved. “I expect these numbers to grow, especially if ETH 1.5 can scale, or if these DeFi platforms can port to the likes of Cardano or AVAX or Solana.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Friday, mostly red.

42405601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWOG,1608325547,On-Chain Data Suggests More Institutions Are Buying Bitcoin Over the Counter,"Despite bitcoin trading near all-time highs, more institutions continue to buy bitcoin, and they’re using over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms to keep their purchases from impacting the overall market.      Unlike retail investors or smaller institutions that use crypto exchanges, large institutions usually trade bitcoin through the OTC market, noted John Todaro, director of institutional research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock. That way, their transactions won’t move prices the way they would had the investors used even the largest centralized exchanges.      One reason that’s the case is OTC transactions are also much more opaque compared with trades on exchanges. Without transparent data on OTC transactions, it is difficult to track or gauge this side of the crypto market.      However, three different metrics monitored by blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant provide an idea of what’s happening in the crypto OTC market and could give clues that in the coming weeks and months, more large institutions may come out to disclose their bitcoin positions.      When a massive bitcoin outflow takes place on Coinbase Pro, it tends to go to Coinbase’s own cold wallets for custody that hold 6,000-8,000 BTC, according to Ki Young Jun, chief executive of CryptoQuant.      “We only know it’s not going to hot wallets [because] we have their address labels,” Ki added. “Exchange users withdrawals can happen, but I would say 99% of big single transactions over 5,000 bitcoin are either internal transfers or going to custody wallets.”      For example, a closer look at the spike in bitcoin outflow that took place on Dec. 12 shows that between 8,000 and 15,000 BTC were moved out of Coinbase Pro to other cold wallets, an implication of OTC deals, Ki said.      Coinbase Custody is directly integrated with Coinbase’s OTC desk, meaning that its clients can leverage the OTC desk without having to move funds out of cold storage.      Read More: Coinbase Completes First OTC Crypto Trade Directly From ‘Cold’ Storage      Both MicroStrategy and British investment firm Ruffer have revealed that their purchases of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin were facilitated by Coinbase.      Read More: Ruffer Investment Used Coinbase to Execute $745M Bitcoin Buy      Another metric, the fund flow ratio for all exchanges, has gone down since the market sell-off in March. This is the ratio of network transaction volume of exchanges compared to the entire cryptocurrency transferred on the network. A lower number means fewer transactions that are done on exchanges and are instead conducted outside exchanges such as over-the-counter.      Notably, the last time the fund flow ratio was at the current level (approximately 5%) was when major crypto exchanges launched their OTC desks in early 2019.      Read More: Bittrex Launches OTC Trading Desk With 200 Cryptocurrencies      The third metric, the total amount of bitcoin transferred on the blockchain, has continued growing. This, coupled with the decreased fund flow ratio, indicates that potential massive OTC deals from the likes of institutions are “ongoing,” Ki said.      “What we’re seeing is an entire class of investors who are new to the crypto market and want to establish positions,” Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told CoinDesk. “They are not so much buying the dip as simply buying, consistently and over time.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/18/on-chain-data-suggests-more-institutions-are-buying-bitcoin-over-the-counter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbe12ed368a289b4f548fddb351cddc6a99da336-1500x914.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedW7X,1608322526,Coinbase Going Public Could Let the SEC Dictate Which Tokens Get Listed,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might soon be able to dictate precisely which tokens a (specific) crypto exchange can list.      San Francisco-based Coinbase announced Thursday that it had filed a confidential S-1, an initial step to listing its shares on a national stock exchange, while Stockholm-based Safello announced its intent to file one on Friday. Going public would subject exchanges to closer regulatory scrutiny from the SEC.      Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo LLP, told CoinDesk that there are few federal laws around corporate governance. What shareholders approve and what a company’s board can approve are typically defined by state law. However, the SEC has been using its power to approve registration statements to try and enforce its will on public or soon-to-be-public entities, he said.      For example, the SEC could force a company to break down details of a potential merger into multiple votes instead of having shareholders and directors vote just on the overall merger proposal.      “They’ve been monkeying with governance rules like this at the federal level even though there’s no federal laws around this,” he said.      Something similar could happen to crypto companies trying to list on stock exchanges within the U.S.      Read more: Coinbase, With Bitcoin Soaring, Files in Preparation for Landmark Public Offering      For example, the SEC could say that crypto trading platforms need clearer procedures for how they list or delist different cryptocurrencies.      “'We don’t think you have a clear enough procedure for making sure the tokens that you list are not securities and we think you should adopt the same rules we use for determining whether a token is a security, and not list the ones that are securities,'” is something the SEC could hypothetically say, Shapiro told CoinDesk.      While it’s unlikely, the SEC could even require exchanges to delist certain tokens in this manner before deeming the S-1 forms effective.      Joel Telpner, a partner at Sullivan & Worcester, told CoinDesk that it is entirely possible the SEC might ask companies like Coinbase seeking to go public to answer certain questions about their operations.      “When you apply for a registration, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to go forward,” he said. “Theoretically the SEC could raise a number of questions about certain things that would require them to potentially make some changes in how they do things. That is always a possibility.”    Raising attention    Confidential S-1s are kept a secret until three weeks before the issuing party goes on its roadshow, which is a public relations push where the entity going public tries to sell its value to potential investors.      Oftentimes, the companies filing don’t reveal the existence of a confidential S-1 until that three-week period. Snapchat, for example, reportedly filed its S-1 in secret months before going public in March 2017.      Given that context, Coinbase’s decision to announce it had filed what is essentially a secretive document may seem strange. However, it could be that while it’s not quite ready to go public just yet, Coinbase is looking to take advantage of a recent boom in initial public offerings, as well as bitcoin’s recent price rise past $23,000.      The present moment is a good time for companies to go public, said Telpner. A number of companies outside the crypto space have already announced plans or gone public in recent weeks.      “IPOs are hot again,” Shapiro said. “This is a fantastic time to IPO, so they probably want people to know about it, they want people to buy it. The headlines are about BTC so it’s great timing.”      Read more: Ruffer Investment Used Coinbase to Execute $745M Bitcoin Buy      Coinbase may also have announced that it had filed the confidential S-1 with the SEC to get ahead of any possible leak of the document’s existence, Telpner said.      Companies that go public must file various statements to the SEC and its investors, which could make the public more comfortable with how those firms are operating, he said.      After WeWork filed, “the SEC said, ‘Uh, there are all these insider transactions, you’ve got to disclose those,’” Shapiro said. He added that he has no reason to believe this new IPO has similar issues, but “we’re going to find out a lot more about Coinbase.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/18/coinbase-going-public-could-let-the-sec-dictate-which-tokens-get-listed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7d105900642a50fda0c98b5284337473cc44afb-1216x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 20-year-old rapper appears to be following the Lil Yachty crypto playbook: a token sale on Fyooz and a subsequent non-fungible token (NFT) auction on the Winklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway.      Lil Pump, whose real name is Gazzy Garcia, is banking on his 25 million social media followers to take ownership of a “PumpCoin,” which, similar to a recent string of experiments with social tokens, will give fans exclusive access to the Colombian-American singer. According to the Fyooz site, ""PumpCoin token holders will have an opportunity to play Call of Duty or NBA 2k21 live and 1:1 with Lil Pump.""      “There has never been a greater need for artists and fans to find a new way of engaging given the lack of industry events from COVID-related shutdowns,” Remo Prinz, co-founder of the Zurich-based Fyooz, said in a statement. “Social tokens are a way for artists and other personalities to potentially monetize fan engagement.” Fyooz token sales are not open to U.S. investors.      The YachtyCoin sale last week raised at least $276,000 for the Atlanta-born rapper. Lil Yachty’s digital collectible sold for $16,050 this week to Bill Lee, a general partner at early-stage VC firm Craft Ventures, who sniped the NFT from “bitcoin billionaire” Tyler Winklevoss at the last minute.

42433377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQOTh,1608313488,"Blockchain Bites: The Fight for Private, Digital Cash","Hey, what a week. Coinbase sent a signal of its intent to go public. Block.one revealed it has more than its purported 140,000 BTC war chest. And bitcoin is still above $20,000 – everyday adding a new notch to its longest streak.      Crypto experts FinCEN is hiring two policy officers to help draft regulations related to the “threats” posed by the cryptocurrency space, advise financial institutions and collaborate across government and the private sector on crypto policy. Earlier this month, rumors swirled that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would rush out self-hosted wallet regulations many think would harm the crypto industry. The Block reported this may require crypto companies file a “currency transaction report” on crypto transactions over $10,000 involving a self-hosted crypto wallet. (More on this below.)      Coinbase IPO Coinbase filed preliminary paperwork to go public, beginning the long road to what could be the first major Bitcoin company trading on U.S. stock exchanges. This summer, rumors swirled that the firm, last valued at $8 billion, would pursue a “direct listing” rather than the bank-heavy traditional route of an initial public offering – though Thursday’s “confidential” filing offers few clues. Messari estimates the firm could fetch $28 billion on the open market.      State of the chain? Compound Labs released a white paper Thursday detailing its plans to create Compound Chain, an application-specific blockchain that can provide money market services across multiple networks. The DeFi protocol is looking to beat Ethereum’s high gas costs, lack of chain interoperability and other technical challenges – though there’s no timeline for launch. Perhaps most important, it’s looking to target the nascent field of central bank digital currencies.    Quick bites  NIC CARTER: Takes on the controversial STABLE Act, saying nationalizing stablecoins won’t improve financial access. (CoinDesk)  AFTER $20K? Bitcoin’s price is cool, but its technology is radical. (CoinDesk)  DAOIST RECAP: The good, the bad and the DAOs only a founder could love in 2020. (CoinDesk)  DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES: FC Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué invested $4.3 million in the non-fungible token (NFT) site Sorare. (CoinDesk)  At stake    Digital cash Two weeks ago, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong threw the crypto community into a tizzy when he spoke of rumors of a potential Treasury Department measure meant to introduce oversight of “self-hosted wallets.” The term wasn’t exactly well-known (Armstrong even included a rough definition in his late-night tweet thread) but the possible repercussions were immediately intuited. The markets – then on a month-long climb – faltered.      Self-hosted crypto wallets are a key part of blockchain technology, and what many crypto purists would call the only acceptable way to store your coin. Also known as non-custodial wallets or self-custody wallets, they allow users to interact with a blockchain network and store crypto without relying on a “third-party financial institution,” to use Amstrong’s term. (""Unhosted"" was coined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [FinCEN] in 2019, to compare to wallets hosted by intermediaries.)      “This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet,” Armstrong tweeted at the time.      It was a broad understanding of what could have broad, irreparable harm for a young industry. Everything from hard wallets to open finance (DeFi) protocols could conceivably be affected. “It would force corporations to know every counterparty to their users’ crypto transactions, keeping logs, tracking movements and verifying identities even before a transfer could take place,” my colleagues Danny Nelson and Sebastian Sinclair wrote.      Last night, The Block gave a peek under the hood to the still murky regulation. According to an anonymous source, Treasury’s Steven Mnuchin is looking to implement a transaction reporting rule for money services businesses (MSBs) that interact with unhosted crypto wallets. The fine details, like if there is a transaction reporting level, are unknown.      Also still dark: When such a regulation might go into effect – from today on, reportedly – and whether there will be a period for public comment. What’s important to note is the rule doesn’t seem to be an outright ban on unhosted wallets.      These so-called currency transaction reports (CTR) institutions may be required to file are a way to bring the type of guidance and oversight to blockchains as had existed in much of the traditional financial system. But many argue it goes a step too far. For years, most oversight of crypto came in the form of on-ramps, such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements at exchanges. Though the FinCEN has pushed forward a “travel rule” adopted by most jurisdictions that introduces reporting requirements for “virtual asset services providers” (VASPs).      As such, whatever regulation the Treasury may hand down is part of a greater trend towards financial oversight. As CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported, blockchain analytics companies have long flagged funds moving to and from private crypto wallets. Now, self-custody is “the next fault line for crypto regulations,” he said.      “Policymakers fear that full maturity of these decentralized protocols could foreshadow a future without financial intermediaries, which would significantly inhibit law enforcement’s ability to identify, prosecute and otherwise disrupt illicit financial networks in an environment when the effectiveness of these tools is already being challenged,” Head of Risk, Compliance and Regulatory Policy at cLabs Jai Ramaswamy wrote for Coin Center.      What’s troubling, however, is these new rules are introducing an unprecedented level of oversight over our financial lives, the argument goes. As the Blockchain Association points out, in enabling peer-to-peer transactions, self-hosted wallets are a necessary tool in maintaining a digital equivalent of cash. Cash has no identity requirements. Cash is also used by nefarious actors. But allowing people to engage in commerce and exchange freely is a net benefit for society.      In treating all digital commerce as suspect, or “high risk,” is unnecessary and misguided the Blockchain Association argues.      “The issue at hand is nuanced, the potential implications are far-reaching, and numerous valid but sometimes competing interests, such as empowering law enforcement while protecting citizens’ fundamental rights, must be considered and balanced,” the association writes.

In a recent portfolio update, Ruffer alluded to the involvement of the “world’s largest custodian of digital assets” without naming names. “Access to the bitcoin is controlled by multi-layer security protocols,” Ruffer wrote of its cold-storage setup. A second source confirmed to CoinDesk that Coinbase was the custodian described in Ruffer’s portfolio update. Coinbase Custody announced last month it was storing over $20 billion in customer assets.      The revelation sheds light on how large investors are entering the bitcoin market: namely through trusted partners. Big bets in recent weeks by everyone from MassMutual to Guggenheim are seen as the driving force behind bitcoin’s current price rally. (MassMutual went with NYDIG for its $100 million bitcoin buy.)      As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, Ruffer invested 2.5% of its $27 billion portfolio into bitcoin in November. The following day, One River Digital, a crypto-focused offshoot of volatility hedge fund One River Asset Management, came out of stealth, proclaiming it had already brokered $600 million in bitcoin and ether for its institutional clients.      Coinbase confirmed on Wednesday it was conducting trade execution and crypto custody for One River Digital. It declined to comment for this story.      One River Digital did not respond to a request for comment.    Coinbase clout    The Ruffer revelation shows just how far San Francisco’s Coinbase is reaching into the world of fund management.      Earlier this month, it revealed itself as the “primary execution partner” for MicroStrategy’s $425 million bitcoin purchase in the fall. A case study published by Coinbase explained how the firm pulls off market-swamping allocations without alerting traders.      Coinbase is now readying itself for a Wall Street debut. On Thursday, as bitcoin continued to race past its $20,000 ceiling into new all-time highs, the exchange announced it had confidentially filed for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators.    Ruffer’s bitcoin philosophy    Meanwhile, Ruffer explained in its portfolio update that macroeconomic factors guided the manager’s bitcoin bet.      “The current macroeconomic environment is set up perfectly for an asset that blends the benefits of technology and gold,” Ruffer said, adding:    “Negative interest rates, extreme monetary policy, ballooning public debt, dissatisfaction with governments – all provide powerful tailwinds for bitcoin at a time when conventional safe-haven assets, particularly government bonds, are perilously expensive.”    Ruffer said bitcoin has grown to meet this moment.      “Since 2017, billions of dollars have been invested in the infrastructure needed to support this wave of bitcoin adoption; many of the impediments to institutional investors have been dismantled.”      Ruffer’s analysis was clear: the institutions are here with more on the way; the cypherpunks are fading fast. Wrote the $27 billion mega-manager:    “[Bitcoin] seems set to move from being loved by the anti-establishment to being embraced by the dominant interests of the establishment.”    Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42433376,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQOXh,1608310660,"Money Reimagined: Your Data, Our Humanity","“For the first time in history, privacy and personhood are both mediated digitally … [I]t’s really hard to be a person without being digital, without exchanging data, without passing data.”      So says tech ethnographer Tricia Wang, the co-founder of Sudden Compass, which works on bringing human insights to big data analytics.      The comment reminds us of what’s at stake as we debate the data-monopolizing power of the internet’s biggest companies: the future of what it means to be human.      For the first time since the “Internet 2.0” era began at the turn of the millennium, the dominant social media, search and e-commerce platforms are facing existential challenges. The disruption could come from legal efforts as anti-monopoly lawsuits evolve in both the U.S. and Europe. Or it could come via some nascent alternatives to the platforms’ centralized model, including from blockchain-inspired startups.      Wang, who joined us on this week’s episode of the “Money Reimagined” podcast, says these responses won’t lead to a meaningful alternative until we gain a better appreciation of the role data plays in our internet interactions. Data, she says, “is not just information. Data is relationships.”      The algorithms of Google, Facebook, Amazon and others place the greatest value not in static, simple information points like your name, address and income, but data that reveals your relationships with other people. Their commercial interest in that data creates real tension because, as Wang notes, the story of our social connections is the story of who we are as human beings.      It’s why the “if you don’t like Facebook, just leave” idea is so naive. All over the world, services like Facebook and WhatsApp are must-have tools. They’re how people find jobs, build businesses and stay in touch with their families. People simply can’t just get up and leave.      Yet, those same people are caught in a dependency and have almost zero visibility on how their data is used. It creates an unbalanced economic relationship Wang compares to the idea of the 20th century “company town,” where employees were housed and fed by their employer but had no idea of the real value of their labor.      The “own your data” movement led by people such as Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Brittany Kaiser is no silver bullet either. Once it’s disaggregated from all those connections and human networks, your data alone is not worth very much. A Financial Times calculator put a person’s basic data at a price of less than a dollar.      Nonetheless, it’s vital to educate ourselves on how we, the people, give up so much in the current relationship.      The imbalance is not just that ad dollars flow to Facebook and Google rather than to the users who generate the content and build the audiences the platforms and their advertisers monetize. It’s that, as detailed in Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are trapped in an ever-tightening feedback loop in which these companies use our data to modify our behavior. There’s a scary Matrix-like aspect to all this.      It’s why the other guest on this week’s podcast, metaMe CEO Dele Atanda, views his company’s work building a more decentralized, blockchain-powered data marketplace as an exercise in protecting people’s human rights. Creating that marketplace and figuring out a meaningful expression of the value of people’s data is how we will ultimately restore agency over our digital lives, he says.      “We need to create a unit of account that we can measure – not just on the basis of size [as bytes] but on the basis of sensitivity, identifiability. These issues are central to how this information can be used to help or harm us,” he said.      Also important, Atanda says, is the governance structure of the database storing the information, which speaks to the potential role for blockchain technology. The more “permissionless” and decentralized the architecture behind the data marketplace, the more confident individuals can be that they retain ultimate rights to their data.      All of this seems pertinent in a week in which society was once again found vulnerable to data failures at centralized systems.      Google’s servers went down, creating problems for home devices plugged into its network. A hack of a software company SolarWinds compromised numerous U.S. government agencies data. Also, allegations of irregularities of Michigan-based voting machines in last month’s U.S. presidential election helped to further erode trust in the overall electoral system, even though supporters of President Donald Trump failed to substantiate an actual conspiracy in favor of his victorious opponent, Joe Biden.      The reason decentralization is worth considering as a potential solution in all these situations is not because it makes things more efficient. Most often, decentralization makes processes more inefficient. (Note also that Google’s systems run remarkably well the bulk of the time.) It’s that we must restore people’s power over their lives, whether it’s in confidently knowing their votes are being accurately counted or that their data is not being sold to and manipulated by the highest bidder.      Decentralized solutions such as blockchains are expensive and complicated. They are definitely not a panacea for the world’s ills.      But they do deserve consideration. Humanity is at stake.    Breaking resistance    With bitcoin’s spectacular mid-week rally, we were reminded that big round numbers matter to markets. There’s nothing innately special about the $20,000 level, but the price action before and after bitcoin broke above it suggests plenty of people did invest some significance into that number.      On two separate occasions earlier in the month, bitcoin made a run at the $20,000 level but failed. The second was when it set a new all-time high of $19,920 on Dec. 1, putting an end to the high set during the last big rally at the end of 2017. It seems investors had left loads of sell orders just below $20,000 and some may have been there for at least three years. Every time buyers pushed it higher, those orders kicked in to prevent a higher move.      But look what happened when those sell orders were eventually exhausted. Once buyers had pushed bitcoin’s price through the $20K mark, all that resistance disappeared. A mere 24 hours later it had jumped a whopping $4,000. No doubt sell orders are being placed at levels somewhere up above, but for now bitcoin feels quite unencumbered.    Global town hall    WHEN THE BILL COMES DUE. When I read about a new study authored by Mario Draghi and Raghuram Rajan on behalf of the Group of 30 Consultative Group predicting a post-COVID “solvency crisis,” my first reaction was, “Finally, the powerful are speaking with honesty on the unsustainable stimulus debts governments are racking up.” My second reaction was, “Oh, yeah, Draghi (former president of the European Central Bank) and Rajan (former governor of the Reserve Bank of India), are no longer in positions of real power.”      The details of the report are illuminating. They make clearer the distinction between the kind of eminent person role Draghi and Rajan now occupy and the significant authority they previously held. As Bloomberg’s Paul Gordon writes, “The report acknowledges that its recommendations require ‘hard choices’ – such as winding down broad aid programs and limiting government support to areas where the market is failing – that could cause a political backlash.”      For the last decade, central bankers have been the biggest conduits of “broad aid programs” in the broadest form of all: monetary expansion, even as they called on governments to relieve them of that stimulus responsibility by taking on the more politically challenging exercise of fiscal stimulus. In office, they are circumspect about that criticism. Out of office, they can be more direct.      The biggest takeaway from this report is concern. In an understandable effort to stave off economic ruin, governments have gone heavily into debt and allowed monetary expansion efforts to pump up financial assets, which has maintained the illusion of balance inside financial institutions’ and corporations’ accounts. The price for all this will need to be paid and it will probably be paid by further deprecation in the value of fiat currencies against other assets. It’s the backdrop to the “why bitcoin matters” thesis now being voiced by big shot investors like Guggenheim Partners’ chief investment officer Scott Minerd, who on Wednesday pronounced that bitcoin should be worth $400,000.      TWO REALITIES. As bitcoin soars and as U.S. stocks continue marching into new record-high territory, the reality is very different from anyone without access to those kinds of assets. As observed by the folks at Upfina, a refreshingly frank economic commentary site, while hedge fund managers and bitcoin HODLers have gotten fabulously rich, 8 million Americans have slipped into poverty since June. In noting that “the main problem is it is expensive to be poor,” Upfina drills down into why the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing efforts – buying $120 billion in bonds a month – is helping a privileged class of Americans but doing close to nothing to help the suffering of so many more in this pandemic. It’s hard not believe that a major reckoning with monetary policymaking is coming.    Relevant reads    Coinbase, With Bitcoin Soaring, Files in Preparation for Landmark Public Offering.

42433374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQORh,1608303612,Akon: Crypto Can Give Africa Financial Freedom,"Africa is waking up. For many years, the potential of the continent’s youth has been growing. Now, as this talent pool blooms across Africa, the world is starting to take note. Combined with the revolutionary power blockchain provides, we are entering a golden age of African development.      With 226 million people aged between 15-24, Africa has the youngest population in the world and, by 2045, the African workforce is predicted to be the world’s largest, giving the continent an enviable and deep spread of talent which is soon set to be thrust onto the world stage.    This post is part of CoinDesk's Year in Review 2020 – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Akon is the co-founder of the Akoin initiative, Jon Karas is president and co-founder of Akoin and Lynn Liss is chief operating officer and co-founder of Akoin.    To this generation of young, up-and-coming entrepreneurs, the idea of having to rely on systems of finance, government and technology built on the crumbling edifice of tradition belongs with the dinosaurs. They want to build their own destinies and future relying on their own skill and resources.      The growth of crypto on the continent means they have the opportunity to do just that. Research from Arcane found that Google Trend data showed African countries repeatedly rank in the top 10 on searches for the term ""cryptocurrency.""      In sub-Saharan Africa alone, there are about 350 million unbanked adults, which accounts for 17% of the global unbanked population of two billion people.      For many Africans, being able to transact on an immutable, censorship-resistant and permissionless blockchain that cannot be affected by the hyperinflation often seen in African economies, is the first step towards achieving self-sovereignty over their finances.      Through blockchain people are able to build and access systems not previously available to them, for example micro lending platforms that can help new businesses to establish themselves.      The technology also has the potential to solve real-world practical issues such as identity management and land titling. Indeed the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) wrote in its G20 submission on digital identity:    This technology is being trialed for various financial sector applications including funds transfers, payment settlement and regulatory oversight, and due to its decentralized and transparent nature also increasingly in identity management as well. The immutable nature of the ledger ensures that dispute resolution is embedded and enforced by computer protocol. Moreover, the transparency, resilience and replication at each node offered by the shared ledger is a useful tool for tracking and maintaining the integrity of the information.    Blockchain technology can give those who are unbanked access to services that may have been unavailable to them. For example, through a decentralized app marketplace built on blockchain people will have access to new ways to save money, pay bills and other people, request loans, sell their own goods and services, and build their own tools to serve other niches in their community.      Rather than their finances being at risk of fluctuations in a hyper-inflated fiat currency, use of a stable digital asset means people can gain greater control of their finances and even complete custody over them, allowing them to opt out of a system that provides them with no benefits or security, into one that does.    Leading the charge  Africans innovating with mobile technology long before the West, for example making mobile phone minutes as currencyhttps://www.bitminutes.com/technology-advantages.php. This characteristic of taking leaps forward in technology is what will drive the growth and success of digital assets on the continent, and we believe as Africa leads in this area, the rest of the world will be watching closely to see the developments it makes.    See also: Love It or Hate It, Akon’s ‘Crypto Wakanda’ Is Coming      While western countries and the rest of the world wrestle at unpicking years of tradition, red tape and regulation to make digital assets fit, African countries – if their leaders choose – are able to embrace change and foster implementation much more quickly.      Africa is one of the only places in the world that can start from zero and really implement and utilize every single new development and invention that's existing today without breaking down existing infrastructure. When you look at all the major countries, from the United States to European countries to China, all of these nations are in a position where they can't conform as quickly to the latest technologies without having to rebuild everything that's already built, whereas African nations can start from the beginning and lead that charge forward.    Digital future    The future of finance lies in digital currency and digital transactions. You can see how many countries are working on developing digital versions of their currencies. It is only a matter of time before all transactions are digitized and paper money is consigned to the history books. The countries that grasp this reality before anyone else will be the ones at an advantage.    Blockchain and digital assets will act as a key to help unlock the potential of the huge talent pool in Africa    We believe the future of the world is going to be digital. It's going to all be computerized and moved in and controlled by apps and developers. Even with music, while everyone was selling CDs and and vinyl from little specialty shops and singles, I was more focused on ringtones, which was the digital aspect of the music business.    Music    It has happened in the music industry with the evolution from vinyl to cassette tapes to CDs and now to digital music. And it will happen with money, too.      Africa is already at the point where mobile phones and mobile phone minutes are used for transactions, it is only a few steps away from moving into an economy based on cryptocurrencies, instead of ageing and devalued fiat.      This is why we are getting in front of the curve now and embracing what we believe is going to represent the dominant model young business leaders and entrepreneurs in Africa, and eventually, the whole continent embrace.      It represents a method for them to create and earn value determined by themselves and which doesn’t rely on an outdated system powered by a countries fiat currency over which Africans have no control.    Growth    We have more than 1.34 billion people in Africa, and within the next five years it will be close to two billion people. The working population is booming and the youth population is expected to grow by more than 40% in the next 10 years. We want Africans who have amazing entrepreneurial ideas to finesse these into something tangible they are able to create a service from and grow their own businesses, but also help their regions to grow, too.      Unfortunately, often the perception of Africa from those living outside it is of a scary and dangerous place. For example, the way they depict Africa in the United States is just so sad because it makes it unattractive and plays on all of its problems, without touching on the positives.      I really want to change that perception and get people seeing it as a viable place to vacation, work and do business.

42423990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j43h,1608303156,First Mover: Bitcoin Rally Stalls as 'DeFi Summer' Proves Endless,"Bitcoin (BTC) was little changed after climbing for six straight days, though prices appeared unable to hold fresh highs above $23,000.  ""The market has paused for a bit to consolidate,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, told First Mover in an email. ""This is normal behavior after major surges as market participants take profits and await the next big move up or down.""  In traditional markets, European stocks fluctuated as Brexit talks stalled. U.S. stock futures were steady as lawmakers worked to complete a pandemic-relief deal. Gold weakened 0.3% to $1,880 an ounce.  Market Moves  (Editor’s note: This is the fifth installment of First Mover’s recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of 2020 and what it means for the future. Today we cover the period from June through September, when an explosion in innovation in the fast-growing cryptocurrency subsector of decentralized finance, or DeFi, diverted eyeballs – and capital – away from bitcoin.)  At the end of May, bitcoin prices were sitting on a 35% year-to-date gain, following a series of wild market gyrations during an undeniably tumultuous and horrific year. With the coronavirus-racked U.S. economy suffering its worst contraction since the Great Depression, not even the bulls were in a mind to complain; the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks was down more than 6%.  But then, suddenly, the bitcoin market went cold. And that's when the summer of DeFi began.  Decentralized finance (“DeFi”) is a subsector of the digital-asset industry where entrepreneurs are building semi-autonomous lending and trading systems atop decentralized networks, primarily the Ethereum blockchain. The goal is to create alternatives to the big banks and trading firms that are centrally managed by human executives and boards of directors in places like New York, London and Tokyo. The idea is that the distributed, computer-based versions of crucial financial-system infrastructure should be fairer and more efficient to use than their old-world counterparts.  The first sign of the DeFi frenzy arrived in mid-June, when the autonomous lending platform Compound, started in 2017, released its proprietary COMP tokens for public trading in digital-asset markets. At the time, users had socked some $163 million of collateral into the project in exchange for loans. But what got everyone's attention was a flurry of trading in the tokens that suddenly gave Compound a market capitalization of nearly $785 million.  Compound’s outsized market cap, relative to the total value locked in the protocol, “may signal the rally went too far,” The Defiant, a newsletter tracking the DeFi sector, wrote on June 16.  Even Compound's 35-year-old founder, Robert Leshner, acknowledged the hysteria: “Because the asset was so new, there was a bit of a speculative fervor,” Leshner told CoinDesk in an interview.  It was just the beginning. Two days later, according to the website DeFi Market Cap, the project's value had reached $2 billion – twice the amount that venture-capital investors consider the threshold for a ""unicorn,"" a privately held startup with a value of at least $1 billion.  “DeFi is hitting its stride and the space will continue to accelerate,” the research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a report.  And bitcoin? Suddenly an afterthought.  “It’s surprising to see bitcoin be so boring given everything happening both within and outside the crypto industry,” the digital-asset analysis firm Messari wrote in its daily email to subscribers.  In mid-July Messari published a chart showing the Ethereum blockchain's daily settlement value surging to about $2.5 billion, surpassing Bitcoin's.  Suddenly prices were soaring for not just ether, the Ethereum blockchain's native cryptocurrency, but for a veritable parade of tokens associated with hitherto little-known DeFi projects like Aave, Chainlink, Curve and good-luck-explaining-this-to-your-friends outliers like Yam and Spaghetti.  Traditional investment analysts and Wall Street Journal columnists were now asserting matter of factly that U.S. stocks were merely being propped up by the Federal Reserve's $3 trillion of money printing. So the DeFi explosion raised the question among crypto-industry analysts who began wondering whether digital-asset markets had become the new home of capitalism.  “Every derivatives trader that was looking for incremental yield and levered returns has been besotted by the magnitude of moves in DeFi,” Viashl Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk at the time. “So, naturally, cost of capital dictates at least some attention that way.”  Big cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance started rolling out DeFi-related offerings to supplement their bitcoin-denominated trading operations. Yearn.finance, a just-invented protocol designed to steer users toward the highest-yielding DeFi projects, saw prices for its YFI token jump eightfold in August alone.  The headlines just kept getting zanier and more incomprehensible, and even old crypto pros could barely keep up. A decentralized project called SushiSwap mounted what was described as a ""vampire mining attack"" to suck some $800 million of liquidity from another decentralized trading protocol called Uniswap, as reported at the time by CoinDesk's Brady Dale.  Weeks later, Uniswap made a surprise delivery of its UNI tokens to anyone who had ever used the platform, worth at least $1,200 in market value – prompting some witty commentators to call it “stimulus for Ethereum users,” since it was the same amount as the coronavirus aid checks mailed out earlier in the year by the U.S. Treasury Department. Seemingly out of nowhere, and without the usual hype and press coverage that comes with a big initial public stock offering, Uniswap had a $5 billion valuation.  Among digital-asset traders, bitcoin looked to be on the defensive, described as a ""pet rock"" because so little of the fast-paced DeFi development was taking place on its blockchain. Some bitcoin traders started converting their holdings into freshly minted digital tokens so that the ""tokenized"" versions of the cryptocurrency could be deposited on DeFi protocols in exchange for juicy interest rates.  Yet, in hindsight, the summer of DeFi galvanized bitcoin's appeal on a variety of fronts.  For one, it reinforced the reality that while bitcoin was the oldest and biggest cryptocurrency, it was hardly the most interesting. The digital asset industry and market infrastructure had matured to the point that the competition looked genuine; rival projects were proving capable of fast-paced innovation, disruption and growth.  ""In 2020, DeFi put in place the building blocks for an entirely new financial system: payments, lending, asset issuance, and exchange,"" Messari's Ryan Selkis wrote on Dec. 15.  The bullish twist was that bitcoin, as the first purchase for many cryptocurrency buyers, might be the gateway to a far-more lucrative industry than previously imagined.  The DeFi frenzy also sharpened many investors' focus on what might be bitcoin's most-compelling use case – as a tool for hedging against central bank money printing.  As the rest of the year would demonstrate, that ""digital gold"" narrative would prove enticing enough to big Wall Street firms and money managers to send bitcoin prices to a new all-time high. A pet rock, but apparently pretty cute.  - Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin watch  Bitcoin was consolidating in the range of $22,300 to $21,500 on Friday. Bulls look to be taking a hiatus, having engineered a rally of more than $4,500 to a record price of $23,370 in the past two days.  The recent rally above $20,000 is accompanied by an increase in bitcoin ""whales"" – large investors with an ability to influence market trends.  As of Thursday, the population of whale entities – clusters of addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – was 2,001, the highest on record, according to data source Glassnode. The previous lifetime high of 1,992 was recorded on Dec. 4.  The number of whale entities has gone up by 16% this year, while bitcoin's price has rallied by 220%.  The data validates the popular argument that increased participation by big investors has propelled bitcoin higher. High-net-worth individuals are increasingly considering bitcoin a hedge against inflation, according to Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and the author of ""The Bitcoin Forecast"" newsletter.  The rally looks sustainable as it is backed by strong hands. There seems to be a consensus in the market that 2021 could bring more significant gains.

In a direct message with CoinDesk, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said his team has plans to offer Coinbase futures once it gains clarity from regulators, which is not assured.      FTX is currently in discussions with Munich-based financial firm CM-Equity to gain regulatory clarity from non-U.S. authorities on if or how the market could launch. FTX first partnered with CM-Equity for compliance reasons when launching its tokenized stock spot and futures markets in October.      Bankman-Fried’s plans for Coinbase futures likely won’t surprise FTX users given the exchange’s large portfolio of other novel and rapidly launched markets, including presidential election prediction markets and bitcoin hashrate futures.      FTX also launched a pre-IPO market for Airbnb the day before the online vacation property marketplace’s Dec. 10 stock trading debut.      As with its other markets, however, FTX would prohibit U.S.-based traders from accessing Coinbase futures, if launched, even though the San Francisco-based exchange's trading debut is expected on an American stock market.      Without regulatory clarity, when Coinbase futures would launch is a wide open question.      Bankman-Fried said his team will probably launch the market as soon as they receive positive legal clarity.

Mizuho sees bitcoin not as a source of revenue itself, ""but as a vehicle to boost engagement on the app,"" and that could drive revenue growth, he said.  Further, as people start to use PayPal services more ""it's going to make PayPal more the center of their financial life,"" according to Dolev.  The same applies to Square (SQ), the Jack Dorsey-led payments firm that offers bitcoin buying and selling through its Cash App, he added.  Dolev predicted that in 2021 there will be an ""inflection point"" as more and more people start using these apps, and the ""trigger is bitcoin.""

An agreement announced Friday will see the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) at the Glasgow institution using Everledger's anti-tamper bottle tags and blockchain platform to track rare whiskies.  SUERC has been tasked with finding ways to authenticate whisky provenance by producers, retailers, auction houses and collectors.  The center's researchers estimate the market for vintage single-malt Scotch whiskies was valued at £57.7 million ($78 million) in 2018. SUERC believes that around 40% of all rare vintage whiskies in circulation may be fake.  In 2018, the center found that out of 55 bottles of rare Scotch it had tested, 21 bottles were either fake or not distilled in the year indicated on the label.  The researchers can tell the fake malt whisky samples from the genuine ones by removing small samples through the cork and interpreting the radiocarbon data in a laboratory.  ""By being granted unprecedented access to samples of the world’s rarest whiskies, its researchers have created a unique radiocarbon dating curve which is now used to determine the age of all types of vintage whiskies,"" the university said.  Everledger's NFC-enabled bottle caps and blockchain network are expected to help protect stakeholders along the commercial chain from counterfeit products.  “One aspect of the process that has eluded us is securing a permanent digital record of a whisky’s origin and age,” said Elaine Dunbar, research scientist at SUERC. ""We are therefore absolutely delighted to establish a partnership with Everledger [that] will provide a lasting seal and a digital record of the whisky and details of its radiocarbon analysis.""

42433375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQOVh,1608296404,"The Good, the Bad and the DAOs Only a Founder Could Love in 2020","Every year the industry optimistically announces that 2018 or 2019 or 2020 will be “the year of the DAO.” Just watch, any minute now someone will tell you that about 2021.      While, personally, my favorite theme is how DAOs (or decentralized autonomous organizations, a way to organize capital without a centralized corporate structure) fall short, when judged on their own promises and merits, in fact, we’ve seen lots of DAO action this year. And much of it is in the right direction. So let’s take a look at this year’s good, bad and ugly in the world of DAO.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Grace (Rebecca) Rachmany is the founder of DAO Leadership management training and is the co-author of ""So You’ve Got a DAO: Leadership for the 21st Century.""  The good: Use cases, new developments, better proposals  Real DAO use    The most positive development in the space is that DAO is being used for more than just random funding. While the technology is still far away from a full governance solution, the following use cases indicate that the range of applications is expanding beyond stablecoins and exchanges to include other DeFi apps and even some decentralized art collectives.      In terms of decentralized exchanges, dxDAO, Curve and Nectar all saw notable appreciation, while MakerDAO, mStable and Bancor continued to make their presence known in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). The launch of the LAO, a law focused DAO, had notable experiments with governance while Trojan DAO and Dada.art attempted to gain a foothold in the burgeoning crypto art scene.    New developments    Aragon is the only DAO technology platform to date that is anywhere close to developing its own self-governance. In fact, it’s the only one even talking about it. This is a huge step towards the vision of DAO tech, which is to provide truly self-governing distributed software.    Aragon has continued to demonstrate outstanding leadership in developing a portfolio of improvements, both in governance – moving into phase 3 to launch a full DAO for its own governance and updates to the Aragon Court Systemhttps://aragon.org/court – and technologically (OS Upgrade, ANT token upgrade, off-chain polling). The DAO Governance module was a particularly bold transition.    See also: DAO Platform Aragon Begins Recruiting Jurors for Tokenized ‘Court’      However, the Aragon Foundation has been a bottleneck in the proposals process. It found that the more time it invested in guiding and filtering proposals, the less time it had to develop the governance it wanted in the long term. With the approval of ANT holders in an open vote, phase 2 of governance was closed and on-chain governance is frozen until the release of the DAO Governance module, which should be some time in Q1 2021.      Meanwhile, the Hypha Earth DHO (Distributed Human Organization) became active in 2020, representing a break with the industry direction in defining what a DAO is. Hypha is built on the Telos network and is associated with the SEEDS cryptocurrency project.      The DHO is much more like a freelancing platform and is significantly more decentralized. The framework in Hypha is that teams within a project can define the work they want done, review and accept proposals for that work, hire people, hold money in escrow and pay upon the delivery of said work.      Given that this is how freelance platforms have been working for a decade, why reinvent the wheel? The Hypha team comes from the DigiLife collective and have thought deeply about the problem. Rather than copying from the existing DAOs, they’ve come up with an elegant solution that would circumvent complex configurations such as those faced with BrightIDs multi-tiered DAOs-within-a-DAO setup.    Pre-vote improvements    The concept of “anyone can propose anything” sounds fair, but the flaws are so deep that, this year, major DAO technologies have created additional layers beyond reputation and staking to combat potential issues.      Most notably is Holographic Consensus, which is a way to signal the best proposals to voters by having members stake tokens on the likelihood of a proposal’s passing. Unfortunately, there’s never been a direct correlation between the popularity of an idea and its quality. At the Genesis DAO, a popularity contest led to such a divisive culture that professional community organizers threw up their hands in despair.      In 2020, there’s been a wide-scale (though tacit) admission that just throwing proposals around isn’t the ideal form of democracy. The recent release of Cardano network’s Voltaire system recognizes the importance of maintaining and rewarding a panel of reviewers prior to the vote. The reviewers give a ranking to each proposal, so voters are still free to vote for any proposal, but the rankings reduce overwhelm and give voters a solid starting point.      See also: Cardano to Launch Hard Fork Before Next Major Development Phase      Another extremely welcome development with Voltaire is that Cardano is developing positive relationships with other chains and DAOs, taking advice from Dash, the longest-running and arguably most successful DAO in the industry. Setting the tone for collaborative relationships is a tremendous relief after the unspoken but visible tension among other DAO platforms that we’ve seen historically.      Given all of these advancements in the technology and its adoption, the outlook is optimistic for building on this success.    The Bad: The death of a colony    Ethereum transaction fees continue to be a major issue for distributed governance. Paying to vote, even if it’s a small amount, is anathema to any democratic process. DAOs may have multiple votes every quarter, or even daily votes. People simply can’t put up with significant transaction fees.      Under the weight of this issue, Colony has officially closed its alpha version while it upgrades to xDAI, and Ethereum sidechain. To be honest, this is worse news for Ethereum than for DAO technology itself. Colony recently announced it expects the new version to be out in early 2021. High transaction fees do speak to the fact that most of the active and successful DAOs, particularly on DAOstack, are in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Low transaction fees on Ethereum are too far away for any other apps to consider using decentralized apps (dapps) on Ethereum for other types of voting. It may be good news for smart contract interoperability, blockchains such as Cosmos and Cardano and for Ethereum virtual machine-based blockchains.    The Ugly: Lawsuits and active users  Lawsuits are ugly    Ironically, the one project with a court (Aragon) this year found itself resorting to the traditional legal system to resolve a conflict. It is with glee that I can officially avoid labelling this as ugly, because the project hashed it out itself. Everything was settled out of court, which again attests to the industry’s evolving maturity, but here’s the tweet in case you missed it.    Active users?    In a recent presentation about DAOs, a representative of DAOstack announced the goal of a DAO is to create a kind of organization that is so resilient it can be distributed around the globe and even the strongest national government in the world cannot destroy it.      He then went on to announce such an organization now exists and has 400 participants! It’s the dxDAO. It’s not even mildly ironic the speaker was speaking in Hebrew, the language of 12.5 million people who belong to an “organization” that has survived repeated annihilation attempts by the strongest governments of the world. Hey, this is the “ugly” section. You knew it was going to get ugly.    This technology isn’t yet being used the way it was intended  So, 445 participants. That sounds, um, well … small. It is, by the way, according to the information I could find through Scouthttps://scout.cool/aragon/mainnet, 10 times larger than the active DAOs running on Aragon, so, yes, it’s relatively large in terms of membership. It’s larger than NectarDAO (128 users), the result of one of the best DAO implementations to date by DeversiFy.    The ugly truth, unfortunately, is uglier. In researching the top DAOs on both DAOstack and Aragon, the actual number of users is lower – much, much lower. The largest number of votes on a proposal I found was 12 votes, which somehow represented 19% of the reputation in a DAO of 128 people. Most proposals passed with one or two votes. Yes, you could generally propose something and just pass it on your own. In dxDAO, BrightID and the other DAOs, voting turnout was similar.      So while on the surface the numbers look promising, a bit of scratching finds that somehow this technology isn’t yet being used the way it was intended.    And then there’s this...    ‘Nuff said.    Jury’s out    Not everything is good, bad or ugly yet. I’m still not completely sure what to make of Commons Stack, a team that started out talking about commons governance that now says it is working on token engineering infrastructure. It is trying out “praise” tokens that give weighted voting rights in a “conviction voting” system where they provide some kind of matching funding on Gitcoin grants.      Even though I have, and stake, these praise tokens, I can’t say I completely understand how it works. It’s an important project to mention in the context of distributed governance, but it’s not exactly a DAO and it’s not yet clear exactly where it’s headed.      See also: Jill Carlson – Experiments in Crypto’s Governance Lab      Commons Stack seems to have bottomless quantities of energy, good will and persistence, and it draws a fantastic crowd of intelligent and insightful people. The recent Commons Stack collaboration with the Token Engineering Commons has generated a tremendous amount of activity, with more than 160 people participating actively in one way or another.    DAOism    All in all, 2020 has been an amazing year for advances in DAO technology and there’s every reason to believe 2021 will be even better. While I remain skeptical about the potential of this technology to address the most pressing issues in governance today, when judged for what it is, DAO tech is making tremendous progress.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Grace Rebecca Rachmany,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/18/the-good-the-bad-and-the-daos-only-a-founder-could-love-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b739f67e010072e27d474de9c09464e4b210ca58-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQOPh,1608293207,Beyond ASICs: 3 Trends Driving Bitcoin Mining Innovation,"From the Bitcoin halving in May to the ongoing price rally today, bitcoin has certainly seen its fair share of ups and downs in 2020. Even as the price of bitcoin sets new highs above those of 2017, observers have remained cautious, fearing that this may very well be a bitcoin bubble 2.0. However, pointing to a maturing market where interest in digital assets is rising among institutional investors, Bitcoin advocates have argued that this rally is not just another speculative frenzy. With such renewed optimism, one can only hope that this time, history doesn't repeat itself.      At the same time, with miner revenues hitting pre-halving levels for the first time this November, much has changed since the genesis block came into being. No longer limited to a network of independent miners, we now see staggering operations at scale, in diverse jurisdictions stretching from lesser-known provinces in China to Kazakhstan and even Malaysia.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Nangeng “NG” Zhang is the founder, chairman and CEO of Canaan, a leading provider of supercomputing solutions.    Despite this growth, the burgeoning mining industry faces existential risks. And not only the ones related to the long-term sustainability of bitcoin mining after the last block is mined in 2140.    New year, new markets    With its inexpensive electricity, low production costs and readily available labor, China has long dominated the bitcoin mining sector. Yet, the center of gravity has started to shift in recent years, largely due to the emergence of mining pools in other parts of the world. Despite China still holding more than two-thirds of the global hashrate distribution countries such as the U.S., Russia and Kazakhstan are starting to catch up.      In order to carve out space and thrive in the bitcoin mining space, these new contenders need to consider a multitude of factors, namely: competitive energy prices or alternative energy sources, attractive real estate prices and a government supportive of digital assets.      Mining-friendly Kazakhstan, for instance, has seen significant growth in bitcoin mining activities, holding over 6.17% of the total bitcoin mining hashrate. This is in large part attributed to a tax-friendly government where crypto mining will not be taxed until the mined assets are exchanged for fiat money. Then there is the legalization of mining, which saw a recent bill approved by the Kazakh Senate and signed into law earlier in June. The low electricity costs only serve as icing on top.      This approach has certainly paid off, with investments in local crypto mining operations expected to double by the end of 2020 and an additional $738 million expected to pour in over the next three years.    China’s bitcoin mining crown will not be so easily displaced    As we look towards 2021, bitcoin mining will continue to move in a positive direction and see continued momentum. For two years now, markets across the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Europe and North America have grown. This trend is only going to be more prominent as miners look to new jurisdictions to avoid regulatory crackdowns while searching for lower-cost electricity.      In Europe and North America, plans for opening mining facilities may have been delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with the gradual recovery of the bitcoin market and the likelihood of a coronavirus vaccine in 2021, we may see a rebound in the demand for mining. The implications of a new Biden administration on the treatment of cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, still remain unclear.      Despite new markets looming on the horizon, China’s bitcoin mining crown will not be so easily displaced. The Chinese government has called to accelerate the development of blockchain technology and financial incentives to advance in renewable energy-powered crypto mining.    Technological innovation    Bitcoin mining has certainly come a long way since the early CPU days of Nakamoto’s genesis block. From initial innovations like GPUs and FPGAs to the birth of today’s ASICs, miners continue to seek out the fastest, most powerful and cost-efficient machines.      The current competitive state of bitcoin mining means that technological innovation needs to constantly keep up with the industry’s fast-growing demands. If not, miners will no longer be able to compete based on equipment, but instead, look elsewhere – whether it’s in alternative sources of energy or other forms of consensus protocols – to further establish a competitive edge and earn maximum profits.      Since the ASICs revolution, much of the technological progress in bitcoin mining has come from the reduction of chip sizes and higher hashrates to provide miners with greater efficiency gains. However, these improvements have been plateauing with each new iteration. And despite bitcoin mining being the ultimate manifestation of proof-of-work (PoW), questions over PoW’s long-term viability have been raised. Ethereum 2.0’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is arguably a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly model.      See also: Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?      When it comes to the next technological innovation, much has been said about the use of quantum computing. Touted as the next computing frontier, quantum tech may potentially crack Bitcoin’s security and effectively rendering Bitcoin’s cryptographic keys insecure. When this happens, a soft fork would be likely to occur, enabling the Bitcoin protocol to run on quantum-resistant algorithms and potentially even be operated by nodes that run on quantum computers.      However, it’s early days for quantum computing, and going into 2021 ASICs will still be the cornerstone of bitcoin mining. I believe bitcoin miners will be waiting another few years before the arrival of the next groundbreaking technology.    Sustainability not for sustainability’s sake    As mining machines get increasingly powerful, so, too, will energy consumption increase.      Regions like China’s Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia have historically been reliant on coal energy to provide crypto mining companies with lower energy prices. China is seeking to address pollution on a broader level, recently stating its ambitions for a “green revolution” to become carbon-neutral by 2060. This means that mining with non-renewable sources of energy such as coal will become increasingly cost-inefficient for China-based miners.      See also: Nic Carter – The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption      To further compound matters, bitcoin miners have traditionally relied on the cheap electricity powered by hydroelectric plants in the Sichuan province as their source of renewable energy. But when you consider that hydropower is only available during the wet season in China, six months of the year, it’s no surprise that bitcoin miners have cast their eyes to more innovative and sustainable sources of energy across novel jurisdictions for renewable or surplus energy.      As 2020 comes to a close, the future of bitcoin mining looks bright. Just as we recovered from the last bitcoin bubble popping, 2021 will see a brighter outlook as the fourth industrial revolution plays out.      In reimagining a mining ecosystem that is both sustainable and viable, we will do well to plan strategically for the long-term and not only consider short-term wins – whether it’s in tech or profitability – focusing instead on the complete integration of commercial, sustainability and environmental goals.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Nangeng Zhang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/18/beyond-asics-3-trends-driving-bitcoin-mining-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b529cc0a9027eab12c6234938ce0f7aaa9e69ddd-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Call and put options at the $100,000 strike price expiring on Sept. 24, 2021, went live on Deribit Thursday.      ""A few trades have taken place, as thus far 45 [call option] contracts have been traded,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk.      At press time, the $100,000 call option is holding a cumulative open interest of 29.4 contracts. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not liquidated via offsetting positions. The $100,000 put option is yet to register any activity.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy, and the put option gives the right to sell. On Deribit, one options contract represents the right to buy or sell one bitcoin.      Also read: Guggenheim CIO Says Bitcoin ‘Should Be Worth’ $400,000      Theoretically, the purchase of a $100,000 call is a bet that bitcoin will rise above that level on or before Sept. 24, 2021, making the option ""in-the-money"". Traders, who expect prices to more than quadruple over the next three quarters from the current price of $23,200, can express their bullish view via the $100,000 call.      Currently, that call option is, as traders say, deep out-of-the-money (that is, the spot price is well below the strike price) and trading at a relatively low price of 0.0475 BTC ($1,090 at press time). By comparison, the $24,000 call is trading at 0.2870 BTC ($6,588).      Traders often buy deep out-of-the-money calls during strong bull runs. That's because they are relatively cheap and gain significant value amid a continued rally in the spot market, helping buyers make big money on small investments.

Making the plea at the federal court in Worcester, Mass., Austin Nedved also acknowledged laundering the proceeds of such schemes via peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges, and other crimes.  In a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Massachusetts Attorney's Office said Nedved admitted running a business buying and selling cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, on LocalBitcoins.com and Paxful.com.  From around 2017 to 2019, he worked for romance and lottery scams targeting ""vulnerable victims.""  ""Despite knowing or being willfully blind to the fact that his customers were fraud victims, Nedved sold bitcoin to them so that they could send money overseas to the fraudsters,"" according to the release.  In romance schemes, victims are persuaded to send money abroad to individuals that purport to be romantic interests, while lottery schemes trick victims into thinking they can obtain lottery winnings or government grants by sending funds for administrative fees or expenses.  In one case, Nedved helped a 78-year-old victim send bitcoin to a fake marriage prospect going by the name “Jonathan G.” who said his oil business needed money amid a crisis.  On June 25, 2018, the victim met Nedved in a parking lot and gave him a cashier’s check to purchase around $100,000 in bitcoin. Days later, Nedved and a co-conspirator took another $40,000 from the victim.  In total, Nedved and his co-conspirators converted over $630,000 of victims' cash into bitcoin, knowing that the funds were the proceeds of scams and other unlawful activities, per the DOJ release.  While in some cases bitcoin was returned to the providers of the cash, in others it was sent on to ""unidentified third parties.""  Nedved was charged with aiding and abetting wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, both of which bring maximum sentences of 20 years in prison, plus fines.  The case is another reminder to take extreme care and carry out due diligence when handing over funds for cryptocurrency purchases or investments.    See also: New to Bitcoin?

The Stockholm-based company aims to list on Nasdaq's First North Growth Market, it announced Friday.      The investment, via an issuance of new shares, came from Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company. Venture capital firms Northzone, White Star Capital, and Techstars already have stakes in the exchange.      Frank Schuil, Safello CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk he had considered issuing shares digitally as tokenized securities but he concluded the technology has “not matured to a level we feel comfortable with.” As such, Safello is “going the traditional route,"" he said.      The Nasdaq First North listing is a ""big thing” for Safello and it is about ""trust building"" with regulators, according to Schuil. The listing approval process will involve Swedish financial regulators who will closely scrutinize the company and its prospectus.      The firm sees the current bull market as being favorable timing for the IPO announcement. “Timing-wise, we have always been successful. Our first investment round was at the peak of the bull market in 2013, and our last investment round was at the peak of 2017,” said Schuil.      “We look at the long-term prospect of crypto and blockchain. While we see the price swings, we know the swings and we can anticipate the swings (for us the prices are relevant for the business) – our whole philosophy is to become profitable in a bear market,” he said.

The investment from Piqué’s Cassius Family fund brings Sorare’s total seed round to roughly $9 million, the firm said in a press release. The move comes as the Ethereum-based NFT platform has seen a steady uptick in collector interest – with one Kylian Mbappé collectible even fetching $65,000 earlier this month.

The firm grew exponentially this year with 80 clubs joining the platform, including five European Champions: Bayern Munich, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto and Zenit. Sorare also announced licensing partnerships with the U.S. soccer league, MLS, and the South Korean K-League earlier this year, bringing both leagues onto its platform. The firm has partnerships with a total of 105 football clubs worldwide.

42433360,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQO1h,1608264745,US Treasury Bulking Up Crypto Policy Advisers as Wallet Reg Rumors Swirl,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the top financial crimes watchdog within the U.S. Treasury Department, is hiring two policy officers to help draft regulations for the cryptocurrency space.      Disclosed in Dec. 11 job postings, these ""Strategic Policy Officers"" will ""assist in the development of policy responses"" to ""threats"" posed by cryptocurrency, issue advisories to financial institutions and collaborate across government and the private sector on crypto policy.      The timing of the listings is notable. Just two weeks prior, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stoked rumors that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would rush out self-hosted wallet regulations that Armstrong speculated could cripple the industry.      The Block further illustrated what those regulations might look like late Thursday night. As soon as Friday, Mnuchin could mandate that crypto companies file a ""currency transaction report"" with FinCEN on individuals moving over $10,000 in cryptocurrency to or from a self-hosted crypto wallet in a single day.    See also: Why FinCEN Wants Details on All Cross-Border Transactions Over $250    Whether those regulations will actually arrive, what they would actually look like and if they'd survive after President-elect Joe Biden and his designated Treasury Secretary nominee, Janet Yellen, take office is yet to be determined.      But the minutiae of the Dec. 11 listings indicate FinCEN is eager to boost its crypto base chops regardless of who runs Treasury. Both top secret-clearance level jobs are permanent, full-time positions. Given the requirements that candidates have experience drafting, strategizing and researching crypto policy, it's safe to say FinCEN is only interested in subject-matter experts.      That could be the difference between crafting effective cryptocurrency regulations and the type of knee-jerk crackdowns Armstrong warned against. Crypto industry lobbying group the Blockchain Association told CoinDesk at the time of Armstrong's tweet that it was ""actively educating"" policymakers to fix ""misconceptions"" around self-hosted wallets.      ""To properly regulate emerging industries, especially the crypto economy, in the most nimble and responsive way requires officials in government to have true 21st-century expertise and experience,"" Executive Director Kristin Smith told CoinDesk Thursday.
