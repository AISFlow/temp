As reported by The Awl, WhatsApp users received messages on 21st August stating that traders from major Wall Street investment banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were about to buy stock in Avra, Inc (OTCQB: AVRN), a company that, according to its website, sells bitcoin ATMs and point-of-sale solutions.    Pump and dump spam on WhatsApp? pic.twitter.com/3BCVnIzHNC        — Noah McCormack (@noahmccormack) August 21, 2015    The messages indicated that the price would see major gains, and in one instance, claimed that a buyout would happen soon.  The stock price quickly shot to a high of $1.26 before falling significantly, though it’s unclear exactly how many WhatsApp users fell for the scam.    Whatsapp spam for pump and dump scheme. Ain't technology grand! pic.twitter.com/tW9PYqCGi2      — Patrick Delaney (@pxdelaney) August 21, 2015          The messages mostly drew complaints from users, who cried foul that they were receiving any spam at all. At least one user on Reddit indicated that they had reported the incident to the SEC.  Heavy trading volume for Avra’s stock continued days after the spike, according to data from Google Finance.  The event raised questions about the company’s financial prospects based on public data filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  For example, HotStocked.com noted that, according to the company’s SEC 10-Q filing for the period ending 30th June, Avra has reported no revenue since it was founded in December 2010. The company reported roughly $25,000 in cash on hand versus about $245,000 in liabilities.  At press time, Avra’s stock is trading at approximately $0.23.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhrN,1440611953,Litecoin Network Experiences First Mining Reward Decline,"Litecoin's block reward has halved.  At block 840,000, the mining reward fell from 50 LTC per block to 25 per block, marking the first time the alternative cryptocurrency, launched in 2011, has seen such a reduction. The 840,000th block was mined by F2Pool, also known as Discus Fish.  Litecoin supporters took to social media to celebrate the halving, and creator Charlie Lee thanked Chinese supporters in a YouTube message.  For now, the network itself doesn't appear to have been significantly affected by the reward drop, though some have speculated that, long-term, the hashrate will fall as profitability for some miners declines.  The litecoin network hashrate saw some fluctuation but is within ranges seen over the past several days, according to CoinWarz.  Markets reacted more significantly around the time of the halving. According to BitcoinWisdom data for OKCoin, litecoin prices in Chinese markets fell sharply but have since seen recovery at press time.  Speculation as to what comes next varies.  Some have predicted a long-term price increase, whereas others see further declines to come after the LTC market ramped and subsequently plunged earlier this summer as concerns about Chinese investment fraud mounted.  External factors in China - the largest market for litecoin – could fuel further volatility in markets moving forward, as the country's stock markets slip further into turmoil.

The marketplace attributed its decision to recent research that highlighted vulnerabilities in the Tor protocol that could lead to the identification of its servers and operators.  Agora is believed to be the largest dark market website by daily transaction volume, and uses bitcoin to facilitate payment for both legal and illicit items listed by vendors.  In its online announcement, Agora's anonymous administrators reported they had moved servers following the detection of ""suspicious activity"" that could potentially reveal their IP addresses and enable law enforcement agents to gain insight into its operations.  The announcement read:  ""At this point, while we don't have a solution ready it would be unsafe to keep our users using the service, since they would be in jeopardy.""  It continued: ""Thus, and to our great sadness we have to take the market offline for a while, until we can develop a better solution. This is the best course of action for everyone involved.""  The administrators urged customers to withdraw funds from their accounts as soon as possible. Consumers were also asked to refrain from sending bitcoin to Agora's deposit addresses while it was offline.  Agora's predecessor Silk Road was taken downhttps://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/UlbrichtCriminalComplaint.pdf by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013 and Ross Ulbricht – it's operator – was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year.

42378294,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhhJ,1440598212,Mt Gox CEO Claims to be 'Victim' in Bitcoin Exchange Demise,"Mark Karpeles, the CEO of bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has denied claims he manipulated account balances while he was running the Tokyo-based company.  According to a local media report, Karpeles told Japanese police he had no knowledge of the disappearance of any bitcoins and that he ""was just a victim"".  Karpeles was re-arrested in Tokyo last week following allegations he had embezzled ¥321m ($2.6m) of customer deposits to fund his personal projects.  The report, which bizarrely noted that Karpeles has an intelligence quotient of 190 – which would make him a genius – also cited the CEO as saying that Mt Gox had been ""a normal business operation"".  According to a loosely translated version of the article, an anonymous friend of Karpeles mentioned a ""Mr X"" (the alleged founder of Mt Gox) whom he claimed lied to the former CEO.  ""The balance of bitcoin was already incorrect when he bought the exchange, but Mr X advised to Karpeles that if Karpeles follow the operational rules decided by Mr X, Karpeles could recover the bitcoin balance, which turned out not to be true,"" adds the anonymous source in the report.  The police investigation is ongoing.

42378299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhnb,1440592822,Support Grows for BIP 100 Bitcoin Block Size Proposal,"Support for BIP 100, the market-led scalability fix from core developer Jeff Garzik, is growing as more miners pick sides in bitcoin's block size debate.  Data from BlockTrail indicates the percentage of blocks mined in support of BIP 100 has quadrupled to 22% following the backing of bitcoin's biggest mining pool DiscusFish / F2Pool on Monday night.  Miners have the ability to voice their preference for which proposal they support, be it BIP 100 or an 8MB increase, when they 'tag' each block they mine. Unlike votes for controversial bitcoin client XT, these tags will not trigger a hard fork of the software.  Garzik's proposal, first published in June, calls for a ""free-market-based approach"" to bitcoin's scalability. Unlike solutions that impose a set cap on the size of bitcoin blocks that increases over time, each block will be dynamic – its capacity agreed by consensus in the mining community.  This, Garzik says, is a less risky way to test bigger blocks incrementally – and one that will allow miners to adjust to any potential issues in real-time.  The 'tags' come following the announcement of a two-day bitcoin scalability workshop for the currency's key engineers and academics in Montreal next month. It is rumoured to be the first time bitcoin's top developers will meet all together in person. Another, to be held in Hong Kong, is pencilled in for later this year to cater for the vast mining community located in China.  Current statistics  Currently, DiscusFish / F2Pool, Kano CKPool and Bit Club network, which accounts for around 1.4% of the current hashrate, are supporting BIP 100. Yet, as the statistic above show, miners presenting over half of bitcoin's hashpower have not yet wavered from the current 1MB default. Some may yet specify their preference, others may not.  Of all the proposed changes, an 8MB increase has the biggest share of bitcoin's hashrate (25.5%), with support from KnCMiner, Antpool, 21 Inc and BW Pool. Meanwhile, Gavin Andresen's XT fork – which has been branded ""dangerous"" by some core developers – lags behind with 1%, despite 14.6% of nodes showing support.  Additionally, Slush.io, the only mining pools having voted for XT so far, appears to have 'switched off' its vote in its most recent blocks.

The 3D Secure protocol – developed by Visa – requests users enter a password to confirm their identity with the card issuer. Once verified, customers are able to complete their online purchase.  The San Francisco-based company, which recently confirmed it had applied for a BitLicense, said in a post:  ""Since credit and debit cards will not require a customer to pre-fund their Coinbase account with a bank transfer, customers in the UK and Spain can now receive bitcoin instantly.""  Coinbase  currently only accepts Visa, Mastercard and Maestro cards with 3D Secure authentication and purchases with either GBP or EUR are subject to a 3% ""convenience fee"".  The company noted the 3D Secure protocol is supported by most banks across Europe and the UK but advised users to check with their bank or try adding their card to their Coinbase account to see whether it is eligible.
