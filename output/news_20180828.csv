Wire services AFP reported Tuesday that ""all financial information"" must be denominated in both the bolivar – Venezuela's official currency – as well as the petro, which was controversially unveiled in December. Maduro's government has claimed, without evidence, to have raised billions of dollars during a presale earlier this year, despite pushback from opposition leaders in the country as well as international critics, including the U.S. government.  Indeed, in March, U.S. president Donald Trump approved new sanctions against Venezuela that specifically targeted the petro.  The development is the latest mandate to come out of the Maduro government related to the petro. It was previously announced that the state-owned oil and gas company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), will begin using the petro as a unit of account, and officials have also ordered that government-funded pensions and salaries be anchored to the cryptocurrencies.  The latest news also comes on the heels of a United Nations report stating that since 2014, 2.3 million people have fled Venezuela amid the country's economic crisis.

In a first-and-second quarter update posted on Tuesday, the Filecoin team unveiled an in-progress roadmap stretching into 2019 and beyond, with milestones including this week's release of demos for the go-filecoin protocol implementation, a plan to make the GitHub repositories for the implementation public, and, most notably, the launch of the Filecoin mainnet after an initial test phase.  On the plan to open up the repositories, the Filecoin team encouraged developers to take part in the process once it begins.  ""This will be a major point of involvement for the community at large, and we strongly encourage the participation of developers interested in developing Filecoin or in building applications on it,"" the blog post stated.  The test network launch is planned for between the last quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2019, though an exact date has yet to be published. The mainnet launch is expected sometime in the second or third quarter of next year, according to the post.  That being said, the team noted that any dates may be subject to change and referred to the roadmap as an ""optimistic timeline,"" explaining that while they ""hate giving dates that may ... slip,"" the developers hated ""keeping [the] community in the dark even more.""  The post added:  ""The pros: a much clearer and transparent planning approach, easier coordination across the community, and excitement as milestones get closer. The cons: timelines will certainly have to change – some things may come sooner or later than initially anticipated.""  Filecoin raised more than $200 million from investors in one of 2017's more notable initial coin offerings (ICOs).

He added:  ""While not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is a fraud, it is important for individuals and firms selling these products to be mindful that they are not doing so in a vacuum; state and provincial laws or regulations may apply, especially securities laws. Sponsors of these products should seek the advice of knowledgeable legal counsel to ensure they do not run afoul of the law. Furthermore, a strong culture of compliance should be in place before, not after, these products are marketed to investors.""  Borg also reminded investors to conduct their own research prior to purchasing any tokens, noting that any promoters ""who claim their ICO offering is exempt from securities registration but do not ask about your income, net worth or level of investing sophistication"" should be treated with caution.  As previously reported, Operation Cryptosweep was first announced in May 2018, when regulators in Canada and the U.S. said they were investigating more than 70 crypto-related startups for potential securities law violations. At the time, there were ""35 pending or completed enforcement actions.""

42401871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2g16,1535464826,Coinbase Survey Shows 18% of US Students Now Own Cryptocurrency,"University students are clamoring for more courses about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  That's according to a nationwide survey of 675 students, commissioned by crypto exchange Coinbase and released today. According to the survey, 21 of the top 50 U.S. universities, as ranked by U.S. News and World Report, now offer a class on blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, and at least 11 colleges offer more than one.  ""Students today are really thinking deeply about economic issues and alternative economic futures,"" Bill Maurer, the dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of California Irvine, said.  He continued:  ""Teaching about this kind of stuff now can be really powerful for students that are trying to find their own way and envision what kind of possible alternatives there might be to the prevailing economic system.""  And that interest in alternative economics isn't just relegated to the expected departments, such as finance or business or even computer science.  Instead, the Coinbase survey found that there's high demand for crypto and blockchain courses across a diverse spectrum of students.  While 34 percent of computer science and engineering majors indicated interest in learning about the nascent technology, 47 percent of social science majors are interested in the same, according to the survey.  Speaking to the enthusiasm within the social sciences, or those related to the study of human society and social relationships, Maurer said, learning about financial systems prepares students in all programs for the job market today.  ""There's a huge demand out there, especially in the design space, for people that have the skills that we train anthropologists with, understanding the human side of technology,"" he said.  Increasing interest  Meanwhile, universities like Cornell, Stanford, and Georgetown are beefing up their blockchain research opportunities to accommodate swells in curiosity.  And at New York University, David Yermack from the Stern School of Business said that to meet growing demand, his blockchain course will now be offered both semesters (when it was originally only taught during one), according to a blog post published by Coinbase outlining the results.  During the first session of the course in 2014, only 35 students enrolled. But in the spring of 2018, 280 students had enrolled.  Not only are students eager to learn, but an increasing number are also trying the technology out for themselves – 18 percent of respondents in the survey said they own some cryptocurrency.  Dan Boneh, a computer science professor at Stanford, who is also seeing rising demand for blockchain and cryptocurrency-related classes, told CoinDesk:  ""It's a pretty exciting time. It feels like the beginning of something.""  Marketable skills  The surge in interest in education surrounding the technology is, in part, a reaction to the broader job market.  Benedikt Bunz, a doctoral student at Stanford, who spoke to Coinbase about the survey results, said cryptocurrency experts have an easy time finding jobs after graduation since such skills are in high demand.  Case in point, Coinbase is ramping up its efforts to recruit college students and recent graduates throughout this academic year.  ""It's exciting to see widespread interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology taking off in the global academic community, including students attending the top universities in the world,"" Nat McGrath, vice president of people at Coinbase, told CoinDesk. ""That's one of the reasons we're focused on building partnerships with underrepresented student groups across college campuses, and we look forward to expanding these efforts in the spring.""  Beyond the Ivy League schools included in the Coinbase survey, Howard University, a historically African-American college, and the women's liberal arts school Smith College are two notable additions to McGrath's recruitment plan.  Given the high quality of students that are showing an inclination towards the field, Boneh said he's sure something groundbreaking will emerge over the next few years.  He concluded:  ""I think [demand] has to do with a lot of talent going into the space. Very smart people are working on blockchain projects.""

The worlds largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization first moved past the $7,000 mark soon after 10:00 UTC today after trading sideways for nearly three weeks. As traders of bitcoin have come to realize, periods of low volatility often come to a boisterous end.  Bitcoin passing the psychological hurdle did not come without warning. As mentioned yesterday, bearish bitcoin futures bets had hit a record low – signaling investor sentiment was beginning to shift into bullish mode.  What's more, the market was not phased by the SEC's decision to reject several ETF proposals last week. While negative, the news failed to wreak havoc on prices, as has happened previously, and was a sign that bearish market pressure was reaching exhaustion.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at an average price of $7,064 across exchanges, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, having peaked at just above $7,070 today so far.  4-hour chart  After closing a 4-hour session above the elusive resistance zone of $6,700–$6,850, the bulls continued to ultimately pass the peak of the prior rally ($6,899) seen on Aug. 22. The next level of resistance currently resides at $7,165.  What's more, the price was able to close above the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) – a feat not accomplished since Aug 4. Finding acceptance above all of the short-term EMAs signals the path of least resistance is to the upside, at least in the short-term.  A short-term pullback to prior resistance ($6,899) would be considered healthy, as price often falls back to prior resistance in order to prove it can hold as support.  Daily chart  The daily chart depicts a couple of bullish indications that suggest a move to around $7,600 is more than possible.  For one, bitcoin is defending its first higher low on the daily timeframe since April – a strong bullish indication since the bulls were able to defend avoid setting a new low for the year.  What's more, the 50- and 100-day EMAs are forming a bull cross, signaling that momentum is indeed shifting away from the bears. The strongest resistance on the daily timeframe lies near $7,800 – the location of the 200-day EMA and descending trendline resistance.  View  The short-term trend is becoming bullish, setting the stage for a move to the prior resistance zone of $7,400  Longer term, bitcoin setting a higher low is a bullish sign that could fuel a move towards the 200 day EMA at $7,800.  Finding acceptance below prior resistance at $6,550 would negate the short-term bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

42401825,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2e18,1535461214,Lloyd's of London Makes Quiet Entrance Into Crypto Insurance Market,"Lloyd's of London, the centuries-old insurance marketplace, is quietly providing cover against the theft of cryptocurrencies.  Announced Tuesday, Kingdom Trust, a qualified custodian of some 30 cryptocurrencies and tokens, is enhancing its safe-keeping services with insurance cover for theft and loss due to natural disaster, courtesy of underwriters in the Lloyd's market. Kingdom Trust, which came close to being purchased this year by BitGo, is a qualified custodian, which means it guards the private keys of troves of cryptocurrencies to a standard deemed acceptable to regulated financial institutions.  Matt Jennings, CEO, Kingdom Trust, said in a statement, ""We serve both institutional and individual investors by providing qualified custody, which gives our clients the framework they need to ensure compliance with their regulators using clear and transparent reporting.""  Stepping back, the ultra-conservative world of insurance is becoming slowly more interested in providing cover for properly custodied digital assets. In the U.S., AIG, XL Catlin, Chubb and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance have been mentioned in the press, but for now, all are keeping a low profile.  And Lloyd's is also treading carefully; Lloyd's corporation, which is the legal umbrella made up of groups of syndicates spreading risk across the market, would not comment on whether managing agents might be offering crypto theft cover, and the syndicates doing it were not named.  The broker who arranged Kingdom Trust's cover, Illinois-based Safe Deposit Box Insurance Coverage (SDBIC), said this is likely because there's still a bit of hesitancy in the marketplace about the asset class.  Indeed, Lloyd's of London issued a directive to all its syndicates last month, warning them to proceed with caution with regard to crypto assets, and ensure that managing agents have the required expertise in the underlying risks.  However, the floodgates are close to breaking open, said Jerry Pluard, president of SDBIC.  ""About 10 syndicates in Lloyd's have indicated a willingness and are somewhat active in evaluating crypto exposures,"" Pluard said, continuing:  ""Of those 10, I would say there are five that have the level of expertise that allows them to be comfortable enough to do the analysis and underwriting of the risk, and then the other five will follow on with those leads in writing exposure.""  In addition, Pluard said there is a whole other set of syndicates in the London market that are considering crypto, but ""haven't really jumped to put a policy of paper in place.""  Belt and braces  Kingdom Trust managed to secure underwriters from the Lloyd's market thanks to a combination of new technology and battle-tested security protocols, said CEO Jennings.  He reeled off a range of features, including proof of reserve, daily reconciliation audits, external oversight, whitelisting of addresses, multi-geographic location disaster recovery program and employees going through regular due diligence programs.  When everything is done using cold storage (not connected to the internet), an inside job or someone posing as someone else and asking for a transaction to be sent somewhere become the main threats, noted Jennings, hence the whitelisting.  Kingdom Trust's safekeeping solution is much more than a wallet, said Jennings, adding that the insurance market is looking for more than just a good wallet solution from an unregulated third-party software company.  ""A lot of people are seeking insurance for hot wallets or what they call warm wallets and some people even call them cold wallets,"" he said. ""But I think the insurance market wants to see an entire safekeeping solution that encompasses the entire atmosphere around the private keys.""  No surprises  Jennings said getting Lloyd's to underwrite Kingdom Trust was a win for the broader industry, and that demonstrating a provably robust storage system would start bringing the costs down for everyone.  He said the ""KT Icebox"" system meant he could offer baseline crypto cover to clients at no additional cost.  Today, a wide range of firms, large and small, are eyeing this space, driven by the allure of institutional investment, regulations permitting. Such players are not surprised to see Lloyd's syndicate underwriters entering the crypto space.  Matt Johnson, chief product officer at DACC (Digital Asset Custody Company), said his company has been looking at insurance policies over the last few months, as they wait patiently in the queue for the SEC to start handing out broker dealer licenses.  ""I don't find it surprising that Lloyd's is in this space,"" said Johnson, adding that to his mind the challenge for everybody is figuring out how to structure these policies so that they are actually protective.  He concluded:  ""You can create an insurance policy that protects no one – you know there are so many caveats to the policy that it's not super protective.""

Accredited investors in the U.S. can now purchase or trade the digital assets on OpenFinance's platform. Retail investors who cannot receive accreditation may also be able to trade certain assets, though after a 12-month holding period, Hernandez told CoinDesk.  The platform soft-launched several weeks ago, he said, to allow buyers and sellers to register and complete their anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures, with today's announcement marking the start of actual trading.  OpenFinance's timeline for launch was based around its partners' availability, Hernandez explained. For example, Blockchain Capital, a blockchain-focused venture capital company, was the firm's first partner and, as such, had to ensure its security token was ready to trade before the ATS could launch.  That being said, the first tradeable token on the platform is SPiCE VC (SPX). Science, Protos, MintHealth, Corl, Bloxroute and Property Coin will also be added in the near future. Any token sold under a Regulation D, S, A+ or CF exemption can also trade on the ATS.  ""[Our partners] are all security tokens that have the necessary smart contract infrastructure in place to be able to trade on our platform,"" Hernandez said.  OpenFinance has been in regular communication with regulators to receive launch approval, he added, saying: ""It's such a new space that the conversations, communications that we've had with regulators more often than not turn into education, where we are highlighting and detailing how our technology and the smart contracts standards allow for adherence to the rules and compliance.""  OpenFinance joins a number of other startups seeking to launch ATS platforms. Over the last several months, Bittrex, Coinbase, Templum and Overstock have all announced efforts to launch similar systems as a way to legally trade security tokens on a regulated platform within the U.S.  Edit (12:45 UTC, Aug. 28, 2018): This article was amended to correctly state that retail investors will have a 12-month holding period, not accredited investors.

Announced Tuesday, the firm has partnered with the municipal government of the Chinese city of Wuchang to deploy a consortium blockchain for tracking the entire production process of locally grown rice.  Located in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province, Wuchang is known for the high quality of a specific type of local rice. However, over the past years, news reports have revealed that packages delivered from the region were sometimes mixed with rice of lower quality.  Starting from Sept. 30, every package of ""Wu Chang rice"" sold by flagship stores on Alibaba's Tmall e-commerce platform will display a QR code that customers can scan using Alipay to obtain information about the food's origin.  Ant Financial said its distributed network is deployed among participating nodes including flagship stores' rice producers, Wuchang's Bureau of Quality and Technology Supervision, logistics supplier Cainiao and the Tmall platform.  The goal is to create a public ledger that contains unique information for each rice package so that any data discrepancy with the counterfeit products can be easily spotted.  ""Consumers will be able to access production and logistics information including where the rice was harvested, which type of seed was used, and other details associated with the harvesting, packaging and transportation of the rice,"" the company said in the statement.  Further, Ant Financial said it expects to launch its blockchain-as-a-service platform in September – opening up its blockchain development tools for more enterprises.  In April, Alibaba announced that it was trialing a different blockchain-based supply chain app in order to prevent food fraud.

Areas that have been on the association's radar to date include peer-to-peer lending, internet insurance, equity financing and internet payments.  ""This platform is responsible for gathering reports and complaints regarding internet financial activities and transferring to relevant government agencies, which will take on further actions according to existing regulations upon receiving the reports,"" NIFA states on its website.  Now the association has added ""token sales"" as a reporting option, whereby Chinese residents are able to file complaints on crypto-related activities defined as illegal by the PBoC in its ICO and crypto trading ban last year.  The activities listed on NIFA's website include operating an exchange for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading, directly or indirectly providing registration, trading, clearing and settlement services for token sales, and offering insurance services for crypto-related businesses.  The news comes amid continuing efforts by Chinese regulatory agencies to clamp down on cryptocurrency trading and ICOs.  Last week, five high-level financial regulators in China issued a statement warning the public against overseas ICOs that solicit investment from domestic investors using nascent mechanisms such as ""initial exchange offerings"" and ""initial fork offerings.""  Chinese internet giants including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are also cooperating with regulators in efforts to block over-the-counter crypto trading via payments applications and are censoring online forums that distribute relevant information.

42401816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2dxC,1535443255,"As Central Banks Go Digital, Crypto Competition Looms","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      With blockchain platforms being tested for various business processes, prospective enterprise users that are unwilling to accept a volatile cryptocurrency will often complain that a key piece is missing from the platform: a stable, digital medium of exchange.  Hence the race, currently underway, to create a viable ""stablecoin.""  Many tech teams, such those at Basecoin, are developing decentralized algorithms intended to peg the value of a crypto-asset to an external reference price such as a fiat currency like the dollar. Others, such as Saga, are building collateralized reserve models, offering guaranteed, fixed-price convertibility into an alternative store of value – also, such as the dollar. Based on the controversy surrounding Tether, the biggest stablecoin, it's fair to say that a widely trusted system does not yet exist.  Here's an alternative vision: What if the race is won by a central bank? Digitizing fiat is arguably easier than pegging to fiat. What it needs is buy-in from officialdom.  The Bank of Thailand moved the world a small step closer to that solution last week. It announced that, in partnership with eight financial institutions, it is developing a digital currency based on R3's Corda distributed ledger protocol.  We'll see how the Thai project evolves, but the purpose for now appears quite narrowly focused on a specific use case: facilitating interbank transfers among institutions operating within the country's capital markets. Although limited to Thailand, it would add in the monetary piece that's been missing from other distributed ledger initiatives to streamline securities settlement, such as that at the U.S. settlement and clearing agency, the DTCC.  However, it's not hard to imagine that if Thailand's or another country's ""wholesale"" central-bank digital currency experiment shows signs of success there will be pressure to expand these so-called CBDC models to a wider community of users.  Expanding access to CBDC  With blockchain-based solutions for supply chains now moving from proofs of concept to implementation, with a lot of that activity in Thailand's neighborhood, businesses could start to seek digital fiat solutions to these new models of automated trade. This will, of course, be limited to in-country transactions, but if prospective decentralized, smart contract tools such as atomic swaps , currently being explored for blockchain assets, can also be applied to digital fiat currencies, instantaneous cross-border CBDC exchanges might become a reality.  And despite concerns about financial instability expressed by the Bank of International Settlements, a central bank-owned body that coordinates activity among its members, I think it's fair to assume a fully retail CBDC will one day exist somewhere.  The BIS' concerns primarily lie with the potential threat to the banking system from money fleeing short-term deposits into CBDC wallets. But that position presupposes banks should continue to play a central role in our payments systems. Many central bankers, who were blindsided by the problems caused by too-big-to-fail banks during the financial crisis, take a different view: that our dependence on for-profit private institutions to manage our monetary system is the very cause of the systemic risks to which our society has long been subject.  No lesser figure than former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has argued forcefully about the need to reform the bank-centric financial system. And although his successor, Mark Carney, has soured on the idea of a digital pound, it's noteworthy that BOE researchers, among the first to explore CBDC ideas, initially explored the potential benefits of removing banks from payments by ending their privileged access to central bank reserves.  A world of competing currencies  If this future does come to pass, it will be a long way from that envisaged by crypto developers who want to remove central banks from the equation. It's even further from the vision of bitcoin enthusiasts, who see the need for a fully censorship-resistant currency with a monetary policy that cannot be altered by policymakers.  But all will not be lost for monetary innovators. The act of digitizing currencies – whether by central banks or by crypto developers – is likely to lead to increased global competition across currencies, as access and the cost of trading them becomes more efficient. That will put central banks themselves under pressure to develop currencies that people want to use.  The competition won't only be among different countries' currencies. With the help of Lightning and/or other Layer 2 solutions, cryptocurrencies will become more scalable and can present themselves as one of a number of options.  I see the scenario eventually evolving into something like the vision of Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, a favorite of libertarians, who foresaw a world of competing private currencies emerging. It's just that this one would entail competition between crypto- and government-run digital currencies.  Hopefully out of that competitive soup something that best serves humanity will arise.  Of course, this isn't happening tomorrow. It's premature to place all-out bets on any kind of currency solution becoming the standard.  But to assume that the world of money won't change at all is also foolhardy. These forces will come to bear in ways that will be difficult for any actors, public or private, to control.  Protecting people's interests  When that change starts to happen, it's critical that we, the people, provide input into how these systems evolve. A world of competing digital currencies isn't necessarily a utopia.  As I argued in a previous column, crypto tokens have in some cases worsened society's problems with truth in social media, prompting tribes of specific token holders to fiercely defend their coin against valid criticism. Imagine the same thing happening with fiat digital currencies promoted as investments by dictatorships.  We might just be getting a test of that with Venezuela's move to peg the bolivar to its new digital currency, the Petro. The government of President Nicolas Maduro has long employed an aggressive propaganda campaign in favor its tragically failed policies. Imagine if he gets a team of Petro-holding trolls to amp up that campaign.  Digital fiat currency could also become an alarming surveillance tool. Already, the concept of China's ""social score"" system is raising concerns in that country. Add traceable digital payments to that kind of model and something even more invasive emerges.  Still, competitive pressures might also help us here. As I've previously argued, privacy is vital to good, functioning, fungible currency systems. So too, naturally, is broad adoption.  If we can create a world of genuine choices across currencies, it's reasonable to assume that people will gravitate toward those that don't entail surveillance and aren't used as propaganda tools.  Will cryptocurrencies do a better job of achieving these standards? Possibly. But it depends on their design. There are plenty of bad altcoins out there.  Still, if a cryptocurrency, whether bitcoin or an alternative with a different monetary policy, attains scalability and includes robust privacy protections, there's still a very decent chance it could eventually outcompete government currencies.  Either way, let's bring on the competition. May the best coin win.  Chess image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Michael J.

According to shareholding disclosures filed by the firm, Pantronics Holdings, on Aug. 21 to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the company is transferring more than 221 million of its ordinary shares to Li Lin, the chairman of Huobi Group, via several of the exchange's subsidiaries.  With the disclosed transaction, Li is poised to become the owner of 73.73 percent of Pantronics and the largest substantial shareholder. Based on the filing, the transaction is priced at HK$2.72 (or $0.35) per share with a total amount nearing $77 million.  The deal, if approved, could give Huobi the opportunity to take over the public company and thus enter the secondary financial market – a process known as a reverse takeover.  Pantronics, an electronics manufacturing service provider that was established in 1990 and went public in 2016, has not yet made any official announcement regarding the completion of the deal, or of any potential corporate restructure afterwards.  A representative for Huobi told CoinDesk that the crypto exchange is still waiting for confirmation and approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As such, the company can't comment on the issue at the moment.  Following the initial notice, Pantronics halted the trading of its shares on the exchange from Aug. 22 ""pending the release of an announcement relating to a possible offer to be made ... on Takeovers and Mergers, which is inside information in nature,"" the firm said at the time.  Gelonghui, a Chinese news source that covers the financial market, first reported around 18:00 UTC on Monday that Pantonics had transferred 73.73 percent of its ownership to Li.  Following that news, the price of the Huobi Token, the exchange's own crypto asset, immediately jumped by eight percent and has now seen a six percent rise over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Huobi's move also comes at a time when several other Chinese private firms in the cryptocurrency space are applying for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, including bitcoin miner makers Canaan Creative and Ebang.  Another bitcoin mining giant, Bitmain, is also reported to be weighing an $18 billion IPO in Hong Kong.

Published Tuesday morning, the findings – included in a report from the Deloitte Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications – form part of a wider look into how the technology could be applied to those business sectors.  To that end, the researchers behind the report surveyed 1,053 executives in seven countries, including 180 from TMT firms. They found that 84 percent of all respondents ""believe that blockchain will broadly scale and reach mainstream adoption.""  Roughly 59 percent say they think blockchain could disrupt their specific industries, and 29 percent of all respondents have ""already joined a blockchain consortium,"" according to the report.  Further, overall interest in blockchain has grown as well, according to Deloitte's findings.
