42425377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOzh,1391209282,"Congressional Leaders, Foundation Praise FinCEN Guidance","FinCEN's rulings on cryptocurrency compliance yesterday have drawn praise from a congressional leader. He nevertheless cautioned government agencies to continue working together on a cohesive strategy to deal with virtual currency.  Senator Tom Carper (D-Del) praised the Treasury-based agency for releasing the two rules, which exempted miners from MSB licensing, and also clarified rules for businesses that wanted to buy and sell bitcoins for their own purposes.  ""I am glad that FinCEN is working to release rulings in order to provide more clear, consistent, and timely guidelines to potential innovators, meaning those interested in virtual currencies can continue to explore the opportunities this technology offers while also adhering to federal law,"" Carper said.  Carper is chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which held hearings into digital currencies last November. He has often been outspoken on the subject, most recently pressing the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) to clarify its position. Bitcoin's volatility at the moment, which springs from a lack of liquidity, makes it act less like a currency than a commodity or other financial instrument.  He has also advocated a 'wait and see' approach to bitcoin, letting the digital currency grow and mature without stifling it by over-regulating it. He has said in the past that he sees 'good things' with bitcoin.  More work needed  Carper said today that the technology was evolving, and could be used for a number of purposes. However, he warned that more inter-agency action was needed.  ""All government agencies should continue working to help ensure that this evolving technology does not outpace an effective regulatory response. By doing so, federal agencies can help ensure that consumers are protected while also fostering innovation and commerce,"" he said.  ""I will continue to monitor how federal agencies respond to developments of this technology and, if necessary, encourage agencies to act to ensure that the federal government is speaking with a unified and consistent voice on this issue.”  The Bitcoin Foundation also praised the rulings yesterday.  ""FinCEN continues to demonstrate real leadership by listening to the public and providing regulatory clarity within existing frameworks for businesses operating in the space,"" it told CoinDesk in a statement, ""all the while maintaining appropriate Bank Secrecy Act safeguards for financial institutions.""  Both of the rulings issued yesterday stem from inquiries made by US-based businesses. FinCEN is using its responses to these individual inquiries as policies that now apply across the board.  The first response exempted miners from MSB status, which will doubtless be a relief to any institutional mining companies wanting to set up in the US.  FinCEN to firms: Buy/sell, but for your own account only  The second ruling enabled companies to buy virtual currencies for themselves, selling them on an exchange later for their own purposes. This is in line with the business model proposed by Andre de Castro, owner of RightClick LLC.  The ruling is a copy of a response to an inquiry sent last May, which is when De Castro sent his original letter to FinCEN.  [post-quote]  De Castro's business would purchase bitcoins from customers using a mobile app or web app. He could then sell it on an exchange at a time of his choosing for profit. He is currently planning to open at a physical location in New York.  FinCEN's response focused on the fact that the applicant was using software to collect bitcoins from sellers, purely for the company's own account.  ""In effect, when the Company invests in a convertible virtual currency for its own account, and when it realizes the value of its investment, it is acting as a user of that convertible virtual currency within the meaning of the guidance,"" it said. However, it warned that any transfers to third parties, requested by counterparties, creditors, or owners should still be closely watched.  ""When regulations are unclear I would stress caution, which is exactly why I have waited as long as I have to get a proper ruling,"" De Castro - who received his clearance from FinCEN in December - told CoinDesk last week. ""Federal penalties are stiff for wrongdoers. One need to understand one's business process well and consider present and past regulations.""

42425374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOvh,1391201953,'Innocent' Silk Road Seller Will Sue to Stop Sale of Seized Bitcoins,"Former Silk Road merchant Peter Ward has announced his intention to hire a lawyer and file a claim for 100 bitcoins that he says were wrongly taken by the government during its seizure of online black market bazaar Silk Road.  The owner of Planet Pluto - a head shop in Devon, England, Ward says he earned the bitcoin - worth $85,000 at press time - lawfully, through the sale of drug accessories such as bongs, marijuana seeds and rolling papers, items he sells successfully online through other outlets.  Speaking to Forbes, Ward suggested that he has the ability to prove his transactions on the site were all legal, and as such, should not have been subject to forfeiture.  “I’m probably in a unique position in that I can prove my coins came from selling legal items. I sold on Silk Road because it had a large user base that matched my target customers. Where better to sell king-size rolling papers?”  Ward was also arrested on his 52nd birthday on 2nd October in connection with Silk Road. Law enforcement officials from the UK's National Crime Agency entered his home and confiscated his personal stash of marijuana and cocaine, however, he was released on bail and has yet to be charged.  Impact on the Silk Road sale  For those more interested in the price of bitcoin, Ward hopes the action will keep the government from its forthcoming sale of $25m worth of bitcoins taken from the now-defunct website.  “It will be cool if an old hippy can throw a spanner in the big FBI machine,"" Ward said.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Los Angeles-based asset forfeiture lawyer Dave Katten said Ward is unlikely to be successful in this goal, even if he has a legitimate claim to the money.  ""If he's really an innocent owner, they should return it, as long as they can't find a specified unlawful activity to tie to it,"" Katten said.  Katten believes the government, if it finds Ward innocent or settles with him out of court, is likely to reimburse Katten after the Silk Road sale. In this case, Ward would not receive his bitcoins, but would likely be compensated in US dollars and with interest similar to what consumers would receive on treasury bonds.  Legal reaction  Steven L. Kessler, an asset forfeiture lawyer Ward is considering for the case, told Forbes that the US government had an obligation to inform Ward of the sale, but that it did not follow through.  “The statute requires that if the government of the United States has knowledge of an individual with an asset subject to forfeiture, the owner has to get notice. Clearly after you’ve arrested a person, you have direct knowledge,"" Kessler said.  Katten isn't surprised, telling CoinDesk that Ward was likely to be ""missed"" by government, as his claim represents a small chunk of the total seizure. However, he stresses that this doesn't mean Ward can't file a claim or receive compensation, should it be owed.  As to whether such a claim would be worth it monetarily for Ward, Katten would only say that the legal process is likely to be lengthy, but that early action could be effective. Still, he says the government could fight such action on different grounds, should it choose.  ""They may say the goods he's selling are not illegal, but they may argue he's using the system to hide the transactions rather than using a more common market. So they may not be so quick to given them back to him.""  Publicity stunt  Another lawyer familiar with Silk Road litigation, speaking on background, suggested Silk Road's perception as a known drug bazaar could also lead the US government to take Ward's case less seriously. The source further suggested that the case seems more like a publicity stunt than a legitimate claim given Silk Road's reputation.  Still, Ward has taken to Twitter to find others who will help support his fight:    Any donations to my legal fund gratefully received, help me get my bitcoins back from the FBI 18bugRoYM6kz4dU2mHJuBnXMbU4SMQdnio #silkroad      — Pluto Pete (@plutopete) January 30, 2014    The announcement is just the latest development in the ongoing saga of Silk Road.

Byrne retracted earlier statements that indicated both he and Overstock would not hold any bitcoin. The outspoken exec further freed his company to hold bitcoin on the call, stating that it is ""no longer bound"" by previous restrictions.  Notably, Byrne echoed statements made by executive vice president Jonathan Johnson at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings this week, saying that Overstock is exploring ways to pay employees, suppliers and vendors in cryptocurrency.  ""I think that we'll be moving, making it optional for some of our colleagues to take some of their pay in bitcoin once that process is worked out, maybe take bonuses or something,"" Byrne said.  Johnson suggested that the more bitcoin is used by Overstock's consumers and suppliers, the more it will be able to bring additional savings to its supply chain.  Stock performance  Despite the boom in publicity, Overstock's stock notably dropped by more than 20 percent after its fourth-quarter earnings announcement.  Bitcoin sales, which the company began processing after 31st December, were not factored into the report. It's big first-day earnings will not be reflected until the end of first quarter 2014.

Further, the company's diluted earnings per share was $3.64, up from $3.02 in 2012.  Informing investors  Byrne and his colleagues issued the responses to an investor that asked whether the company would be offering special deals to bitcoin users. Neither Johnson nor Byrne answered this question directly, but they did reiterate their strong support for bitcoin, stating that they want to be a key part of the ecosystem.  The CEO also recounted how he came to be involved in bitcoin, noting that he has been interested in the cryptocurrency for over a year, and that concerns about the legal status of bitcoin initially held back the decision. He called the implementation a ""testament to [Overstock's] IT department"", noting that integration with Coinbase took just 10 days.  2014 outlook  While it was not stated during the call, Johnson indicated at the NYDFS hearings that Overstock would continue to monitor developments in the altcoin markets.    Jonathan Johnson of @Overstock says the company is open to altcoins if they can be received ""risk-free"" #bitcoinhearings      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 29, 2014    A spokesperson also indicated that Overstock will be expanding internationally to serve two additional countries in 2014, but did not indicate where or when this expansion will take place.

The 'Robocoin Ambassador Program' offers participants 25% of a machine's fee revenue until the amount reaches $10,000.  To earn that $10,000 an Ambassador needs to find potential Robocoin operators, guide them through the purchase process and then actively promote machines ones they're installed.    #Ambassadors! Come one, come all! For every RoboCoin ATM you sell, we'll give you $10,000 in Bitcoin!      — Robocoin (@robocoin) January 31, 2014    Each machine costs $20,000 to install. Robocoin expects its Ambassadors to not only sell machines, but continue to promote and support recruited operators post-sale. They must not only support the company's cause, but be passionate about bitcoin itself.  According to the program's site:  ""You love bitcoin. You understand why Robocoin is significant. You're dialed in to your local business community and you understand how incredible of an entrepreneurial opportunity Robocoin Operations can be. You aren’t just a Robocoin Ambassador, but you’re an ambassador for bitcoin. Your job is to source incredible operators, teach them about Robocoin and help close the deal.""  The statement continues: ""You don’t just make the sale and walk away. You add value to your referred operator every step of the way. Your job is to make their life easier, not just during the sale but after the sale. Market their machine. Share their progress.""  To register as an Ambassador, applicants must provide Robocoin with contact details as well as a promotional strategy and any existing sales leads they have.  Bi-directional  Las Vegas-based Robocoin bills itself as the first 'real' bitcoin ATM, as it offers two-way transactions. While other machines simply dispense bitcoins in exchange for cash, Robocoin ATMs will also give you cash for your bitcoins.  The first Robocoin machine, launched in a Vancouver coffee shop through local partner Bitcoiniacs, reportedly processed $1m worth of transactions, which totalled 1,576, in its first month of operation alone. Over half of those transactions created entirely new bitcoin wallets, the company said.  The machines register a palm scan for all users, saying this identifies each user as unique to limit transactions, but not in a way that connects the identity to a name.  Robocoin announced a big push into Asia at the beginning of 2014, a move that was slightly thwarted when Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced it would actively block installations there.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/31/robocoin-launches-10k-incentive-program-to-promote-bitcoin-atms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89b35f352b06d5f9c5e4ebe891f2d11314a32699-1024x703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376858,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erED,1391188843,Plug and Play Unveils Bitcoin Startup Incubator With Expert Mentors,"An established startup incubator located in Silicon Valley, California is launching a bitcoin-centric accelerator.  The Plug and Play Technology Center has recruited some key figures within the digital currency industry after announcing Plug and Play Bitcoin Winter 2014, a program that will foster businesses in the bitcoin realm.  The accelerator is accepting five bitcoin-related ventures for a program that will begin on 24th February. Startups accepted into the program will be given $25,000, startup space in Sunnyvale, plus access to a number of experts working within the bitcoin industry.  Familiar faces  Notable advisers include; Jacob Farber from law firm Perkins Coie; Roger Ver, an angel investor in various established bitcoin companies; and Patrick Murckhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board, the Bitcoin Foundation’s general counsel.  “With a smaller group of five startups, face time with the mentors will be ample,” says Scott Robinson, who has been leading Plug and Play’s bitcoin initiatives. He added:  “Each mentor has committed to offering sessions for presentations, discussion and one-on-one interaction within a group setting no larger than 30 people.”  Plug and Play has previously invested in successful ventures such as PayPal and Dropbox. Robinson says that those investments “were partly a result of the partnerships we foster among the most robust investor networks in Silicon Valley, which includes over 200 VCs and 500 Angels”.  Plug and Play clearly intends to replicate that formula by fostering bitcoin-based innovation.  The test of time  The incubator is looking specifically for unique ideas in the bitcoin space, Robinson told CoinDesk. The key criteria for potential startups is that they can stand the test of time and build upon the intriguing peer-to-peer network philosophy behind bitcoin’s distributed system.  “We're primarily looking for startups utilizing the protocol in an innovative fashion: we don't want ‘Amazon but with bitcoin’.”  When it comes to potential compliance matters, Plug and Play is open to working with digital currency startups that may have to deal with possible US-based regulatory issues. Digital currency-related policy outside of established federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance is relatively unknown right now.  Yet recent hearings conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services may provide some policy clarity soon. Regulation may eventually come in the form of a method involving some sort of specialized licensure.  As a result, Plug and Play has brought on as mentors people who are knowledgeable of the regulatory opacity bitcoin companies must work in for the time being.  “We're fairly open to all startups at this point – luckily, our partners are incredibly versed when it comes to navigating complex and dynamic legal ramifications, specifically in virtual currency,” said Robinson.  “We're not against looking at a new and innovative ways to innovate with looming MSB (money services businesses) implications.”  Global reach  Robinson also pointed out Plug and Play’s global reach. That could be an asset in the event of possible sanctions levied against bitcoin businesses in certain jurisdictions. “Our reach is unique: We have accelerator initiatives in Berlin, Singapore, Vancouver and other locations. This provides incredibly powerful entry points into markets more amenable to bitcoin regulation,” he said.  It is important for there to be incubators in order to nurture the development of nascent bitcoin startup companies. Investor interest in the space resolutely gives these businesses resources to help them thrive. Plug and Play’s recruitment of 15 mentors for their program gives credence to that.  As it stands, the incumbent player in the bitcoin accelerator world right now is the San Mateo-based Boost VC. That incubator has already backed nine bitcoin startups through its program. Entrepreneur Magazine has called Boost VC the “Currency Kings” of the venture-backed world.  Boost will be holding a Demo Day for its most recent accelerator class on February 11 in Menlo Park. As in the past, CoinDesk will be covering the bitcoin-related companies that will be pitched to investors on the day.  As for Plug and Play, accepted companies in its bitcoin program will be plugged in with “200+ VC's, 500+ angel investors, and 100's of experienced entrepreneurs,” according to Robinson.  Interested startups are encouraged to apply on the accelerator’s AngelList posting. Here is the full list of mentors for Plug and Play’s Bitcoin Winter 2014:  1) Bill Tai of Charles River Ventures  2) Andreas Antonopoulos, IT Security Expert and CSO of Blockchain.info  3) Wences Casares, entrepreneur and investor  4) Michael Terpin, CEO of Social Radius  5) Ryan Gembala of Azure Capital  6) Adrian Fenty of Andreessen Horowitz and Perkins Coie; former mayor of Washington, DC  7) Patrick Murck, Bitcoin Foundation general counsel  8) Jacob Farber of Perkins Coie  9) Rik Willard, founder of NYC incubator MintCombine  10) Petar Nedyalkov of Voivoda Ventures  11) Roger Ver, “Bitcoin Jesus” and angel investor  12) David Johnston of BitAngels  13) Atish Babu of Omnivore Capital  14) Brock Pierce, serial entrepreneur and angel investor  15) Jean-Jacques ""J"" Cabou of Perkins Coie  Mentor image  via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/31/plug-and-play-unveils-bitcoin-startup-incubator-with-expert-mentors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c48ccbc6f9b087c66ad3eb3fcd5bed98c868aef-1000x661.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6er6f,1391186185,Estonian Central Bank Warns Bitcoin May be a 'Ponzi Scheme',"A member of the Central Bank of Estonia has issued a warning to the country's citizens about bitcoin and other virtual currencies.      Mihkel Nõmmela, who heads the bank's Payment and Settlement Systems Department, called bitcoin a ""problematic scheme"" in an email to Bloomberg. Nõmmela echoed concerns raised at this week's bitcoin hearings in New York, noting that all risks in the system are assumed by the user, and that consumers have nowhere to turn for support. He said:      ""Already there have been cases where the owner of a trading virtual money has suddenly ceased to exist, so customers have also suffered losses.""              Nõmmela indicated Estonia's Central Bank would continue to pay attention to developments in the virtual currency space, saying there are ""grounds to assume that the use of virtual money schemes will expand in Estonia as well"". But, he did issue a firm warning to Estonians who seek to use it:      “All in all, virtual currency schemes are an innovation that deserves some caution, given the lack of any guarantees and responsible parties to back them in the longer term or evidence that this isn’t just a Ponzi scheme.""            Estonia follows Russia's lead    With the statements, Estonia appears to be following its eastern neighbor Russia in taking a more skeptical approach to virtual currency. On 27th January, the Bank of Russia issued warnings suggesting bitcoin users could be unintentionally breaking laws by unknowingly aiding money launderers and terrorists.      However, not every influential economist in Russia has come out against virtual currencies. The head of Sberbank, the biggest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, had previously urged Russia not to restrict the growth of virtual currencies. Sberbank's head, German Gref, said:      “It’s a very interesting global experiment that breaks the paradigm of currency issuance.""            Estonia's economic outlook    Estonia was hit hard by the global recession, as its economy shrank by more than one-fifth from 2008 to 2009. The development lead to an economic downturn that was ""exacerbated by global slowdown"", according to the International Monetary Fund. The development all but wiped out the country's 7% growth from 2000 to 2007. As a result, bitcoin's sharp shifts in price have likely spooked regulators, who fear putting citizens at risk.      Nõmmela suggested that bitcoin users “can quickly lose it if, for example, his or her computer lacks the necessary anti-virus software or recovery options"".      Notably, Estonia also only recently joined the Euro, becoming a member in 2011.    Estonia's bitcoin population    With a population of just over 1 million residents, the news is unlikely to spark market movements. But it could have ramifications in Estonia, which finds itself in the middle of the pack of countries when it comes to bitcoin interest, research suggests.      Estonia ranks 58th in terms of official downloads of the bitcoin client and wallet, behind Solvenia, but ahead of its southern neighbor Latvia, with 114 downloads. However, LocalBitcoins shows just a small number - less than 10 - Estonians are active users of its platform in the country.

42376868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erQn,1391182558,"A Million is Never Enough, Chinese Laundry, and Bad Taste by Bitcoin","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 31st January 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    The dangers of thinking too small    Having your CEO arrested is rarely an on-message event. Even if you're the Mafia, such an event does call into question the core competencies of the central executive; for proper enterprises who live by the rule of law, it’s much worse.      A decent spin doctor can put a positive light on almost any mishap that becomes public with the company name attached, but when the head honcho can’t make a conference call because there’s no internet access in San Quentin – awkward.      Thus, the arrest of Charlie Shrem, CEO of Bitinstant and vice-chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation (not now, he isn’t) is a bit embarrassing for all concerned.      The Winklevii, investors in Bitinstant, and other high-profile connections have been busy issuing “Nothing to do with us, guv” press releases: a friend in need is rarely someone with much skin in the game.      The charges are: knowingly selling bitcoin to Silk Road people for nefarious use, operating an unlicensed currency transmission agency, and not telling the plods that bad things were afoot. Precisely the sort of thing that high-profile bitcoin names aren’t supposed to do.      Still – innocent until found guilty, and all that.      John Law would also like the jury of public opinion to remember that one of the accused’s potential sins was just not doing it enough.      If he’d followed the lead of HSBC’s CEO and presided over an operation which moved somewhere in the region of a billion dollars of Mexican drug money through its systems, then he’d have got away by saying “I’m profoundly sorry” and having his bank pay a fine.      A mere million from a bunch of punks on the Internet? Don’t make us laugh, say the Feds as they slap the cuffs on, while laughing.      (The HSBC story is a real hoot, by the way. The drug dealers actually built special containers designed to exactly fit the counter windows at the retail banks they used to deposit the cash, so they could unload as much dosh as possible daily. Who needs bitcoin?)      There are a couple of positive aspects, for those who wish bitcoin well. It disproves any remaining notion – still expressed by naysayers – that the authorities are helpless in the face of cybercurrencies and it’s a field day for the bad guys.      The Silk Road shakedown shows that good old-fashioned policing is more than up to the task of working through the consequences. It’s also very noticeable that those involved in the enforcement are at pains to say that bitcoin itself is not 'OMG Evil' and they can see its good side. Any moral panic has died aborning.    Scant comfort for Shrem, of course, who may be contemplating up to 25 years in the slammer should things not go his way.  If so, he’d be wise to dispose of the ring he wears which has his bitcoin password engraved on it – otherwise his nickname 'Four Finger Charlie' may yet come to pass.  Chinese whispers  More mysteries from the Middle Kingdom – just what’s driving some of the more unusual aspects of Chinese bitcoin trading volumes?  CoinDesk took a look and uncovered a familiar mix of accusations and counter-accusations – whether automated trading is being set up to mislead the market, or whether it’s all kosher and just happens to drive the market in certain ways and whether people are hiding what they’re doing or being open about it.  In part, this is typical of financial markets, where traders behave in ways that go right up to the edge of the permissible and on into the grey areas, at least until a regulator shuts them down or things go wrong anyway.    There is no doubt that interest in and demand for bitcoin is as feverish in China as anywhere. The Chinese government’s noted equivocation on the subject – at one moment promoting the idea by running educational TV programmes, the next telling the banks they may not trade with bitcoin exchanges – is sometimes explained by the country’s other currency problems.      That the renminbi must become a fully tradable currency at some point is not in doubt: that it is in no state to do that yet is also a commonplace. How much does the government fancy having an uncontrollable currency in widespread use when it’s having trouble riding herd on the official stuff?      But there could be another reason. Widespread reports are circulating (although not in China, where they’re repressed, foreign websites reporting them get cut off) of truly heroic personal fortunes being made by close relatives of the Chinese leadership.      Not only are the numbers staggering – one figure puts the total at around $4 trillion. Trillion! – but the cash is stashed in various foreign off-shore boltholes. As a result of the reports – which won’t go away – new requirements have come in for officials to declare their financial holdings.      Of course, one of the main problems with having huge amounts of ill-gotten hanging around is that it’s hard to move it when the dosh inspectors come looking.      It’s especially hard when locking down the currency and foreign transaction regulation is of public, overriding importance. Thus the reasoning goes, the more you can move into bitcoin before things get too sticky, the more you’ll take away.      Which, if true, explains both the intensive pressure on bitcoin price being driven by China, and the government’s express unease at either closing it down or opening it up. After all, stability and fiscal probity in the face of nepotistic kleptocracy is pretty much the definition of state responsibility. On the other hand, it is family.      The potential scale of the forces at work here is hard to comprehend – $4tn is capable of blowing a hole in any country’s stability, if not defused carefully, and really would push bitcoin prices out of known space if the above thinking has any basis in reality.      Or… well, look at North Korea’s approach to dealing with unhelpful members at the Christmas dinner table.      John Law cautions that rumours coming out of China are a poor basis for planning one’s pension, and that whatever happens will be both unexpected and with unknowable consequences.      However, it is vastly entertaining to watch. Here’s hoping that somewhere in the impenetrable Chinese state infrastructure there’s a native Edward Snowden at work. Is that too much to ask?    Fancy a flutter?    One of the joys of bitcoin is that one can pontificate endlessly on unknowables like Chinese politics, but it’s also very easy to make predictions that have a fighting chance of coming true, and remarkably quickly at that.      It doesn’t take any special skill, as bitcoin and its ilk are spreading like spots on a teenager. All you have to do is pick one area of human activity that hasn’t been bitcoined yet, and say confidently that it will. Because it will.      So, John Law has predicted the digicoinification of porn, legal drugs and gaming machines, only for them to come true mere weeks after he stuck his flag in the sand.      This week alone has seen Potcoin, which aims to be the currency of choice for captains of cannabis in those markets where weed is legal, and the advent of the Bitcoin Arcade Machine – which shows how easy and cheap it is to add bitcoin functionality to existing stuff.      In this case, the coin slot mechanism on gaming machines just sends electronic pulses to the machine’s logic saying when money’s been added: just program a Raspberry Pi to do the same when it validates a bitcoin transaction, and you’re done.      But even John Law at his most oracular, far-seeing, Nostradamus-nobbling best, failed to predict one particular product, now available for bitcoin. He wouldn’t normally mention it, except that it is unique, spectacularly gruesome, and has provoked the stern disapproval of CoinDesk’s editor and keeper of the godly, the wholesome and the correct. Which has only improved Law’s opinion of the product.      There is no way to dress up or disguise the horror, so here goes: Eyelashes For Cars. Huge, parodic, arching, plastic, headline-topping eyelashes for cars, available in a wide variety of colours and easy to install on any motor.      Readers of a certain age may remember the Compact Pussycat, the hyper-feminized vehicle of choice for Wacky Race’s Penelope Pitstop. It had eyelashes: for many decades, experts have concluded that here the concept had reached its natural end.      But no. It is a thing. The website claims that:      “Eyelashes on Car headlights are a growing trend with girls and you would be surprised at how many guys, all over the world. Whatever your personality, having these amazing car eyelashes on your headlights will make heads turn wherever you go. People will be pointing, other cars will be honking and children smiling everywhere you go.”              Well, yes, John Law would be surprised at how many guys. How many, guys? The site doesn’t actually say. The site also doesn’t mention the pointing, the ridicule, and the frequent need to comb out cyclist lycra from between the prongs.    It’s also unclear how the genesis of the headlamp merkin will affect the field of gender studies, already stretched by the advent of Truck Nutz (not, as far as is known, purchasable with bitcoins) as evidenced by academic Zachary Blairhttp://zacharyblair.weebly.com/curriculum-vitae.html’s seminal ""Junk in the Trunk: A Queer Exploration of Truck Nutz as Contemporary Material Culture"".    It is to be hoped that Zach can bring Eyelashes for Cars within his purview. Don’t just concentrate on the low-hanging fruit, man.      The only thing about Eyelashes for Cars that is more unsettling than the very fact of their existence is that someone, somewhere, is sitting in a factory making them.      Whatever you’re doing this weekend, and however deep the January blues have bit, take some comfort from this realisation: it isn’t you.

CoinDesk is attempting to verify the matter.  A new Hong Kong bitcoin exchange has launched after raising $2m in funding from local investors.  The exchange, HKCex, said the funds came from ""private financial institutions"" in the region.  HKCex is led by chief executive and chairman Pheng Cheah. The company said it will allow mainland China customers to open accounts and will also accept wire transfers from mainland bank accounts.  ""Mainland customers are welcome,"" said Lavin Lam, a marketing and PR spokesperson for the exchange.  HKCex will also allow customers to use deposit and withdraw funds to credit cards using a PayPal gateway. This requires a signed authorisation form for transactions, Lam said.  The new exchange will trade bitcoin, but it plans to include altcoins like litecoin, PPcoin, Novacoin and namecoin within a month of launching the service on 1st March.  The funds will be spent on building the exchange's trading infrastructure (alongside a merchant platform and marketing costs). The firm said its goal is to be the world's ""most secure bitcoin trading platform"".  It will rely on two-factor authentication, AES-256 encryption, SSL connections and cold storage. CEO Cheah said in a press release announcing the funding round:  ""It is no secret nowadays there are several large exchanges in the world, however all of them experience difficulties working with fiat currencies. Our exchange won't have these shortcomings.""  HKCex enters the scene in the wake of increasing activity among Hong Kong exchanges. AsiaNexgen, for example, gave out $65,000 worth of bitcoin vouchers on the streets of the city to celebrate Chinese New Year in what it claimed was the biggest giveaway of the digital currency to date.  The city will reportedly get a bitcoin ATM this month as well. Exchanges on mainland China have been in flux lately as they grapple with regulators' edicts restricting dealing in bitcoin by financial institutions.

42376862,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erKV,1391173073,Bullion Exchange Brings Ripple into the Physical World,"A new service launching in Singapore today uses the Ripple network to acquire, store and convert precious metals into any currency for customers anywhere in the world.  Ripple Singapore  is a new kind of Ripple 'gateway’, which is the name given to the exchange network's entry and exit points. It's Singapore's first major gateway, and the first in the world to offer trade in precious metals.  Users maintain a balance in a Ripple wallet (similar to a bitcoin wallet), while the bullion itself is vaulted in Singapore. They can then use that balance to pay anyone instantly in any currency available on Ripple, or trade the bullion itself. Ripple Singapore's model charges 0.2% per transaction, and nothing for vault storage.  There are two ways to buy bullion with Ripple Singapore: Directly via its 'Bullion Counter' (for a minimum 10oz of gold/platinum or 500oz of silver), or indirectly from other users, with no minimum at all. Anyone who wants to take physical delivery of their bullion may do that too, with two working days' notice.  Ripple Singapore is open to users in any country, though there is an identification and verification process to comply with Singapore regulations. Co-founder James Cox is a big believer in both precious metals' stability as a store of value and the integrity of the Ripple Network's technology.  ""We believe and hope that gold and silver offer a stable store of value that have proven themselves over thousands of years,"" he said.  Ripple Singapore has partnered with Silver Bullion Pte Ltd to store all metals. Gold and platinum are held at the Certis CISCO Center II (operated by Singapore's Auxiliary Police) and silver at Ferrari Logistics. Currency balances are kept with Singapore's OCBC Bank, the country's oldest.  Safe jurisdiction  Ripple  has so far been used only to exchange currencies (both fiat and digital) but, in theory, it can be used to exchange any item of value for any other – provided someone is offering it. Cox said Ripple Singapore capitalizes on the ""huge advantage"" of Singapore's investor-friendly tax regime and its growing reputation as Asia's precious metals hub:  ""Everyone still needs to do their due diligence on taxes in their own local area, of course, but in Singapore there's 0% tax on investment-grade bullion, and Ripple Singapore charge 0% vaulting fee. Ripple Singapore will cover costs via the 0.2% transaction fee.""  ""Singapore is the ideal place for this – it's a very safe jurisdiction legally, has a fantastic reputation in the financial space, and there's huge demand for gold and silver in Asia and particularly Southeast Asia right now.""  To 'establish a trustline', or exchange value, on the Ripple Network, users must spend a small amount of its native currency, XRP. Ripple Singapore will even supply the XRP to its users at no cost to get things moving.  Cox explained XRP simply: ""Imagine each transaction on Ripple is a sealed envelope going from A to B, and XRP is the stamp on that envelope. The network is neutral regarding the the sender, receiver or the contents or value of the letter, it still requires an XRP stamp.""  ""We will be giving away free XRP to our customers so they can get started without further ado. We hope our new customers enjoy that.""  Ripple  The Ripple Network itself is an open-source, decentralized distributed currency exchange, payment system and remittance network upon which anything of value can be traded. Ripple Singapore, however, is perhaps the first major gateway to demonstrate its utility in the physical world.  Cox believes the absence of an internet protocol for exchanging value has led to an imbalance of value around the world; something Ripple's technology will help to restore.  ""SMTP allows us to send email messages, HTTP allows us to see websites. Via the internet we've been blessed with the ability to exchange information but not value.""  He added: ""So we've lost track of value. It's led to a wacky, even out-of-kilter kind of world where an ounce of silver is worth less than a cocktail in some places, and an acre of farmland in one place is worth less than a handbag elsewhere. Now Ripple allows us to send value, it will play a part in helping restore balance and sanity.""  He added that five years from now, having a Ripple address will be as essential as an email address has become today.

42376861,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erJF,1391167801,Vancouver ATM Operator Wants to Leave Bitstamp Following Breakdown,"Customers were unable to buy bitcoin from Vancouver's bitcoin ATM last weekend because its operator was unable to clear a backlog of buy orders.  The machine's operator, Bitcoiniacs, said the problem arose because the ATM relies on Bitstamp to clear its orders, and the exchange had allowed orders amounting to more than 45 BTC to pile up without being processed.  Bitcoiniacs uses a Robocoin machine, which is able to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency. Robocoin machines perform trades on the Bitstamp exchange by default. According Mitchell Demeter, co-founder of Bitcoiniacs, the exchange stopped processing buy orders for bitcoin from the ATM on 21st January.  The unprocessed orders eventually piled up to more than 45 BTC, he added. “We had several clients very concerned as they had deposited thousands of dollars and days later there was no sign of their coins.""  Zero response  Bitcoiniacs contacted Bitstamp repeatedly, but received ""zero response"" according to a reddit post by Bitcoiniacs announcing the ATM shutdown. The post read:  ""Unfortunately, due to a massive delay in processing at Bitstamp, and ZERO response to repeated contact requests from anyone in the management or customer service there, we've had to shut down the buying option at Vancouver's bitcoin ATM at Waves Coffee.""  Bitcoiniacs stopped allowing buy trades through its ATM from the afternoon of 24th until the morning of 27th January. According to Demeter, around 80 clients were affected by the delayed transaction.  He said he received another 50 inquiries from customers who wanted to know when the ATM would resume executing buy orders for bitcoin. However, Demeter added that his customers responded calmly to the delay.  ""The delay was fairly well received by most clients. Most people understand when dealing with a third-party, some things are out of our control.""  When CoinDesk contacted Bitstamp chief executive Nejc Kodric to corroborate Bitcoiniacs' claims, he refused to comment. Another inquiry, to Bitstamp's, general support e-mail address, was also met with a refusal to comment:  ""Unfortunately, Bitstamp is unable to comment any of the points in your inquiry. For more information we kindly suggest you contact the ATM service directly.""  Solutions  Both Robocoin and Bitstamp could have implemented measures to prevent the backlog of transactions from building up, Demeter argued. One method would have been to create a 'hot wallet' which would allow coins to accumulate in the ATM operator's Bitstamp account.  This would effectively create a 'buffer' of a number of bitcoins to service withdrawal transactions. Withdrawals would come from this hot wallet, as opposed to sales from Bitstamp's open market. One drawback, however, is that hot wallets have been targeted by hackers in the past.  The other method Demeter suggested was for Bitstamp to 'whitelist' the ATM operator's account. This would signal to the exchange that the account was vouched for, and activity (such as an unusually large number of transactions) would not set off a red flag.  ""[Being whitelisted] would mean our account would not get flagged as spam due to a large frequency of withdrawals.""  Bitcoiniacs said it would leave Bitstamp in response to the recent uncleared backlog and other problems it experienced in the past. It launched an exchange called Cointraderhttps://www.cointrader.net/about last month to handle transactions for its ATMs.  The exchange will also be aimed at other bitcoin businesses operating ATMs or brokerages. Demeter said the exchange will have bank accounts in the UK and Canada to service European and North American customers respectively.  It will also be able to take AstroPay transactions for customers in South America. Cointrader is set for a relaunch on 10th February to gain more exposure and liquidity, Demeter said, adding:  ""As soon as we have enough liquidity built up on Cointrader, we will be switching all of our ATMs and brokerage offices over to that.""  The Vancouver machine is the world's first bitcoin ATM. It was installed in the Waves coffee house last October. It attracted attention when it reportedly took more than $1m Canadian dollars within its first 29 days of operation. Operators have sprung up around Canada since then.

42376860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erHz,1391162613,You Can Now Pump Gas for Bitcoin in the Rocky Mountains,"A gas station in the US now lets customers fill up with bitcoin, making it likely to be the first business that allows the purchase of fossil fuel using cryptocurrency.  The station has completed eight transactions since it began accepting bitcoin at the start of January, according to the store's owner, Shahzad Sarwar.  “I started taking bitcoin, above all, to support the bitcoin community,” he said.  The gas station, in Greeley, Colorado, is called Cosmic Market and also has a convenience store attached. Here you will find proof of Sarwar's fervent support for the digital currency writ large on the wall. “Bitcoin accepted here. Take the power back. Let the banks eat cake!” a poster proudly proclaims.  The number of Cosmic Market customers that have the ability to pay in bitcoin is tiny right now, but they are certainly happy that such a service exists. When Sarwar announced his unique ability to take bitcoin payments for fuel, one redditor commented on the thread:  “I have bought gas from here using bitcoin. I feel lucky living so close to one of the first gas stations in the country to accept bitcoin.”  It’s not just ideology that led Sarwar to start bitcoin transactions, though. Bitcoin payments could also potentially save him a significant amount on credit card transaction fees, he said.  Sarwar has a day job as a software engineer; the Cosmic Market is just a sideline and ending up as a gas station owner was never part of his life plan.  “I bought the store out of pure stupidity,” he said. “But I have learned a lot since. The gas station business is very competitive and it is very hard to make money,” he said.  As the first gas station owner to accept digital currency, it’s perhaps not surprising that Sarwar thinks differently in other ways too.  The strategy he has employed to increase profits at the Cosmic Market is to expand the retail floor space from 320 to 2,500 sq ft, and to stock what he calls ‘unique items', such as insect candy and colourful smoking paraphernalia.  How about four wafers coated in white chocolate and studded with milk chocolate-covered ants? “It’s disgusting but I know you want one!” Sarwar wrote on the Cosmic Market blog.  “It’s just for fun and to make customers smile,” he said of the novelty snack. And if the urge takes you, you can buy that with bitcoin too, he adds.  Last July, CoinDesk asked whether bitcoin would ever be used at gas pumps. Shahzad Sarwar has now made that a reality.

42376853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6er7v,1391152234,Community Debates What's Next After New York Hearings,"The dust has settled from the virtual currency hearings in New York City this week. We saw a mixture of speakers, including law enforcement agents warning of digital currencies' many potential dangers, VCs getting hot under the collar over the regulation debate, regulators musing about whether they should license miners or not, and one vehemently anti-bitcoin academic.  New York state has almost 20 million people - around 6% of the US population - and houses the heart of its financial services industry. It was a good place for the first state-level inquiry into the regulation of decentralized digital currencies, which is the area of greatest uncertainty for companies trying to operate in the space.  The whole purpose of the hearings was to better inform a financial regulator that is planning to introduce regulation on digital currencies this year. Nominally termed 'Bitlicenses', it's likely that they'll differ in form from existing regulation. But is that what people want? And now that the hearings are over, what happens next?  ""Existing regulation is too cumbersome and takes too long for companies in the cryptocurrency space,"" said Charles Lee, inventor of litecoin, and an employee at Coinbase, who testified at the hearings.  Lee favours a Bitlicense approach, with caveats. ""One year is a really long time in this space, so new licenses would be good as long as they are easier to obtain. The key thing though is that the new licenses should replace the current money transmitter licenses,"" he said.  ""If the bitcoin/litecoin company had to apply for both a bitlicense and a money transmitter license, then that will make things worse and not better.""  Marco Santori, chair of the regulatory affairs committee at the Bitcoin Foundation and an attorney at NYC law firm Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP, submitted written testimony to the hearings but didn't speak personally. He takes an opposing view.  ""We should applaud DFS for joining the conversation on digital currency that has been going on at the federal level for some time. Federal regulators have uniformly stated - and the Foundation agrees - that no new regulations are required for digital currency businesses,"" he said.  Santori criticized the DFS for not taking a firm position on how or whether existing laws apply to digital currency businesses. ""Before we ask whether we ought to have new regulation and special licenses, though, shouldn't we first decide whether and how the current laws apply?""  From cryptocurrency 1.0 to 2.0  That's like trying to tie red tape around a moving bullet. The signs are that technology development in the already dynamic decentralized currency space is accelerating. Bitcoin is not even yet mainstream, and yet there is already a second generation of digital currencies emerging that are already promising new features.  Initiatives like Mastercoin and Ethereum are offering more flexible block chain structures, with fundamentally different ways of operating, including apps and storage mechanisms that migrate on and off of the block chain. In some cases, these mechanisms are morphing on the drawing board. In the meantime, regulators this week were still pondering whether regulations should require cryptocurrencies to have a block chain.  ""They've spent the last 50 years very carefully building a system to control the flow of money, and many billions of dollars went into this,"" said Charlies Hoskinson, who is leading Ethereum.  All that is about to be turned on its head, he argued. ""They understood this was going to be big, but they have no idea what to do about it.""  Let the code take care of it?  So, why not simply let the technology take care of the problem? Some people believe in reducing the policy-level regulation to a bare minimum, and instead prefer the idea of driving regulation into the code itself. Let the technology handle it - it's more scalable that way, said Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson. Lamenting having to fill out five forms to open a bank account recently, he advocated something that could handle AML and KYC in code, rather than relying on archaic paperwork.  Will that work? Best ask a coder.  ""To a certain degree, yes. But because bitcoin/litecoin is a decentralized system, any thing that is put into code can be rejected by the community,"" said Lee, whose employer is a portfolio firm of Wilson's. But it depends how it's done.  ""For example, if you were to force everyone to have KYC in each address in the bitcoin block chains, the community would likely fork bitcoin to not have that or just support another crypto currency that doesn't have it. So there's only so much you can do in code.""  Yet those on the side of more stringent regulation are certainly eager to drive ID and verification further into the block chain, closer to the technology itself. District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr recommended at the hearing that the state verifies the owners of specific bitcoin addresses.  That made the founders of CoinValidation happy. That firm, which we wrote about in November, wants to offer that service, although it's a suggestion that angered community commenters when CoinValidation first announced itself.  Nevertheless CoinApex, an incubator which houses the firm, highlighted Vance's comments on its blog, inviting companies to get in touch.  Outsourced compliance  Others seek to outsource the whole compliance effort for startups in less controversial ways, helping them to handle the paperwork associated with federal (and, when it's finally thrashed out, state) licensing. The Winklevoss brothers floated the idea of outsourcing compliance at the hearings.  Brian Stoeckert, co-founder of NYC-based coin compliance consulting firm CoinComply, launched the firm last May. It handles the operational side of compliance, enabling young digital currency companies to concentrate on the other aspects of their business.  [post-quote]  Stoeckert addressed one aspect of the debate, which was the need for consistency across the various states. Members of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), which help to co-ordinate banking rules in various states, are exploring digital currency compliance rules.  Be warned, said Stoeckert - incumbent financial services firms in those states would be unlikely to let that go without a fight.  ""You have the traditional remittance businesses that have had to invest significant resources,"" he said. ""That's an area where lobbyists might come through and say 'hey, why are you carving out new rules for these groups?'.""  Federal and state law  Even getting to a uniform state policy may be tricky. Wilson suggested 'on-ramp' regulation that would impose gentler requirements on startup firms providing digital currency services in the financial services space. It seems unfair for the Coinsetters of the world to jump through the same regulatory hoops as the JP Morgans, for example.  ""One thing that regulators have learned over the years is that regulations should be scaled to the size of the company they apply to,"" agreed Houman B. Shadab. The associate professor of law at the New York Law School and co-director of the Center for Business and Financial Law is a member of the Bitcoin NYC meetup group that convenes at 40 Broad Street, the heart of the city's bitcoin community.  ""If they are not, incumbents will have the advantage over startups, and that would seem to be particularly harmful for the bitcoin economy,"" he added.  But Santori argues that this could balkanize states and hinder the inter-state consistency that digital currency firms are looking for. ""I think we ought to question whether that would be a genuine benefit if it would just lead to more uneven treatment among the states and further entrench the 50-state licensing requirement in the US,"" he warned.

42376865,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erN1,1391127476,"FinCEN Declares Bitcoin Miners, Investors Aren't Money Transmitters","The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published two new rulings on 30th January that aim to bring clarity as to which players in the virtual currency space will fall under the Bank Secrecy Act's (BSA) definition of a money transmitter.      FinCEN said that miners who mine virtual currency for their own use, as well as companies that purchase and sell convertible virtual currency solely as an investment aren't subject to this law.      ""The first ruling states that, to the extent a user creates or “mines” a convertible virtual currency solely for a user’s own purposes, the user is not a money transmitter under the BSA. The second states that a company purchasing and selling convertible virtual currency as an investment exclusively for the company’s benefit is not a money transmitter,"" the release states.              The announcement sought to bring clarity to the organization's March 2013 announcement that money services businesses were responsible for complying with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under FinCEN regulation.    Initial reaction  Reddit commentators greeted the news positively, with some going so far as to call the announcement ""a huge victory"" for the virtual currency community, removing a potentially large burdens from the mining and investment communities.  Members of the mining business community also greeted the news with favor:  ""We're happy that FinCEN has clarified what we believe was their intention all along and that Bitcoin miners can now continue mining confidently,"" Jeff Ownby, vice president of marketing at Butterfly Labs, told CoinDesk.  However, while some were optimistic, others implied that this is just the latest development in legal grounds that are likely to shift as more government bodies seek clarity on the matter and await guidance from higher authorities.  Impact on mining  While FinCEN's declaration will be welcomed by bitcoiners, it may be of little importance to individual miners who never viewed themselves as money transmitters in the first place. However, the statements may not be the last word on how bitcoin miners are regulated.  Bitcoin mining is becoming an increasingly institutionalized pursuit that takes places in Hong Kong shipping containers and geothermal-powered Icelandic caves, driven by multimillion-dollar mining businesses. Such operations are definitely not mining for their own personal use.  Because of these changes, bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik suggested that more clarity will be needed from FinCEN:  ""I hope to see future additional clarity from FinCEN and IRS vis-a-vis mining pools vs. miners. Most 'miners' today do not have any power to select or validate bitcoin transactions. Miners today provide a computing service to the mining pools, in exchange for a difficulty-based revenue stream.""  Impact on regulation  Notably, the FinCEN guidance will prevent regulations in states such as New York from implementing strong oversight on the mining community. At this week's New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings, general counsel Daniel Alter seemed to express the most interest in putting controls on this sector of the industry, as he suggested miners may have the ability to ""destabilize"" bitcoin.  ""Mining strikes me as a systemic threat. I think from our perspective we are concerned about systemic issues,"" Alter said.  Judith Rinearson  , partner at Bryan Cave, argued against these suggestions and for a measure most like the one FinCEN provided.  ""Unless a miner is actually mining and selling or exchanging, I wouldn't require anything, especially those who are mining for their own use,"" Rinearson said.  Jeremy Liew  , of Lightspeed Venture Partners, expressed satisfaction with the ruling. The investor directed many of his comments at the NYDFS hearings to attempting to limit regulation on the virtual currency industry.  ""These are good common sense clarifications that reflect FinCEN's growing understanding of the way that digital currencies work,"" Liew said.  To read the full release, click here.
