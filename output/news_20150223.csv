42398231,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvUy,1424730339,Bitcoin Miner Aquifer Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy,"Bitcoin mining company Aquifer LLC has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, Aquifer, also known as AQH, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on 19th February.  The company claimed between $1m and $10m in assets, as well as between $1m and $10m in outstanding liabilities. The company has between one and 49 creditors, the filing stated.  Aquifer said in court documents that it expects to have enough funds on hand to repay unsecured creditors. The filing names a number of California-based vendors and service providers, as well as other creditors located in the United States.  Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Aquifer is one of several mining companies involved in MegaBigPower’s franchisee program. When the program was announced in the summer of 2014, Aquifer was described as a “strategic partner”. According to MBP, Aquifer was the recipient of more than 700 TH/s in mining power since the partnership began.  MBP owner Dave Carlson told CoinDesk that he was unaware of the bankruptcy filing and had been unable to communicate with the Aquifer team in the past month, adding that the hashing power the MBP mining pool had received from Aquifer dropped off roughly two weeks ago.  ""My focus will be to attempt to recover my equipment from their location,"" he said.  A representative for Aquifer declined to comment.  The California bitcoin company has maintained a public profile in the past with appearances at recent bitcoin-focused events, including head of finance and operations Anthony Borough's participation on the mining panel at the North American Bitcoin Conference in January.  Aquifer is the second US-based bitcoin mining company to file for bankruptcy in 2015. Last month, CoinTerra filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection amid a deterioration of its finances and a lawsuit filed by C7 Data Centers of Utah.

42398230,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvT0,1424724021,Blockchain Reports 3 Millionth Bitcoin Wallet,"Wallet software provider Blockchain has opened its three millionth bitcoin wallet, having doubled downloads in less than a year.  The company has seen continued demand since bitcoin's 2013 price spike, passing the 1.5 million milestone in April. Rival Coinbase currently lists 2.5 million wallets in the wild.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Peter Smith could not confirm how many of Blockchain's wallet accounts are active (ie contain funds) for privacy reasons. However, he pointed to record-breaking transaction volume as a sign of bitcoin's user growth.  ""You can look to the 140% (approx.) year-over-year growth in the number of transactions powered by our software daily to get a sense for activity, which, as a company focused on making it easy to transact, is really encouraging,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/23/blockchain-reports-3-millionth-bitcoin-wallet,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvTz,1424710987,Bitcoin.de Launches Integration With Fidor Bank Accounts,"Bitcoin.de  's long-standing partnership with Fidor Bank has finally borne fruit, with the company claiming it is the world’s first bitcoin trading platform with a ""direct connection to the classic banking system"".  Bitcoin.de says the arrangement brings a far faster service, allowing EUR/BTC trades to be completed within ""seconds"" when both customers have a free 'FIDOR Smart Giro Account'.    Extra security is also promised, with customers' funds staying within their Fidor Bank accounts, rather than being held by a centralised body, such as an exchange.      In the case of insolvency or security breach, Bitcoin.de points out, those funds are all too easily lost, with no guarantee of return. The same applies should a bitcoin exchange prove fraudulent, as was alleged recently in Hong Kong.      Accounts held at Fidor Bank – which, as a licensed German bank, is highly regulated – are covered by a ""standard deposit security of €100,000"".      To put this arrangement in place, took over one and a half years of development work, with regulatory requirements being taken into account and a new set of Terms and Conditions being created for the business, according to Bitcoin.de.    'Massively enhanced security'    Oliver Flaskämper, board member of Bitcoin Deutschland AG, said.      “That is not only good news for all bitcoin fans, but also good news for FinTech companies based in Germany. Together with the right partners more is possible in Germany than one might think.”              Fidor Bank CEO Matthias Kröner explained that, in the bitcoin environment, conducting money transactions promptly from one bank customer to another enhances security ""massively"".      ""As such,"" he said, ""Fidor Bank is setting a further milestone in digital banking”.      Bitcoin.de is a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform that allows bitcoin buyers and sellers to deal directly with one another, rather than dealing with the company, as is the case with bitcoin exchanges.    Crypto-friendly bank  In October 2013, digital currency exchange Kraken also forged a partnership with Fidor to offer its European customers regulated bitcoin trading services.  Unlike most other banks globally, Fidor seems very open to cryptocurrency business, as well as the technology itself. In May of last year, it became the first bank to integrate Ripple's payment protocol, allowing its customers to instantly send any currency in any amount through the bank's money transfer system.  Kröner said at the time:  ""Ripple enables us to securely and instantly send money anywhere in the world at no additional cost and through the same customer facing products and relationships we offer today.""  Finding solutions to risks of centralising customers' funds in a single company's bank account seems to be a growing trend. In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchange Gatecoin recently launched, promising segregated bank accounts for customers, and notably covering 40 countries across the globe.  Gatecoin  is a licensed Money Services Operator in Hong Kong, meaning it is monitored by the country's Customs and Excise Department.

42398234,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvYu,1424700808,Bitcoin Payment Option Disappears from WordPress Platform,"WordPress, the web's most popular blogging system, has removed bitcoin from its payments options at checkout.  The open-source platform, which supports over 60 million websites, became one of bitcoin's first high-profile advocates when it announced it would accept the digital currency for premium features in November 2012.  It had listed the currency alongside PayPal and major credit and debit cards, however the bitcoin tab has now mysteriously vanished. Third-party plugins that use bitcoin still appear to be running.  A blog post outlining the digital currency's benefits, including that fact it ""[runs] on open source software, just like WordPress"", now redirects to information on traditional payment methods.  BitPay partnership  Despite the disappearance, BitPay, the company that exchanges WordPress' bitcoin payments into fiat currency, still lists the platform as one of 50,000 partners on its homepage.  Additionally, a search on the WordPress Plugin Directory brings up 103 plugins related to the digital currency, including PayStand.  Cryptocurrency tipping on Gravatar, a universal avatar service owned by WordPress' parent company Automattic, is also still active. Users were given the ability to add their bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin addresses into their Gravatar profiles early last year.    Some bitcoin-accepting companies have reported a lacklustre performance following the initial PR boost, with Overstock revising its sales figures from $10–$15m to $3m as purchases slowed in 2014.      Whether this change signals poor bitcoin sales for WordPress or an unrelated move away from digital currencies, remains unclear.    WordPress and BitPay have been contacted for comment, however no responses had been received at press time.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42398226,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvO5,1424691009,E-Commerce Giant Rakuten Says Bitcoin Acceptance Likely,"The CEO of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten has repeated his conglomerate's intention to ""probably"" accept bitcoin at some stage, at a company financial conference in Tokyo today.  Without disclosing a specific timeframe in which it might happen, company CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said: “We are thinking about [accepting bitcoin] and we probably will.”  The CEO, one of Japan's wealthiest individuals, previously revealed his interest in bitcoin in a speech last July.  According to a Wall Street Journal report, Rakuten has formed a department to study digital currencies and has invested in US-based bitcoin ventures, including Bitnet.  The Rakuten Financial Conference brought together high profile figures from the international payments industry, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and James Anderson, senior VP for mobile and emerging payments at MasterCard.  While a number of possibilities relating to the future of payments were discussed at the half-day event, a key component was a panel focusing on bitcoin, featuring Bitnet CEO John McDonnell. Also present were Yukio Noguchi, an economist formerly with Japan's Ministry of Finance, and representatives from Japan's digital currency industry self-regulatory body, the Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA).  Xapo  CEO Wences Casares was due to attend but missed the event due to ""flight issues"".  Speakers at the conference also discussed Japanese consumers' love of cash and loyalty point systems, something that often mystifies tourists and newcomers to the country.  Bitcoin became a somewhat notorious issue in the country following the Mt Gox debacle and its aftermath, but has otherwise been received favorably by politicians, avoiding overt regulation so far.  Rakuten, which is often considered a rival to Amazon, has over 10,000 employees and 40 businesses around the world. In Japan it operates a bank, an insurance company, and even a professional baseball team.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/23/e-commerce-giant-rakuten-says-bitcoin-acceptance-likely,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
