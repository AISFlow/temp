42431815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fnh,1587840670,Bitcoin Miner Maker Ebang Files for a $100M US IPO,"Ebang International Holdings, one of the leading manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, is taking another stab at going public, this time farther from home and with a smaller fundraising target.      The Hangzhou, China-based firm aims to raise up to $100 million from an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S., according to an April 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Chinese firm would be listed under the ticker symbol EBON on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Loop Capital Markets in Chicago and AMTD Global Markets in Hong Kong are the underwriters on the deal.      This is Ebang’s second attempt to go public after it failed to do so on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in June 2018. The target proceeds from that would-be IPO were estimated to be $1 billion.       Founded in 2010, Ebang is among the earliest China-based hardware companies, such as Bitmain and Canaan Creative, to make application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips and fabless integrated circuits (ICs) for bitcoin mining machines. Chinese miners contribute over 65 percent of the computing power on the Bitcoin network.       Ebang generates over 82 percent of its revenue from making bitcoin miners. It raked in $109 million in revenue last year, down nearly 66 percent from 2018. Its net loss for 2019 more than tripled to $41.1 million, according to the filing.       The firm confidentially filed for the IPO in February without disclosing pricing terms, according to Renaissance Capital.     Second chances     Ebang is one of several crypto companies that failed to launch an IPO in Hong Kong and later came to the U.S. for another shot.       Rival bitcoin miner makers Bitmain and Canaan Creative tried to go public on HKEX but their plans fell through because local regulators were reluctant to allow any crypto-related company listings.       Canaan later managed to launch its IPO on Nasdaq last December.       Huobi Group, one of the top crypto exchanges by volume, acquired a Hong Kong-based electronics manufacturer last year in a bid to get listed through a reverse takeover.       However, the process has been put on hold due to strict mergers-and-acquisitions regulations.    Risk factors    While Ebang is unsure of what impact the upcoming halving in May would have on bitcoin’s price, the firm sees ever-changing regulations in China, potential sharp drops in the price and the COVID-19 pandemic as substantial risk factors for its revenue streams, according to the filing.       “The significant drop in the bitcoin price is expected to have a negative effect on the value of our bitcoin mining machine inventory and incentivize us to increase credit sales,” the firm said in the filing, referring to the March market crash.       The Chinese government once planned to phase out crypto mining businesses and did not change the provision until several months ago. Varying policies from different provinces also pose a challenge for bitcoin miners.       For example, Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China, one of the main areas that offer cheap electricity for mining farms, warned local mining enterprises that were operating illegally to close their operations before Aug. 30, 2018. Many small miners that did not register with the local government were considered illegal at the time.       The coronavirus outbreak in China has delayed the delivery of mining machines from almost all the manufacturers to their clients.       “The outbreak of coronavirus COVID-19 in China has resulted in a severe disruption of social and economic activities in China,” according to the filing.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/25/bitcoin-miner-maker-ebang-files-for-a-100m-us-ipo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80365602cf1c4df808635c0aa9b83d4102c07c9b-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431807,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fVh,1587835229,"New Crypto Bridge Will Make Tether Transactions Cheaper, CTO Says","Tether's CTO hopes a new EOS-Bitcoin interoperability bridge could one day make tether cheaper and faster because users will be able to make transactions on less-congested blockchains.      Paolo Ardoino, who is also the CTO of Tether's sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, told CoinDesk this is part of the reason he has been working with the team behind the token wrapper project, pTokens, to develop an interoperability bridge between the Bitcoin and EOS networks.      Launching Friday, the company will initially support a bitcoin wrapper on the EOS mainnet – pBTC. Essentially, a user will be able to deposit funds in one network, say Bitcoin, and pToken will issue the user the equivalent amount of ""wrapped"" tokens on the new network. The company hopes to support a bridge between litecoin and EOS, as well as EOS and ethereum.      An EOS wrapper for a tether ERC20 token is currently being planned, according to pTokens' website. Founder Thomas Bertani told CoinDesk there were no plans yet to consider developing an EOS wrapper for tether on Omni, a secondary layer on top of the Bitcoin protocol.      See also: Tether CTO Claims USDT Stablecoin Can Boost DeFi Liquidity      A key benefit of interoperability is users can better leverage the different characteristics of different blockchains, Ardoino said. One of the initial reasons Tether created an ERC20 version in 2017 was so it could sidestep the congested Bitcoin network.      ""Omni was costing a lot of money, up to $500, Ethereum wasn't so saturated, so the fees were cheap. Every trader would have preferred to move the funds onto the Ethereum blockchain because it was cheaper and faster,"" Ardoino said.      Ethereum speeds slowed due to network congestion by the end of 2017, however. Creating an interoperability bridge between it and EOS – which has higher throughput and much less chain activity – essentially provides users with a ""backup"" option, so they can continue to trade with minimal fees and quick settlement times, he claimed.      Many crypto exchanges, including Bitfinex, already offer users two different types of tether, so the ability to swap between protocols already exists in some form. However, interoperability bridges make it easier for users themselves to move between the different protocols.      Ardoino foresees Bitfinex and Tether will continue to perform chain swaps. Major exchanges looking to swap $10 million worth of tether between two chains will always be able to organize it with them directly, he said.      But, he added, greater interoperability will allow retail investors with smaller amounts of tether to also shift freely between the different blockchains.      See also: Tether Stablecoin Launches on Its Seventh Blockchain      Ardoino hopes his involvement with pTokens might encourage other developers to build bridges to other protocols, creating greater connections between all the different chains. Enhancing interoperability may one day act as the bridge for tether to launch on many other new protocols, he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/25/new-crypto-bridge-will-make-tether-transactions-cheaper-cto-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf77cc4ef13d5a96ead8a667b3bb59bacd91731e-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6ffh,1587805564,"SEC, Kik Continue Court Clash Over $100M Kin Token Sale","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Kik Interactive are both doubling down on their desire for a speedy resolution to a nine-month-old legal case over whether Kik’s 2017 initial coin offering was a securities sale.      The SEC and Kik both filed oppositions to the other party’s motions for summary judgement late Friday, reiterating their arguments in the case and their respective takes on whether statements collected during the court battle to date are complete and accurate.      In the SEC’s view, kin would have no value if it wasn’t for Kik’s efforts to “champion” the ecosystem, writing, “at no point during its marketing campaign did Kik identify any specific good or service that could be purchased with kin.”      The SEC first filed suit against Kik in June 2019, months after letting the startup know it was investigating whether the $100 million kin token sale was an unregistered offering of securities.      In its filing Friday, the regulator said that “all persons and entities that bought Kin through the $100 million offering (‘Kin investors’) (1) made an investment of money (2) in a common venture (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” referring to the three-pronged Howey Test (the U.S. Supreme Court-based evaluation of whether something is a security or not).      “Kik does not dispute that it conducted the 2017 offering through interstate commerce, or that it offered and sold securities to the SAFT participants,” the SEC said. “Rather, Kik now seeks summary judgment on the sole grounds that (A) it did not offer and sell investment contracts to the public investors, and (B) the portion of its offering to the SAFT participants qualified for an exemption from registration.”      The SEC believes these grounds are insufficient. The regulator also filed a number of exhibits on Friday to bolster its case.      According to one of these exhibits, Kik began 2018 with $34.9 million in a TD Bank account in Ontario, Canada. This number fell to $15.97 million by August 2018, meaning Kik spent close to $19 million in that eight-month period. The filing does not specify whether the amounts are in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars.    ‘Not an offering’    Kik, for its part, maintains the SEC cannot prove it led its customers to expect profits or it entered into a common enterprise with its customers, two of the tenets of the Howey Test.      “The SEC’s motion for summary judgment should be denied because it has not presented facts demonstrating that either transaction (the Pre-sale or TDE [token distribution event]) required registration with the SEC,” it said in its filing.      The company, which actually sold off the messaging app portion of its business late last year, and its founder Ted Livingston has said kin is used as a currency and has been since its launch.      Kik said in its filing it conducted two transactions: The first was a private sale to accredited investors prior to the launch of kin. These were treated as securities pursuant to federal law. Its “second, separate transaction.”      “The second transaction, having been conducted after the infrastructure for Kin already existed, and given that it was merely a sale of goods to the public, was not an offering of securities,” Kik’s filing said. “Thus, the sale did not require registration with the SEC.”      Kik said its own marketing materials actually said it “would be just one of many developers and participants contributing to the success of the Kin economy.”      The company claims this means its customers would know Kik alone would not “be responsible for managing” this economy.      The filing claims that because the two sales were “discrete,” each sale must be evaluated separately. In particular, the filing says the sales “did not involve the ‘issuance of the same class of securities,’” and were made for different purposes.      As a result, they must be evaluated separately against the SEC’s claim that the company violated the Securities Act of 1933, Kik argues.      Moreover, Kik said in its filing it was not warned appropriately that its sales might be a securities sale.      “The SEC’s Motion fails to establish that Kik was provided adequate notice to Kik that the particular facts and circumstances of its sale of Kin would constitute an ‘investment contract.’ This factual dispute alone precludes summary judgment in the SEC’s favor,” the filing said.    Factual statements    Both parties also filed their respective responses to 56.1 material – statements Kik and the SEC filed to support their motions for summary judgement. The responses outline whether the entities agree that the statements the other made are factual, or whether they have a disagreement.      Here, too, the parties diverged in their assessments. Kik said that while it might not dispute some of the statements filed by the SEC, “many of them are wholly immaterial to the discrete issues in the Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment: whether Kik's Sales of the token Kin in 2017 constituted an ‘investment contract.’”      It pointed to some purchaser expectations of profit, claiming there is legal support for the argument that Kik cannot be responsible for what some purchasers expect if it does not promise a profit.      As such, many of its responses say, “Undisputed. Kik objects to this statement as irrelevant and immaterial to whether Kik’s sales of kin constituted an ‘investment contract,’” throughout the document.      The SEC, for its part, felt a number of statements made by Kik were incomplete. A number of its responses to Kik read, “The SEC does not controvert the assertions contained ... but they are incomplete and, as such, misleading.”      These statements include Kik’s notes on its marketing materials and white paper for kin. The SEC claims Kik did not limit itself to these materials, but rather marketed kin in multiple forums.      The SEC also claims that “there was nothing to purchase with Kin” at multiple points through the document to support its assertion that kin’s value was derived from Kik’s efforts.      The next set of replies for the case are due on May 5, 2020, according to the federal court database.
