42386926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVw6b,1622666248,Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Repair Mode as Traders Head to Miami; Dogecoin Gains,"The cryptocurrency market is still recovering from last month’s volatile correction. Bitcoin was up about 4% over the past 24 hours as of press time and was holding support above $35,000. Technicals suggest limited upside towards $40,000 and $45,000 as resistance remains strong.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $37,800 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 4.25% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,805.21-$38,214.79 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,756 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 8.82% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,539.65-$2,802.82 (CoinDesk 20)    Traders were met with a mix of good and bad news heading into June. The bad: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose last week to delay a decision on WisdomTree’s bitcoin ETF application. In late April, the SEC delayed a decision on VanEck’s bitcoin ETF application to at least June.      Delayed approval of a bitcoin ETF could leave traders searching elsewhere for signs of a directional pull. Bitcoin, ether and other larger cryptocurrencies have been stuck in relatively tighter ranges over the past few days, but some analysts remain hopeful that bullish sentiment will return.    Bitcoin goes to Miami    Some are looking to the Bitcoin 2021 in-person conference in Miami starting Thursday as a possible positive influence on price movement. This is similar to the so-called ""CoinDesk Consensus Effect,” an unproven theory that crypto prices typically rally during or immediately after last week's annual conference.      Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, calls it the “Miami Effect.”      “The idea is that a gathering of several thousand people speed networking, sharing ideas and closing deals can be a boon for grassroots growth in the industry,” wrote Greenspan in a newsletter published on Wednesday.      Elsewhere, dogecoin (DOGE) continues to rally and is up about 20% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing.    Dogecoin howls at the moon    The rally in DOGE has taken center stage ever since Tuesday’s blog post by Coinbase saying traders on its Pro platform can begin trading the cryptocurrency as early as Thursday.      Dogecoin was trading at 41 cents at the time of writing, representing a 32% gain in the last 24 hours.      “People are still going to be cautious long term, but this debut will eventually have some ability to attract traditional investors and not just the Robinhood/Reddit army,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.      “We’ve had consistent net buyers on dogecoin, which indicates the general bullishness around it as it gains popularity across all demographics,” said Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich in an interview with CoinDesk.      However, some analysts see lack of fundamentals as a possible deterrent to DOGE’s rally. And technicals suggest limited further upside despite the short-term bounce.      Read the full story by CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma here.    Volatile May leaves bitcoin rangebound    Over the past month, bitcoin suffered its third-worst monthly loss of about -35%, leaving analysts to wonder if sellers have fully capitulated.      Last month’s correction “performed slightly better than some of the most notable bear markets in history in 2012 and 2018, as you can see in the chart below,” wrote 21Shares, a Swiss based asset manager, in a newsletter published on Tuesday.      Meanwhile, fundamentals are improving, which suggests selling pressure could subside this month.      “We are witnessing fundamental buying pressure from long-term investors representing more than 50% of the investor base,” wrote 21Shares.      “Traders should look out for a confident move above $40K or a sell-off below $30K,” wrote Arcane Research in a newsletter published on Tuesday.    Blockchain activity declines    “Activity on the Bitcoin blockchain has declined sharply with the latest price correction, and the number of daily active addresses is now at the lowest level since November last year,” according to Arcane Research.      Historically, large drops in blockchain activity coincided with market tops similar to 2017 and 2019. The current drop in active bitcoin addresses suggests further downside for the cryptocurrency.    Ether is making a slight comeback    Ether has struggled to sustain moves above $2,800 over the past week as the corrective phase takes hold. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value appears to be holding support relative to bitcoin.      ETH/BTC (the price of ether in bitcoin terms), shown below, is holding above the 50-day volume weighted moving average with resistance seen around 0.08.      Other markets      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher on Tuesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    algorand (ALGO) +15.24%  polkadot (DOT) +16.18%    Commodities:    Oil was up 1.40%. Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude: $68.68.

Hsu, who took office last month succeeding former Acting Comptrollers Brian Brooks and Blake Paulson, has called for a review of a host of issues the federal bank regulator oversees.      “I've instructed the team – everything's on the table, let's think about everything – while being cognizant of factors [like] constraints around decisions that have already been made, things that have already been put out there, what the state of play is,” Hsu said. “And so, you know, it's basically encouraging my team to think broadly about everything while being pragmatic.”      This review includes conditional national trust charters issued to a few cryptocurrency firms and applications for such charters from other companies, he said.      The ultimate goal is to determine an “overall strategy” for digital assets, he said.      It’s this same viewpoint that inspired an interagency sprint group composed of members of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, he said.    Read more: State of Crypto: Federal Regulations Are Coming Into Focus    “The instructions that we gave to the team were to really focus on, first and foremost, getting on the same page in terms of terminology,” Hsu said. “Definitions can help on an interagency basis in terms of talking about being precise.”      Once the group has created a common set of definitions, it can move to identifying risks in the digital asset sector and determine next steps around regulations.      Hsu said he hopes the different regulatory agencies that may have jurisdiction over digital assets can work together to determine the most beneficial regulatory framework, including overseeing trading platforms.      “The strongest view I have right now is that we all need to talk to each other and decide on this together,” he said. “What we need to avoid is effectively competing with each other in a way that leads to a race to the bottom.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/02/new-occ-head-doesnt-rule-anything-out-in-digital-asset-guidance-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbe33c93d7bb0c1575ff07e045358e55dcea4ac3-2400x1680.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVw5L,1622661241,‘Perception of Validity’: How the Market Is Reacting to Dogecoin on Coinbase Pro,"Retail traders have been howling ever since Tuesday’s blog post by Coinbase saying traders on its Pro platform can begin trading dogecoin as early as Thursday, depending on “liquidity” conditions.      Dogecoin was trading at 41 cents at the time of writing, representing a 32% gain in the last 24 hours.      So what does the listing mean for the meme cryptocurrency? We asked several analysts, fund managers and competing exchanges for their take on how the markets will receive a new market letting customers have a bite of dogecoin.    Edward Moya, Oanda    “People are still going to be cautious long term, but this debut will eventually have some ability to attract traditional investors and not just the Robinhood/Reddit army,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.      “There’s certainly momentum behind this move,” said Moya.      After Elon Musk’s appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" the meme cryptocurrency’s momentum slowed and went quiet. People were moving on to ether, safemoon and other altcoins, according to Moya.      Now, what was once seen as an “embarrassing trend” for technical traders could now be breaking above this, he said.    Read more: Coinbase Lists Dogecoin on Professional Trading Platform    Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, said it processed more than $6.5 billion worth of DOGE in April, and in May over $9 billion.      Although the meme cryptocurrency has gained support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, for the cryptocurrency to take off it needs a use case argument according to Moya.      “There’s got to be some kind of innovation,” he said.    Steve Ehrlich, Voyager    Voyager, a U.S. crypto trading app that supports retail trading for dogecoin, has seen “significant appreciation and trading activity,” for the cryptocurrency on its platform today.    Read more: ‘Silliness Is Next to Godliness’: Why Doge Still Thrives    “We’ve had consistent net buyers on dogecoin which indicates the general bullishness around it as it gains popularity across all demographics,” said Voyager’s CEO Steve Ehrlich in an interview with CoinDesk.      Coinbase wrote in its blog post about the listing that unlike bitcoin, ""which is designed to be scarce, dogecoin is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no maximum supply.""    James Butterfill, CoinShares    James Butterfill, investment Strategist at CoinShares, said that when speaking to his clients, who are institutional investors, they are wary of investing in dogecoin due to its lack of fundamentals.      “When you invest in any digital asset, you have to look at the fundamentals behind it, with dogecoin there’s a lack of these,” he said.    Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies    From a technical perspective, Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said she sees this move creating a “perception of validity.”      “What we are seeing right now is a short-term oversold bounce,” she said.      Stockton said dogecoin has gained short-term momentum, but sees limits to further upside.

42386920,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVw0J,1622649868,ECB Report Highlights Risks of Not Launching CBDC,"A European Central Bank (ECB) report entitled ""The international role of the euro"" has outlined the threat to countries that elect not to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).    Domestic and cross-border payments could be dominated by non-domestic providers, according to the report published Wednesday.  The report gives as an example ""foreign tech giants potentially offering artificial currencies,"" akin to Facebook's Diem (formerly Libra) project that sent shockwaves through the financial world on its announcement in 2019.  Market dominance by such a privately issued currency would leave consumers and businesses vulnerable should it threaten the stability of the financial system.  ""Issuing a CBDC would help to maintain the autonomy of domestic payment systems and the international use of a currency in a digital world,"" the report concludes.  A CBDC would also enhance the global status of the currency in which it is denominated if it's adopted in countries with unstable currencies. This would also ""reduce monetary policy autonomy in the economies concerned,"" according to the report.  The European Commission and the ECB have been discussing the potential launch of a digital euro since the start of 2021, with central bank President Christine Lagarde saying in March that one could be launched within four years, should the decision be taken to proceed.

The Metaplex marketplace allows artists to build their own storefront similar to Shopify but for NFTs. They will also be able to hold online auctions, allowing sellers and buyers to deal directly without a middleman, the firm said in an emailed release.      NFTs are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers.      The Metaplex market will hold auctions and sales, and any NFTs minted will be deposited using the decentralized storage protocol Arweave, which backs data for a one-off fee. Creators using the marketplace will be given access to performance and revenue data, and payments made to the artists will be automatic.      “Building on a foundation of the Solana protocol and Arweave, Metaplex is able to dramatically reduce minting and trading fees,” said Raj Gokal, COO of Solana Labs and adviser to Metaplex.      For infrastructure, Metaplex has partnered with the cryptocurrency exchange FTX for payments. Users will be able to buy digital collectibles using FTX Pay with credit cards or cryptocurrency.      Music streaming and sharing platform Audius will display Metaplex NFTs and include functionality for users to buy and sell them.      Metaplex has also partnered with a number of influencers, sports brands and comic artists. Creative partners include the musician and record producer André Allen Anjos, known as RAC; creative studio Street Dreams, and CryptoKickers, the NFT-based wearables brand known for creating custom footwear for the metaverse, the 3D virtual environment.      “Metaplex will do for NFTs what Shopify did for commerce, but takes it one step further by not acting as the middleman,” RAC said.

This isn’t just seen in the amount of capital being deployed in BTC or DeFi, which might have gone elsewhere, but also in the human beings who choose to work in the industry.  Over the last few months, there have been a few notable departures from traditional financial and software giants. Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund, lost its chief financial officer to NYDIG. Coinbase hired a top Goldman Sachs lobbyist. FTX hired an executive from Citadel Securities.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Then there are the regulators who have made their home at crypto upstarts. Former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks took charge at Binance.US the same day former top U.S. commodities regulator Chris Giancarlo joined BlockFi’s five-person board.  These are figures who, as part of their remit, had large swaths of the economy under their supervision and identified the most dynamic and personally rewarding opportunities as being in crypto.  ""The internet is a remarkable social and technological phenomenon. It's by no means seen its course. What it's done first to information then to retail and transportation, it's now doing in financial services in a very broad way,” Giancarlo said the morning of his announcement, on CoinDesk TV.  These human flows demonstrate the viability of what’s being built in crypto. Capital deployment is a big indicator, and there are crypto projects doing big numbers. But that’s all a calculated risk, a gamble, a hope for yield in an economy where everything seems to offer returns. Tomorrow Tesla could announce it sold its BTC horde.  Human beings taking jobs in crypto is different. It’s stickier. But it also gives a peek into the industry’s dynamics. People may be motivated by competitive salaries or startup equity, but they may also have harder-to-define motivations, such as a belief or feeling that crypto is the future.  Employment reports consistently show blockchain skills are in high demand.  “The bitcoin and crypto industry has the highest asymmetry opportunity in any industry, so it is not surprising to see thousands of people moving from legacy businesses to these disruptive upstarts,” the influential Anthony Pompliano said over email.  Pomp kicked up a crypto jobs board four months ago to help place the experienced and inexperienced in open crypto roles. He says 50,000 people have already applied for positions, and as many as 20 people have been hired.  Mike Wen recently left Apple to go “all in on crypto.” He says he followed a familiar path for millennials: used BTC to buy a fake ID in 2014, invested in “the next wave” in 2017 and started to get curious again about DeFi in 2020. And now he’s hooked.    Read more: Crypto Hype Cycles and You    “NFTs were the first use case that both made sense to me as a consumer but also was something I knew I would be passionate about working on,” Wen said over email. He’s building a community-owned NFT platform, Gallery, and feels empowered by the core ideals of “decentralization, self-sovereignty and permissionless innovation that crypto embodies.”  While he doesn’t think most of his former colleagues will rush out to join a crypto startup or that decentralized collectives could ever truly compete on the hardware front with monoliths like Apple, Web 3.0 is where the real innovation is taking place.  “This relates to me so deeply because in my career I've always been grinding, just waiting for the ‘right opportunity.’ However, in crypto the opportunity is out there, you just have to go out and grab it,” Wen said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/02/how-do-you-know-crypto-is-winning-look-where-the-talent-is-going,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b986a30558545f94b5caa9535eeb7a097020019-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVw45,1622645413,The Lesson of Bitconnect: Promoters Can Be Liable,"On Friday, May 28, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced civil securities fraud charges against five U.S. promoters of Bitconnect, an alleged fraud that operated along the lines of a pyramid scheme from roughly 2016 to 2018. Newer entrants to the cryptocurrency world might not recognize the name, but Bitconnect was a huge story and an important (negative) part of the evolution of crypto. The looming downfall of its proponents – including some who are still active in the cryptosphere today – has some important takeaways.      What’s most striking is that the SEC has targeted five Bitconnect promoters, not the actual creator and mastermind of the scheme – allegedly an Indian man, who appears in the Friday charging documents but is not named or charged. That leads to a couple of important questions: First, do the charges assume that these promoters knew that Bitconnect was a scam? And if not, does the filing imply greater scrutiny of other people who regularly promote or endorse crypto projects – scam or not?    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    But first, a refresher. On paper, Bitconnect was a “lending platform”: You sent them bitcoin, and Bitconnect promised to use that Bitcoin with their “trading bot and volatility software.” This bot, Bitconnect claimed, could produce immense returns whether Bitcoin went up or down – as much as 40% returns per month, according to promotional materials. These “returns” were tracked only on Bitconnect’s website, and were paid out in the Bitconnect token rather than BTC. Even then, actually withdrawing funds from Bitconnect was a laborious and eventually impossible process involving multiple conversions and long waits.      Even for relative financial novices, there should be multiple red flags here. First and foremost, 40% monthly returns compound to a roughly 3,900% annual return on your investment, a rate that would turn just $100 into $4,050 within a year. This certainly qualifies as a promise of “outsized returns,” which the SEC lists as a common theme of crypto frauds. (Crypto or not, be skeptical of any investment offering more than 10% or 20% annual returns without a clear sense of the risk you’re taking for those rewards.)    Read more: SEC Sues 5 Over $2B Bitconnect Ponzi    The premise of a “trading bot” is just as suspect. To even theoretically profit from volatility during a bear market, a bot would have to be able to short, or bet against, bitcoin at very high speed. That may have been possible to some degree (BitMEX had already launched bitcoin short options) but would have been a huge technical and infrastructure challenge. More importantly, even the best high frequency trading strategies on Wall Street – the grown-up term for a “volatility bot” – are high-volume, low-margin operations, and even the highest performers in their best years return roughly 60-70%% annually.      Of course, Bitconnect’s target audience was people who didn’t know or understand these basics – small time retail “investors,” not just in the U.S. but in places like India and Africa where financial literacy is even lower.      The scale of the fraud was huge, taking in approximately $2 billion from would-be investors, according to the SEC. That success came largely because Bitconnect mimicked the multi-level marketing (MLM) strategies of companies like Avon and Herbalife. Most countries had a “National Promoter” and numerous “Regional Promoters” who arranged local events and promotional talks.      They also, particularly in the United States, produced immense amounts of social media content promoting Bitconnect, and including affiliate codes that helped promoters earn immense referral fees. According to Friday’s charges, Michael Noble, a.k.a Michael Crypto, was paid $731,281 for allegedly recruiting 1,000 investors. These numbers weren’t publicly known at the time, but they’re high enough to constitute another major sign of fraud.      (The MLM model was also used during the same period by OneCoin, a similar though even cruder pyramid scheme that is believed to have taken in as much as $4 billion worldwide.)      The other defendants include Craig Grant, Ryan Maasen and Trevon Brown, aka Trevon James, all accused of acting as regional Bitconnect promoters in the U.S. In addition, Joshua Jeppesen was allegedly a “continental promoter” who oversaw regional and national promoters, according to the SEC.    The wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow, but they grind exceedingly fine.    Trevon James may be the most widely known of those accused. He was a massive YouTube and social media presence during the scam’s heyday, and remarkably open in the aftermath of its collapse. (He even tweeted about the charges last week.) James’ most infamous moment was likely his confused declaration, “You didn’t lose your money! Now, you have your … technically, you kind of lost your money.”      What’s really significant about James being named in the lawsuit is he, at the very least, did a great impression of being an honest enthusiast of Bitconnect, and there’s no allegation he played a role in creating the scheme. For those who comment or make videos about crypto projects, this might create some anxiety about legal risks. If you endorse something that winds up being a scam, are you at risk of SEC attention?      First and foremost, the best way to stay safe is to not take undisclosed payments in exchange for promotion. According to the SEC, the four regional promoters (Brown/James, Grand, Maasen and Noble) made between $475,000 and $1.3 million each for their promotional work. Jeppesen, the “continental promoter,” allegedly took home over $2.6 million. The SEC says that put them afoul of “touting” laws, which I wrote about last week after Soulja Boy inadvertently revealed he was being paid to promote SaferMars. The second set of charges focused on the lower-level promoters is that none were registered broker/dealers, even though they received payment based on how many people they helped buy positions in Bitconnect.      But the most interesting and enlightening element of the SEC’s charges are that a completely different charge is reserved for Jeppesen, whom the SEC accuses of “aiding and abetting” securities violations. An accusation of aiding and abetting, even in a civil context, involves an assessment of the defendant’s “state of mind,” Anderson Kill crypto and securities lawyer Stephen Palley told CoinDesk. That includes whether the person actually knew he or she was promoting a fraud.      Though I didn’t see anything clearly spelled out in the charging documents, this might indicate the SEC has evidence Jeppesen knew that Bitconnect was a scam all along but promoted it anyway. That the other four defendants are not being charged with aiding and abetting, by contrast, may indicate the SEC doesn’t have evidence they were in on the fraud.      That’s a very important lesson for those in the cryptosphere: Even if you don’t know something is a fraud, you can be vulnerable to legal action if you get paid to promote it. (Theoretically, you could face action for undisclosed promotion of even an honest project, but the SEC is mostly focused on frauds.)      In multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes in particular, the line between a victim and a perpetrator is often fuzzy – someone who really believes in a fake or scam project can enthusiastically sell it to friends and family while also ultimately getting ripped off. Some of the biggest promoters of OneCoin were themselves true believers and lost immense amounts of money when it folded.    Read more: David Z. Morris - Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    A seemingly important signal of the state of mind of the Bitconnect defendants would have been whether, and how much, the promoters themselves invested in Bitconnect, but there’s no information about that in the charges. It’s also notable two other high-profile U.S. Bitconnect promoters, Craig Grant and “Crypto Nick,” were not charged. That may mean the SEC determined they were victims as much as perpetrators.      But it may also mean they’re next in line and will be separately charged later, and that’s the final important takeaway: Just because a few years pass doesn’t mean financial fraudsters have gotten away scot-free. Bitconnect collapsed in January 2018, nearly three and a half years ago, an eternity in crypto time but not terribly long by SEC standards.      And the delay might not have gained the defendants much: They face having to return everything they earned, and more.

The platform was hacked May 30 in a flash-loan attack that resulted in an overall $50 million loss for the platform.  In a blog post Tuesday, Belt Finance said it will compensate users who were directly affected in its 4Belt pool or beltBUSD vault and the holders of BELT tokens.  Belt Finance estimated vault users suffered a 21.36% loss of funds, and pool users lost 5.51%. Overall, the attack cost the beltBUSD pool a combined loss of 50 million BUSD ($50 million), comprising 43.8 million in fees and the 6.23 million the attacker withdrew as profit.  In the blog post, the firm provided details on how the compensation plan works, including the airdrop of a remedy4BELT (r4BELT) token, and the next steps in the recovery plan.  Belt Finance said it is also creating a buyback fund to increase BELT value to make liquidity mining on BELT as profitable as possible.  The firm is committing $3 million to the fund, which is intended to add buy-side pressure to the token and increase its value over time.  Belt Finance said the team has never sold any of its BELT allocation.

CoinDesk 20 data shows the token increased almost 40% to $2.21 in the past 24 hours. The price hit a two-week high of $2.38 earlier today.  The rally takes KNC's market cap back above $400 million. However, it still ranks in the mid-20s on the list of most prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols by market value, according to Messari.  At press time, Uniswap is the biggest DeFi project, with a market capitalization of $15.6 billion. Aave and MakerDAO rank second and third at $4.86 billion and $3.56 billion.  ""Kyber Network has underperformed its peers, still trading at relatively low market capitalization,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said, adding that the token is relatively cheap.  In other words, KNC is likely catching up with its DeFi peers in the wake of positive fundamental developments.  Kyber's dynamic market maker (DMM), aimed at bringing greater flexibility and high capital efficiency, went live in early April.  The planned migration to the new KNC token to boost governance power, create multiple streams of utility, and support new liquidity innovation is proceeding smoothly.  Exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Gateio, UpBit and Bithumb are supporting the new token, while Huobi, OKEx, and Coinbase are making preparations for the transition.  ""The token migration will permit a wide range of upgrading capabilities as we advance, all to promote capital efficiency with dynamic fees and amplified liquidity,"" Vinokourov said.  With dynamic fees, fees increase during high market volatility and decrease during low market volatility to encourage trading and volume.  According to the official blog, such a structure helps optimize returns for liquidity providers and reduce the impact of impermanent loss – a temporary loss resulting from volatility in a trading pair.  While KNC has chalked up double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, prominent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether have gained 3% to 5%. Meme-focused cryptocurrency dogecoin has rallied by 35%.

The project is led by a former Huobi executive and includes the participation of investors including Multicoin Capital and Polychain Capital, according to a press release.      Under the plan, DAO committee members will select the “most promising” DeFi projects.      ""Yield farmers self-allocate to the vetted DeFi projects while also incentivizing them with liquidity mining rewards,"" according to the release.      The 15 so-called talent hunters of the protocol – the initial members on the Aladdin committee – include executives from Polychain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Multicoin Capital and Alameda. These founding members can subsequently add new members through invitation. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)      “DAOs are one of the most important innovations in all of crypto,” Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee said in the press release. “Over time, they will take over and decentralize vast portions of the entire economy.”      AladdinDAO’s native token, Aladdin token (ALD), is designed partly as an incentive for the committee members to both select and vote for the best projects, according to the protocol’s white paper reviewed by CoinDesk.      The DAO mining mechanism, according to the white paper, incentivizes committee members to choose high-quality DeFi liquidity mining programs after well-researched work.      The DAO mining rewards are paid out every two weeks, which, according to Sharlyn Wu, one of the founding members, is to avoid any liquidity pump-and-dump incidents.      According to the white paper, the vast majority of the ALD tokens will be distributed for liquidity mining. Of those, 30% are for mining users, 31% for DAO mining, 30% for founding members and community members and 9% for ""DAO Reserve.""      The idea of a project like AladdinDAO isn't altogether new. Projects like Big Data Protocol, which are also backed by investors with crypto expertise, have tried to build a liquidity mining marketplace. According to data from DeBank, the total value locked in Big Data Protocol has plummeted to around $20 million since it skyrocketed to above $6 billion not long after it went live.      “The smarter the DAO is, the better decisions it can make, and the higher quality projects and liquidity the platform can attract,” Wu, now the core contributor of AladdinDAO, said in the press release. “This is a self-reinforcing cycle, as the stronger the platform becomes, the more pricing power it gets, the more value DAO tokens can capture.”      The former banker headed the blockchain investment arm at China Merchant Bank International (CMBI) before becoming the chief investment officer at crypto exchange Huobi, leading the DeFi effort there.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Wu said she chose AladdinDAO as her first project after her departure from Huobi because she saw the advantages of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) after spending her career at large, centralized financial institutions.      “I want to work and live freestyle, and I still want to connect with the other smart people in the crypto world and evolve with them together,” Wu said. “I did this for myself, and it provides a new lifestyle for me to work and live in the crypto world. Hopefully, this can be the platform for many other smart and talented individuals.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | SPONSORED,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/02/new-defi-dao-relies-on-talent-hunters-to-vet-yield-farming-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae4e1bc921d8b04ec9d3830060d12d6ebcc0b976-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bridge furthers their goals of discovering the industry's ""Bluetooth moment,"" Nervos and IOHK, according to the development team behind Cardano.      The launch is significant because it links two ecosystems worth billions of dollars in terms of market capitalization, the companies said in a press release on Wednesday. It is the first bridge for cardano (ADA), currently valued at $56.3 billion and the market's fourth most valued crypto.      Blockchain accelerator Mousebelt has been tapped to develop the tech, with funding to come from a Nervos grant. The Cardano team will commit expertise and resources to connect its network.      See also: Swiss Asset Manager Valour Launches Cardano and Polkadot ETPs      The Force Bridge, as it's known, will allow users to interchangeably transact with Nervos or Cardano's native currencies (CKB and ADA). It will also enable participants to create their own wrapped tokens – cryptos that are pegged to the value of another – and do so across both chains, according to the release.      The bridge is expected to reduce transaction costs across both platforms' cryptocurrencies while reducing the burden for users to possess different wallets to access features from both networks. It will let developers from both chains access services and features to expand their decentralized applications and user bases, the companies said.

In addition to financial backing, AU21 will provide support for business development and marketing. The fund’s manager, AU21 partner Alexi Nedeltchev, said he expects at least a 10-fold return on the fund.      “The low gas fees help anyone using Uniswap or any other major [decentralized finance] project,” Nedeltchev said. “It’s also very easy to transfer to Polygon because it uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine.”      While it has been a long-time buyer of Polygon’s native token MATIC in secondary markets, AU21’s interest increased when Mark Cuban invested in the firm last week. Polygon has given small grants to some projects in the past but this is the first fund dedicated to such projects, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal told CoinDesk via Telegram.      Previously, AU21 only had an ecosystem fund for Polkadot.      “We saw the Polkadot system rising first and then quickly [Binance Smart Chain] got really popular and lately we’re seeing a lot of Polygon, after the rebrand from Matic to Polygon,” Nedeltchev said. “They’ve also got a lot of mainstream attention.

42434486,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDTPh,1622633400,Valid Points: Why Staking on Eth 2.0 Is Becoming Lucrative for Exchanges,"Virtual conferences are in full swing.      Earlier this month, ETHGlobal put on a month-long hackathon focused on Ethereum scalability, known as Scaling Ethereum. Most notably, out of this event, a temporary test network for the Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 merge was built.      Last week, CoinDesk hosted its annual Consensus crypto conference, and just this past weekend EthGlobal hosted another hackathon centered on innovations for a Web 3 world. This week we look at what the phrase “Web 3” means and why development for it is so important to Ethereum.      But first, let’s take a look at some data and figures around the staking industry of crypto.    Pulse check: Exchanges are staking their claim as Eth 2 validators  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    As of Tuesday, June 1, the rough breakdown of network stakeholders on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain looks a little something like this:      Drilling down into the specifics, the largest exchange staking on Eth 2.0 is Kraken, with control of roughly 14% of ETH deposits. The second-largest exchange in control of 10% of total deposits is Binance.      Staking is becoming an increasingly lucrative service for cryptocurrency exchanges to run. Even Coinbase, the largest publicly traded North America based crypto exchange, is investing heavily into its staking services as evidenced by its recent acquisition of staking startup Bison Trails.      “Staking’s popularity is the natural outcome of an asset class growing in maturity,” Jeremy Welch, Kraken’s vice president of product, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Whereas three years ago holders were mainly interested in securing short-term gains, many are now confident locking up tokens to earn passive income. Why? Conviction is growing in the longevity of crypto assets as a respectable new asset class.”      Staking-as-a-service platform Staked reported in April that over Q1 2021 the total market capitalization of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains grew 151%. As of the end of March, PoS blockchains made up one-fifth of the entire market capitalization of the crypto industry.      Projected earnings across these PoS networks including Eth 2.0 are expected to be close to $19 billion by the end of this year. Speaking to growth of the staking industry, Staked Q2 2021 report said,      “In every case, staking provided better returns than simply holding the asset: Stakers earned an additional yield of between roughly 4% and 34% in one quarter.”      These rates compete directly with the interest crypto holders are also able to earn on centralized and decentralized lending markets. In a world of rock-bottom interest rates in the traditional finance industry, could cryptocurrencies be the alternative that investors turn to for higher yields?      Potentially. Although as we’ll discuss in New Frontiers, the world of crypto assets is nascent and still very much in the process of development.    New frontiers: Hacking the future of Web 3    Unlike the Scaling Ethereum hackathon, which centered on the tools and technologies for building the next iteration of Ethereum, the Web 3 hackathon, which took place virtually this past weekend, focused on products and services for the next generation of the internet.      The vision for Web 3 hasn’t always centered on blockchain technology and smart contracts. Back when the phrase was first coined in 2001, Web 3 was synonymous with “The Semantic Web.” This was an early idea by computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, who believed the internet would be used increasingly less by people and more by machines who could process all the information on the World Wide Web more efficiently.      Fast forward to 2021 and the vision for Web 3, at least in the Ethereum community, is about decentralized, open and permissionless systems run by machines, rather than people. Alternative systems for services such as cryptocurrency exchanges, traditional financial lending markets, and social media applications can all be built on Ethereum, an open and permissionless blockchain, and engineered to run exclusively through smart contract code instead of human intervention.      Building the protocol layer of Ethereum to support mainstream decentralized application (dapp) development is one part of the new Web 3 vision. However, another major component of this vision requires developing the dapps themselves to take advantage of Ethereum’s unique capabilities as a world computer.    What is being built for Web 3    From Thursday, May 27, to Sunday, May 30, dozens of developers and blockchain enthusiasts gathered online for the Web 3 Weekend Hackathon and were organized into teams to innovate new products and services atop the existing Ethereum network. From decentralized finance protocols to file-sharing services, metaverses, messaging applications and more, several ideas were presented by the end of the hackathon.      However, projects based on the creation and development of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were by far one of the most popular areas of focus at this year’s Web 3 Weekend Hackathon.      Five out of the top 12 most highly ranked projects at the hackathon were centered on non-fungible tokens (NFT). One called YouTube NFT Drop creates a service to reward early subscribers to a YouTube channel with exclusive NFTs as a way to incentivize early followings among new YouTube creators. Another called the NFT Factory enables artists to upload various images to a website that automatically mashes up these images and generates a unique NFT of the resulting image that can be claimed and traded on Ethereum.      Among these NFT-focused projects, a third that also made its way to the finals called ArtVaults sets up a secure storage platform for NFT content. The project addresses an ongoing concern for NFT creators and traders: the unreliability of content access.      “We offer a number of improvements relative to the standard user experience for NFTs,” said Cole Jorissen, co-creator of ArtVaults. “At the moment, exclusive NFT content like high resolution files are usually stored using centralized services like Google Drive, and this usually requires the original NFT creator to maintain that file. If they stop paying for their subscription, accidentally delete or modify the file, or the centralized service goes down, the file is no longer accessible and can be lost forever.”      ArtVaults gets around this issue by requiring NFT creators to pay for long-term storage of their token in advance on the decentralized file-sharing network known as Filecoin. NFT creators can also share files in their vault for viewing purposes to potential buyers by whitelisting specific Ethereum addresses.    More hacking needed    While ArtVaults addresses the issue of reliable storage for NFT content, it does not address the issue of NFT authenticity and reliability which is yet another challenge plaguing participants of what has recently become a more than $2 billion industry.      Back in April, two pseudonymous hackers created their own NFTs disguised as original creations of the famous artist Beeple. One of the hackers, “EthGnome,” engineered his token to appear to land in famous individuals' Ethereum wallets such as founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin’s wallet, Lindsay Lohan’s wallet and more recently the wallet of billionaire investor Mark Cuban.      Speaking to the ways in which the NFT industry could evolve for the better, EthGnome told me in an April interview, “I think having NFT marketplaces serve as gatekeepers for verifying NFT smart contracts is a pretty solid solution.”      EthGnome explained the vast majority of fake NFTs activity can be mitigated by prominently labelling which NFTs were minted from either a verified smart contract that has been reviewed by a team of professionals as being safe, or a published smart contract that has not been reviewed but at the very least open-sourced, or finally, a non-published contract whose code has not been publicly disclosed.    When innovation outpaces development    These types of ideation from EthGnome and the creators of ArtVault are evidence that the NFT industry is maturing and infrastructure to support the industry’s continued growth is being developed.      In the weeks to come, organizers of the Scaling Ethereum and Web 3 Weekend Hackathon are putting together a third virtual hackathon event from June 18 to July 9 focused on solutions and innovations specifically for the DeFi ecosystem atop Ethereum. During the upcoming Hack Money event, there are sure to be projects addressing pain points and challenges to DeFi adoption similar to the NFT-focused projects that made it into the finals of the Web 3 hackathon.      It is these projects from various hackathons that are a reminder of what Ethereum 2.0 and the forthcoming upgrades after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) are ultimately meant to support. Efforts and interest in the next iteration of Ethereum are closely tied to goals related to building up the next iteration of the internet, as well as the next iteration of finance.      To this end, Eth 2.0 can’t come soon enough as both areas of innovation, Web 3 and DeFi, already seem to be quickly outpacing and outgrowing the current version of Ethereum.

Thus, a price bounce cannot be ruled out.  In contrast, JPMorgan analysts foresee another leg lower before stability and recovery. Bitcoin fell from $58,000 to nearly $30,000 in the eight days to May 19.  Dogecoin is trading at 12-day highs above 32 cents, representing a 5% gain on the day.
