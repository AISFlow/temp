42427546,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVwZh,1494012654,The Second Wave of Bitcoin Price Growth May Just Be Beginning,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  In this guest feature, Woo breaks down recent developments in the bitcoin markets, arguing that with a trading band broken, the cryptocurrency could be entering a new phase of maturity.  Something interesting has been happening the last couple of weeks.  I'm pretty well connected to a lot of veterans in crypto, and independently, we've all been fielding inquiries from smart money investors, the non-technical types who are now ready for a hedge instrument against global uncertainty.  Our basic conclusion is that what we're seeing right now is a whole lot of new money coming into the cryptocurrency markets.  Some have been perplexed with this unprecedented rise, and it's easy to see why. The total market cap of the space is now $46.5bn, a figure that's up roughly 50% over the last few weeks.  That might seem simplistic, but it's also coinciding with a lot of uncertainty in Europe.  On Sunday, 7th May, we will see the outcome of elections in France. Of the two candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, Len Pen is for France leaving the European Union. Should this happen, it could signal the start of an EU breakup.  Now, Le Pen is considered a long shot, similar to President Donald Trump in the US elections last year, but we know what happened there. Savvy investors have been looking for hedges, and now new money is moving into cryptocurrency. But, new money is also flowing from bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies.  So-called ""altcoins"" are getting the benefits of bitcoin's two-year stalemate on scaling, so the amount of money falling out significant. Now, it's important to understand that altcoins markets, with the exception of ethereum's ether token, are thinly traded. This means that for every $1 going into altcoins, their markets rise disproportionally compared to bitcoin's deeply traded market.  This adds an amplifier to the altcoin market cap rise.  Really, the big clue to this situation is bitcoin and ethereum are both rising at the same time when we typically see a see-saw action. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is evidence that new money is coming into the system.  Price Action  Another less-discussed development is that bitcoin broke out of its long-time trading channel yesterday.  This is significant, as the channel has held for a multi-year timeframe.  It's now carving out new all-time highs without a channel resistance to hold it down. In this situation, all bets are off.  Since there are no historical resistance points, we default to Fibonacci levels, derived off the golden ratio numbers that traders use to find support and resistance levels. Our next Fibonacci level is $1,717, which will act as resistance. While it is entirely possible that we could see a run up to this price if the buying frenzy continues, we are seeing a dip as the market overheats.  I suspect some of the current dip may have been from election speculators taking profits before the final outcome.  So, we are faced with a situation similar to our March ETF decision.  If Le Pen wins, bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets will have a very strong run ahead of it. On a Le Pen defeat, I suspect we may get a moderate retrace and consolidation before resuming its upward momentum. (I can't see the new influx of new money slowing down, a Le Pen defeat does not solve the EU's financial uncertainty.)  Further, looking back at Google search trends, we are not in a hype cycle as yet.        This further supports the notion that it's a moderate population of high net-worth investors entering with sufficient money to push these markets up significantly.  I would say wave two of bitcoin has begun. In wave one, investors were technically proficient. In wave two, investors will be non-technical, but savvy in traditional markets. Wave three will be the general public.  I've estimated this will begin in two years when bitcoin's peak 60-day volatility dips below 5%. At this level, it will begin to compete with national currencies in price stability.  And who wouldn't consider bitcoin as an alternative cash account that generates a relatively smooth return of 100% per annum? This is the long-term historical price trend driven by a doubling of users per year.  So, despite the confusion, the fundamental drivers of this bitcoin rally are solid. Unlike in 2013, we may not see a pullback this time around.

The group of European financial institutions – BNP Paribas Securities Services, Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Euronext, S2iEM, Société Générale and Paris EUROPLACE – unveiled their project last summer, with the stated goal of ""focusing on new solutions that will give small and mid-sized companies...easier access to the financing they need"".  Now, CACEIS – the division of Crédit Agricole that focuses on asset servicing – is joining the fray, having inked an investment agreement with the group to help develop the initiative. As noted by the firm, the move dovetails with efforts last year by the French government to clear the way for municipal bonds to be issued digitally via blockchain.  Jean-François Abadie, the firm’s chief executive, said in a statement:  ""We are very pleased to participate in this collective innovation process. This promising project combines a wide range of experience and expertise that is appropriate to its ambition to help drive the process of transforming the post-market environment. This is fully in line with the CACEIS strategy of prioritising the development of innovative solutions for its clients.""  The firm’s work isn’t its first project related to the technology. In March, CACEIS partnered with bitcoin exchange Bitstamp to let investment funds accept bitcoin.

42427531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVw7h,1494000681,Certified Accountants Say Blockchain Could Change the Way They're Paid,"Blockchain could change the way accountants generate revenue, according to a report published yesterday by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).  The group, which boasts more than 180,000 members worldwide, said in its report that the kinds of services accountants provide may evolve depending on how the technology is adopted. These changes, the report's authors note, may impact the income of accountants as well.  While the report notes that ""it will take time"" to see how distributed ledger adoption affects revenues for accountants, it does caution that ""the most likely effects on the revenue mix may be clear sooner"".  The report’s authors write:  ""There may be a gradual move away from low-margin activities (for example, transaction checking) towards a greater emphasis on higher-margin work (for example, interpreting technical accounting policy to a given situation). Over time, this may affect the revenue model, with greater emphasis on paying for expertise and advice (outputs-based rate card) rather than for time (inputs-based, per hour billing).""  As mentioned above, the ACCA tempers these predictions by arguing that the full ramifications won’t be known in the absence of ""large scale and mainstream adoption"". The next five years, the paper’s authors argue, will provide telling evidence as to what the actual impact will be.  ""If it looks likely that the revenue mix will evolve, then accountancy firms may want to evaluate their structure and organise themselves differently to prepare for the future,"" the authors go on to recommend.  That line of reasoning – that organization and information-seeking can help accountants prepare for the future – is reiterated, as the authors indicate that ACCA members may want to begin their education if they haven’t already.  ""Blockchain presents new areas for analysis and consideration, and the sooner professional accountants increase their awareness, the better prepared they will be to engage with it,"" they note.

42427530,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVw5h,1493990709,CME Explores Cryptocurrency Derivatives Contracts in Patent Filing,"Derivatives giant CME has developed a system for delivering digital currencies tied to derivative contracts, patent documents show.  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published CME's application on 4th May, entitled ""System for Physically Delivering Virtual Currencies"". At its heart, the concept envisions delivering cryptocurrency holdings tied to a particular contract without the clearing party actually taking possession.  The firm is already known to be looking, at least conceptually, at the idea of derivatives contracts for bitcoin miners. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the proposed derivatives would enable miners to more effectively hedge against the ever-increasing difficulty of mining (the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain), as well as the declining value of their mining hardware.  The new application indicates that CME is looking at additional products tied to the tech, with the firm explaining:  ""A clearing counter-party could facilitate physical delivery of virtual currency contracts by instructing the sellers of expiring contracts to transfer the virtual currencies directly to the clearing counter-party, and the clearing counter-party would then transfer the virtual currencies to the buyers.""  That CME would be looking into this area is perhaps unsurprising. Last November, it launched a pair of bitcoin price benchmarks, which would ostensibly serve as part of the infrastructure for any products it may facilitate.  What’s more, the firm's executives have previously discussed the prospects of financial products around digitized assets.  ""In fact, some of the most exciting areas to explore are at the intersection of digital assets and tokenized fiat and tokenized commodities,” CME executive director and digitization lead Sandra Ro said during an event last November.  Ro is one of three inventors listed on the patent application, along with digitization director and technology architect Ryan Pierce, and Mansoor Ahmed, who serves as director of clearing for the firm.

42427538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVwLh,1493985603,Ethereum's Big Switch: The New Roadmap to Proof-of-Stake,"After years of development, ethereum has a new plan to update the algorithm that keeps its entire network in sync.  Vitalik Buterin, ethereum's creator, recently released a rough implementation guide that reveals the network's developers will first start with a 'hybrid' system that merges bitcoin-style proof-of-work mining with its much-anticipated and still-experimental proof-of-stake system called Casper, created by Buterin.  The plan effectively means ethereum will begin alternating between the two systems, so that some transaction blocks (one out of 100) are secured via proof-of-stake and the rest remain on proof-of-work.  Buterin has notably been working on his implementation in parallel with ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir, ""cross-pollinating"" their ideas. According to Karl Floersch, blockchain engineer for ethereum startup ConsenSys and a coder working with Buterin on Casper's development, the result is that the network is choosing the more conservative of two potential paths forward.  Floersch told CoinDesk:  ""What Vitalik has come up with is a get-it-out-the-door, working version, that works, but might be less theoretically revolutionary than Vlad's.""  Because Buterin's implementation of Casper can, he thinks, get to production faster, it will be used in the first stage of ethereum's evolution.  If implemented, this would be the first time proof-of-stake would be employed on the live ethereum platform, albeit playing a minor role. It also would a large real-world test of proof-of-stake, enabling the cryptocurrency community to determine whether the proof algorithm is a superior one, as proponents have argued.  To advocates, the goal of this potentially revolutionary change to proof-of-stake is to reduce the electricity ethereum requires to reach agreement on the state of transactions and contracts on the network. But, since it has been pushed back several times, detractors see this hybrid as the latest evidence that proof-of-stake won't ever be fully implemented successfully on ethereum.  Others say the hybrid implementation is just about security given that the network now secures millions of dollars in value.  Blockchain consultant Ciaran Murray, for example, called this move a ""precautionary"" measure, while Buterin called it a ""stepping stone"" that he expects to take place after ethereum shifts to stage three of its development process, a planned phase called Metropolis.  Buterin told CoinDesk:  ""[T]his is going to be our primary focus after Metropolis from a development standpoint, and right now we are very actively in the process of developing a prototype in Python.”  Virtualizing mining  To take a step back, the big idea behind proof-of-stake is to 'virtualize’ the mining process.  In proof-of-work, miners compute puzzle answers at dizzying speeds, a process that requires money for equipment and electricity. In proof-of-stake, participants similarly commit money to the system, but not with electricity and equipment. With Casper, virtual miners, known as validators, commit money to the system with the understanding that they will lose their deposits if they don't follow the rules.  Recently, alongside advancements in the algorithm theory, Ethereum Foundation formal verification engineer Yoichi Hirai has been running the Casper scripts through a mathematical bug detector, a process known as 'formal verification'.  According to general notes on his formal verification work, Hirai is using the mathematical tool on smart contracts ""so that no surprises happen after deployment"".  Since smart contracts can't be changed after deployment, developers are proceeding with extra caution. The same caution applies to Casper, which is itself enabled by a smart contract.  Casper's stage one  In stage one of Buterin's plan, proof-of-stake will be used as a 'checkpoint' every 100 blocks, and will offer further evidence that blocks store the correct transactions (what the devs call ‘finality’).  Floersch is currently coding the 'fork choice rules' for pyethereum, the Python ethereum client. These rules outline how validators determine which ethereum chain to build on, he explained. Validators look at the chains in front of them and make their choice partially based on how much ether is committed to each chain.  If validators make the wrong decision, they'll lose money.  ""You can see how it forms a consensus, or it forms a single chain instead of a bunch of chains,"" said Floersch.  Casper developers will publish the smart contract on ethereum, creating an official Casper account where anyone can deposit ether if they want to engage in the virtual mining process.  Once the pyethereum version is done, the team will pass on the work to be incorporated in the Casper daemon, a package that will eventually be run along with each ethereum client, whether Geth or Parity, for example.  Stage two, then, is to deploy this process on a larger scale.  A good idea?  Whether proof-of-stake will work or not has already been debated ad nauseum, with sides largely split based on people's previous cryptocurrency purchases.  But dissenters have some reason to worry. If the network doesn't work as planned, there's a chance transactions won't go through as users expect, or that smart contract rules might not add up. This is why ethereum's engineers are trying to work out the ‘finality’ property.  Others are skeptical of the hybrid approach in general.  ""I'm not exactly sure about the wisdom of a staged transition. You either have faith and confidence in your consensus algorithm or you don't,"" said Charles Hoskinson, CEO for blockchain tech firm IOHK.  It should be noted that IOHK is heavily involved in the development of ethereum classic, which is often viewed as a competitor to ethereum.  ""Adding an untested or insecure component to your network as a wait and see is a terrible idea,"" he continued. ""Also where is the peer review? What conferences have they submitted a proper white paper to and what feedback have they gotten?""  But, to some in this nascent field of 'cryptoeconomics', this back and forth is exciting. Floersch mentioned the combination of economics and cryptography that underpins Casper can potentially be applied to other global problems.  “Of course [proof-of-stake] a really cool problem and it’s great. But, I think down the line, there will be other applications of cryptoeconomics, which I think is a whole new field of mechanisms to use economics to provide a desired outcome,” he said, concluding:  “Casper is one of the first ones that do that.”  Alarm clock image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/05/05/ethereums-big-switch-the-new-roadmap-to-proof-of-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c3c763bf033450fb8f8782ce69df49e79f43d1a-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVwVh,1493980226,Silk Road Goes Dark: Bitcoin Survives Its Biggest Market's Demise,"Marco Santori is a FinTech lawyer based in New York City where he leads the blockchain tech team at Cooley LLP.  In this latest edition of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Santori discusses the downfall of the notorious bitcoin-powered dark market Silk Road in fall 2013, and the lasting impact this had on the technology's perception and his practice.  I still kick myself for failing to buy a single item on Silk Road.  Yes, I'm a lawyer, and, yes, I'm a square. Yes, most of its wares exceeded my risk tolerance. Still, the Silk Road era was a rarified moment in history, and I was too busy warning people about money transmission to even buy a pair of alpaca socks.  In fairness to myself, it was still the early days – the summer of 2013. A bitcoin could be had for about a hundred US dollars. Things were simpler then. Ethereum didn't exist. Nobody was talking about the legality of token sales.  I had just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, where, together with other members of the Bitcoin Foundation, we had the first multilateral meetings with the federal government on cryptocurrency.  It had been quite a party. FinCEN, IRS, FBI, DEA, SEC, CFPB, CFTC… just about any agency with a potential interest in magical internet money was there to hear us explain it to them. None were believers. In fact, the vibe in the room was clear: bitcoin is for criminals, and these apologists think they're going to change our minds.  This 'bitcoin is for criminals' narrative may not have started with the Silk Road, but it was certainly buoyed by it.  The marketplace was accessible only via the so-called 'dark web', an anonymous network that required specialized software to use. Once accessed, you could buy anything. Drugs, porn, fake driver's licenses… so long as you paid in bitcoin.  It was the first, and, at the time, the only one of its kind. As the Silk Road grew in popularity, so did recognition that bitcoin could be used for illicit activity, and so did the government's interest in it.  So, the government shut Silk Road down.  The hammer  It happened in October of 2013, just a couple of months after our grand defense of bitcoin to the very federal agencies that gave the order.  I can't say just where I heard the news first, but the reports hit almost at once: posts on social media, emails from clients, calls for comment from the press, communications from the Bitcoin Foundation's PR team.  In many of their voices, I heard an unmistakable tinge of panic – the kind of panic usually endemic to tense depositions or bet-the-company litigations – but the only bitcoiner arrested was Ross Ulbricht, the dark market's alleged (and convicted) operator.  The rest of the bitcoin citizenry was panicked because they were stakeholders in all of it.  Bitcoin was the lifeblood of the Silk Road.  The shock  At the Bitcoin Foundation, we scrambled to develop messaging. At my law practice, we worked to gauge client exposure and risk. Was crypto prohibition on the horizon? Would bitcoin be deemed contraband?  Would the government classify our clients – bitcoin businesses – as entities of primary money laundering concern? If so, an entire industry would be blacklisted from the global financial system...  Once news broke, the media speculated widely that bitcoin transaction volumes would drop to near zero, and that bitcoin prices would do the same. After all, bitcoin was for criminals, the narrative went, and now that the greatest criminal use for bitcoins was gone, what was bitcoin good for?  At the time, we could only speculate. A systemic limitation of a permissionless, pseudonymous network is a lack of data on the intent of its users. We could only guess how much of bitcoin was tied to Silk Road.  Many of us, even if privately, guessed that it was a lot.  We were wrong. When we finally looked back on the numbers, volume didn't drop. It soared. Price did fall, but almost immediately recovered and blew past its pre-Silk Road heights. It was astounding.  Damage control  One of our public messaging points at the Bitcoin Foundation was the story that bitcoin was a currency with a heart of gold, now freed from unjust association with dark markets.  Its value and its volume were now demonstrably independent from its greatest suspected criminal use, we said. From the beginning, the 'bitcoin is for criminals' narrative had to be fiction.  And we were right. Still, this wasn't the whole story. The whole story was a great deal more complex because, almost immediately, dozens of Silk Road copycats begun to spring up.  Within a year, there were plenty of dark markets using bitcoin. Some were even using new, more privacy-focused digital currencies that were opaque to forensics and post-hoc analysis.  Yet, we also started to see transaction volumes in developing countries start to climb significantly for the first time. People were using bitcoin to improve their lives. Word was getting out that there was an alternative to runaway inflation and fiscal mismanagement inherent in some government money.  It just so happened to get out to criminals quicker than it did to most everyone else.  Lasting impact  Still, Silk Road showed us that bitcoin could be used for criminal transactions just as well as legitimate transactions.  Its shuttering showed us the criminal uses of bitcoin were probably much more limited than anyone – even most bitcoiners – suspected. Silk Road changed the way we thought about money. It changed the way we thought about anonymity. It was a rarified moment in history, the effects of which transformed an industry.  It changed so much about my government outreach work and my practice of law. But at the time, I couldn't even work up the courage to log on and buy some alpaca socks.  I still kick myself.

42427541,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVwPh,1493974808,A Decentralized Mixer For Ethereum? Zcoin Is Working on It,"The development team behind zcoin, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency built on the Zerocoin protocol, has announced a project to create a decentralized coin mixer for ether transactions.  Revealed in a post on the zcoin blog published 4th May, the idea is to create an ethereum-compatible version of the procedures in the Zerocoin protocol which allow users to convert non-anonymous cryptocurrency (bitcoin, ether etc) into an anonymous token.  The idea is that these tokens could be sent to another user, converted back into the base currency and spent without revealing the private token's owner.  Running such a system on ethereum opens up the possibility of both leveraging the platform's smart contract functionality and eliminating the need for a trusted third party to handle the mixing, as is currently the case with bitcoin mixers.  As the zcoin post explained:  ""Unlike Coinjoin and its variants, it also does not require a central server to process such mixing, does not require you to trust any third parties and does not require other users to provide liquidity for a mixing transaction.""  While the highest levels of anonymity in the cryptocurrency space are currently associated with standalone currencies such as zcash, dash and monero, the zcoin mixer is representative of a small but growing trend in privacy projects focused on ethereum.  Another such example, ZoE (Zcash on ethereum), similarly showed that there are fruitful avenues to explore in bringing anonymity technology to the distributed computing platform.
