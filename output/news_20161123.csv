42379010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkah,1479926450,21 Files for New Bitcoin Mining Patent,"21 Inc has applied for a patent for specialized bitcoin mining circuitry, public records show.  According to an application published earlier this month by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), 21 Inc is seeking a patent for ""digital currency mining circuitry with adaptable difficulty compare capabilities"".  The application was originally filed on 6th May, 2015, with 21 co-founders Nigel Drego, Veerbhan Kheterpal and Daniel Firu named as inventors. The application is the second for 21, which submitted a similar application in April 2014 that was published in October of last year.  Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process by which entities on the network race to create the next valid block of transactions, and the successful addition of a block nets the miner 12.5 fresh bitcoins, worth roughly $9,200 at current prices. In the years since bitcoin's creation, mining has evolved from smaller, home-based setups to data center-based operations that run hundreds of machines simultaneously.  According to the application, it's the rise of specialized bitcoin mining hardware that resulted in a need to develop improved methods for chasing the next block.  The application states:  ""The difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle has led to the use of dedicated circuitry designed specifically for bitcoin mining. Such dedicated circuitry can be expensive to design, purchase, and operate. It may therefore be desirable to provide improved systems and methods for performing cryptographic operations and for verifying the solutions generated from the cryptographic operations.""  The filing is notable given that 21 Inc had worked with Intel on the development of a bitcoin mine that began operating in 2013, using chips from the Santa Clara-based technology firm as detailed in documents obtained by CoinDesk last year.  21 has gone on to build its strategy around the Bitcoin Computer released in September 2015 and aimed at creating a basis for machine-to-machine payments using the digital currency. The startup, which has raised more than $100m in venture funding to date, launched a software suite in May as part of a push to expand the concept to other devices.  The USPTO has published a number of bitcoin and blockchain patents in recent weeks, including those from startups Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, as well as established firms like AT&T and Nasdaq.  21 did not respond to requests for comment.

42379003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkRt,1479913251,"Morgan Stanley is Planning to Leave R3, Reports Say","Morgan Stanley is said to be pulling out of the R3CEV blockchain consortium, according to reports.  Reuters  and The Wall Street Journal indicate that the bank doesn't plan to take part in the startup's ongoing funding effort, aimed at raising $150m. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander had moved to withdraw from the consortium, though at press time, neither bank has publicly commented on the reasons for their exits.  Departures aside, the consortium is pushing forward, as most of the R3 member banks are said to be planning to invest in the funding round. Those involved reportedly had until the end of last week to express non-binding interest in participatoin.  According to the Journal, Bank of America, UBS and Barclays remain R3 members.  R3 said earlier this week that member turnover was expected as the consortium efforts move forward, stating:  ""Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.""  At press time, Morgan Stanley has yet to publicly comment on the matter.

42379006,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkWv,1479907507,Steemit's First 'Fest' Reveals the Power of Blockchain Community,"When it comes to evaluating the strength of a blockchain (after you put aside technical discussions), what matters more, eventually, is the ecosystem that forms around a blockchain, the community that develops to support it.  In the public blockchain segment, bitcoin is known to have the strongest, if not the most expansive blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is easily second in line, with over 300 distributed applications and an increasing number of startup companies opting to use its infrastructure.  If you continue this ranking using community and ecosystem as units of measure, Steem (via its flagship social site Steemit) is the best contender for the third-largest, blockchain ecosystem.  For background, Steem is the blockchain platform that powers Steemit, an incentivized social media publishing application. (Steemit is like social media sites you're familiar with, except that users earn real financial rewards for posting, participating and voting).  Actually, the Steem blockchain has already (automatically) dispensed $4m since its launch in March 2016 to thousands of its early adopters, and has caught the attention of the market due to the meteoric rise of its cryptocurrency, then subsequent fall back to initial levels.  For the sake of analogy, if Facebook was re-incarnated today, using Steem's philosophy, we would all get compensated for giving them our attention, which they have centrally and monopolistically monetized.  Global appeal  SteemFest  , a two-day conference held last week, was the first coming together of the Steem global community. It was the brainchild of Roeland Landegent, an Amsterdam-based software developer and event organizer.  In August, Roeland, an early Steemian (as Steem users are called) contacted Steemit's CEO and co-founder Ned Scott and proposed the idea for an in-person gathering, and the concept was embraced by Steemit Inc. Subsequently, Steemit Inc, along with other sponsors, agreed to fund the event to make ticket prices affordable, while keeping the quality of the event logistics high.  I was one of 35 speakers at that event, and witnessed the variety, vibrancy, excitement and eclectic composition of the 206 attendees who came from an impressive mix of 31 countries, representing Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Panama, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the UK and the US.  Many of the attendees paid for their travel using Steem dollars they had earned on the platform, As a bonus, each attendee received a number of Steem Power as a reward for attending. Furthermore, a fund was made available to reimburse attendees in financial need. One small exhibit area featured Maurice Mikkers, a ""tear catcher"" who photographs your tear via a special microscope in high resolution for 25 SBD (Steem-backed dollars).  These were just a handful of the real examples that demonstrated the usefulness of Steem as a currency that crosses from the online to the real world.  Two other demographics stats impressed me: about 25% of the audience were developers, and a good 35% of the total attendees were women.  Those two numbers are significant because they fly in the opposite direction of what you typically see in blockchain conferences that are filled with generally male developers. The non-developer segment speaks to the fact that many Steem users don't even have knowledge of the blockchain in the background.  'Live experiment'  Just like the SteemFest attendees, the speakers and topics were eclectic.  Presentations ranged from a ""State of the Steem Nation"" address by Ned Scott to a talk by eight-time New York Times best-selling author Neil Strauss on his Steemit experience.  Elsewhere, Steemit superstar Heidi, known as @heiditravels, spoke about how she is now able to fund her world travels from Steem earnings. There was also a coding on Steem tutorial; a developer’s roundtable; and discussions relating to Steem’s governance model.  My talk's title was ""The Grand Vision of a Crypto-Tech Economy"", in which I presented the greater context of a circular economy that is surrounding Steemit.  Videos from 17 of the presentations from the main hall (there were two tracks) are available here. Both tracks were live-streamed during the event and garnered 1,000 viewers during the Saturday.  Some consider Steemit to be a live experiment, and if it is so, it carries with it several best practices and lessons. Instead of reporting on the content of the presentations, I will enumerate some lessons for other blockchain ecosystems, with Steem as an example:  The ecosystem is a measure of strength. An ecosystem is typically an outcome that results from finding a community that embraces your technology, and is not dictated top down. Bitcoin has experienced it. Ethereum has thrived on it. Steem is currently doing it.  Number of blockchain applications is key. Blockchains need to showcase the level of innovation that is forming around their technology. For Steem, Steemtools is a repository of about 100 Steem-related applications and useful tools. It is a good display of creativity and innovation around the Steem blockchain and Steemit. Some of the promising applications include a marketplace, a magazine and a decentralized publishing application.  Users may not care or know there is a blockchain. A blockchain’s main purpose is to maintain integrity of transactions, ensure there is no double-spending, provide value flow and continue to care for the needs of its community. End-users in Steemit drive the value and engagement with the platform, not the technologists behind it.  Tokens must provide a needed utility. A real linkage between tokens and the business is not to be underestimated. In the case of Steemit, the currency is part and parcel of its operations. Every user click, vote, comment or published content is tracked and monetized. It is not possible to game the system or easily cause unnatural user behavior.  Work translates to value. Upfront investment is needed. Some people invest their money. Others invest their time. Both have returns, but you must invest something. Steem users that invested their time in publishing, upvoting or commenting on other content are rewarded. It’s the ultimate work-to-value translation.  Governance can evolve. No blockchain is perfect at launch time, just as no product is ideal at its initial launch. Bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchains have experienced their share of hard or soft forks, on the road to continued evolution. Steem is no different, and they will be iterating on their incentive model based on a proposal that was the result of user feedback and discussions at Steemfest.  Transparency is key. A public blockchain is almost like a public company. Ongoing transparency is paramount. Almost everything related to Steemit is openly available. They have publicly shared their usage metrics – a few of which are: 110,000 registered users, 25,000 daily readers (4,000 of which actively participate), close to 3,000 posts published daily, with an average of 35 actions on each, all of them recorded on the blockchain, resulting in over 1 transaction per second. Some of the applications in Steemtools use their API to pull further insights from Steemit.  Network effects are important. You can’t escape the beneficial laws of network effects when building a blockchain ecosystem or application. Each new user benefits all others via their participation, therefore increasing Steem’s value for all participants, and enabling that value to get propagated on the very network that was inherently created.  SteemFest was an essential reality check on the status of the Steem ecosystem, but every blockchain, decentralized application or decentralized protocol owes it to their community to think about their own ""fest"" as a living display that brings together its ecosystem and showcase its life.  In an ironic twist, that might be the only central artifact in an otherwise very decentralized phenomenon.  Disclosure: The author holds value in bitcoin, classic ether, ether and steem.

42379011,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkbx,1479904534,Uganda Takes its First Steps Toward Bitcoin Regulation,"A UN organization focused on criminal justice issues has released details about a meeting on bitcoin and digital currencies this past summer in Uganda.  Held in Kampala on 7th July, the meeting drew support from the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (UNAFRI); the Bank of Uganda; and the University of Birmingham Law School.  Dr Maureen Mapp, a teaching fellow for the University of Birmingham Law School who spearheaded the event, told CoinDesk that the aim of the event was to establish a basis from which bitcoin regulation could be crafted in Uganda.  Should the effort move forward, Uganda would be one of the first African countries to regulate bitcoin. (Data from CoinDesk Research shows that interest on the continent is growing, but that its startup sector lags behind other startup sectors internationally).  Indeed, Mapp said the effort grew out of a digital currency research project conducted with the Commonwealth Secretariat that showcased to her how Ugandan public officials were largely in the dark about the technology's benefits and risks.  Mapp told CoinDesk:  ""I was inspired to engage with policy makers and regulators in order to investigate whether states could develop policies and regulation that encourage innovation while protecting the private rights and interests of users of virtual currencies.""  The overarching goal, she explained, was building awareness, as well as setting the stage for future discussions.  Working with the Ugandan central bank and later UNAFRI – which helped fund the July gathering – Mapp began contacting stakeholders within the country to put together what became the meeting at UNAFRI’s campus in Kampala, Uganda’s capitol.  Among the outcomes of the meeting is a think tank dedicated to the ""technological, policy, pluralist, ethical and legal issues"" surrounding digital currencies, composed of the organizations and representatives that attended the July meeting. Those involved also developed a draft framework for future discussions between private and public stakeholders, which was published earlier this month by UNAFRI.  Next steps include the preparation for a second meeting, set to take place on the same date in 2017. But ahead of that, the gears are already in motion for future regulatory or legislative moves in Uganda.  ""The legal and regulatory environment is moving towards embracing the technology so as to harness its benefits and to promote innovation,"" she said.  Before that, stakeholders need to agree on the right approach to regulation. Self-regulatory and public-private partnerships are currently on the table, according to Mapp.  ""Another concern is how to mitigate any risks in order to protect the public interests, but without stifling innovation,"" Mapp explained.

42378998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkQd,1479875008,Bitcoin Pioneer Charlie Shrem Launches New Blockchain Venture,"""You're going to have bitcoiners owning stakes in septic tank companies.""  If early bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem's newest venture (his first since his release from prison earlier this year) goes to plan, the results could offer new – and unusual – ways for digital currency users to invest.  Called Intellisys Capital, the startup (co-founded by CEO Jason Granger) intends to offer a private equity investment portfolio in which tokens representing shares in a portfolio of ""middle market companies"" are issued on the ethereum blockchain.  Announced at CoinDesk On Tap in New York today, the venture is Shrem's first since his first startup BitInstant shut down amid regulatory concerns.  Intellisys Capital, he said, now intends to issue tokens representing blockchain-based shares in manufacturing, real estate or even sanitary waste firms that are profitable and low risk.  Shrem told the audience:  ""We'll be selling ownership and shares in this portfolio of companies on the blockchain, so a token won't be based on speculation. If you own the token, you'll be owning a piece of hard assets, a piece of these companies.""  Blockchain will be used to administer and decentralize the fund, he added.  As explained in a press release, the fund will be called Mainstreet Investment LP, and 30% will be owned by token holders and a controlling stake. The remaining 70% will, in turn, be owned by Intellisys Capital.  Using this strategy, Intellisys Capital hopes to begin generating dividends, which it will then issue to token holders and invest in blockchain technology companies to build a portfolio. (Shrem cited this ability as a key reason Intellisys is using the ethereum platform).  ""The strategy is designed to create symbiosis between blockchain assets and traditional finance and to help many traditional sectors move toward state-of-the-art improvements and efficiencies,"" a press release said.  Expected to launch in the next few months, Intellisys will raise funds through the sale of an ethereum-based token called 'mainstreet investment token', slated to be sold starting 15th January, 2017. The sale will only be open to both global investors and accredited US investors.  Elsewhere, Shrem discussed his life after prison, as well as his perceptions on current industry events and issues with Cooley LLP blockchain lead and industry legal veteran Marco Santori.  Overall, Shrem was positive about both the bitcoin and blockchain industry and the new venture, adding:  ""I could've went [to jail] and the technology could have died, and it did the opposite.""  For more of Shrem's talk, watch the full stream of the inaugural CoinDesk On Tap event below.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated the crowdsale would not be open to US investors.
