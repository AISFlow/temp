As CoinDesk previously reported  , SEC staffers rejected proposals from three companies – Proshares, GraniteShares and Direxion – in a triple-set of orders published late yesterday. Now, according to the letters, senior SEC officials will review those orders, though it's unclear at this time when the review will be completed.  As SEC secretary Brent Fields wrote in a letter addressed to NYSE Group senior counsel David De Gregorio:  ""This letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 43 I of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 20 I .43 1, the Commission will review the delegated action. In accordance with Rule 431 (e), the August 22 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.""  ""The Office of the Secretary will notify you of any pertinent action taken by the Commission,"" Fields added. Similar language was used in two others letters, including another sent to NYSE Group and Cboe Global Markets.  The news was announced by commissioner Hester Peirce, who notably dissented from a decision last month that saw the SEC shoot down, for a second time, a proposed bitcoin ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  In a follow-up tweet, Commissioner Peirce explained the steps to come as the SEC moves to review the decisions.  ""In English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff. When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission. The Commission may review the staff's action, as will now happen here,"" Peirce wrote.

The idea is that the technology can be used to simplify court processes for handling digital evidence, according to Balaji Anbil, who is also the head of digital architecture and cybersecurity at the Justice Ministry.  The agency involved in the test is Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), and according to Anbil, a working group focused on the tech recently held its first meeting on the matter.  In the Thursday blog post, Anbil explained that ""as an architectural style, distributed ledgers enable new innovative data solutions that support both high degrees of integrity and [decentralization].""  Anbil added:  ""At HMCTS, we are passionate about the application of novel solutions to traditional challenges including evidence sharing, identity management and ensuring citizens have maximum control over their own information. Our service designs are focused on value, simplicity and use of the best modern technology approaches. This brings numerous benefits including cost effective and timely delivery and future proof solutions.""  Anbil explained that the technology has already been used by some European Union member nations, highlighting Estonia in particular as a country which ""developed innovative citizen identity management solutions using blockchain.""  The post also noted that HMCTS will trial the technology for ""inter-agency evidence sharing"" later this year.  Last November, Alistair Davidson, a technical architecture lead at the Ministry, outlined the use case in a separate blog that, at the time, did not indicate that the U.K. government was moving ahead with an actual pilot.

42429565,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzlzh,1535038225,Bittrex Partners With Trading Firm on Crypto Securities Offering,"U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex is partnering with a regulated alternative trading system (ATS) with the aim of ultimately launching trading in crypto securities.  In an announcement Thursday, Bitrex said it is working with Rialto Trading, which currently offers fixed-income products for traders, to gain regulatory approval to support ""blockchain-based securities,"" according to a press release.  If approval is granted, Rialto plans to launch a ""comprehensive"" securities offering, including an issuance advisory service, placement, trading and custody. For the system, the firm will leverage its ATS and the tools it uses to support its existing offerings alongside Bittrex's blockchain, cybersecurity and cryptocurrency trading tools.  The release adds that the ATS will support U.S. dollar trading for digital securities.  Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara said, ""It takes a unique combination of advanced technology and financial expertise to build and launch an efficient, reliable and secure platform for trading digital securities.""  The partnership will also bring access to a larger market for Rialto's clients, said CEO Shari Noonan.  She added:  ""By working together, we'll be able to expand our current client offerings to not only include digital securities, but also provide them access to a globally advanced and reliable trading platform.""  Shihara continued to say that the ""new venture is well-positioned to further advance blockchain's adoption by offering a comprehensive solution at the right time.""  The move by Bittrex sees the firm positioning itself similarly to U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, which announced in June that it was taking steps to become a federally regulated broker-dealer.  Coinbase revealed in a company blog post that the firm is in the process of acquiring a broker-dealer license, an alternative trading system license and a registered investment advisor license.  If those licenses are granted, the exchange plans to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to offer blockchain-based securities. As part of the plan, Coinbase is moving to acquire several regulated companies – Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC – to smooth its path.

Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, Toshihide Endo, commissioner of the Financial Services Agency (FSA), said his agency is trying to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in a way that protects consumers and yet doesn't stifle innovation.  He told the news source:  ""We have no intention to curb [the cryptocurrency industry] excessively We would like to see it grow under appropriate regulation.""  Endo's comments echo statements previously made by representatives of the FSA. In September of last year, an unnamed executive of the regulator was quoted by The Japan Times as saying, ""We pursue both market fostering and regulation enforcement. ... We aim for sound market development.""  That comment came even as the FSA moved to more closely scrutinize exchanges to ensure they adhered to a revised payment services law, passed in April 2017. The new rules defined operational standards for exchanges and set up a licensing scheme for exchanges, as well as, in a world first, recognizing bitcoin as a form of legal tender.  In January of this year, a $530 million hack of the country's Coincheck exchange prompted the FSA to launch inspections and issue ""business improvement orders"" for exchanges that were deemed to have inadequate systems in place.  Endo was appointed commissioner of the FSA in July, having previously been director-general of the agency's supervisory bureau.

Vidente, a video equipment maker that owns 10.55 percent of Bithumb and 10 percent of its holding company, revealed the financial data to a South Korean financial regulator on Thursday, according to local news agency Yonhap.  Before deductions, the filings state, Bithumb collected a total of $270 million in revenue within the first six months of 2018, with $194 million in operating profits.  While the data for the same period last year is not available, Yonhap said Bithumb made $380 million in net profits in 2017 alone, more than 10 times its half-year profits so far.  It's been a rocky summer for Bithumb so far. The platform suffered a major breach in June that saw around $31 million in cryptocurrencies stolen – though it later claimed to have clawed back $14 million. It's not clear if that event has affected the disclosed first-half figures significantly or if the costs will be pushed to a later accounting period.  An investigation into possible tax evasion launched in January also saw the company receive a hefty bill of around $28 million as it concluded, also in June – although no wrongdoing was found.  Data from CoinMarketCap indicates the 24-hour trading volume on Bithumb, once the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has taken a significant plunge this year.  For instance, on Jan. 2, Bithumb was the world's third-largest trading venue with $2.5 billion in 24-hour trading volume. It has now dropped to the 19th, with around $71.7 million changing hands in the past trading day.  CoinDesk also reported early this month that the 24-hour trading volume on Bithumb dropped by 40 percent from $350 million to $250 million within a week after it suspended the opening of new customer accounts due to a banking restriction – an issue also related to the hack.  In similar news, Dunamu, the software developer that owns the Upbit exchange, has also just disclosed its latest financial data.

42429574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzmDh,1535022003,Bitcoin Price Defends Key Support Despite ETF Rejections,"Bitcoin is teasing a minor rally today, having defended key support at $6,230 despite a string of bad news.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,400 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, 94 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are flashing red, according to CoinMarketCap.  The risk-off tone in the cryptocurrency markets is likely associated with the US Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) rejection of several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday.  Further, it was reported earlier today that China, one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies, is planning to block access to more than 100 overseas crypto exchanges.  Still, BTC has avoided a break below the rising trendline and is holding well above the support at $6,230 (Aug. 20 low), as seen in the chart below, forcing us to consider the possibility of a rally.  4-hour chart  The chart also shows the 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls. So, it seems safe to say that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Only a UTC close below $6,230 would weaken the bull case.  That said, the probability of a break below $6,230 is low, as the SEC ruling has not caught the market off guard – that is, the investor community was likely expecting the commission to deliver bad news after its previous ETF rejection in July.  Following that, the bitcoin price crashed more than 30 percent in the three weeks to Aug. 14, indicating the market was pricing in yesterday's negative news in advance.  View  BTC could remain well bid above $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) in the next 24 hours. That would pave the way for a sustained rise towards $7,000 in the short-term.  If the support at $6,230 is breached, then the bears may push the cryptocurrency down to the recent low of $5,859.  A UTC close below $5,755 (June low) would signal a resumption of the long-run bear market and would open the doors to $5,000 (psychological support).

At the core of the Pure Diamond Blockchain Project is the cryptocurrency Pure Diamond Coin (PDC).PDC is a cryptocurrency that is &apos;pegged&apos; or &apos;linked&apos; with the generation of lab-grown diamonds. This association of PDC and a collateral ensures that the value of the token is more stable and less likely to face large fluctuations. Overtime as more lab-grown diamonds are cultivated, the value of the token is expected to steadily increase. For instance, in its first year if 100 lab-grown diamonds are cultivated then one token would be valued at 100 lab-grown diamonds. In its second year 200 lab-grown diamonds are cultivated, so the valuation of the PDC token would be 200 lab-grown diamonds.The post PR: The New Era of Jewellery Pioneered By The Pure Diamond Blockchain Project appeared first on Bitcoin News.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ICO | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-the-new-era-of-jewellery-pioneered-by-the-pure-diamond-blockchain-project/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/bitcoin.com/cldf2rh6sP6.jpeg

42429567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzlvh,1535011207,Crypto Startups Are Destroying Millions of Coins – And Investors Love It,"Throwing away revenue?  It might not make sense in conventional business, but don't tell that to crypto entrepreneurs. Indeed, for some projects, economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of ""creative destruction"" is taking on a literal meaning in that they're actively destroying their own money supply – and generating value for investors in the process.  It's turning out to be an unexpected benefit of the initial coin offering (ICO) model, whereby startups and projects fuel and fund their projects with a scarce digital asset they create. In short, these projects can use the token to price their services, and then strategically alter the economics of the money supply to which they have a direct relationship.  To that end, burning tokens, or destroying the cryptographic keys to these assets so they can't ever be recovered, has proven to be a selling point for investors, with ICO white papers finding projects promising they will destroy new tokens as they return to the issuer as earnings. Essentially the ask is, if you buy our token now, these companies promise potential backers they'll trash them as they earn them back.  However unorthodox, one thing is clear: speculators appear to love the model.  Take Switzerland-based Eidoo, which just announced that it was burning 1 percent of the total supply of the EDO tokens it created when it did its ICO in November.  Its latest blog post reads: ""The excellent news is that we will destroy 920,000.00 EDO tokens starting from August 31st. This means that we are going to permanently remove one percent of the total supply of EDO tokens.""  Sure enough, EDO's price spiked nearly 40 percent shortly after the post above came out.  For Eidoo, this means it earned the tokens it created back as revenue from helping startups to run ICOs on its app. But since it isn't going about this process alone (the company says it has 200,000 users eager to get in on more sales), it's jettisoning a full half of the money it brought in by burning the tokens.  The twist is, Eidoo is a major holder of EDO tokens, meaning it's a win-win for the company and investors.  As Eidoo's Amelia Tomasicchio told CoinDesk:  ""Burning 50 percent of our revenue is not really creating any loss for the company itself, but it is creating value for the entire EDO token holders.""  A new direction  Sure, there may not be guarantees that Eidoo's model will work in the long run, but industry insiders argue counter-intuitive practices like this come with the territory in eras of financial experimentation.  ""This is a 1.0 attempt to manage how an economy would work,"" author, investor and crypto startup advisor William Mougayar told CoinDesk, adding: ""They all want to play Fed Reserve Chairman or Chairwoman.""  Mougayar said he expects more companies to handle their crypto finances in creative ways, which doesn't mean that all the ideas are good. Destroying part of a company's revenue may seem disconcerting, or even signal to consumers that it is over-priced.  As Mougayar said, it's a pattern that can never work for a company that isn't delivering a service in demand.  Tomasicchio wrote:  ""This model has been adopted during the recent months by a variety of projects in the space, however, Eidoo has been quite unique in burning so many tokens in such a short timespan – thanks to a very high revenue coming from the service usage of the recent months.""  Founded in 2016 to make crypto easier and more mobile friendly, Eidoo started burning early on. After its $27.9 million ICO in November left a little over 9 percent of the tokens designated for the sale unsold, it burned them, as it had promised to do.  The burning continues later this month, and so far, it's winning the project attention.  ""Projects burn their own tokens to remove them from the market to demonstrate consumption – as a result this creates further scarcity, thereby affecting the market cap, and arguably is a form of price manipulation,"" Lisa Cheng of the Vanbex Group, a blockchain services company.  Follow the exchanges  But Eidoo's upcoming burn won't be the most significant instance in recent memory, as crypto exchanges that have launched their own tokens have most readily embraced the model.  In July, Binance burned 2.5 million of its BNB tokens (which it uses for discounts on its exchange) worth approximately $30 million, according to a blog post (that's more than the whole market cap of all the EDO tokens). When it created the token, the company committed to burning 20 percent of its token profits each year.  Even more aggressively, they say they will do it up until they've gone through half the BNB token supply.  Still, there's utility beyond the depreciating supply. The Binance token has been used to lower the cost of transactions for users, helping to bring more people onto the platform, as Mohamed Fouda explained in a recent Medium post about why exchanges are launching tokens. Effectively, they leverage their large volume to drive up the value of their stored supply of tokens, offloading revenue to token appreciation.  But it only works if people want to come. Mougayar gave the example of a tavern.  ""If I bribe you with a free beer, you may come once,"" he said, but visitors that don't like the place won't come back. Similarly, a company that uses a token to provide early discounts to bring people in still need to deliver a strong product.  The idea is spreading across exchanges. KuCoin is using 10 percent of its profits each quarter to buy back and burn its own tokens.  Even Eidoo will launch its own decentralized exchange or ""hybrid exchange"" in a few weeks, with plans to use EDO there as well.  Munchee flashback  But while buybacks and burning can boost price, it could present other problems for projects.  Eidoo calls its token a utility token. ""The way a given token works defines its very nature. Regulators themselves are already doing a good job trying to define the different categories of tokens which are being used today,"" Tomasicchio wrote.  U.S. regulators, though, have indicated which category tokens with burn functions fall into.  ""I would caution those exploring this concept to check with their jurisdiction as the recent SEC announcements have been quite clear that burning tokens would constitute the actions of a security,"" Cheng wrote.  In particular, she looked to the Munchee decision from last year, in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) specifically pointed to the company's promise to destroy tokens as an example of increased value ""derived from the significant entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of others.""  It is well established in equity markets that buy backs are a way to support the price of a stock. If a company has cash reserves and flat growth, as Apple has had from time to time, it can be a way to keep the mass of its investors loyal by stabilizing the stock price.  We have seen this pattern come to crypto as well. U Network recently did a buyback to power its growth effort. Going further and burning is adds complexity, but the SEC appears confident it can draw a parallel to what token issuers are doing with examples from equities markets.  ""I'm not sure this will stand the test of time,"" Mougayar said.  He concluded:  ""The sky is not the limit.""

The office now plans to step up its efforts in monitoring commercial use of cryptocurrency and to block internet access to these trading platforms, the report said.  Authorized in 2016 by China's State Council, the National Fintech Risk Rectification Office is a government agency that aims to protect against financial risk related to issues like peer-to-peer lending and cryptocurrency trading.

42429576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzmFh,1534996915,Even If It Fails: Why Dash Could Have a Lasting Impact on Crypto Adoption,"It's easy to see why Zimbabwean entrepreneur James Saruchera wants to use cryptocurrency to circumnavigate inflation.  As a university student in South Africa, Saruchera dropped classes and worked multiple jobs when inflation in his homeland made it impossible to remit school fees. His parents later lost their savings and pension investments after another bout of hyperinflation.  Yet when Saruchera founded his payments startup in February 2017, after years of researching different blockchain networks, he made what many in the crypto community might consider a surprising choice. He picked dash to be the backbone of the business.  Founded in 2014 as darkcoin before adopting a more regulator-friendly brand, dash is best known for its optional privacy features and boasts a market capitalization in the lower half of the top 20 cryptos. It's drawn a fair bit of criticism for its cryptography practices and the way the core team has been run as a for-profit venture from day one.  But dash has at least one thing going for it: its team has figured out how to win over entrepreneurs in the developing world, like Saruchera.  His startup, Kuvacash, was seeded with a grant for roughly $550,000 worth of the cryptocurrency from the Dash Treasury DAO, a pool of mining rewards that allows dash fans worldwide to submit proposals and vote on which ideas get funding.  Saruchera said:  ""It's as close as you can get to a perfectly decentralized, democratic organization.""  Now, he's getting ready to pilot Kuvacash's mobile payments app with 100 users in October and negotiating with the government of Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, to build a dash-powered transit app for an upcoming tram line.  While cryptocurrency adherents have been evangelizing the technology in poorer countries since the early days of bitcoin, few projects if any have done so as aggressively as dash.  The Dash Treasury DAO alone has granted over $33 million-worth of dash since 2015, $2.3 million of which went to projects in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, Ghana and Kenya. That number is clearly ramping up as the community shifts strategies. Out of 27 grants in the developing world, 20 of those proposals have received funding over the past 12 months. The August 2018 payout alone is expected to give around $920,273 worth of dash, including grants for programs in Venezuela and Brazil.  In addition to providing this startup capital, the project has set it itself apart in these markets by offering support for entrepreneurs, starting with their first transaction and wallet all the way to launching a dash-oriented business. Protocol developers also improve the underlying software based on feedback from such diverse users.  And despite the lingering controversies over dash's technical infrastructure, these efforts to serve marginalized communities are starting to gain notice.  ""I have heard about and admire their outreach,"" said Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful, a bitcoin exchange that focuses on emerging markets.  Boots on the ground  The Dash Core startup, which stewards the dash network, learned people in the developing world can drive adoption on their own when given free capital and technical support.  ""In the same way that you have a credit card that might say JPMorgan Chase on it, and its powered by Visa, it's their own brand of services and its powered by dash,"" Dash Core Group CEO Ryan Taylor told CoinDesk.  According to Taylor, dash is seeing the fastest adoption rates in places with high inflation and easy access to mobile phones. So, to maximize growth, the company will focus on hiring more local staff in emerging markets.  ""We're going to be putting a lot more resources into that corridor of countries that exhibit those attributes,"" Taylor said.  Beyond funding, grant recipients also engage with Dash Core developers to provide feedback and get support on infrastructure development.  ""We have the ability to effect improvements, feedback on certain use cases and how those [insights] can be adjusted at the core platform level,"" Saruchera said, adding:  ""On-the-ground insight has led to them [Dash Core Group] modeling zero confirmation instant send, increasing the speed and capacity of InstantSend on the network. These high-performance protocol adjustments help lay the foundation to improve dash's speed even further.""  Meanwhile, Dash Core Group employees often give away small amounts of crypto to users in places like Venezuela.  To be sure, other blockchain projects have used similar tactics in developing countries. Some have rewarded locals for recruiting new users, such as the South African startup Wala, or worked with crypto exchanges to increase access, like the startup behind zcash did by partnering with AirTM exchange in Latin America. The Ethereum Foundation funds one-off research projects. Some bitcoin projects are donating crypto to groups in the developing world.  But dash is doing all of the above, and starting to get some results. Take, for example, Venezuela, where according to the Dash Core Group, hundreds of merchants are now transacting with dash, thanks to local advocacy programs. These ambassadors literally walk up to Venezuelan businessmen and convince them to start using dash.  ""We're going to be rolling out a plan for Latin America more broadly,"" Taylor said. ""Venezuela has become our second largest market.""  Yet these Venezuelan users aren't necessarily joining the broader crypto community. One such merchant in Caracas, food truck entrepreneur Alejandro Valderrama, told CoinDesk he hasn't learned about any other blockchain technologies or engaged with the dash community beyond his own customers and dash ambassadors.  To be fair, a dash saleswoman introduced Valderrama to digital wallets this July, so he's quite new to the scene. Now, four or five customers a day buy Valderrama's food with dash, worth up to $7 per transaction, adding around three percent to his overall revenue. He holds the cryptocurrency without converting into fiat or seeking any significant funding from dash organizations.  Valderrama described dash as a ""strong currency,"" the best way to hedge against the devalued bolivar.  Critics and converts  Funding and infrastructure model aside, some still question Dash Core Group's tactics and sustainability.  Critics say the dash model artificially restricts supply with misaligned incentives since node operators and miners share fractional profits. Plus, it is far more expensive to operate a full dash node, called a master node, than a bitcoin node. Some say this hinders the network's decentralization.  Blockchain consultant Tone Vays told CoinDesk he's concerned the dash governance model isn't sustainable and the community's evangelizing tactics may confuse less tech-savvy consumers, adding:  ""If people convert their dash into something that has a higher probability of lasting for a longer time, that's great. But if they don't, they will be scammed or lose all their value and hate all crypto going forward.""  Bitcoin is more secure and decentralized than dash's experiments, he said. Bitcoin may not accommodate low-value transactions yet, but onboarding merchants with a dash-only digital wallet troubles Vays.  When asked about the risks of promoting an altcoin to unsophisticated consumers, Venezuelan business development lead Alejandro Echeverría, head of the Dash Merchant program, pointed to dash's educational efforts. These include monthly events drawing 500 attendees in Caracas and ""Dash Youth"" lectures at high schools and universities.  ""We are focused in Dash exclusively and we want people really use it as a daily currency,"" Echeverría said.  On the other hand, Tricia Martinez, CEO of the ethereum-powered Wala, told CoinDesk hiring local ambassadors to promote a single digital asset is the norm in emerging markets. Gathering feedback from novices is also invaluable to developers abroad, as is hands-on cooperation from sophisticated users like Saruchera in Zimbabwe.  ""These consumers need to be on our team,"" Martinez said. ""They need to be building.""  As for the criticism about expensive nodes, dash node operator Eric Sammons wrote a blog post that running such software is simply a job that requires collateral as a prerequisite. And in response to criticisms of mining and other technical aspects, theDash Core Group published a statement that dash is a work in progress able to ""deliver innovations"" without venture capital or a token sale because investors and users decide for themselves whether to support the project.  Crypto rails  Since there's no substitute for giving people tools to help themselves, dash adoption may deliver the most impact in places where entrepreneurs run their own experiments with support from technical experts.  Starting in October, Kuvacash will run a pilot with roughly 100 users to test the mobile app's remittance, merchant payments, and peer-to-peer money transfers.  ""Not just in stores, but also in informal trading settings like a person selling tomatoes or bananas at a market,"" Saruchera said. ""If the person that they are sending funds to doesn't have a smartphone, just a feature phone, we can allow them to get a reference number so they can go to our agents and cash out that way.""  Following the hyperinflation cycles over the past decade, most Zimbabweans use imported U.S. dollars because they no longer trust local bonds or banks. So, Kuvacash got a license to import dollars and is now deploying local agents who can help users cash out in person for fiat bills as needed.  By 2019, Kuvacash aims to offer both peer-to-peer payments and crypto-powered transit accounts through the same wallet app to anyone in Harare who wants to use dash. Representatives from the municipality of Harare confirmed they are negotiating a transit deal with Kuvacash, although it is not yet finalized.  If all goes according to plan, commuters will use the mobile app pay for tram rides with dash, which Kuvacash will promptly convert back into U.S. dollars for the tax collector.  At the moment, it's difficult to regulate public transit in Zimbabwe, in terms of price gouging, safety and taxation, because vehicles are mostly operated by individual drivers and owners. Transparent blockchain records of tax revenue could be especially useful for establishing trust in a country fraught with accusations of bureaucratic corruption.  ""Poor people, they can spend as much as 50 percent of their income on travel,"" Saruchera said, adding that the new metro would offer reliable transportation for less than $0.50. ""If we can help fix this, then we can exponentially increase their quality of life.""

Kryptovault, which operates facilities in several Norwegian cities, could be closed because it lacks the right permits, The Local reported Tuesday. Local officials say the facility ""has been operating illegally,"" though it's not clear what certification the mine is required to have.  As a result, the local government may force Kryptovault to shut down its miners – at least temporarily. CEO Stig Myrseth told the paper that the company has applied for the missing permits, adding that the firm was told it had the appropriate permits when it first took over an old paper mill.  The facility draws as much as 40 megawatts of power to run 9,500 computers, and the fans used to cool the facility have sparked complaints over the last several months because of their noise level.  A nearby resident, Trond Gulestø, reportedly told another paper that ""our summer has been ruined,"" explaining that the farm generates noise ""24 hours a day, 365 days a year.""  Last week, as previously reported, the noise level resulted in a bomb threat being made against the company. An anonymous letter stated that ""if you are expanding crypto mining and filling the country with noise, then you will be sabotaging the peace. I am threatening to send you some explosives.""  Kryptovault is looking to invest in equipment to reduce the noise pollution it produces, according to The Local.
