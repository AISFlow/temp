ETH Furbo (FETH) is an Ethereum-based token that gives PEPE reflections to all holders regardless of how much they hold. This means that while investors are earning significant returns on their FETH holdings, they‚Äôre also earning PEPE which means they are getting double the profits. FETH Announces Presale Date In its grand entrance into the crypto market, the FETH team has announced its presale date. The presale is scheduled to hold on Monday, May 15th, at 5 PM UTC and the page is currently live on Pinksale. This will give investors the first chance to get into the FETH token at the lowest price possible. Welcome everyone. Our presale will be taking place on PINKSALE on Monday, May 15th at 5 PM UTC.

This is because upon listing, tokens debut on the market at much higher prices, bringing presale investors good profits. The total supply of FETH is 1,000,000,000,000 tokens and 56% of the total supply will be available for presale. 31.92% of the tokens will go toward the liquidity pool, 6.08% of the supply will be held for centralized exchange listings and liquidity for the token, and 6% will be reserved for team operations and marketing. FETH‚Äôs tokenomics ensures that the community controls the vast majority of the supply, allowing them to determine the price and value of each token. As for the presale, the maximum buy for each wallet is capped at 1 ETH to make room for an even distribution of supply among investors. ETH Furbo Taking Over PEPE, DOGE, And SHIB Instead of having coins that offer the community nothing in return, the FETH token rather provides an avenue for investors to earn more on their investment. This is why automatic PEPE reflections are available for all holders which can be claimed directly on the ETH Furbo website. This allows FETH to develop a loyal and dedicated community that will ensure consistent returns for holders. Furthermore, it is the first meme-based token to also give out PEPE rewards ‚Äì a coin that has rapidly grown to become the third-largest meme coin in the world. PEPE reflections promise to merge FETH with one of the largest meme communities in the world, doubling its reach.

12618262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532567,1684015255,Dogecoin Traders Watch For A Breakout On Higher-Than-Average Volume,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies of 2021, thanks to the involvement of high-profile figures like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. Its value skyrocketed earlier this year, but has since retreated. As investors and traders keep a close eye on its movements, the next potential catalyst for Dogecoin could be a decisive breakout on higher-than-average trading volume. Let‚Äôs examine the current state of Dogecoin, what traders are looking for in terms of a breakout, and what the future may hold for this popular meme coin. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Hit 35% Surge In Staking Demand ‚Äì What It Means For Investors Dogecoin (DOGE) Recent Performance And Price Action On Wednesday, Dogecoin‚Äôs downtrend was confirmed as the cryptocurrency hit a lower high of $0.074 and formed a lower low at the 7-cent mark on Monday. As of Friday‚Äôs 24-hour trading session, Dogecoin was attempting to print an inside bar pattern, indicating a potential bearish trend. Traders should monitor the crypto‚Äôs movement and volume to assess its future direction, especially if it breaks up or down from Thursday‚Äôs mother bar. At the time of writing, Dogecoin‚Äôs price on CoinGecko was 0.072436, showing a 3.0% 24-hour rally. However, the last seven days have been challenging for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, with a significant slump of 9.0%. Despite the recent decline, there‚Äôs a chance that Dogecoin‚Äôs local bottom has occurred as it was working to print a hammer candlestick on Friday. This candlestick pattern suggests that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs downward momentum may have come to a halt, but it remains to be seen whether it can sustain an upward trend in the coming days. Potential Catalyst For Dogecoin‚Äôs Recent Rally Dogecoin‚Äôs recent 24-hour rally may have been influenced by the recent events on Twitter, which have been previously spearheaded by Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúDogefather.‚Äù However, he has now handed the leadership to Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal‚Äôs advertising chief, who appears to share Musk‚Äôs enthusiasm for meme coins. Yaccarino‚Äôs interest in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is evident from the fact that she follows multiple affiliated accounts on Twitter, including the primary ones for both cryptocurrencies. DOGE total market cap currently at $10 billion on the weekend chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: SPONGE Lists On 2 Major Exchanges: Will It Beat Pepe‚Äôs Solid Price Performance? However, her views on key issues related to cryptocurrencies, particularly their potential role on social media platforms, remain largely unknown, despite her active presence on Twitter. It remains to be seen if Yaccarino‚Äôs involvement will have an impact on Dogecoin‚Äôs future performance, similar to the influence that Musk has wielded over the cryptocurrency. Only time will tell whether the ‚ÄúYaccarino Effect‚Äù will be a potential catalyst for Dogecoin‚Äôs growth in the near future. -Featured image from EPLAN UK Blog",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-traders-watch-for-a-breakout/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

What contributed to the slump? The fallout from several bank failures since March as well as looming recession threats, the report said, drove declining volumes across Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ), Binance, Binance.US, OKX, Upbit and Kraken. That's on top of regulatory concerns that briefly had Coinbase ( COIN ), in particular, considering exiting the U.S. But CEO Brian Armstrong dialed back on that suggestion less than a month later, saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.‚Äù Even so, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ), which together account for roughly 65% of the global crypto market cap, rose, albeit modestly, during the month and extended their notable year-to-date gains. Spot trading volume at the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, dropped 48.1% to $287B in April, representing its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021, CCData highlighted. That pulled its market share down to 46.3% -- the lowest since October. In recent months, Changpeng Zhao's Binance has been plagued with a number of negative developments, having more recently suffered from bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) withdrawal issues . Nonetheless, Binance remained the dominant exchange in the crypto space by a wide margin, CCData said. The second and third largest exchanges -- Coinbase ( COIN ) and OKX -- accounted for only 5.60% and 5.39%, respectively, of the total spot trading market. The report defines spot volumes as ""trading volumes on crypto assets with immediate delivery.""

12595604,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532541,1683979112,Bitcoin Price Dip Could Be Linked To On-Chain Activity,"Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced downward price pressure in May, with the token failing to surpass the $30,000 resistance mark. This development could be linked to on-chain activities that indicate an increase in the number of Bitcoins sold on exchanges during this period. 300,000 Bitcoin Sold On Exchanges In May According to CryptoQuant, a data explorer, over 300,000 bitcoins purchased between one to six months ago have been sold this month. It is worth noting that the majority of these sales were made by individuals who acquired the cryptocurrency between November of last year and January of this year. According to the data explorer, 266,000 bitcoins were purchased between November and January, while 78,000 bitcoins purchased between January and March were sold in May. The motivation behind these sales could be to take profits due to the significant price increase that Bitcoin has experienced since the investors purchased it. From November to April, the price of Bitcoin rose from $16,000 to $31,000. However, since April, the cryptocurrency has been making lower highs, possibly due to the selling activity of these investors in May. Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours Bitcoin Shows Strength At Around $27,000 Bitcoin‚Äôs price action in recent days was significant as it demonstrated the resilience of the cryptocurrency in the face of market volatility. As mentioned, Bitcoin had fallen to as low as $26,800 before quickly rebounding and testing support at its low of $27,000. This successful retest of support once again confirmed the strength of Bitcoin in this price zone. The market‚Äôs high volatility yesterday can be attributed to the United States‚Äô inflation report, which revealed a higher-than-expected increase in prices. Additionally, false rumors that the US government was selling Bitcoin caused bearish pressure on the market. Despite these events, Bitcoin held strong and was able to retest support. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Price: The Bear Vs. Bull Battle Continues ‚Äì Who‚Äôll Take The Beating? Bitcoin has tested the support around $27,000 several times in the past two months and has formed a solid bottom. In addition,¬†the Fear & Greed Index has declined, putting the market back into neutral territory. While this level is not necessarily bad when taken at face value, the fact that the index has declined from greed back to neutral is concerning. Nevertheless, despite some analysts predicting that the cryptocurrency could fall to lower levels, it has not dropped below this price zone. This is a positive sign for investors as it shows that there is a strong demand for Bitcoin at this level. Bitcoin price has consolidated as the market seeks a new equilibrium after the recent price correction. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,804 with a 24-hour price rise of 2%. It remains to be seen whether the token will make a renewed push toward the $30,000 resistance mark in the coming days. -Featured image from iStock, charts from TradingView.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOT,BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-dip-could-be-linked-to-on-chain-activity/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12595604.jpeg

PYPL closed the week at $61.69, down 3% from Thursday, March 11. PayPal Shares Crumbling Analysts observe that the decline in PayPal‚Äôs stock price has also resulted in a notable shift in its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. PayPal is now down 80% from its 2021 high, its largest drawdown to date. Its price to sales ratio has moved from a record high of 17x to a record low of 2.5x.$PYPL pic.twitter.com/w9JjzPXmJb ‚Äî Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) May 12, 2023 Previously at a record high of 17x, the P/S ratio is now at a record low of 2.5x. The P/S ratio is a financial metric, which evaluates a company‚Äôs valuation, and compares its market capitalization to its total revenue over a specific period, typically a year. Related Reading: PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel Admits He Underinvested In Bitcoin The P/S ratio offers valuable insights into how the market perceives a company‚Äôs revenue generation relative to its size. The ratio focuses on the rise and fall of the company‚Äôs revenue. This ratio also signifies the amount investors are willing to pay for every dollar of the company‚Äôs revenue. To put it into perspective, PayPal‚Äôs previous P/S ratio of 17 implies that investors are willing to pay $17 for every $1 of revenue generated by the company. Now, investors are only willing to pay $2.5 for every $1 revenue. Paypal shares are still at a premium. A P/S ratio above 1 indicates that investors are still willing to pay a premium for the company‚Äôs revenue. While the exact reasons behind PayPal‚Äôs downturn are not explicitly stated, speculation suggests that the company is facing a combination of intense competition and outdated technology. PayPal is one of the oldest payment processors. As the online payment landscape is constantly evolving, it has become increasingly challenging for PayPal to wade off competitors. For instance, banks have incorporated new systems such as Zelle. Besides, the Federal Reserve is rolling out FedNOW. There are also other avenues for users to use cryptocurrencies or even networks such as XRPL by Ripple Labs. Some users have even compared PayPal‚Äôs level of innovation to what it was in 1999 when Western Union was its primary competition. Too much competition plus outdated tech. It's difficult to stay relevant 25 years later. Banks now have Zelle and even the Fed is rolling out FedNOW, and they suck at innovation. In 1999 their competition was Western Union charging you $$$. ‚Äî Patrick Dehkordi (@PatrickDehkordi) May 12, 2023 Crypto Holdings Rise In Q1 2023 This is in spite of PayPal announcing a substantial surge in its cryptocurrency holdings In Q1 2023, revealing a remarkable 56% increase compared to the previous quarter.

According to data from the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, the number of daily active network addresses on Litecoin has increased by over 400,000 since the start of May. However, Litecoin has only experienced a slight increase in its transaction volume during the same period, which is unusual considering the significant rise in its daily active addresses. Analyzing this network activity, Santiment released a detailed report on the factors behind such development. Increased Daily Active Addresses On Litecoin | Source: Santiment Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours LTC-20 Standard Drives Rise In Litecoin Micro Addresses According to Santiment, the majority of new active addresses on Litecoin are the most miniature set of wallets on the network holding between 0-0.001 LTC. This explains the little increase in trading volume despite the rising number of daily addresses. Behind this gain in micro wallets, Santiment postulates the recent introduction of the LTC-20 token standard to be the primary driving force. This is based on chart data which shows that this exciting rise in the 0-0.001 LTC wallets began after the launch of the LTC-20 standard on May 2. Increased Micro Addresses (0-0.001 LTC) On Litecoin | Source: Santiment According to its official Gitbook page, LTC-20 is referred to as an experimental standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While providing an introduction to this blockchain product, the page author stated; ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is an extremely dynamic experiment, and I strongly discourage any financial decisions to be made on the basis of its design. I do, however, encourage the Litecoin community to tinker with standard designs and optimizations until a general consensus on best practices is met.‚Äù However, while LTC-20 is in its testing phase, it has been the rave of the Litecoin community in the last two weeks. This is mainly because it is based on the Bitcoin BRC-20 standard, allowing users to create ‚Äúworthless‚Äù fungible tokens using the ordinal theory. The BRC-20 token standard has proven to be quite successful since its launch two months ago, accumulating a market cap of over $660 million from then to date. That said, both the BRC-20 and LTC-20 tokens are NFT-like assets, albeit fungible, which inscribe data such as text, images and video on a blockchain.

The token has gained by 14.8% on its year-to-date value but is down by a staggering 80.43% from its all-time high value of $410.26.

Due to his knowledge of the company‚Äôs internal compliance practices, Friedberg‚Äôs decision to support the legal action is a significant blow to FTX. Related Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil‚Äôs Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin‚Äôs Price? Notably, the lawsuit started mid-November last year, a few days after the exchange shut down. FTX Lawsuit Gains Support From Former Executive As revealed in the proposed amended complaint, Friedberg gave evidence that FTX promotional activity surfaced from Florida. Daniel Friedberg was the compliance chief of the US arm of FTX and FTX‚Äôs chief regulatory officer. So, his evidence could negate the defendants‚Äô claims, stating that FTX‚Äôs activity has no connection with Florida, including the Miami court. Friedberg also referred to the vice president of the US arm of FTX, Avinash Dabir, noting that he is based in Miami. He added that Dabir performed operations in the city from an FTX office in 2021. He said that Dabir was responsible for overseeing FTX brand ambassadors, of which the court defendants are no exception. The brand ambassadors noted were comedian Larry David, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, a former basketball player, retired NFL player Tom Brady, and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Other celebrity promoters include entrepreneur Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, Steph Curry, a basketball star, with his team, the Golden State Warriors, and Brady‚Äôs ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen. Meanwhile, the class action lawyers saw that Friedberg‚Äôs statements countered the defendants‚Äô claims. They claimed it‚Äôs unlikely for such a conspiracy to erupt from Florida because the exchange did not intend to expand to Miami until September last year. It was after the move to Miami that they enacted the promotional agreements. In the meantime, the lawsuit class action lawyers are assessing the new evidence from the defendants to amend the case. Celebrities Face Lawsuits For Misleading Crypto Endorsements Several crypto endorsements for celebrities have often landed in lawsuits. This happens when misleading statements regarding a cryptocurrency‚Äôs potential returns, security, or legitimacy make investors suffer financial losses. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? Additionally, endorsing or promoting unregistered securities without complying with securities laws can have legal consequences. An example is the case between the SEC and Jake Paul, Lindsay Lohan, and some other celebrities over failing to reveal a paid crypto promotion. Aside from this, celebrities might unknowingly or intentionally participate in pump-and-dump schemes, artificially inflating prices through promotion and then selling their holdings, which can result in securities fraud charges. As such, celebrities must comply with relevant regulations to avoid legal disputes and protect investors. -Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/former-executive-backs-up-lawsuit-against-ftx-celebrity-promoters/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

12593820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532519,1683973846,Crypto Analysts Predict XRP Price Rally Against BTC,"Market analysts are watching Ripple‚Äôs XRP for a potential price surge against the world‚Äôs leading digital currency, Bitcoin. XRP, known for its lightning-fast transaction speed and secure blockchain technology, has recently experienced a rollercoaster ride due to its lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Related Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil‚Äôs Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin‚Äôs Price? However, an XRP and BTC chartist, Cryptoes, predicts a trend reversal for XRP based on current indicators on the chart. Analysts See A Pump In XRP Price Against Bitcoin The performance of XRP since the beginning of April has been very low compared to that of Bitcoin. This led to a notable decline in the XRP/BTC pair over the last five weeks. Its poor performance does not affect how certain analysts picture the token. The positive view of XRP‚Äôs price can be attributed to a key support level at its current position. Cryptoes called crypto enthusiasts‚Äô attention to this occurrence in a tweet, revealing that the weekly chart of the XRP/BTC pair projects a major support level. The chart revealed that XRP‚Äôs price had slowed against Bitcoin‚Äôs since April 3. However, the support level could prevent further decline of XRP tokens as it might be the bottom point. He added that the token might consolidate for weeks before initiating a rally. Another popular crypto analyst, Egrag, has a different view from Cryptoes. According to him, the market currently projects a bearish trend. His reason is hinged on the movements of two Simple Moving Averages (SMA), the 20 and 100 moving averages on the same chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? According to Egrag, the 20 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) place sell pressure on the coin‚Äôs price. As such, the 100-moving average is a strong resistance against the current price of XRP. It could be difficult for the token to break out from such resistance. He believes that the presence of these indicators signals market weakness, and XRP could yield to them. But time will tell if XRP will pump to close above the falling wage. XRP‚Äôs Recent Price Performance There is no significant difference between XRP‚Äôs price at the beginning of May and its current price of $0.4286. On May 1, the coin was trading around the $0.47 price mark, which eventually declined to $0.465 at the close of the day. It maintained this price range between $0.45 and $0.46 over the next seven days and dipped slightly to $0.4186 on May 8. Since then, it has been hovering around the $0.41 and $0.42 price levels. In the past seven days, it has declined by 7.25%. However, its 24-hour price trades sideways at the time of writing, while the trading volume and market cap have also increased by 18.45% and 1.93%. -Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-analysts-predicts-xrp-price-rally-against-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This announcement would come following wide discussions about the waning influence of Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange. Related Reading: PEPE Goes To The Moon: Meme Coin Listed On OKX, Binance Listing In the Works? OKX Launches Cryptopedia; Partners With Radiant And Marinade In a GlobeNewswire press release dated May 13th, 2023, OKX Wallet disclosed the launch of Cryptopedia, a Web3 learn-to-earn and airdrop platform. This new platform aims to help users easily identify and access Web3 projects and dApps. Cryptopedia will also enable users to unlock additional airdrops and gain extra rewards. The first Cryptopedia issue, which is focused on the zkSync theme, provides users with the opportunity to receive zkSync airdrops and other related airdrops. Users will also have the chance to collect non-fungible tokens jointly created by OKX Wallet and zkSync. zkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce cost on the Ethereum network. As the name suggests, this protocol is based on the zero-knowledge (zk) concept. In the press release, OKX Wallet also announced its partnership with two protocols, namely Radiant and Marinade. Its collaboration with Radiant, a decentralized lending protocol native to Arbitrum and BNB Chain, will allow users to access Radiant‚Äôs lending service via the OKX Wallet plug-in and Discover platform. With Radiant, users are able to borrow a variety of digital assets across multiple chains against their own assets on one chain. Marinade, on the other hand, is a non-custodial liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol on the Solana network. Similar to Radiant, this partnership will facilitate users‚Äô access to Marinade‚Äôs liquidity staking service via the OKX Wallet plug-in and Discover platform. OKB Shows No Significant Price Action The OKB coin is the utility token of the OKX ecosystem. From trading fee discounts to passive income, there are a few benefits that holders of this token get to enjoy. And it appears that the growth of the OKX ecosystem has some links to OKB price. That said, it is somewhat too early to tell what the impact of these partnerships will be on the price of OKB. Moreover, there has been no significant price movement in the OKB market since the announcement was made. A broader look at price action reveals that the OKB market has been moving sideways in the last few weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the token‚Äôs value dipped by a measly 2.1% in the past seven days. As of this writing, an OKB coin changes hands at $44.82, tallying only a 2.6% price rise in the last 24 hours.

Bull Battle Continues ‚Äì Who‚Äôll Take The Beating?,"Since the beginning of this year, Polkadot has been on a roller coaster ride as the general cryptocurrency market has fluctuated over the past months. Related Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil‚Äôs Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin‚Äôs Price? Recently, the price of Polkadot (DOT) has experienced negative sentiment, causing a slight decline in the coin‚Äôs value. The coin‚Äôs price slightly decreased from $5.51 to $5.12 on May 9, 2023. However, it started to gain further positive momentum the same day and recovered to $5.3 today. Strong Bearish Momentum The price of DOT has been trading sideways within the last 24 hours, indicating a bearish trend. As a confirmation of the bearish momentum in the Polkadot market, the 24-hour trading volume is down by 18%. The decline indicates a decrease in demand for DOT in the market and might lead to greater volatility as traders adjust their position based on the market sentiment. Polkadot‚Äôs current market cap is estimated at $6.1 billion, with a market dominance of 0.56%.¬†But the increase in selling pressure has impacted the price of Polkadot significantly. Polkadot is in the phase where investors and traders are afraid to buy or hold the coin. As investors take advantage of the current dip in price to acquire more DOT, anticipate a modest recovery in the coming week. Polkadot (DOT) Technical Analysis DOT trades below its 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This indicates that DOT has a bearish momentum in both long-term and short-term trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows that DOT currently reads 32.92. This indicates that the coin is slightly in the oversold region. It also suggests that DOT is experiencing some downward pressure. However, the asset may rebound from its oversold condition and return to a normal trading range. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? The MACD indicator also confirms the bearish trend as its trading below the signal line.

Recent Development In Polkadot Ecosystem Meanwhile, the number one gaming blockchain platform, Mythical Games, is departing from the Ethereum network to launch its new Mythos ecosystem on Polkadot. The recent development will allow Mythos gaming partners to build the biggest and most connected gaming ecosystem in the Web3 industry. The development will result in a new scalable platform, accessible to all Mythos partners and compliant with Web2 gaming platforms, including the Epic Games Store. This accessibility is a core principle for Mythical as it continues to bridge the gap between blockchain and traditional gaming. The Mythical Games founder proclaimed that the decision to leave the Ethereum ecosystem was due to the slow transaction speeds and other issues around the network. This partnership will also benefit the Polkadot ecosystem as Mythical has an advanced feature, streaming technologies, and Web3 gaming expertise. It will also drive the massive adoption of both Polkadot and Mythical. -Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/dot/polkadot-dot-price-the-bear-vs-bull-battle-continues-wholl-take-the-beating/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

In a week marred by losses of varying sizes, the hottest coin of the meme season was not exempted, losing 46.1% of its market value within this period. The past week was quite bearish for the entire market as the total crypto market cap dropped by $64 billion to a current value of $1.170 trillion. Bitcoin, the market leader, did share most of the headlines with PEPE, as its market price crashed by almost 9% to trade below $27,000 for the first time since March. Although the CPI announcement on Wednesday did provide some boost to the premier cryptocurrency, it could not match the momentum of the market bears as Bitcoin currently trades around $26,815.

Having been on a steady decline all week, this recent price rise has provided some relief for PEPE investors who thought the meme token was well on its way down. Although there is no guarantee that PEPE could be on its way to pulling off another stunning market performance, its resilience may just set it apart from most short-lived meme coins joining the likes of the prominent Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. In general, PEPE remains the best-performing token of the moment, gaining by over 405% in the last 14 days and over 2,331% since its launch on April 17. In this period, the meme token has also made much progress in the industry with listings on over 30 exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, OKX, KuCoin etc. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.0000158, with a 2% increase in the last hour. The token‚Äôs daily trading volume is also up by 151.92%, valued at $934.45 million. However, PEPE remains 62% away from its all-time value of 0.00000431, which was attained just seven days ago.

PoS and other consensus mechanisms are integral to the security of a network.¬†This shift has significant implications for the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of staking ‚Äì the process of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. Related Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil‚Äôs Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin‚Äôs Price? While staking has been around for some time, several factors are now converging to potentially drive a significant increase in ETH staking. In fact, a leading staking service provider has predicted a surge in staking activity and has backed it up with compelling reasons. So, what does this mean for Ethereum, and why is staking becoming such a critical part of its blockchain infrastructure? Staked Q2 Report Predicts Significant ETH Staking Rate Increase Staked, a research subsidiary of the Kraken exchange, has released its Q2 report, projecting that the ETH staking rate could see a significant increase of 20% to 35% over the next 12 to 18 months. This forecast was based on several factors, including the recent increase in average Ethereum staking yield from 5.2% to 5.8% on a year on year basis. Moreover, the Staked Q2 report‚Äôs prediction of a significant increase in the ETH staking rate could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. If more users begin staking their ETH, the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency will decrease, potentially leading to an increase in its price. This, in turn, could have a ripple effect on the entire cryptocurrency market, making it a crucial trend to watch in the coming months. ETH total market cap currently at $218 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com What Increased ETH Staking Means For Investors One of the most obvious benefits is that a higher staking yield means investors can earn more rewards for their staked ETH. This could be especially appealing to long-term investors who are looking to maximize their returns. Additionally, the increase in staking could potentially lead to a decrease in the circulating supply of ETH, which could drive up its price. This means that investors who are holding ETH could see their holdings increase in value. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? But the impact of increased ETH staking goes beyond just earning rewards and potential price increases. It also has a positive effect on the overall health and stability of the Ethereum network. By staking their ETH, investors are essentially locking it up, making it more difficult for bad actors to attack the network. This makes the network more secure and trustworthy, which could attract more users and investors to the platform. Source: Coingecko At the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $1,798 according to CoinGecko, with a 2.4% rally in the past 24 hours.
