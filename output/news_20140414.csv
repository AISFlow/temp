42377138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBVL,1397516704,Charlie Shrem Indicted on Federal Charges for Money Laundering,"Former Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman Charlie Shrem has been indicted on charges stemming from alleged money laundering on the Silk Road, once of the largest illegal marketplaces online.  The indictment involving Shrem and Florida resident Robert Faiella indicates that the two had been conspiring together to funnel money into Silk Road since 2011.  Shrem, 24, was co-founder and an executive of bitcoin processor BitInstant. He is also accused of never filing a single suspicious activity report with the government during his time at the company.  The details  According to the indictment  , Shrem worked with Faiella to supply bitcoins to Silk Road users. Faiella, 52, who was known in Silk Road forums as ""BTCKing"", allegedly used BitInstant in order to convert cash into BTC, which was the only payment method used on the online illicit marketplace.  Shrem was arrested on the charges on 27th February, and posted a $1 million bond for his release thereafter. He has been under house arrest since that time, but has made several media appearances.  He was interviewed by CoinDesk  around the time of the Mt. Gox collapse and presented to the Texas Bitcoin Conference via a Skype video feed in March.  BitInstant and Silk Road  BitInstant was one of the first companies that easily enabled bitcoin enthusiasts to procure BTC in the US. BitInstant users could go to a bank location or send cash directly, and BitInstant would convert it into bitcoin.  Shrem was also one of the founding members of advocacy group the Bitcoin Foundation, and subsequently stepped down from his vice chairman Foundation board post following his arrest.  Silk Road's website was taken offline by federal authorities last October. Its supposed mastermind, Ross Ulbrict, was indicted in February on drug and money laundering charges.  The charges in the indictment involving Shrem and Faiella are two counts of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report.  Shrem is expected to be arraigned on April 29.

42377143,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBbd,1397513703,Block Chain Technology Offers New Crime-Fighting Options,"Edan Yago is CEO of Epiphyte and a founding board member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA). Epiphyte develops systems that bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and cryptofinancial networks.  The views expressed in the article below are Yago's own, and do not necessarily reflect those of DATA.    Last week was a turning point for bitcoin and distributed cryptographic networks.    It started with the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York, where it became clear that the bitcoin world is truly starting to live up to its promise of creating the most secure financial system in human history.  Up until now, most of the services that we have developed around the bitcoin ecosystem have been centralised services mimicking the those of traditional finance.  The result has been an industry that has lost its users hundreds of millions of dollars in a cocktail of scams, hacks, incompetence and whatever Mt. Gox was. But, the clear message from Inside Bitcoins is that we, as a community, have decided to stop drinking this dangerous frappe.  More secure services  A new generation of services is being launched that is taking advantage of the unique properties of block chain technology to provide user-friendly security that scales. The clearest sign of this is the launch of services taking advantage of multi-signature wallets to secure transactions. Cryptocorp, Bitgo and Greenaddress have all created wallets that will help secure user coins without taking ownership of them.  Bitrated  are creating a multi-signature escrow with crowd sourced dispute arbitration and trust rating. The major exchanges are quietly looking at options for both improved public auditing and multi-signature-controlled holdings of user funds.  Several stealth mode companies are working on building massively scalable peer-to-peer trading platforms, distributed on both crypto- and fiat currency sides of the trade.  Additionally, a number of interesting new services are using the block chain to build non-financial services. Maidsafe, for example, have built a secure data storage and communications platform that will reward people for providing hard-disk space and bandwidth with what has been described as 'proof-of-storage.'    The week continued with the first Annual DATA Conference in Washington, DC. DATA is an organization of the leading digital currency companies and of which I am a board member. Its mission is to help the digital asset industry create a set of best practices to protect users and educate regulators and the public. The conference brought together leading voices from Congress, regulatory agencies, academia and the industry.  Math as law  A major theme of the conference can be summed up with an exchange in which a regulator explained the need for regulation, saying (with some self-referencing irony): “We are from the government and we are here to help.” A member of DATA responded that “We are from the block chain and we are here to help”.  There are two types of technologies that can be used to regulate services and provide consumer protection. The old technology is legislative, a set of bureaucracy-based protocols for insuring trust and good behavior.  The new technology is exemplified by the block chain, software-based protocols for achieving the same thing. Are we ready yet to completely replace traditional governance with software and maths? Of course not.  However, there was recognition from all sides, including representatives of regulatory agencies, that distributed technologies offer a new set of options for dealing with age-old societal problems of incompetence and crime.  [post-quote]  What’s great is that many regulators came to participate at the DATA conference because they grasp this opportunity. More than anyone, they have seen firsthand how hard their job is using their current tool set.  Their best intentions are often stymied by inefficiencies and unintended consequences. Their actions are often criticized because they find it hard to build consensus for rules that are made in a necessarily closed source fashion: proprietary and hierarchical.  One example that they brought up is know your customer rules. In the current system, the only way for a criminal investigator to obtain the information they need is by requiring all financial services to keep extensive identification records and to provide these to government. Encryption and web-of-trust technologies provide an alternative, in which private information can be safe-guarded, while trust is still maintained.  The key thing regulators emphasized was that blunt tools inevitably lead to overreach. More targeted tools can lead to more nuanced solutions.  Less centralized authority  One of the reasons I became involved in founding DATA is that I believe that the 'regulation debate' in bitcoin circles has been overly simplistic and polarized. Most of the conversation has revolved around the (ancient) question of ""how much regulation do we need?"" Lots? A little? None? Do we need new regulation for the block chain? Does the existing regulation apply to bitcoin?  Hidden in this debate is the fact that the block chain itself is a new form of regulation. One based on software principles instead of legal and bureaucratic ones. This means we now have a new option – an escape from the tired old debate of how much central authority we need.  Instead of having to decide between more authority or less authority, we have a third option: less centralized authority, more distributed authority. The best place to showcase this opportunity is the bitcoin space. We can protect users and society as a whole by building smart systems like the ones starting to emerge.  New finance, new society  We have a historic opportunity, to build a new type of society, at once less restrictive, more open and safer for everyone. If over the next few years we do a good job of this, we will revolutionize finance. Finance will stand a shining example for all other facets of human society, which today are organized by traditional methods of government.  Our users are watching, the regulators are watching, the world is watching. Our opportunity is to innovate and improve at the level of the very protocols that safeguard our communities. We can augment the traditional tools of government with a new layer: government of the block chain, by the block chain, for the people.

42377130,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBLH,1397506548,Gyft Forced to Abruptly End Walmart Gift Card Support,"Mobile gift card provider Gyft has announced via an email to its customers that it no longer offers users the ability to purchase Walmart gift cards on its platform.  Gyft  , which accepts bitcoin and provides 3% 'Gyft points' back to digital currency buyers, added the US retail giant to its network on 24th March to great fanfare, as Walmart was long one of the most requested retailers by Gyft users.  The company informed customers of the change in its offerings via a 14th April email.  Read the message:  ""Due to circumstances beyond our control, we need to remove Walmart from our list of participating retailers, effective April 13, 2014. Rest assured that we are doing everything in our power to bring them back up as soon as possible.""  Gyft and its CEO Vinny Lingham have been outspoken about their support for bitcoin, with Lingham most recently penning a lengthy post on how bitcoin played a key role in the growth of the company.  The San Francisco-based company began accepting bitcoin in May 2013 through a partnership with BitPay.  More details  Though new buyers won't be able to purchase Walmart gift cards, Gyft indicated that existing Walmart gift cards purchased on its platform can still be redeemed.  The company, long one of bitcoin's most supportive companies in the wider tech ecosystem, stressed that bitcoin users who were dissatisfied with the decision should get in touch with Walmart regarding the matter.  Said the email message:  ""If you are as disappointed as we are about this decision by Walmart, please email them at help@walmart.com and let them know how you feel about it.""  Gyft will continue talks with Walmart  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lingham indicated that Gyft would seek to learn more about the decision and to continue to speak to Walmart about relisting its gift cards. Still, Lingham wasn't optimistic that the retailer's policy would change.  Said Lingham:  ""We will continue to talk to them, but it's a giant organization... I can't speak to their reasoning at this stage.""  As pointed out in the email, however, Gyft still provides bitcoin users access to a number of mainstream merchants.  Notably, this includes Minnesota-based retail giant Target, the third-largest in the US, which joined the Gyft network in November.

42377141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBaN,1397505590,Survey Results: 96% of Merchants Would Recommend Bitcoin to Peers,"This is the final instalment of a three-part series aimed at learning more about the merchants who accept bitcoin and support the wider digital currency ecosystem.  The results are based on a survey issued on 17th March that received more than 200 responses. Part One of this series sought to better define the merchants who are taking part in the bitcoin ecosystem, while Part Two examined the sales successes these businesses have been able to achieve to date.  So far, our merchant survey has defined the types of businesses operating in the bitcoin space and examined the effect that bitcoin buyers have had on their bottom lines, answering two integral questions about how bitcoin's use is growing in the merchant ecosystem.  However, the last piece of the puzzle may well be to assess if merchants believe their experience with the industry to be positive.  After all, adding bitcoin as a payment option isn't a costly process – and for those who use major bitcoin processors, one without tremendous liabilities – it's perhaps more worthwhile to assess the intangible benefits that bitcoin adoption and awareness can bring.  For example, even merchants who aren't able to increase sales substantially generally see a spike in interest surrounding their business. Furthermore, those who come to the technology due to its ideological implications often discover like-minded individuals and a supportive community along the way.  Both of these instances arguably translate into an even greater awareness for bitcoin as an industry that would not have existed otherwise, and in turn, create a positive experience for merchants.  As such, Part Three of our survey aims to look more broadly at this potential network effect by assessing merchant satisfaction with bitcoin as well as whether this has translated into wider support for the digital currency ecosystem.  97% of merchants are satisfied with bitcoin  According to our survey results, merchants have had overwhelmingly positive experiences with digital currency. When asked if they were ""glad they started accepting bitcoin"", 96.9% of respondents answered 'yes', while just 3.09% reported 'no'.  Merchants were also given the opportunity to expound on why they felt positively or negatively about bitcoin, with many citing the advantages of bitcoin over available payment tools like credit cards and PayPal, as well as the ability to accept international payments with ease.  Explained one respondent:  ""It's the future. We have customers all over the world and not all of them are able to use PayPal or credit cards.""  96% of merchants would recommend bitcoin to another business  In addition, our survey found merchants were similarly positive about recommending bitcoin to other merchants, with 96.7% reporting that they would do so.  Just 3.3% said they would not recommend bitcoin.  Merchants who said they were not satisfied with accepting bitcoin for payment, tended to cite the risk associated with bitcoin's price volatility, as well as the low interest in bitcoin amongst the general public.  One respondent even suggested that bitcoin's bad publicity could affect their reputation, stating:  ""[There is] is some reputational risk in associating myself with something that the major media connects to nefarious activities/persons.""  48% of merchants are open to altcoins  Finally, the survey sought to assess whether the enthusiasm merchants hold toward bitcoin is translating to support for alternative digital currencies. Overall, the report found that 48.6% of merchants would consider accepting altcoin payments, with 51.4% reporting that they would not do so.  Of the available alternatives, litecoin was the most popular altcoin, with 88% of merchants who would consider altcoins suggesting they would evaluate litecoin.  Dogecoin  and peercoin finished third and fourth in the survey, respectively, with 52.9% and 25.88% of altcoin-friendly respondents reporting they would consider these coins.

42377132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBNn,1397500118,"BitAngels Closes 10,000 BTC Fund for Decentralised Applications","One time-tested measurement of an industry's promise is the amount of investment capital flowing into new ventures in the space, and now angel investor group BitAngels has closed a new fund that highlights the bright future of digital currencies and decentralised applications.  Billed as the world's first ""distributed veteran entrepreneur and angel investor group,"" BitAngels has been an active organization in the bitcoin community, having invested $7m into digital currency startups since its inception in 2013.  BitAngels  co-founders Michael Terpin and David Johnston sat down with CoinDesk at Inside Bitcoins NYC to talk about their new fund – the BitAngels Fund I.  Speaking on BitAngel's focus for investments with the newly closed fund, managing director David Johnston said:  ""We want this to be the first fund that focuses solely on decentralised applications of the bitcoin protocol. We're only investing in open-source companies and we want to see this fund really go beyond just currency and payment protocols to other applications.""  Raising capital for innovation  Terpin and Johnston revealed that the BitAngels Fund I officially closed with just over 10,000 BTC raised in total. At a valuation of $4.6m at press time, BitAngels's new fund has collected a substantial amount of capital – all of which will be invested in companies working with the technology of the bitcoin protocol and block chain.  One company that Terpin has personally invested in is the CryptexCard, which recently launched as the world's first Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer (AML/KYC) compliant bitcoin ATM and debit card.  Another startup that has caught the attention of BitAngels is MaidSafe, a company that calls itself ""the new decentralised internet."" While the angel group has not made any investments in MaidSafe, they are interested in purchasing MaidSafeCoins.  Said Johnston:  ""When we look at all of the possibilities for building applications on the protocol, it's all about technology verticals for us. There are so many different use cases, and we want to invest in companies that explore these.""  Plenty of eager investors  In just under one year, BitAngels has grown its membership to more than 400 angel investors who live all around the world. Terpin explained that he and Johnston came up with the idea for the angel group during their very first meeting, and that the response from investors interested in joining the group was immediate:  ""We officially went live and announced a meet-up for potential investors that may be interested in joining the group. We expected six or seven people to show up to that meeting. More than 35 people showed up, just one day after we went live.""  Terpin credits the growing interest from credible venture capital firms as one factor that helped grow BitAngels' membership. The group has quickly become one of the largest angel groups across any industry, and has joined the likes of BoostVC and Andreessen Horowitz with their focus on the digital currency industry.  Said Terpin:  ""Credibility begets credibility. I see serious players in the technology industry showing a lot of interest in bitcoin, and I think to myself 'well if Marc Andreessen is all in, then I'm all in.'""  ""From the cradle to the IPO""  BitAngels' focus on early stage companies helps the angel group build an infrastructure to help their companies ""from the cradle to the IPO, so to speak,"" Terpin said. BitAngels provides resources from companies in their ""garage stage"" all the way to full liquidity, and their network of veteran entrepreneurs all over the globe can offer guidance to companies that are based in almost any country.  As the digital currency industry continues to grow and more entrepreneurs begin to explore the possible applications of this new technology, groups like BitAngels help ensure that innovation flourishes by providing resources for companies to help turn their meaningful ideas into reality.

42377118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8V9,1397496916,Amazon Exec Says Company Decided Against Accepting Bitcoin,"Amazon is not interested in embracing bitcoin, but it is looking into new digital payment services, possibly a service developed in-house, a new report suggests.  The company's payments head Tom Taylor told Re/code that Amazon did indeed consider bitcoin, but eventually decided that there was not enough interest in the technology for Amazon to benefit from adopting it.  Said Taylor:  ""Obviously, it gets a lot of press and we have considered it, but we’re not hearing from customers that it’s right for them, and don’t have any plans within Amazon to engage bitcoin.""  Amazon’s revenue in 2013 was almost $75bn, while the market cap of all bitcoins ever created is roughly $5bn.  Amazon has more pressing issues  Taylor pointed out that Amazon has bigger goals at the moment than experimenting with digital currencies. For example, he noted that Amazon needs to deal with foreign exchange rates and other issues affecting sellers.  The Amazon exec admitted that a global currency has some advantages, and that credit card companies are not supplying enough information that could help merchants better understand customer behaviour.  When asked whether Amazon would ever launch a service that would compete against big brand credit cards, Taylor said Amazon would only if it felt confident that it could do a better job than American Express and Visa.  He added that the service would have to be “something much better” than what is already available.  Re/code’s Jason Del Ray cited industry sources who believe it is only a matter of time before Amazon launches its own payments service, but the company is not saying much for the time being.  Amazon's payments history  Interestingly, Amazon started experimenting with its own digital coins last May.  Amazon Coins  were handed out to buyers of Kindle Fire tablets and could be used to purchase apps and various virtual items on the company's app store.  Of course, Amazon Coins were never envisioned as a currency or as an alternative payments system, they were basically a way of boosting customer loyalty and promoting the Amazon Appstore. Although Amazon's tablets are Android-based, they run a tweaked version of Google's mobile operating system and don't feature access to the Google Play Store.  Amazon is rumoured to be working on one or more smartphones that should use the same approach as its Kindle Fire tablets, so the company has a good reason to promote its closed app ecosystem.  Bitcoin not seeing interest from big brands  Earlier this year, Overstock became the biggest US retailer to accept bitcoin, and two months later the company announced that its bitcoin sales had surpassed $1m. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said the biggest surge came on the first day of bitcoin sales, but the company also saw gradual growth in bitcoin sales on a week-by-week basis.  TigerDirect joined the bitcoin club a few weeks after Overstock. The results were similar, the tech retailer surpassed $1m in bitcoin sales in less than two months. The company's director of marketing Steven Leeds told CoinDesk that the overwhelming response validated the company’s decision to embrace bitcoin.  Still, outside of these examples, and a handful of rumours, merchant adoption has not seen the traction some predicted at the start of the year.  Amazon’s arch rival eBay is staying away from bitcoin, too, but at least it is allowing users to sell their bitcoins and bitcoin-related merchandise through its classifieds.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/14/amazon-exec-says-company-decided-against-accepting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a3e0eadfd29c7e8b939283029e6bd65a1229237-1000x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377116,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8Tt,1397494484,What Facebook's Mobile Money Plans May Mean for Bitcoin,"With the price of bitcoin trending upwards on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the digital currency market is once again showing resilience, even in the face of controversial news from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  However, while these events saw major government agencies attempting to limit how funds could be handled by bitcoin businesses and imposing accounting requirements on bitcoin users, a new report has suggested that bitcoin could soon face another threat, this time in the form of viable competition that could hinder adoption in the short term.  The Financial Times reported on 13th April that Facebook is reportedly exploring an electronic mobile money service that would allow users throughout Europe to exchange units of monetary value through a process called ""passporting"".  Passporting allows businesses to conduct operations in the European Economic Area (EEA) under a single market directive, which would enable Facebook's credit institution to reach multiple markets. Armed with this classification, Facebook would be able to receive deposits from the public and grant credits for its accounts anywhere in the EEA, the European Banking Authority suggests.  The FT notes these units of value would represent claims against the company, which would then be exchanged. The media outlet said that Facebook has so far spoken with three companies – Azimo, Moni Technologies and TransferWire – about the service, but that the company has not confirmed the reports.  The news follows similar rumors that Facebook was looking to pilot a PayPal competitor in August of last year, though this service was eventually revealed to be a more simple app login service.  Community unfazed by Facebook's plans  Still, even accounting for Facebook's name recognition and brand value, major bitcoin investors don't see the social networking service as a significant threat to bitcoin.  One of the foremost reasons, according to Wedbush Securities managing director Gil Luria, is that Facebook is still relying on the same antiquated infrastructure of companies like MasterCard and Visa for payments.  Explained Luria:  ""The type of innovation coming from bitcoin technologies is a leap that will take time for these mainstream companies to adapt to, so I doubt anything Facebook can do right now goes much farther than a prepaid account funded through existing payment networks.""  Adam Draper, founder and CEO of bitcoin-focused venture fund Boost VC, also echoed Luria's response, stating that bitcoin's long-term value will likely win out over competitors.  Still, he was enthusiastic that the news means Facebook is looking to attack similar problems as entrepreneur in the bitcoin community. Said Draper:  ""This is exciting, it means that the big companies are playing in the space.""  Impact on the remittance market  Facebook's intent isn't limited to Europe alone, however. One source told the FT that the mobile money initiative would be part of a broader attempt by the company to become a remittance provider in the developing world.  To this end, Facebook would be able to capitalize on the popularity and availability of not smartphones, but its social networking service, which serves roughly 1.2 billion users.  Given that the company purportedly plans to use passporting to enable the service, Facebook's ability to compete with bitcoin would be limited to EEA member states.  Pelle Braendgaard, co-founder of global bitcoin wallet provider Kipochi, sees this as one of the potential service's more limiting factors:  ""Payment systems require a wide enough network that they are useful for users. Bitcoin provides that and it may be easier for Facebook to eventually build a wide enough network for this, but it isn't a given.""  Bitcoin-based remittance service specialist, Tomas Alvarez of Coincove, wasn't fazed by the prospect of new competition either.  ""I think that unless they adopt a more efficient way of sending money (*wink crytpo-currencies *wink) they might end up with a PayPal (expensive) that runs on Facebook.""  Still, should Facebook enter the market, Alvarez hinted it could beneficial at removing the stigma associated with adding monetary services to social networks, which could be a larger win for the bitcoin industry.

Each bitcoin transaction has a custom-generated address and upon receiving funds, Corkket emails a QR code to the buyer, who prints it out and exchanges it for the goods being purchased. The seller then scans the QR code and gets paid.  As well as protecting sellers from chargebacks or disputed payments, it also means people don't have to visit complete strangers' homes carrying credit cards or large amounts of cash.  ""The inspiration came mainly from Craigslist's lack of inspiration. But just as important, we wanted to give the bitcoin community a way to participate in local commerce.""  Tang even refers to himself on Corkket's Twitter page as a 'Bitcoin Zealot'.  Users can also transact with US dollars, though Corkket appears to be promoting bitcoin's use foremost. The site also tries to keep business as close and local as possible – once you tell it your physical location, Corkket looks for deals first in your own building, then your block, and lastly your city – so it may end up saving you time and money on transport too.

In January, Palihapitiya, who is one of the largest individual owners of bitcoin, had predicted 11.5 million wallet downloads, but after the bitcoin price stabilised below $500 in the first quarter of the year, he has readjusted his forecast to 7.3 million.  He shared this information via a tweet last night:    If you are wondering why USD/BTC is depressed, here is our internal projection of wallets thru EOY 2014... pic.twitter.com/Fh23kFBolw      — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) April 14, 2014    The data is based on Coinbase, Blockchain and MultiBit wallets, all three of which passed their one-millionth-download milestone at the start of this year: Blockchain.info at the beginning of 2014, Coinbase in February and MultiBit just last month.  On March 29th, there were 3.9 million wallet downloads for the year, as per the Source+Capital graph tweeted out by Palihapitiya.  The Social+Capital Partnership  is a Palo Alto-based VC fund made up of philanthropists and technologists. Palihapitiya is its founder and managing director, prior to which he was the longest tenured member of Facebook’s senior executive team and held leading roles at The Mayfield Fund, AIM and ICQ, and Winamp.  Born in Sri Lanka and raised in Canada, Palihapitiya is also the owner of Golden State Warriors NBA team, which ‘maybe’ accepting bitcoin soon.  One of the responses following Palihapitiya tweets questioned what was driving the significant slowdown in wallet growth rate.  His response was:    @polemitis probably because we still haven't seen the killer idea that will be a ""sink"" to get BTC flowing and attract new buyers...      — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) April 14, 2014    Vinny Lingham, CEO of Gyft, also pointed out that number of wallets is not the same as number of users. In a separate post, he argued that consumer adoption was slower than merchant adoption.  Palihapitiya responded to that saying:    @VinnyLingham agreed. wallets > consumers, so the story is even worse i guess!      — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) April 14, 2014",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/14/chamath-palihapitiya-predicts-73-million-bitcoin-wallet-downloads-in-2014,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b59cb7fdf99f08dec49b5fd5a13a138ae46766d2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8L5,1397466751,BTC-e Back Online Following DDoS Attack,"BTC-e was down briefly on Sunday, following a powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against its servers.  DDoS attacks against bitcoin exchanges have gained notoriety since the 'massive and concerted' attack which targeted multiple organisations earlier this year.  However, in the current climate of uncertainty even a harmless attack can be misinterpreted, with speculation spreading like wildfire on social media. Luckily BTC-e was quick to confirm the attack and dismiss fears – it was just another DDoS attack, now all too common in the world of bitcoin.    DDoS attack on our server      — BTC-E (@btcecom) April 13, 2014    Back to normal  At press time BTC-e was back up and running with more than 4,000 users online. The exchange told CoinDesk that DDoS attacks happen periodically and that there is nothing special about the latest one.  “Our networking team responded quickly and it is fixing the problem,” BTC-e said, adding:  “We don’t consider it as an important problem, as there is a workaround to fix it quickly.”  This was apparently a minor outage, with no security breach.  Non-DDoS technical issues  BTC-e has faced its fair share of technical issues not related to malicious activity. Back in December, the exchange suffered from lengthy processing delays which also led to concerns. BTC-e is operated by an anonymous team of Eastern European developers, hence many users were suspicious that some foul play was involved.  However, at the time the exchange told CoinDesk that the problems were the result of a sudden surge in the number of users. BTC-e has since hired more staff to cope with the extra workload and the exchange claims it has not face any more serious problems – aside from the occasional DDoS attack, of course.  The BTC-e team still insists on anonymity. However, judging by its market share, most users don't seem to mind at all.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/14/btc-e-back-online-following-ddos-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2129578bc92e2023ebd918d805ca63d003596a9-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
