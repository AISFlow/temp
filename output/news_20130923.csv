Ploshay, manager of communications at Bitcoin Magazine, received 90 votes, which equates to 25.1% of all the votes cast for the individual seat. Serial entrepreneur, angel investor and venture capitalist Malka received 26 (72.2%) of the votes for the industry seat.  Ploshay and Malka join the likes of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem on the board.  Jon Matonis  , executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said: ""We welcome our new board directors and the wealth of additional experience they bring to Bitcoin Foundation, Inc.""  The Bitcoin Foundation was created by a group of people involved in the space who wanted to make sure bitcoin reaches its full potential. The foundation has three primary objectives: to standardize, protect and promote the digital currency.  Ploshay, who is based in Atlanta, told Let's Talk Bitcoin earlier this month that she wanted to be elected to the foundation's board to ""preserve and protect the merits and future of bitcoin"". She added:  ""Time is of essence and the Bitcoin Foundation needs a take-charge leader who is willing to put in long hours until the job is accomplished.""  Ploshay beat off strong competition from the likes of Facebook software engineer Ben Davenport and BitPay investor Trace Mayer, while Malka was up against BitPay co-founder Tony Gallippi and Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/23/elizabeth-ploshay-and-micky-malka-elected-to-bitcoin-foundation-board,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92d429bb4537b00911241b40497ddc38caa50e38-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397252,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Kf,1379942675,Seven bitcoin startups pitch for funding at Boost VC demo day,"The summer 2013 class of seventeen startups pitched to a crowd of over 100 investors at Boost VC’s demo day in Menlo Park last week. Seven of the startups in the incubator’s most recent class were bitcoin-focused.  To help educate investors on the concept of digital currency, an explanation of bitcoin was included on the back of the demo day’s program for the event.  Each startup was given four minutes to present a pitch to investors and try to raise money. This demo day gave credence to the rise of bitcoin-based businesses as each startup offered some compelling reasons why it thought they would succeed in the digital currency economy. Here’s a quick look at each bitcoin-based startup that pitched during the demo day.  Vaurum  Right now, the traditional brokerage investor lacks access to bitcoin. That’s a problem Vaurum is working to fix by building an API for financial organizations to link into.  Vaurum founder and CEO Avish Bhama displayed a slide of Mt. Gox’s website and asked the question, “Would you trust these guys?” With all the problems that Mt. Gox is experiencing, it’s getting harder to do so.  The team at Vaurum has experience with financial trading products and is building what they called a “robust trading engine” that could be linked into traditional brokerages for bitcoin investing. Vaurum was looking for $1 million in its seed round, and had already secured $150,000.  VerifyBTC  Have you ever had to verify your identity in order to use a bitcoin exchange such as Bitstamp? If you have, you might know how long the “know your customer”, or KYC process takes to complete.  VerifyBTC  is looking to streamline that process, and the company’s cofounder Manoj Das says that its process can take seconds to complete. It does this by automating the verification process, cross-referencing data provided with databases from credit card companies.  The goal is to eliminate the manual process that companies like Mt. Gox go through. VerifyBTC is already being used by fellow Boost startup BitBox. The company was looking to raise $700,000 from investors.  Arbiter  Andy Zissner of Arbiter believes that betting in games is a “core game mechanic”. The problem is that it is hard to build a game with betting.  Arbiter is looking to solve that problem for game developers by building a platform that can be plugged into mobile apps. And to ensure fast payouts, Arbiter is using bitcoin as the currency in its platform.  Arbiter has already partnered with a large game developer with 150,000 active daily users, but Zissner was unable to reveal the publisher at this time. The company was not trying to raise additional cash at this time since it still has some of its initial Boost funding.  BitPagos  Founder and CEO of BitPagos, Sebastian Serrano told us how his startup focuses on paying South American businesses quickly in bitcoin for credit card transactions instead of local currencies.  Serrano, from Argentina, has seen his home currency wiped out three times in his lifetime.  In Argentina, he told the audience, bitcoin sometimes has a 60% markup because it is considered more stable than the Argentinian peso.  Bitpagos is focusing on South America, where only 30% of people have bank accounts, and 10% have credit cards. The company was looking for $500,000 in investment money.  BitBox  Kinnard Hockenhull  , BitBox’s CEO, started his Boost pitch talking about failed economic systems.  He spoke about the city of Detroit, where he is from, calling it “a victim of monetary policy”. BitBox has been doing business as an exchange initially, but the company’s strategy is to be a “bridge”, a vertically integrated company that provides an array of bitcoin services.  One area of interest, according to Hockenhull, is the $5 trillion per day foreign exchange market. The company already has 8,000 users and has done $300,000 in volume , $145,000 of which was transacted in the past month.  The company was looking to raise $500,000.  BitWall  The first company at Boost VC to present its business, BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/ CEO Nic Meliones started with a statistic: 276 publishers have failed in the past few years.  The company believes that the answer in the publishing industry is micropayments. Its system puts a wall up requesting a small fee in bitcoin for viewing digital content. Consuming new media on the internet is an something that Meliones, who previously worked at Visa, believes is a $36 billion industry.  BitWall has already signed up 10 publishers including bitcoin news aggregator ZeroBlock, where you can see their system in action. The startup has 100 other publishers already interested as well. It was looking to raise $300,000.  Gliph  “Technology is best when it disappears”, Gliph co-founder and CEO Rob Banagale told the audience during its pitch.  Gliph is the only app available for the iPhone that allows users to send bitcoin to one another. It does this by using a messaging interface that allows users to “attach” bitcoin payments.  Gliph connects to wallet providers; it’s currently compatible with Coinbase, BIPS, and it recently added blockchain.info. Instead of providing a wallet itself for users, the company relies on these providers instead.  The app already has 20,000 users, 1,800 of which have wallets connected to the app. Gliph has already closed $200,000 from investors.  What do you think about these bitcoin startups? Do you feel that Boost VC is helping to legitimize the bitcoin economy?

42397244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Oe,1379933039,'No-wallet' bitcoin payment app Gliph gets $200k in funding,"Mobile bitcoin wallet and secure messaging app Gliph has received $200,000 in funding towards its first seed round, in a deal which will see it relocate from its native Oregon to California.    The company raised the money from San Mateo-based Boost VC. It follows $50,000 in funding from the Oregon-based Portland Seed Fund, and an initial $15,000 from Boost VC earlier this year, bringing its total funding to date to $265,000.  Gliph founder and CEO Rob Banagale explained that the app, which lets users send and receive bitcoin while also handling secure messages, was originally conceived as a means of shielding identities online.  “The reason I focused on this space is because I wasn't really comfortable with what I saw Facebook and Google+ doing with regards to digital IDs,"" he said. In particular, he has found Google's policy of forcing people to use real names off-putting.  Gliph has three main components. The first is cloaked e-mail addresses, which allow people to hide their real e-mail addresses behind a pseudonym address, which can be disposed of at will.  The second is secure messaging, which uses encryption to hide message content.  And finally, it interfaces with people's bitcoin wallets, enabling them to send money to other Gliph users easily without using bitcoin addresses.  However, he noticed that people were using it heavily for Craigslist transactions.  “What we really wanted to enable was peer-to-peer transactions, because if people were already using our services to connect with people, communicate with them, and then close a deal, the most valuable portion of that is when you exchange the service or product for payment,"" he said.  In Banagale's ideal scenario, a person selling an item on Craigslist or some other service would use a cloaked e-mail address to list it and communicate with a potential buyer, without having to reveal their true identity, e-mail address, or phone number. Messaging could switch to the encrypted system within the app at any point.  A payment could be made for the good or service, via bitcoin, without ever leaving Gliph, and when the transaction was complete, and the good or service exchanged, the cloaked e-mail address could be disposed of, effectively disconnecting the seller from the transaction.  The company, which demonstrated the product initially at SXSW in March 2012, added support for bitcoin at the Bitcoin Conference in May this year.  In addition to Android, Gliph is available for the iPhone, and has managed to get several releases past the stringent approval processes imposed by Apple's App Store. Several bitcoin wallets have failed, falling foul of what seemed like an anti-bitcoin policy at Apple in the past.  However, Gliph has a unique feature, explains Banagale: “We deliver an experience that no one else has come remotely close to, which is this in-line, no-wallet or intra-wallet function that enables you to send between wallets seamlessly,"" he said.  Instead of creating a bitcoin wallet directly on a mobile device, the software connects directly to online wallets hosted by services such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info, or BIPS. If a user doesn't have a wallet with one of these services, the act will create a Coinbase one for them, without hosting it on the mobile device.  The software does not support direct payments to bitcoin addresses using the app, but instead only permits payments to be made to other Gliph users, indirectly, by sending between wallets. Banagale believes that the concept of scanning QR codes into a bitcoin wallet to make a payment will become obsolete.  “We don't see QR codes as a sustainable and real way for the mass audience to use bitcoin,"" he said. “We think that will be a refuge for the early users, but if you want your aunt to start using bitcoin, she can never see a wallet address, and she won't understand or want to scan a QR code.""  Gliph uses AES 256 encryption to scramble messages between its users. However, Banagale admitted that the encryption keys are still stored on central servers, potentially opening it up to hackers, or government intervention.  Lavabit, a secure messaging service that was used by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, also stored its keys centrally, and was forced to shut down after government intervention.  One of the barriers to storing encryption keys directly on a mobile device is that the company would be forced to use Apple’s own encryption libraries, pointed out Banagale, which potentially raises more issues than it solves.  Banagale did point out that the service includes a lockdown privacy protection facility, in which the user can elect to forego a password reset service. This means that the company will never be able to decrypt a user’s communications, even if they forget their password and ask for a new one.  Gliph will use this latest $200,000 of funding to improve the product’s ease of use and grow the user base, Banagale concluded.
