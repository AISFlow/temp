42397775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6ll,1405458604,BitPay or Coinbase? Shopify Now Lets Merchants Choose,"Online e-commerce marketplace platform Shopify has announced a new partnership with bitcoin financial services provider Coinbase that will allow its roughly 70,000 merchants to integrate bitcoin processing services on their websites.  The move is notable as Shopify began accepting bitcoin payments in November, electing at the time to offer BitPay as a payment option to its merchants. As a result, the announcement with Coinbase means Shopify merchants can now elect which major bitcoin processor they wish to use.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Shopify director of payments Louis Kearns framed the decision as one that would better allow merchants to select bitcoin processing features that meet their needs.  Kearns told CoinDesk:  ""We've found that by supporting multiple payment providers it encourages each of them to innovate a bit more and their customers benefit as a result. We see this as a positive play for Shopify and bitcoin at large.""  Shopify has also updated its internal resources section to include information about both its BitPay and Coinbase account offerings and how they can be activated by online merchants.  Coinbase-led initiative  Kearns indicated that while it believes the feature will enhance the value of its service to its merchant customers, Coinbase took the lead on the initiative by building a Shopify integration tool. With this work complete, Kearns said, Shopify was able to simply approve the new feature before extending it to its customer base.  Kearns explained:  ""We host an open-source payments integration platform that allows payment providers like Coinbase to submit their own integrations to get up and running on Shopify, so Coinbase took the initiative there and built that integration.""  Kearns added that, as a result, merchants can look to Shopify as a way to test both services before ultimately selecting a partner.  ""We wanted to facilitate a choice for merchants to select whatever bitcoin provider they wanted to work with, or try each of them and decide which one they wanted to use,"" he said.  Expanding Shopify features  Kearns went on to state that customers have also been asking for Coinbase integration and that such requests continued even after it enabled BitPay payments last year, due in part to the different features offered by each platforms.  Kearns said he believes the new offering will potentially allow Shopify to appeal to more merchants, allowing the company to expand bitcoin usership:  ""Each company has a certain segment that they are the dominant leaders in. Coinbase is a bit more US-focused, you need US bank accounts to go from bitcoin to fiat, while BitPay is more international.""  As noted in Shopify's updated resources section, the companies also offer different pricing models. BitPay charges a 1% transaction fee on standard sales and a 0% fee for monthly subscribers. Coinbase, by comparison, charges merchants 0% transaction fees on up to $1m in processing.*  Building on success  Though he declined to offer specific data, Kearns suggested that bitcoin use on Shopify is seeing steady growth, and that the company has thus far helped merchants process ""millions of dollars worth of payments"".  Key to this growth has been the use of Shopify's platform by high-profile bitcoin companies and enthusiasts. For example, Kearns cited the fact that hip-hop artist 50 Cent is using Shopify to accept bitcoin for clothing purchases, while ""several big mining shops"" are also leveraging the service.  For more on Shopify and its bitcoin services, visit the company's website.  *BitPay has since eliminated processing fees for merchants who use its basic service.

42397768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6jn,1405455035,"Industrial Bitcoin Mine Employee Disappears After $190k in Alleged Theft, Fraud","A man operating under an assumed name has been accused of stealing bitcoin and bitcoin mining equipment from a Florida-based industrial mining facility and defrauding investors on a popular bitcoin lending platform.  The alleged perpetrator worked under the name Jon Simms, acting as both an independent bitcoin buyer and seller and a professional mining specialist for Digital Mining Investments. The scam targeted bitcoin lending site BTCJam and Digital Mining Investments' Tampa-based mine.  The stolen items allegedly include 55 BTC (roughly $35,000 at press time) taken from BTCJam users, roughly $160,000 in mining equipment stolen from Digital Mining Investments and a currently unknown amount fraudulently redirected through the industrial mine.  CoinDesk spoke with Pat Kenrick, an operations manager for Digital Mining Investments, who said that the alleged perpetrator was discovered to have been rerouting bitcoin mined in Tampa to a secret wallet. While he didn’t know the exact amount of bitcoins redirected from the mining operation, the mine’s large capacity – 500 TH/s – suggests that the theft was of a considerable amount.  Kenrick explained that the man disappeared without notice before any alleged wrongdoing could be prevented, saying:  ""We have not heard from or seen Jon for two weeks now. He deleted us from his Facebook page [and] turned off his phone as well.""  Digital Mining Investments has since reached out to local law enforcement agencies, and an investigation is now underway, according to Tampa police authorities.  Multiple aliases used  According to Kenrick, the man who presented himself under the name Jon Simms had at least one other identity. During his time in Tampa, the man built relationships with both prominent members on BTCJam, as well as members of the local bitcoin community.  The man alleged to be behind the scheme also acted as a local bitcoin advocate and activist in Tampa, ostensibly working to both promote Digital Mining Investments and the digital currency as a whole. Local users of BTCJam told CoinDesk that the man even appeared on local television to discuss bitcoin.  The man’s BTCJam profile shows one active loan of 55 BTC - this was the final amount he received from lenders, according to users on the bitcoin loan platform who suffered losses as a result of the incident. The loan, which carried at 0.75% interest rate, had a seven-day repayment period, but users who gave money to the alleged scammer said that he promised payment within three days.  The owner of CashInBitcoinOut.com, a bitcoin investing service, says that he worked closely with the alleged scammer and believes that ""he needs to be found and brought to justice"".  He remarked:  ""CashInBitcoinOut was one of the largest lenders on BTCJam to Jon. I personally bought my first bitcoin from him in December, met him again, shook his hand, saw where he worked and vouched for him on BTCJam. It's not just about the money, it's about my own reputation for vouching for him.""  CashInBitcoinOut is also offering a 1 BTC reward for information that leads to the arrest of the accused perpetrator and the repayment of the 55 BTC stolen from BTCJam users.  Recovery underway  Digital Mining Investments is moving quickly to recover from the incident and loss of both bitcoin and mining hardware, which included KnCminer ASICs and other equipment that has been seen for sale online, according to Kenrick.  He added that due to the incident, the company is undergoing restructuring, and that it has already acted to make key investments that will ensure its long-term viability.  This includes relocating to a data center in Salt Lake City, Utah, he said:  ""It’ll work out a lot better for us power-wise, just the facility itself. Once we have everything taken care of in with attorneys, get out of Tampa, get everything out in Salt Lake City, we’ll be somewhere around 500 TH/s of mining power.""  Kenrick acknowledged that the full ramifications of the bitcoin and hardware theft - as well as the incident at BTCJam - may take time to resolve. However, he said that the company is actively working with law enforcement and legal experts to find a solution.  Despite the uncertain situation regarding the whereabouts of the alleged thief - unsubstantiated reports indicate that he may have planned to flee the US, it appears that both Digital Mining Investments and the BTCJam community are working to move past the incident.  Mounir Shita, a user who loaned money to the man, told CoinDesk that he will continue to invest on the platform despite the incident, saying:  ""He was my first investment and my first loss. Promised 72 hours return, loan is now past due. No word from borrower. Still believe in BTCJam community, so one loser won't stop me from trusting others.""  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this situation as the investigation in Tampa unfolds.

42397761,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6dt,1405451116,ING: Future Bitcoin Protocol Should Include Central Bank Functions,"A new video report from eZonomics by ING, a money management resource operated by Netherlands-based multinational banking company ING, suggests that bitcoin could one day be supplanted by an improved protocol that seeks to control digital currencies in a similar way to government-backed central banks.  In the video clip, ING economist Teunis Brosens theorizes that in order to function as efficiently as traditional currencies, a bitcoin algorithm needs to be developed that ""smoothly matches money supply and demand"".  Brosens further suggested that such a technological advancement could be wildly popular in the marketplace, stating: ""The inventors of that successful algorithm would make such a momentous step forward that they would surely qualify for the Nobel Prize in economics.""  The statements came as part of an introductory video on bitcoin by eZonomics by ING, an ING resource that seeks to increase financial education by providing practical information on money management.  Where bitcoin falls short  The video finds Brosens introducing the basics of cryptocurrencies before discussing how the technology meets the traditional definitions of money.  He suggests that ING believes bitcoin only meets one of the three central tenets of traditional currency due to its volatility and lack of oversight, saying:  ""Real currencies dampen these fluctuations by regulating money supply and prices through interest rates, but it is an explicit goal of bitcoin to do away with central authorities.""    Can #bitcoin and other virtual currencies ever replace “real” money? New #economic update #video http://t.co/RRUwCpXCVp      — eZonomics (@eZonomics) July 15, 2014      Price fluctuations  The video further emphasized the varying price of bitcoin as a weakness, citing the ""several fluctuations"" in bitcoin price that have occurred in bitcoin's five-and-a-half-year history.  Brosens summed up this viewpoint, adding:  ""Money is a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Cryptocurrency may take the first box if it is accepted more widely, but the second and third are problematic because the value of bitcoin is very volatile.""  The video arrives shortly after a recent report by another major Dutch financial company, payments specialist Innopay, which saw the financial entity speaking with a variety of bitcoin experts as part of a wider fact-finding effort.

The news comes roughly one month after Google Finance partnered with Coinbase to launch a bitcoin price tracker that enabled BTC-to-fiat price conversions across a wide range of global currencies.  A representative from Google confirmed the update to CoinDesk, noting that the tool works on Google Search's smartphone app as well.  The spokesperson said:    ""You can also ask Google to do conversions – if you have the Google Search app on your smartphone, for example, ask it, 'How many bitcoin are in 500 U.S. dollars?' and you'll get the answer in a handy conversion tool.""

How it works  Google search engine users can now type in basic queries such as ""bitcoin price"" or ""price of BTC"" in order to instantly access the tool.  The update also handles more complex queries including ""price of 3 bitcoin"" or ""5 BTC"", and responds by showing the current price of bitcoin along with a chart illustrating the currency's history dating back before 2011.

42397767,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6io,1405440833,Gallery: Take a Tour Inside France's Bitcoin Advocacy Centre,"Spurred by the global media publicity generated by Bitcoin Center NYC earlier this year, a network of physical bitcoin-focused co-working and public outreach spaces has sprouted in major cities around the globe, aiming to increase awareness of bitcoin and provide support to local ecosystems.  One of the more notable installations is La Maison du Bitcoin ('The House of Bitcoin'), a 220-square-metre space in Paris, France, that became the first of its kind in Europe upon its launch on 13th May.  Since then, co-founder Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk that interest in the centre has been ""tremendous"", with dozens of people visiting the centre every day to discuss bitcoin. Most encouraging to Larchevêque is that many of these individuals are coming to the centre to learn about the digital currency for the first time.  Larchevêque said:  ""Aside [from] meetups and hackathons, day-to-day visitors are totally new to cryptocurrencies and are very curious to know more. That was a great surprise for us.""  View the gallery below:  La Maison du Bitcoin now hosts a free 'Bitcoin 101' seminar every month, with roughly 50 attendees present for its most recent meeting, Larchevêque said. More importantly, he added, is that these attendees are demonstrating a high level of engagement, denoted by the lengthy Q&A session that took place after the event.  Challenges to adoption  Larchevêque also discussed some of the challenges the centre is facing in France, noting that obstacles to consumer adoption there are similar to those the industry is facing elsewhere around the globe.  He said this uphill fight will also affect the centre's ability to serve new-to-bitcoin consumers, explaining:  ""The problem we see is that the technology is too complex as it is, and there is a strong need to package everything into dead simple interfaces anyone can use.""  Even so, Larchevêque is optimistic, given that the country's government that has recently taken steps to increase transparency in its nascent bitcoin industry.  Calling the developments ""quite positive"", Larchevêque noted that the decision to exempt bitcoin sales from value-added tax and to require exchanges to embrace know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) best practices are both in accordance with industry belief.

42397772,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6ph,1405438365,Car Marketplace Beepi: Accepting Bitcoin Was 'Logical' Step,"New Silicon Valley startup Beepi – an online used-car marketplace that connects buyers and sellers and claims to offer better prices than car dealerships – now accepts bitcoin payments.  Beepi  ’s co-founders Ale Resnik and Owen Savir told CoinDesk that accepting bitcoin is a “logical step” for any e-commerce startup.  The promise of the company is to replace the middlemen in the car sales industry with a more efficient peer-to-peer system – an aim that has parallels with the impact of bitcoin, Resnik and Savir said:  “We’re reshaping the antiquated process of buying a car by removing complex barriers that go beyond just payment options. In turn, bitcoin is reshaping an outdated payments industry, which is moving us toward a digital, cashless society.”  How it works  On the buy side, Beepi is similar to other listings platforms, except with the added assurance that the cars for sale are ‘Beepi verified’ and come with a 10-day honeymoon period, during which you can decide to return your purchase.  The car is delivered to your door, free if you live in California, and reportedly with a big red bow wrapped around it.  Sellers register their car’s details online and then Beepi comes to their house to look over the car and test-drive it.  Beepi guarantees a sale within 30 days, you can keep driving it until you a sale is completed, and Beepi will buy your car directly if it doesn’t find a seller on its marketplace. The firm takes a 9% commission from the seller in return for the service.  Holding onto bitcoin  In April, the company received $5m in investment from Redpoint Ventures and, as well as bitcoin, offers a range of payment options that can be combined for each purchase, an approach Resnik and Savir said makes the startup unique:  “With the addition of bitcoin, we can further streamline the process of buying cars by give our customers a variety of ways to pay.”  They say that that they use bitcoin themselves and “are holding it as an investment”, rejecting the suggestion that bitcoin is simply a publicity tool for startups.  “We don't see this as a publicity tool for any business, but rather the next necessary step in a world where consumers are becoming increasingly technically savvy. Again, as bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, accepting bitcoin as a payment option should be one of the next logical steps for any ecommerce company.”  Shift in payments  Like many merchants who accept bitcoin, Beepi uses a specialised payment processor, in this case BitPay, meaning that neither Beepi nor the car seller will actually handle any bitcoin.  This means sellers aren’t able to receive payment in bitcoin, but buyers can pay in bitcoin as they do on sites like online retail giant Overstock.com or travel services platform Expedia.com, which recently began accepting bitcoin for hotel bookings.  “The way [society makes] purchases is changing across the board,” say Resnik and Savir. “Both Beepi and bitcoin are a part of that process.”  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42397757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6bv,1405428684,Polish Law Firm Flags Lack of Safeguards for Bitcoin Consumers,"A recent report by Polish law firm Wardyński & Partners calls for new regulation to protect users of digital currency in the country.  Under current Polish law, the report states, the legal protection of digital currency users is minimal and relies predominantly on the application of general regulations in civil law.  Consequently, these users cannot benefit from the legal acts that defend the rights of those using traditional payment methods, such as Poland's Payment Services bill or the Act on Financial Instruments in Trading.  The report adds:  “For us, new technologies are all about new legal challenges. In many instances, we must tackle [the] doubts surrounding the legal treatment of innovative products and services or an absence of relevant regulations.”  Legal parity with fiat  Addressing the varying legal protections across different currency services, the report argues that cases of digital currency theft should hold the same legal repercussions as those involving fiat currency:  “The possibility of applying selected provisions of the Penal Code to ‘theft’ of bitcoin demonstrates that in the area of criminal law, legislative intervention to protect the growing number of users of virtual currencies is urgently needed.”  The authors call this legal variance “disturbing” and suggest that article 267 §1 of the Polish Penal Code, which penalises individuals for obtaining unauthorised access to information, should also apply to cases of cryptocurrency theft.  “The economic meaning of ‘theft’ of virtual currencies is identical to the theft of legal tender or a payment card,” the report continues. “But theft of virtual currencies as such is not punishable.”  Poland's hacking attacks  Like many other nations, Poland has seen its share of security breaches, hacking attempts and theft over the past few months.  As earlier reported by CoinDesk, Poland’s digital currency exchange Bidextreme.pl was hacked in November last year, with customers’ bitcoin and litecoin wallets emptied. Four months later, Poland’s leading bitcoin exchange Bitcurex temporarily shut down its website following a hack that targeted funds in its bitcoin wallets.  Company representatives told CoinDesk that the decision to temporarily close the platform would allow its IT team to “perform a necessary verification”.  Bitcurex resumed service on 18th March, announcing that the perpetrators did not manage to break its security measures or gain full access to its operational hot wallet. However, the two incidents were likely to leave some of the country’s bitcoin users worried about the safety of their cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin and VAT  Last week the Polish finance ministry issued a statement clarifying that while bitcoin is not recognized as an official currency in the country, it can be used as a financial instrument. However, the country's ambiguous digital currency taxation guidance remains subject to a wide range of interpretations by public institutions.  The report argues that digital currencies require a tailored tax solution, specific to their needs:  “Under current law, users of virtual currencies are exposed to a particular tax risk. The lack of regulations specifically addressing [digital currencies] means that [fiscal interpretations] of operations involving virtual currencies are derived from general regulations, which are ill-suited to the nature of such operations.”  It concludes that cryptocurrency trading should be exempt from the value-added tax in Poland, or “at least be considered”.  Headquartered in Poland’s capital city, Wardyński & Partners is one of the largest independent Polish law firms, with offices located in Poznań, Wrocław, Kraków and Brussels.  The firm’s practice is focused on numerous areas, including EU law, tax disputes and technology, according to data released by the company.

ANX customers load their cards from bitcoin balances (effectively selling bitcoins to ANX) or from any of the 10 international currencies the firm currently supports. The stored currency on the cards, however, is always US dollars.  The cards can then be used worldwide at any merchant that accepts debit cards and at regular ATMs to withdraw cash, though, again, all amounts will be debited in USD.  ANX charges a 2.5% fee to load the cards, which is deducted from the deposited amount.  There has been a proliferation of companies offering bitcoin-loaded debit cards in the past year, with offerings also on the way from Xapo and expresscoin.  Solving the acceptance problem  Bitcoin debit cards are one solution to the 'merchant acceptance' problem. Although accepting bitcoin directly from customers offers advantages to businesses through reduced bank processing fees and no chargebacks, many merchants remain unaware of bitcoin or how to use it securely.  Debit cards go one step further even than payment processings companies, who exchange bitcoins for fiat currencies soon after a sale is made.  Most merchants accepting the cards might still be completely unaware that bitcoins were involved in the transaction.  Day-to-day role  Ken Lo, ANX's CEO, said the company believes prepaid cards will play an integral role in a bitcoin consumer's day-to-day financial life, explaining:  ""We felt it was important to go beyond current offerings in the marketplace and bring something new and innovative to our customers. The ANX Bitcoin Prepaid Debit Card enables our customers to easily transfer their Bitcoins to their card anytime and benefit from the same freedom and flexibility of a traditional credit card"".  As well as its exchange and wallet platforms, ANX has also previously launched a bitcoin ATM and a physical shopfront for customers and potential customers to further their bitcoin education.  Immediate delivery  ANX's debit cards are available for immediate delivery to any customer who has been through the company's know your customer (KYC) verification procedure.  Once delivered, a card is linked automatically to the customer's bitcoin wallet and can be loaded via the ANXBTC and ANXPRO online exchange websites.

The news, publishedhttp://mainichi.jp/shimen/news/m20140715ddm008020039000c.html in major daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, is significant as the Rakuten Group is the country's premier online retail conglomerate, and one of the world's largest, with a network of over 40 businesses worldwide and over 10,000 employees.  Another potentially interesting angle is that Rakuten has its own bank, offers credit cards, has its own securities brokerage and runs the e-cash network of RFID-chip cards known as Edy.  Mikitani made the comments in a speech (unofficial translation) to several of Rakuten's merchants in Fukuoka, saying:  ""The Internet revolution is accelerating this year and I imagine that, sooner or later, Rakuten will start accepting money in the form of bitcoin (an internet virtual currency).""  Bitcoin offered a more stable option to some countries even over their own national currencies, he added.  Commerce and competition  Rakuten has its finger in many major pies. It is regarded as a global competitor to Amazon.com, and Mikitani himself is an Internet business pioneer often referred to as 'Japan's Jeff Bezos'. It also manages a professional baseball team, the Rakuten Eagles, which last year won the Japan Series.  Mikitani often engages in a fierce business rivalry with fellow entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of mobile phone carrier Softbank, with the two regularly seeking out ways to disrupt Japan's often conservative corporate status quo.  The company's online marketplace, Rakuten Ichiba (literally 'Rakuten marketplace'), has over 40,000 independent merchant members. According to Wikipedia, its revenues in 2012 reached $4.63bn.  Going global  The company is further famous for its aggressive acquisition policy, traveling the world to buy other e-commerce sites including Play.com, Buy.com (for $250m in cash in 2010), and messaging app Viber in February this year for $900m.  It has also bought a stake in Pinterest, and purchased e-book company Kobo, whose devices it markets and sells in Japan, again in direct competition with Amazon.com.  Were Rakuten to begin accepting bitcoin, whether sooner or later, virtually every kind of consumer product would potentially be available for purchase with bitcoin in Japan. Often seen as another Holy Grail for digital currency, neither it nor CEO Mikitani has previously hinted publicly the option might be considered.

Gox Market Void,"A consortium of Chinese and American bitcoin businesses has announced a plan to start a new Japan-based exchange, and is seeking to acquire Mt. Gox and its remaining assets as a means to bolster the new offering.  The joint venture, named BitOcean Japan, consists of Chinese ATM producer BitOcean and New York-based exchange technology platform Atlas ATS, a company that has been looking for a local partner to expand its global exchange network to the Asian market.  While the new venture is not a Mt. Gox rescue plan per se, and is not looking to resurrect the Gox name, its members are looking to purchase the bankrupt exchange's assets and will be making a submission to Nobuaki Kobayashi, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the Mt.

Gox under a similar branding, BitOcean has revealed it will be taking a different approach, should it be able to leverage the defunct company's assets as part of its effort.  BitOcean Japan co-founder and General Counsel, Daniel Kelman, explained the change of heart surrounding the name, saying:  ""We kicked around the idea of using the Gox name because we felt that is would be best if we could prevent it from being forever a stain on bitcoin. We decided against using Gox because the damage has been done and is irreversible — we were all 'Goxxed' and, frankly, anytime someone in bitcoin gets ripped off from here until eternity it will be referred to as a 'Goxxing'. What is important is that people realize bitcoin is not Mt Gox in any sense of the word.""  A more important issue now is distributing creditor assets without further waste, he added.  A May decision in the Mt. Gox case has opened up the exchange to a potential bidding process, though Kobayashi has stated that he has yet to formally consider any bids.  Atlas looks east  The move is also significant for Atlas ATS, which recently launched a 'nano exchange' aimed at enterprise trading and that is seeking to extend its product by leveraging local outlets strategically placed around the globe.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Atlas ATS Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Rafi Reguer noted the appeal of being associated with a Mt. Gox revival effort, stating:  ""The primary reason for offering our technology is that we believe in their plan on bidding for Mt. Gox and their vision how to return faith to the bitcoin markets and to all of the people who lost either money or BTC in the bankruptcy.""  He added: ""We think it is an admirable thing that BitOcean is doing and we wanted to be a part of it"".  BitOcean also had strong local knowledge in Asia, particularly China, he added, and forming a partnership was instrumental in starting a business in the region. Both businesses were committed to supporting both the businesses and people involved with digital currency.  The technology backing the Atlas ATS exchange platform also runs in over 50 Wall Street trading firms in the US and Canada, Reuger said.  Japan and JADA  Kelman said the decision to base the business in Japan was multifaceted. He noted the move aims to fill the market void left when Mt. Gox collapsed, and help Japan reclaim its status as bitcoin's 'spiritual home' thanks in part to Gox's beginnings in Tokyo and the name, if not the person behind it, of Satoshi Nakamoto.  BitOcean Japan is also looking to become a member of the Japan Association of Digital Asset (JADA) the new self-regulatory industry body which has the full blessing of Japan's government.  ""We are very happy to see an organization in Japan existing to provide a means of communication between the industry and government,"" Kelman continued.  There have been no problems so far setting up banking relationships, which BitOcean Japan did before JADA's existence was announced. This had previously been seen as a barrier to future bitcoin businesses in the country, especially after the financial debacle surrounding Mt. Gox.  Legal uncertainty  Despite BitOcean's ambitions to ensure Mt. Gox does live on in some form, Kelman was less enthusiastic about the exchange's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.  There are still no guarantees that Kobayashi plans to approve any rehabilitation plans for Mt. Gox, Kelman suggested, adding that his actions so far have appeared to favor prompt liquidation and a sale of Mt. Gox's remaining 200,000 bitcoins.  Kelman said attempts to contact Kobayashi directly had so far met with little success, with the trustee communicating mainly via paper mail and Mt. Gox's law firm.  The rival bid organized by Sunlot Holdings, which operates the SaveGox.com website, has also not yet been approved. BitOcean says the key difference between the plans is that BitOcean's backers are themselves Mt. Gox creditors, and would thus present a plan designed more to favor creditors' interests.  BitOcean in China  BitOcean Japan's parent company was one of the first bitcoin businesses to open in China, and is a permanent member of the international Bitcoin Foundation.  The company demonstrated its bitcoin ATM technology at May's Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing, and is planning to launch a two-way bitcoin kiosk this month.
