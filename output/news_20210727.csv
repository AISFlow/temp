42434926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuWbh,1627426800,Mining Difficulty Expected to Increase for the First Time Since China Crackdown,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty may be set to increase for the first time since China’s crackdown on crypto mining in May.      A rapid expansion of mining facilities in North America and the return of Chinese miners through overseas hosting sites are two major factors that will drive up mining difficulty, according to industry pros.      Mining difficulty is a metric to describe how hard it is to mine a block and get rewards in bitcoin. An increase in mining difficulty requires a miner to use more computing power to earn bitcoin, which reduces the miner’s profit margin. The more mining machines are online, the higher the mining difficulty and the more secure the Bitcoin network..      Mining difficulty has seen a continuous decrease since the Chinese central government called for local authorities to shut off bitcoin mining operations across the country on May 21. The latest bi-weekly difficulty level posted on July 17 is the fourth downward adjustment since the crackdown.      “For the first time since China’s hashrate went lights out, we’re anticipating next week’s adjustment to be positive, a roughly 1.75% increase,” according to Seattle-based mining Luxor’s newsletter on Saturday.      Even before China’s crackdown, big North American mining companies such as Marathon and Riot were already expanding their operations due to bitcoin’s historic bull run in early 2021, Luxor CEO Nick Hansen said.      “While we saw the big hashrate drop across the network during that time, other miners were also deploying new hardware,” Hansen said. “It was just drowned out by the disconnections in China.”      Marathon said it entered a binding letter of intent with the U.S.-based miner hosting services provider Compute North in May to run about 73,000 bitcoin miners as part of the hosting firm’s 300-megawatts (gw) data center in Texas. The Las Vegas-based company claimed its hashrate would reach 10.37 EH/s after all its mining machines are fully deployed.      “I am personally expecting a positive difficulty adjustment next month because the displaced miners (from China) have since found new homes and they aren’t coming offline anytime soon,” said Azam Roslan, senior sales associate at Wattum, a New York-based mining company that offers hosting and mining machine brokerage services.      Most of the growth that will drive up mining difficulty in the coming months would still be from the North American miners who planned expansion ahead of Beijing’s crackdown last year or in early 2021, Daniel Frumkin, researcher at Prague-based mining company Slush Pool, said.      “The Chinese miners that were forced offline in the crackdown and did not find capacity available right away are more likely to take more than three months to get back online because, in most cases, they have to collaborate on building out more infrastructure,” Frumkin said.    Closing in    The positive adjustment could be the beginning of a drastic surge in hashrate in the coming year.      “I think we have reached that minimum low difficulty point and now we are going to start to grow unless there are other big government shakeups or changing bitcoin price,” Hansen said.      So while Beijing’s crackdown on crypto mining might be a disaster for Chinese miners, it could be a windfall for the miners in the rest of the world.      Mining companies in North America and central Asia have raked in wide profit margins due to the low mining difficulty. However, the window of opportunity is slowly closing on miners as mining companies across the world are scrambling to build out new hosting sites to run mining machines.      “We are a long, long way away from where we were before the crackdown, but my guess is that adjustments will be positive for a long time,” Frumkin said.      Hasen expects that in about 12 months hashrate would return to the level before China’s crackdown, based on the average lead time to build out new mining facilities to host both new machines and those that come from the Chinese miners.      “I do not think the positive adjustment is just a blip and we will see significant growth and probably exceed the all-time high before the crackdown given how much new capacities are being built,” Hansen said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/27/mining-difficulty-expected-to-increase-for-the-first-time-since-china-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19ed8aab9ae4cc9992d24703910ee12eb518f329-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Technical data suggests lower support around $34,000 could stabilize the current pullback.      “Going forward, we expect bitcoin to keep pushing higher and test the upper end of the $30,000-$42,000 trading range,” wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, in an email to CoinDesk. “We expect to see similar moves in altcoins, too, led by ether.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $37,896.6, -3.95%  Ether (ETH) $2,244.3, -4.27%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4401.5, -0.47%  Gold: 1799.2, +0.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.238%, compared with 1.293% on Monday    “Only a conclusive break above $50,000 in BTC would attract fresh flows and signal a change in the broader direction for the market,” Balani wrote.      Some analysts expect further upside in bitcoin as institutional buyers find value opportunities across cryptocurrencies.      “As institutional investors have been waiting on the sideline to take positions, the current market move could be sustained during the week” wrote Elie Le Rest, partner at crypto hedge fund Exo Alpha, in an email to CoinDesk.      The short-squeeze rally triggered the most active trading session this quarter in crypto markets, according to data from Skew.      The increase in volumes has been driven by large buyers, typically institutions that have waited for a more directional trend on bitcoin since the end of May, according to Le Rest.    Brief return to profitability    Over 2 million BTC have returned to profitability based on their realized price after bitcoin rallied over the past few days, according to data from Glassnode.      “This indicates that 11.2% of the circulating supply has an on-chain cost basis between $29K and $38K,” Glassnode tweeted Monday.    Bitcoin drawdown    Bitcoin’s drawdown, or the percentage decline from the peak near $63,000, narrowed to around 40% over the past week. Typically, drawdowns exceeding 50% indicate the start of a bearish trend, similar to 2014 and 2017-2018.      The current drawdown suggests bitcoin’s intermediate-term downtrend is stabilizing given the sharp price bounce over the past few days. However, drawdowns can last much longer towards 70%-80%, which previously occurred near bear market troughs.    Options less bearish    Bitcoin’s one-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts, or bearish bets, relative to calls, or bullish bets, has come off sharply to 2% from 13% late last week, according to data provided by crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew. The one-week put-call skew has declined from 13% to 5%.      The narrowing of the spread between prices for puts and calls essentially means investors are no longer seeking downside hedges in anticipation of an extended price drop, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.    Bitcoin futures back in contango    “After Monday's short squeeze, some unregulated futures are back in a 10% contango, but the basis varies across the various venues, and the institutional traders still seem cautious,” according to a Tuesday report by Arcane Research.      Contango, a term used to describe the bullish arbitrage, occurs when the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price. Since April, bitcoin’s contango has narrowed as bullish sentiment waned.      “We’re still far away from the extreme contango of 50% from mid-April, but it is concerning that the traders in the unregulated offshore futures once again outpace the CME traders,” Arcane wrote.      “The growing contango occurs as traders with a short bias are reluctant to re-enter short positions after Monday’s massive short squeeze.”    The Tether put    With largest stablecoin, USDT, in the news again for inauspicious reasons, worried perma-bears might now be searching for the crypto market equivalent of a credit default swap – a derivatives instrument that allows buyers to bet on another trading counterparty’s creditworthiness.      The answer to that might be a put option on tether, essentially a bet that the stablecoin’s price will fall below its ostensible redemption value of $1. Some traders have been actively scouting around for such a trade, according to some players in digital-asset markets.      Although market makers have seen demand for a tether put, fulfilling that demand is difficult, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. Currently, there is no active market for put options on tether. Exchanges don’t find a business case there because, technically, there is no exposure to offset. Participants fearing a tether collapse need to find a put seller in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or approach market makers. That’s a costly affair.      The solution may be dealing in a tether put at a much lower or out-of-the-money strike below $1.00. That would cost relatively less than buying a put at $1.00.    Altcoin roundup  Senator Warren fires on crypto again: Longtime crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is urging the U.S. government yet again to form a regulatory strategy to “mitigate the growing risks that cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system.” In an open letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on July 26, Warren urged the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Yellen leads to bring about a “coordinated and holistic” response to the risks of crypto. Warren cited decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto-enabled cyber attacks and unique threats posed by stablecoins as risks to the financial system.  Eco raises $60M for high-yield USDC savings app: Eco is raising another $60 million to propel its early hit stablecoin crossover as regulators turn up the pressure on the sector. Eco is part of a wave of fintechs hawking bank-like services to a fiat audience – but one of the few with a crypto back-end: It generates returns on clients’ deposits by lending them out to institutions in the form of stablecoin USDC. That model may come under scrutiny as world regulators probe the stablecoin sector with new force, reports CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.  Solana’s Saber Labs Raises $7.7M: Saber Labs, a core contributor to a cross-chain stablecoin exchange bearing its name and built on Solana, has raised a $7.7 million seed round.

SecretSwap works similarly to Uniswap or SushiSwap but also has privacy features, including resistance to ""front-running,"" which is a bot attack (or trading) strategy on the Ethereum network in which a bot gets a transaction first in line in the execution queue, right before a known future transaction occurs. The launch of the governance tool means that holders of SecretSwap’s SEFI token can vote in a system that is private by default.      In a blog post announcing the launch, the community said this would help “secure the integrity and sovereignty of SecretSwap’s decentralized governance.”      SecretSwap, a relatively new entrant to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), has seen over $275 million in volume, according to data site Secret Analytics.      “Data privacy is critical to the security and usability of DeFi,” Tor Bair, the Secret Foundation’s executive director and chairman, said. “SecretSwap solves universal DeFi issues like front-running while giving users access to multi-chain assets and privacy by default.”      The move continues a build-out of the Secret Network’s line of applications and system, and provides an alternative to more public DeFi platforms.      How this will play out in practice remains to be seen, as public DeFi projects – and democratic processes writ large – generally tout transparent votes.      Bair added that some of the challenges to bringing the project to launch included ensuring that voting mechanisms were protected against offline attacks, that individual votes were protected while still reported in aggregate and that all of this worked seamlessly with the existing trading user experience.      “This launch of SEFI governance fulfills the initial promise of the SEFI governance token and strengthens community ownership over SecretSwap and the future growth of Secret DeFi – a multichain, front-running resistant, privacy-centric DeFi ecosystem that puts users first,” Bair said.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/27/secret-network-adds-private-governance-to-its-defi-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e218086abf96553f9849de858440b8890a78f8a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuWnh,1627412362,Why Stablecoins Are Suddenly in the News,"Stablecoins have existed for roughly seven years but talk about them has never been as heated as in recent weeks, not only within the crypto community but among regulators and traditional market investors.    What is a stablecoin?    Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is usually pegged to a range of assets, whether it’s a government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar, a precious metal like gold or even another cryptocurrency.      Issuers have been trying different methods for realizing and maintaining stablecoins’ price peg to the underlying assets. Some stablecoins pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar – such as USDT, USDC, BUSD and GUSD – are backed by reserves whose dollar value is supposed to match the tokens’ circulating supply. Others are backed by physical commodities, such as tether gold, representing one troy fine ounce of gold on a London Good Delivery bar.      There are also decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and FEI, which are powered by algorithms.    How are stablecoins used?    Prior to the rise of stablecoins, most people traded cryptocurrency against government (""fiat"") currencies and other cryptocurrencies. “Starting in 2017, spot trading against stablecoins started to dominate a larger share of the trading activity,” noted Pankaj Balani, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange.      Compared with trading crypto against fiat currencies, stablecoins offer a faster, less expensive option, allowing for more liquidity. They're also theoretically less prone to the market-price fluctuations witnessed in other cryptocurrencies.      Stablecoins are also used in crypto lending. You can earn an annual interest rate of 4% from depositing USDC in a savings account at Coinbase, one of the companies behind the stablecoin. The interest rate for depositing USDT could range from 1.66% to 13.5%.      There has been much going on about stablecoins recently, and some of it can be overwhelming. Here are the three big things happening right now:    1. Tether is under a cloud    As the most traded cryptocurrency in the market, USDT has become a backbone for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Over half of all bitcoin trades are made against it.      However, Tether, the company behind the digital token, has been plagued by regulatory issues.      Monday, Bloomberg reported the U.S. Justice Department is conducting an investigation into whether Tether, in its early days, hid from banks that transactions were linked to crypto.      Tether published a response on its website, saying the Bloomberg article was based on “years-old allegations, patently designed to generate clicks."" However, the company didn’t explicitly deny the allegations.      Some investors are also uneasy about Tether’s reserves, skeptical of the company’s ability to redeem its tokens in the worst circumstances. In May, the company revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office. As disclosed by Tether, roughly half of the reserves are invested in ""commercial paper"" – typically short-term corporate debt – while 13% are in secured loans and 10% are in corporate bonds and precious metals.      Tether’s holdings of commercial paper, loans and corporate bonds are exposed to market risk, term risk and credit risk, said economist Frances Coppola. “If the value of their commercial paper was to fall, or value of their corporate bonds was to fall,"" Coppla said, ""then the value of their tokens in issuers would not be $1, it would be less.”    2. Regulatory heat    Stablecoins had a total market capitalization of $116 billion as of July 26, an almost fourfold increase since the start of this year, according to CoinMarketCap. As growth increased so has the attention from U.S. and other regulators.      “Regulators look at stablecoins because they're more adjacent to the existing banking system than other types of cryptocurrencies,” Alex Svanevik, CEO of crypto analytics company Nansen, wrote to CoinDesk via email. “There's a real chance stablecoins could be disruptive for traditional finance.”      A month ago, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, identified tether and other stable-value tokens as a risk to the financial system, citing concerns of potential disruption to short-term credit markets.      Also, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced she would examine stablecoin regulation and risks as part of a presidential advisory group. Shortly thereafter, officials from the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. met to discuss the issue “in light of the rapid growth in digital assets.""      Separately, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler suggested last week that some stablecoins should be deemed to be securities, subject to his agency’s oversight.      In China, Fan Yifei, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), said digital currencies pegged to a fiat currency had the bank “quite worried” and “may bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system,"" as reported.    3. Circle going public, other stablecoin issuers disclose more info    Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin, has also been in the spotlight. Circle plans to go public through merging with Concord Acquisition Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC). The deal would value the crypto financial services firm at $4.5 billion.      Following CEO Jeremy Allaire’s pledge to make the company more transparent, Circle published, for the first time, a breakdown of the assets backing its stablecoin in its most recent attestation, dated July 16. The company reported about 61% of its tokens are backed by “cash and cash equivalents,” meaning cash and money market funds. “Yankee Certificates of Deposit” – meaning CDs issued by foreign (non-U.S.) banks – comprise a further 13%. U.S. Treasuries account for 12%, commercial paper is 9%, and the remaining tokens are backed by municipal and corporate bonds.      Another stablecoin issuer, Paxos, also released for the first time a breakdown of reserves for its stablecoins, Paxos standard and the Binance-labeled BUSD. Some 96% of the reserves were held in cash and cash equivalents, while 4% were invested in U.S. Treasury bills as of June 30.    The takeaway: Stablecoins’ systemic role, and risk    The systemic role stablecoins play in crypto trading and lending has caused some investors to worry about worst-case scenarios, such as what could happen should stablecoins issuers face massive redemption requests.      The risk could also spill over to the traditional markets. The credit ratings firm Fitch said in a report earlier this month that risks facing stablecoins are potentially “contagious.” As of March 31, Tether’s commercial paper (CP) holdings amounted to $20.3 billion, which suggests that its CP holdings may be larger than most prime money market funds in the U.S. and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Fitch.      “A sudden mass redemption of USDT could affect the stability of short-term credit markets if it occurred during a period of wider selling pressure in the CP market, particularly if associated with wider redemptions of other stablecoins that hold reserves in similar assets,” the rating firm said.      Stablecoins may also affect money supply, according to David Grider, head of digital assets Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Stablecoins let you do something very interesting, which is to let you earn interest on both sides of the same dollar,” he told CoinDesk.      The actual dollars being reserved could be lent out in the real economy, while the digital receipts may be lent out again in the crypto economy and earn interest as well. As Grider wrote in an analyst note, that’s “effectively taking the same dollar and lending it twice.”",NEUTRAL,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,"Frances Yue, Eli Tan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/27/why-stablecoins-are-suddenly-in-the-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff0739e728bf6e64b68cd235f712ce0e0103aa8d-1300x890.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434925,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuWTh,1627409995,The Node: Goldman's 'DeFi' ETF Is a Nothingburger,"In what appears to be a world first, Goldman Sachs has applied to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the neologism “DeFi” in the title. But the fund appears to have little to do with “decentralized finance” as we know it.      The Goldman Sachs Innovate DeFi and Blockchain Equity ETF would track 20 companies that advance blockchain technology and the digitization of finance, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    With companies like Cisco, Nokia and Sony in the mix, though, it’s clear the investment banking giant is taking something of a liberal view of what constitutes “DeFi.” For instance, the greatest contribution to the blockchain sector made by the German tech giant Siemens might be a press release announcing its inclusion in the ETF.      Although the news is a nothingburger, it is revealing in its own right of the extent that “crypto” has permeated the business world. It’s also a clear expression of the disconnect between what hardcore coiners may want versus what is realistic to expect.      Many of the stocks included in the ETF could claim to be working on blockchain technology broadly, but any specific DeFi application is likely suspect. Most of these corporate efforts would fall under “enterprise blockchain,” a term that’s become a punchline among anyone who has actually used MakerDAO, Compound or Aave. But the phenomenon is still chugging along, presenting its own vision of corporate blockchain adoption.      While DeFi seeks to remove middlemen from the equation, enterprise blockchain is about bringing them back in. Truly, a revolution is coming to database management and tracking leafy greens.      Take Nokia, the Finnish company widely remembered for its near-indestructible, pre-smartphone era cellular devices. The company recently launched a blockchain and artificial intelligence powered data marketplace, according to a press release. Buzzwords aside, that’s not very sexy.      Accenture, Alibaba and Overstock also have well-documented, blockchain-related ambitions. CoinDesk reported in 2020 that Alibaba, for instance, was zeroing in on International Business Machine’s place as the top blockchain-related patent holders, with fingers in everything from music streaming to a Cosmos-like cross-chain product.      These efforts don’t always pay off. IBM notably slashed its blockchain division after revenue misses. Its stock wasn't included in the ETF application.      Yesterday, the markets went wild amid a circulating rumor that Amazon would soon accept bitcoin payments. That turned out to be false, though a company spokesperson did say the company remains interested “in the space.”      If Amazon did accept bitcoin payments, it would be another strong endorsement of the crypto economy. It would also introduce another intermediary in the sector, another company with its own corporate responsibility commitments.      Meanwhile, DeFi has organically blossomed into a $65 billion industry. It’s a testament to the idea that complex financial systems can run without centralized, corporate oversight. I wouldn’t bemoan an ETF application that tracked MKR, AAVE or COMP, but do we need the validation?      Crypto is meant to undercut or exist independently of corporate and state interests. The fact that so many international conglomerates and tech giants are taking note of the technology, while staying at arm's length from the exciting stuff, is a testament to that. Their PR departments seem to find this simulacrum useful, but calling enterprise blockchain “DeFi” doesn’t make it so.      Goldman’s “DeFi” ETF application may stand a better chance than most crypto-related funds in getting approval from the SEC, exactly because it plays into this publicity trick. As CoinDesk's Nathan DiCamillo noted, there are 12 outstanding bitcoin-related filings and several for Ethereum before the SEC, and so far the agency has only punted on making a decision. Pretending that a bunch of blue-chip stocks are interchangeable with cutting-edge experimental protocols might help Goldman get past that gate, but it’s hard to think that would be doing its clients any favors.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/27/the-node-goldmans-defi-etf-is-a-nothingburger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfb42f40ef0be0281f4ec74d7b2b511637bc4999-2048x1184.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Daily trading volume for bitcoin reached $9.2 billion, the highest since June 22, according to a report by Arcane Research.      Trading volumes in bitcoin were previously trending downward, with some saying this was, in part, due to Wall Streeters “taking a break,” and heading out on summer vacations.

42387366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmf4j,1627406068,Senate Banking Committee Bashes Bitcoin's 'Phony' Populism,"The U.S. Senate Banking Committee put crypto on trial Tuesday as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said the industry needs tighter regulation and as the committee's chairman sought to answer his own hearing’s titular question – “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” – with a resounding “nothing.”      Warren said bitcoin decentralization is a fantastical narrative because the network’s true power brokers – miners and corporations – have the leverage to achieve false moral supremacy over big banks.      “Instead of leaving our financial system at the whims of giant banks, crypto puts the system at the whims of some shadowy faceless group of super coders and miners, which doesn't sound better to me,” Warren said.      Painting the industry as a fraud-ridden, accountability-dodging, digital slot machine that enriches its creators and burns everyone else, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the banking committee's chairman, warned in his opening remarks that crypto could endanger U.S. consumers and financial stability.      ""There's nothing democratic or transparent about a shady diffuse network of online funny money,” Brown said. He called for “smart regulations” that protect consumers from crypto “extortionists” and their “phony populist marketing.”      The hearing was almost certainly the testiest in a trio of crypto-themed inquiries Tuesday morning.    Read more: State of Crypto: Congress Is Holding 3 Hearings Today, Here’s What to Expect    Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, House members debated central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and senators jousted on the ransomware wave. It was a sign of the growing influence that crypto wields in monetary policy and cybercrime.      Democrats on the banking committee said that influence should be quashed, as they attacked crypto for myriad hypocrisies – particularly decentralization. Republicans, led by ranking member Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who has invested in cryptocurrencies, were slightly more cautious; Toomey acknowledged “legitimate concerns about cryptocurrency” but showcased the upsides of blockchain technology.      Three very different witnesses – Angela Walch, a professor at St. Mary's School of Law in San Antonio; Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a blockchain and digital currency advocacy group; and Marta Belcher, chairwoman of the Filecoin Foundation – offered sometimes irreconcilable viewpoints on the industry.      Walch described crypto as an unregulated time bomb primed to wreak havoc on traditional financial payment systems, and Belcher called out the “myth” that cryptocurrency isn't heavily regulated.    Lawmakers weigh in    Some senators used the hearing to push different theories about market and mining trends. According to Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), China’s bitcoin mining exodus is step one in a state-sanctioned plan to achieve dominance in the financial industry over the U.S.      “They're shipping ‘em around the world because they know these guys can raise hell with our financial system,” he said.      Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said that most decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives instruments violate U.S. commodities law, a view echoed by Dan Berkovitz, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Smith later called out bitcoin’s massive carbon footprint, poo-pooing arguments that crypto can go green.      “We don’t have time to ride the cost curve down,” she said.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is urging the government yet again to form a regulatory strategy to “mitigate the growing risks that cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system.”      In an open letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on July 26, Warren urged the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Yellen leads to bring about a “coordinated and holistic'' response to the risks of crypto.      Warren described becoming “increasingly concerned” about the danger cryptocurrency poses to investors, consumers and the environment in the absence of “sufficient regulation.” She also claimed the growing demand for crypto and its approximately $2 trillion market cap could also pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system.      This is not Warren’s first letter to a government official concerning crypto. Earlier this month, she sent a letter to Gary Gensler, who became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April, asking for clarity on crypto regulation by July 28. She has criticized the speculative nature of digital assets in interviews, and has pushed for regulation in her role as chair of the Senate's Subcommittee on Economic Policy.      In her letter to Yellen, Warren wrote that the financial system’s increasing exposure to cryptocurrencies means that “material distress in the cryptocurrency market could spread throughout the financial sector.”      She cited the risk posed to banks by volatile crypto prices, the “unique threats” posed by stablecoins, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the anonymity associated with it and the rise of crypto-enabled cyber attacks as examples of the ways cryptocurrencies “ripple through nearly every corner of the financial system.”      Warren also took shots at the current, haphazard approach to crypto regulation, calling it “fractured” among various government agencies.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/27/senator-warren-urges-coordinated-and-holistic-response-to-dangers-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0424aa2650cf64735481534fa4e7538c71c03da-1500x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zhao made a point of clarifying that he would be “honored to run Binance as a regulated financial institution,” and that his move, when it comes, would be when a better leader emerges rather than some reaction to the ongoing regulatory clampdown.      As part of the exchange’s plan to address the current regulatory scrutiny, Zhou said Binance is “pivoting from a tech startup to a financial institution,” which will involve opening headquarters, and creating a structure regulators can easily recognize.      “We have a structure that's relatively hard to understand for regulators. For example, simple things like we don't have a headquarters,” he told reporters. “So we are now looking to establish multiple headquarters in regional headquarters in different parts of the world. We don't have specific locations for all of them yet.”    Read more: ShapeShift to Shut Down, Airdrop FOX Tokens to Decentralize Itself Out of Existence    Zhao acknowledged Binance’s communications with regulators in the past “have not been the best,” adding that the plan now is to hire ex-regulators and “become licensed everywhere.”      Asked by CoinDesk if a reported U.S. probe into Binance had kicked off a coordinated swoop on the exchange across multiple jurisdictions, Zhao said he did not know.      “No one has told us this is a coordinated effort, so we don’t know,” he told CoinDesk.

42387364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmf0x,1627399747,How to Fix Ethereum’s MEV Problem and Give Traders the Best Price,"As mainstream adoption gathers steam and the number of decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions explode, the Ethereum community is debating a growing controversy: the best way to tackle the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) problem.      Disputes come as no surprise given that in the past three years, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications has gone from zip to $54 billion today. In 2021 alone, DeFi on Ethereum has enjoyed a colossal rise in value, increasing 246% already by July.    Dr. Friederike Ernst is chief operating officer at Gnosis.    But with rising value comes increased attempts at exploitation, as we’ve seen with the co-occurring rise of MEV.      Defined in a 2019 Flash Boys 2.0 paper by a group of researchers at Cornell University, MEV is “the measure of the profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce.” Miners can exploit and profit from front-running, back-running and sandwiching transactions in any block they mine. These types of activities are not well received by DeFi users as they translate to higher costs for executing transactions, and have a higher chance of paying for a failed transaction.      As DeFi scales and pulls in wider adoption, such behaviors affect more users and transactions than ever and are unlikely to be solved by Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), according to a report from research group Flashbots.    Why MEV is an issue    Is MEV really that bad for Ethereum? Well, it depends on which side of the fence you’re on. Since January 2020, miners have ""extracted"" nearly $750 million in value from Ethereum users. In the last 30 days, that figure stands close to $94 million.      MEV-type value extraction, executed by miners who hold sole power to organize transactions within a block, is endemic due to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) mempool design. This element of mempool design has garnered the Cixin Lin-inspired nickname “the dark forest,"" a side effect of the EVM architecture that goes unnoticed by most users.      In a nutshell, every transaction on Ethereum submitted to the chain is monitored to check if there’s a possibility of taking advantage of it. It’s in the dark forest that the mainstream Ethereum community learned there is often an adversarial relationship between users and miners.    Read more: Why Ethereum’s Miner Extractable Value Problem Is Way Worse Than You Think | Opinion    The MEV “dark forest” gives rise to two intertwined problems:    DeFi users are constantly suffering from all types of MEV, such as front-running attacks that end up making the users' transactions fail even though they paid to execute them, or back-running attacks where the users get value extracted from their operations solely because the miners are in a privileged position.  Even when a transaction tries to prevent a possible protocol exploit, it can still lead to a bigger problem because the existence of the transaction itself signals the protocol weakness to everyone else.    Not all hope is lost.    Batching solutions    MEV is not going to go away unless we design resilient components for users. Critical infrastructure and correct tooling for DeFi are necessary to combat the problem. And it has to be at the dapp level. The transition to proof-of-stake is an unlikely solution, as changing Ethereum's core protocol requires a very high level of consensus (which is most likely not going to happen).      There are multiple ways in which dapps or users can combat MEV, but the most realistic approach is to have a trading mechanism (protocol) that enforces batch auctions. Batch auctions, or batch trading, is when an exchange's order book processes orders across a time range with the goal of executing all trades within a batch simultaneously. This serves as a price finding mechanism for correctly pricing token pairs with the same clearing price for each block.      In traditional markets, batch auctions are used during market opens to process all the orders placed during non-market hours. In DeFi, batch auctions are helpful to execute numerous transactions simultaneously in the same block.      In a system where miners or validators have all the power to reorganize transactions, batch auctions settlements can take away that power from them. This is because a batch settlement forces the miners to execute transactions regardless of the order they have. With a batch auction with uniform clearing prices, the order of the trades can not alter the prices.      Batch auctions allow dapps built on top of a protocol to offer users improved trading methods, such as:    Gasless order submission, or when users submit off-chain orders via signed messages  Enforcement of the same prices for all trades that happen at the same time, even if they are from different traders  Helping users get matched directly with one another – in a ""coincidence of wants"" – without depending on external, third party liquidity pools  Off-chain, more gain    Submitting off-chain orders through signed messages is a new way of conducting trading that has not been widely used before. Dapp users don’t need to submit on-chain orders for them to be valid. Rather, they can submit off-chain orders by signing a transaction with their order preferences (they are signing a message with their intent to trade).      Because the orders have been placed off-chain, the transactions are not sent to the mempool individually, until they are later sent and settled via the batch auction settlement transaction all at once. This means they can be settled all together in a single batch, which increases the difficulty to replicate and makes the re-organization of transactions irrelevant because all trades have the same price regardless of the order.      At the same time, off-chain orders can allow a protocol to be non-trading route dependent, so that even if a miner is able to pick up the signed messages and tries to take advantage of them, it would be irrelevant as the miner does not know against which AMM pool those trades will be settled. As the protocol does not force users to be bound to a specific trading path, it can focus on achieving better prices rather than on executing transactions the fastest.    Read more: Valid Points: MEV on Eth 2.0: The Good, Bad and Ugly    Protocols that have price-finding mechanisms based on batch auctions with uniform clearing prices and coincidence of wants (CoWs) can offer their users a level of MEV protection unmatched by any other form of MEV prevention developed so far. (Coincidence of wants is an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they exchange these items directly without the need of a third party providing liquidity to facilitate the exchange to happen.)      On a deeper level, this means that if protocols use batch auctions instead of a constant function market maker design, they can offer their users the chance to settle trades directly based on the CoWs that can be found. The protocol can therefore optimize prices according to the different orders it receives in each batch, so that it’s always able to give the best price to traders while protecting them from MEV. As we mentioned before, batch auctions can also allow a protocol to establish uniform clearing prices, which, along with CoWs, can help users be protected from MEV.      This protection comes from the fact that, because the protocol matches the trades without external on-chain liquidity. In other words, in the event of a COW, the protocol would not need to execute an on-chain transaction against an automated market maker (AMM) to make the trades liquid.      Additionally, if no CoWs can be found, uniform clearing prices within a batch auction make the transaction ordering of the auction irrelevant because all trades of the same token pair get the same settlement price, therefore removing the possibility of MEV actors having a chance to extract value by reorganizing transactions.      MEV is a growing problem for Ethereum, but it can be mitigated. Protocols focused on batch auctions, with these sorts of qualities, can help the DeFi-automated market maker space in the fight against MEV. It’s up to us as a community to ensure we only use those dapps that have the users interest at heart, and that allow them to coordinate trades in a smarter and more efficient manner.

Bitcoin's one-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts, or bearish bets, relative to calls, or bullish bets, has come off sharply to 2% from 13% late last week, according to data provided by crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew. The one-week put-call skew has declined from 13% to 5%.      The narrowing of the spread between prices for puts and calls essentially means investors are no longer seeking downside hedges in anticipation of an extended price drop.      Ether's one-week and one-month skews have seen similar drawdowns to 0% and 1%, respectively.      The short-term skews have pulled back due to a flurry of call buying. On Friday, a trader bought a total of 2,000 call option contracts on bitcoin in multiple clips of 100 via over-the-counter (OTC) desk Paradigm. The buying was concentrated in July 30 expiry calls at strike prices of $33,000, $34,000 and $35,000. The trader also snapped up Aug. 6 expiry calls at strikes $34,000, $35,000, and $36,000.

The Pennsylvania-based Stronghold filed its S-1 form Tuesday with the SEC, proposing a $100 million IPO.  The firm intends to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker SDIG.  Stronghold converts waste coal, a material left over from coal mining, into power used to mine bitcoin. Pennsylvania regulators classify waste coal as an alternative energy source on par with hydropower for its environmental impact.  In its S-1, Stronghold said it currently operates approximately 1,800 crypto asset mining computers with hash rate capacity of roughly 85 petahash per second (PH/s). Since April 1 the company has entered into three definitive agreements with multiple suppliers to purchase over 27,300 additional miners with a total hash capacity equal to over 2,600 PH/s.  In June, Stronghold raised $105 million in a funding round with contributions from MG Capital and Greg Beard, a former senior partner at private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Beard is now listed as Stronghold's co-chairman and CEO.

42387371,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmf7F,1627392600,"State of Crypto: Congress Is Holding 3 Hearings Today, Here's What to Expect","Congress is continuing to hold hearings around the digital asset sector, with three simultaneous meetings today to discuss different uses for cryptocurrencies.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Crypto in Congress  The narrative    I originally pitched this newsletter a year ago as a vehicle to discuss regulatory issues and the U.S. Congress' approach to crypto in a more in-depth way than in a straight news article. Part of my thesis at the time was that I fully expected to see more regulatory interactions with the crypto world. Anyways, Congress is holding three (or two, depending on how you look at it) hearings that are important for crypto today. At the same time.    Why it matters    The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on ransomware, the Senate Banking Committee is holding a hearing on crypto uses and the House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing on central bank digital currencies. The fact we’re seeing three simultaneous hearings on different aspects of the crypto industry shows how much attention Congress is paying to this sector.    Breaking it down    Each of Congress' hearings start at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, or about 30 minutes after this newsletter is emailed out. CoinDesk will, of course, be covering all three hearings.      I’m going to take this in order of most adjacent to crypto to most direct.    Senate Judiciary    The Senate Committee on the Judiciary will hold a hearing titled “America Under Cyber Siege: Preventing and Responding to Ransomware Attacks,” with a witness panel of government officials. As of my writing this, there’s no hearing memo and no pre-published witness testimony, so it’s hard to gauge just how much crypto will actually come up.      However, we know that regulators are eyeing cryptocurrencies as a payment tool for ransomware attacks, and this did come up during a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing last week. I fully expect crypto to come up again today, and it’ll be worth paying attention to government officials’ recommendations on regulating or restricting ransomware payments through crypto.      The witnesses at this hearing are:    Richard Downing, U.S. Department of Justice Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division  Bryan Vorndran, FBI Assistant Director, Cyber Division  Eric Goldstein, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Executive Assistant Director  Jeremy Sheridan, U.S. Secret Service Assistant Director    Sheridan was a witness at the aforementioned House hearing, where he told lawmakers that criminals can use cryptocurrencies for a variety of illicit activities.      “The rapid expansion of cryptocurrencies, as well as other digital stores of value, presents a significant challenge to law enforcement, and a growing area of risk to the U.S. and our foreign partners,” Sheridan said in his testimony to last week’s House committee.      The rest of his testimony is worth a look but tl;dr the U.S. Secret Service has some concerns about how crypto might be used in money laundering. I imagine we’ll hear something similar in today’s hearing.      I plan to livetweet this hearing – you can follow along on Twitter @nikhileshde.    House Financial Services    The House Committee on Financial Services hearing titled “The Promises and Perils of Central Bank Digital Currencies” (CBDC) should take a different tack. A hearing memo raises a number of questions we’ve heard before, including how a CBDC might address monetary policy and financial stability concerns, national security concerns, privacy, financial crimes and cybersecurity concerns.      The witness statements likewise focus more on policy concerns around a digital dollar/U.S. CBDC than they do on arguments about whether a U.S.-issued crypto is even a good idea – in other words, so far it seems like this will be pretty substantive.      It’s important to note that this hearing will be held by the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy, the same subcommittee which held a hearing on how cryptocurrencies might be used in terrorist financing earlier this year.      The witnesses are:    Julia Coronado, MacroPolicy Perspectives President and Founder  Yaya Fanusie, Center for a New American Security Adjunct Senior Fellow  Julia Friedlander, Atlantic Council Senior Fellow and Deputy Director  Andrew Levin, Dartmouth College Professor of Economics  Robert M. Baldwin, Association for Digital Asset Markets Head of Policy    The witness list is an interesting blend of industry insiders, researchers and academics.      In pre-written testimony shared with CoinDesk ahead of the hearing, Baldwin recommended policymakers look at how a CBDC might impact the commercial payment system in addition to how it could be administered and used.      My colleague Sandali Handagama will cover this hearing. You can follow her on Twitter @iamsandali.    Senate Banking    Last, certainly not least (and possibly most), the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will host a hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?”      It’s a loaded title, but the witness list suggests that this will also be a very substantive hearing. We’ll hear from:    Angela Walch, St. Mary’s University School of Law Professor  Jerry Brito, Coin Center Executive Director  Marta Belcher, Filecoin Foundation Chair    In other words, the three witnesses all have deep expertise within the crypto industry, whether as researchers or as participants in crypto-focused organizations.      I don’t have a whole lot on what sort of questions might be asked but, as Ron Hammond of the Blockchain Association points out, this hearing will have both crypto critics and advocates in Congress asking questions.      The hearing will also take place a day before SEC Chair Gary Gensler is expected to explain his agency’s authority in regulating crypto exchanges, as well as answer a host of other questions about the industry in response to a public letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).      “I'm looking forward to discussing cryptocurrency's use cases and the promise of decentralized technologies at the hearing. I think it's an important dialogue to have in order to ensure that future legislation does not have unintended consequences that could chill innovation in this space,” Belcher told me via email.      My colleague Daniel Nelson will cover this hearing. You can find him on Twitter @realDannyNelson.    Tether investigation    Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating Tether on bank fraud allegations.      “Specifically, federal prosecutors are scrutinizing whether Tether concealed from banks that transactions were linked to crypto, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential,” according to the report.      Tether’s banking woes aren’t exactly new: In its settlement with the company, the New York Attorney General’s office detailed some of its banking issues. Tether and Bitfinex, its sister firm with which it shares key ownership and managers, both used banks in Taiwan, with Wells Fargo acting as a correspondent bank, according to the legal filing.      Wells Fargo cut Tether off in early 2017, at which point the stablecoin issuer found a few other banks before ultimately landing with Deltec (though it’s possible this isn’t Tether’s only bank right now).      In response to the Bloomberg report, Tether claimed that the news site was “repackaging” old claims but the stablecoin issuer stopped short of actually denying the allegations (a spokesperson did not answer a direct question about this).    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    I’m getting an increasing number of emails about U.S. President Joe Biden nominating officials for various roles, but nothing about making the acting heads of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network permanent heads or otherwise naming new chiefs for these agencies. Elsewhere, Congress has continued confirming some nominees, though others, such as Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director-nominee Rohit Chopra, still await their final votes.    Elsewhere:  Bank of Russia Tells Stock Exchanges to Avoid Crypto-Related Funds: The Russian central bank warned stock exchange operators not to list any sort of product that might have exposure to the crypto industry or crypto-related investment products.  Brazilian Police Seize $33M in Crypto Money Laundering Probe: Brazilian law enforcement officials seized or placed holds on the crypto exchange accounts of individuals and entities accused of money laundering, totaling about $33 million worth of crypto.  US Credit Union Regulator Wants to Know How Its Firms Handle DeFi: The National Credit Union Administration has published a request for information about how credit unions in the U.S. might interact with crypto, including decentralized finance. The regulator is seeking input from the general public on a total of 26 questions across different categories like risk, compliance, actual usage and operations.  Outside CoinDesk:  (FT) Hedge funds are growing wary of Binance due to the increased regulatory backlash to the exchange, reports the FT’s Laurence Fletcher, Eva Szalay and Adam Samson. Citing Tyr Capital and ARK36, the report says hedge funds are trading less on the exchange than they used to due to concerns about the regulatory risk.  (Politico) Regulators are concerned about decentralized finance (DeFi) and “working to get their arms” around this aspect of the crypto industry, Politico’s Kellie Mejdrich reports. In what I’m sure must be a coincidence, this report came out right around the time Uniswap Labs announced it was taking tokenized stocks (among other tokens) off the frontend portal it controls. The whole article is worth a read.  (New York Times) The New York Times’ Ephrat Livni and Eric Lipton profile Sam Bankman-Fried and other “crypto nomads,” crypto startup founders from North America who set up their businesses outside the region. And yet, despite their efforts to avoid U.S. regulators, some of these exchanges still have plenty of U.S.-based customers.

42387353,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmeoN,1627391012,Crypto Fintech Eco Raises $60M for High-Yield USDC Savings App,"Eco is raising another $60 million to propel its early hit stablecoin crossover as regulators turn up the pressure on the sector.      The fiat-input, cashback-granting digital wallet and stablecoin platform is not even five months removed from its $26 million pre-seed. But CEO Andy Bromberg said Eco’s user base has swelled since that March debut, and the company is ready to speed up its growth.      Eco is part of a wave of fintechs hawking bank-like services to a fiat audience – but one of the few with a crypto back-end: Returns on clients' deposits (which are handled by Wyre) are generated as they are lent out to institutions in the form of stablecoin USDC.      That model may come under scrutiny as world regulators probe the stablecoin sector with new force. Crypto lender BlockFi’s interest accounts are under local fire for alleged securities violations and executives at Tether, the mega stablecoin issuer, are reportedly in federal investigators’ crosshairs over criminal bank fraud.      “We are watching the cases really closely,” Bromberg said in an interview before the latest Tether developments, “and are going to make sure that whatever we're doing is in alignment with the latest understanding of every regulation that exists.”    Read more: Diddy, Haddish, Durant Revealed as Investors in Crypto-Powered Banking App Eco    Nonetheless, he said Eco “has not been convinced yet” by Vermont, Texas, New Jersey and Alabama’s allegations that BlockFi’s service is an unregistered security, a claim that could have ramifications for businesses like his.      Eco, which began life as a full-on crypto startup, isn't so showy now about its usage of services lending fiat as USDC. But the high efficiency model is how the startup puts its users’ dollar deposits to work.      “I think it's under-appreciated by a lot of people, how many reasons there are for dollar-denominated demand in the crypto markets,” Bromberg said.    Fundraising push    Private equity firm L Catterton and Activant Capital, a previous investor, led the round, Bromberg said. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Lightspeed Venture Partners, LionTree Partners and Valor Equity Partners also chipped in.    Read more: Rewards-Focused Startup Eco Raises $26M in Round Led by a16z Crypto    Eco plans to double its 25-strong headcount in the next six months to accommodate rapid growth. Bromberg said he’s pushing to accelerate the product timeline and plans to hire designers, product managers and engineers accordingly.      A larger team could also help Eco work through a 180,000-deep waitlist, which, once onboarded, will more than double the startup’s existing user base.      “The waitlist is certainly bigger than onboarded users,” agreed Bromberg, who declined to state by how much.      He credited the practice of 1-on-1 onboarding with producing high conversion rates and deposits of $7,700, 20x higher than the average size.      UPDATE: 7/27/21 10:28 PM EDT: This article has been updated to better convey Eco's stablecoin lending practices.

42387367,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmf3T,1627390844,DeFi Insurance Platform Tidal Finance Goes Live on Polygon,"Tidal Finance, an insurance offering aimed at the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has launched its mainnet and token reward system for participants providing capital to its reserve pools.      Announced Tuesday, Tidal Finance goes live on Ethereum layer 2 network Polygon, with a handful of initial clients for its subscription-based insurance model, including StaFi, Xend Finance, Marlin, EasyFi and bZx.      Faced with a dearth of insurance options, cryptocurrency companies – particularly those inhabiting the nascent realm of DeFi – have come up with alternative solutions, usually attracting reserve pools to cover losses with the incentive that individual investors bolstering those reserves will earn return on that investment (a similar system works at Lloyd’s of London).      Chad Liu, CEO of Tidal Finance, said the goal is to bootstrap about $10 million into the reserve pool by the end of the year.      “At launch, Tidal ourselves are going to seed $200,000 in the reserve pool. We are pretty confident, judging from our competitors that we will easily bootstrap like $5 million up to even $10 million,” Liu said in an interview.    DeFi insurance    Tidal uses the term “mining” to describe the distribution of its native token to participants who choose to deposit USDC in the pool to back one or more of the protocols offering cover.      “As an estimate, if they back up one protocol, they can get around 15% APR. If they back up, say, seven protocols in the initial launch pool, that would go up to about 100% APR,” Liu said.      Decentralized insurance alternatives have grown in tandem with the DeFi boom with platforms like Nexus Mutual gathering a capital pool of over $380 million at today’s prices. In the case of Nexus, token holders take part in a fully decentralized governance and voting system to decide which claims should be paid.      Liu said Tidal takes a more direct approach to claims handling, relying on a mix of in-house security experts and in partnership Halborn, a security and auditing firm specialized in blockchains and smart contracts.      “The final call on claims is down to a risk assessment committee,” Liu said. “In my opinion, it’s better to have a separate party’s assessment that doesn’t involve an entangled interest with losing capital when a claim happens.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MATIC | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/27/defi-insurance-platform-tidal-finance-goes-live-on-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a9cfb5f661259b2b69f9b2c897a87d46a6cfc3d-1500x838.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Tuesday, the Fireblocks Series D round was co-led by heavy hitter tech VCs Sequoia Capital, Stripes, Spark Capital, Coatue and DRW. Also a co-leader on the round was SCB 10X, the venture arm of Thailand’s oldest bank, Siam Commercial Bank (now the third global bank to invest in Fireblocks alongside BNY Mellon and SVB Capital).      Technology firms that specialize in the safekeeping of cryptocurrencies and tokens have become desirable items on the shopping lists of banks and large fintech players eyeing the digital asset space. Firms like Fireblocks that can provide cryptographic key sharding technology such as multi-party computation (MPC), are seen as particularly valuable, and there have been some acquisitions and partnerships.

The funding was led by Race Capital with participation from Chamath Palihapitiya's Social Capital, Jump Capital, Multicoin Capital and Solana Foundation, among others.      Dylan Macalinao, co-founder and CEO of Saber Labs, told CoinDesk Tuesday via a spokesperson the funding is in relation to the exchange's fast growth and total value locked (TVL).      ""Value is locked up in the exchange when liquidity providers deposit assets into a liquidity pool (e.g., the USDC-USDT pool, which currently has $22 million in assets),"" said Macalinao. ""We expect Saber's TVL to continue to rapidly increase as more projects integrate with Saber's deep on-chain liquidity.""      Other notable investors included OKCoin's Jason Lau, FTX's Tristan Yver, Curve Finance's Julien Bouteloup, Terraform Labs' Jeff Kuan and Stacks' Ryan Shea.

BBVA, BNY Mellon, DNB, MYBank, Sberbank, Societe Generale and UniCredit are the seven banks using SWIFT Go, an announcement Tuesday said.  The service is designed to enable businesses and consumers to send payments quickly and securely anywhere in the world directly from their bank accounts.  Global messaging network SWIFT connects banks and other financial institutions for cross-border payments and links more than 11,000 institutions. In June alone it transmitted more than 350 million messages containing financial information.  SWIFT Go may be seen as an attempt to compete with the global real-time payments system provided by Ripple.

42406994,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8vSH,1627383213,"Bitcoin Takes a Breather as Stocks Drop, Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yields Hit Record Low","After rallying for five consecutive days, bitcoin is taking a breather alongside a dour mood in traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency is changing hands near $37,000 at press time, having failed to hold Monday's gains above $40,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices pulled back after e-commerce giant Amazon flatly denied speculation it was adopting bitcoin as a payments alternative.      Asian stocks hit the lowest point of the year early Tuesday as shares in Chinese internet companies lost more ground owing to the regulatory crackdown. Major European markets are also flashing red, and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are down 0.53%.      According to some observers, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are at the far end of the risk curve. So, a worsening of risk aversion in traditional markets would be bearish for cryptocurrencies.      However, recent price action suggests bitcoin sellers have run out of steam. The cryptocurrency traded higher on Monday even after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin tether (USDT), for possible bank fraud.      Bitcoin has managed to hold on to the $30,000 support in recent weeks despite increased regulatory scrutiny of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, persistent concern about stablecoins, and China's ban on mining.      The market activity is reminiscent of the resilience observed in early October 2020. Back then, bitcoin remained bid above support at $10,000 despite multiple exchange hacks, and a BitMEX lawsuit. The cryptocurrency went on to hit record highs above $20,000 in December.      Another factor favoring an upside in asset prices is the renewed decline in inflation-adjusted bond yields. The real yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank to a record low -1.11% on Monday – down 51 basis points from the February peak of -0.60%. According to the Financial Times, real yields in the euro region also traded at all-time lows on Monday.      Deep negative real – or inflation-adjusted – returns on bonds tend to boost the attractiveness of other assets. For instance, assets from equities to gold and cryptocurrencies saw unprecedented rallies in the 12 months through March 2021 as real yields collapsed and central banks pumped trillions of dollars worth of liquidity into the system in the aftermath of the March 2020 crash.      Also read: USDT Maintains Dollar Peg as Traders Shrug Off DOJ Tether Probe Report      This time, the bullish impact of the decline in real yields may be tempered by growth fears and central banks looking to scale back stimulus. ""There was a big liquidity push back then, but now central banks are thinking of doing the opposite, and there are some growth concerns,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and growth director at TradingView, said.

Sun is ""transferring from business to school,"" he said on his WeChat and Weibo accounts, a statement some took to imply he's thinking of winding down his business activities.  He will become a deputy leader in a research project on blockchain-based social governance, according to a Tuesday joint press release with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.  The 30-year-old said he hopes to be the next Jianzhang Liang, referring to a Chinese internet entrepreneur and CEO of travel platform Trip.com who retired from his executive position in 2016 aged 47.  In a subsequent tweet, Sun said he is not planning to retire.  The project was approved by the Central Party Committee to consider the advantages of blockchain in social governance and look for innovative applications, the statement said.  Chinese reporter Colin Wu tweeted that Sun will not actually retire, but aims to show he has a good relationship to China's ruling party.  The announcement met with support from some Weibo users, who saw it as motivated by nationalist sentiment: ""Brother Sun can't stand the plight of the American Empire and will come back to build socialism with us,"" wrote a user identified only as ""The banner of Marx.""
