42398513,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUS3r,1437165622,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Putin and Deloitte Draw Summer Snores,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of media coverage and its impact.  Berklee, Deloitte, Standard Chartered, Vladimir Putin – the mainstream media was spoilt for choice this week as big names from mainstream business circles and global newsmakers contributed their opinion of the technology.  Too bad the press didn't notice.  With the bitcoin price down from last week's highs and speculation about a Greek eurozone exit finally waning, mainstream journalists seemed to have taken a much-needed respite from awkward attempts at analyzing the industry this week.  Even with comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin (likely the first head of state to publicly acknowledge the technology) or a key opinion related to how value added tax (VAT) could be handled in Europe, the press responded with a resounding shrug that suggested mainstream news may not soon recover from its Q2 decline.  Macro trends emerge  Speaking of trends, this week saw at least two notable reports celebrate the halfway mark of 2015 by attempting to make sense of developments in the ecosystem.  The most extensive was CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin Q2, which offered nearly 100 slides of insight. Its most notable conclusion? That bitcoin is increasingly behaving like an asset that can be used in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, while showing more signs of price stability away from its volatile peaks.  As for bitcoin in the headlines, the report found overall press coverage was down in Q2 across all major news outlets surveyed including Financial Times, The New York Times, Sina and The Wall Street Journal.  US bitcoin services firm Coinbase also released a mid-year review, finding similar conclusions regarding the price and volatility of bitcoin.  That report's most notable conclusions may have been regarding transaction volume on the bitcoin network, as it asserted:  ""The network averaged 60,590 transactions per day in June 2014 and 117,474 transactions per day in June 2015. (Note that this does not include the recent spikes due to load testing and spam on the network.) That’s a 94% increase in monthly transactions over the past year.""  Elsewhere, Coinbase noted the growth in the use of its API and what it believed to be the increase in exciting projects such as 21 Inc, Abra and Blockstream.  Putin's uncertain address  Possibly the highest-profile – and perhaps unexpected – piece of news this week came during a Russian TV appearance by President Vladimir Putin, who in a question-and-answer session, was asked for his thoughts on digital currencies.  Though the comments hinted at Putin's lack of understanding regarding the technology, interestingly the remarks were generally neutral in tone.  Putin suggested he agreed with the Bank of Russia and its approach to understanding the technology. Implicit in the remarks was that the Bank of Russia has opposed a draft bill put forth by the Ministry of Finance which has called for bitcoin and digital currencies to be banned.  Still, it was the community's somewhat comparably hostile reaction to Putin's remarks that arguably received more play that the comments themselves, which were publicized only by International Business Times and in China-based news outlets.  Writing for NASDAQ, Martin Tillier took aim at comments that sought to belittle the Russian leader and his assertion on how the technology is ""backed by nothing"".  Tillier said:  ""As with all of the old men before him (and many young ones too) he completely ignored that the same thing is true of every modern conventional currency. Dollars, euros, yen and rubles are also backed by nothing and have value because people believe they do. If anything it could be argued that because of the computing power and trustless account network behind Bitcoin it has more backing it than the others, not less.""  Tillier took aim at Reddit in particular scolding the community for its ""tizzy"" on the subject, though he grounded the comments somewhat in overall criticism for online news reactions.  ""With maturity comes respect, and so long as bitcoin users and followers continue to overreact to everything, the respect that the currency deserves as a potentially transformational idea will be withheld by the vast majority of people,"" he continued.  Bank news narrative falters  This week also brought the first signs that interest in statements from major financial institutions toward bitcoin may be waning as comments by ""big four"" auditing firms Deloitte and Standard Chartered Bank failed to draw much interest.  In an interview with CoinDesk, for example, Deloitte detailed the breadth of its bitcoin and blockchain program, noting it was currently exploring use cases for the technology in two of its core verticals, auditing and consulting.  Deloitte Consulting principal Eric Piscini told CoinDesk:  ""The solution we're developing using the blockchain will accelerate the audit process because that company would post every transaction in a blockchain.""  Though the statements were not from any major Wall Street firms, and in the case of Standard Chartered, didn't coincide with announcements about the actual use cases of the blockchain, the overall quiet period could be read as the first signs that interest in this news narrative is waning.  On one hand, the reaction is logical. As evidenced by CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin Q2 report, many major banks have already come out in favor of blockchain technology.  However, the development should have a particular resonance, as this news cycle is starting to bear similarities to last year's furor around the adoption of bitcoin as an e-commerce payment option by merchants such as Overstock and Expedia.  Though these announcements were heralded as major milestones, 2015 has seen a dramatic decline in the number of big brand merchants accepting, or even publicly speaking about, bitcoin and its use as a currency.  The development perhaps hints that despite the increase in attention from banks, real developments at major enterprise financial institutions may still be years away.

42398509,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUS0u,1437160255,Blockchain Identity Startup ShoCard Raises $1.5 Million,"ShoCard has raised $1.5m in funding from AME Cloud Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Enspire Capital and Morado Venture Partners.  The startup, which seeks to use the bitcoin blockchain as a way to authenticate identification, debuted in May at TechCrunch Disrupt NY. Its launch came amid a broader shift in focus among investors, who appear increasingly interested in harnessing the power of bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger for use cases beyond payments.  ShoCard views its solution as one that could disrupt the digital identity business, providing consumers with the means to hold a secure version of their personal information for use in e-commerce purchases, online banking logins and more.  The funding will help the startup advance on what might be its core barrier to mainstream adoption as stated by TechCrunch's Romain Dillet – attempting to secure mainstream partners.  While a challenge, the company boasts experience at the helm, having been founded by former Yahoo senior vice president Armin Ebrahimi and former Coupons.com president Jeff Weitzman.  ShoCard is one of a small but growing number of startups seeking to use the blockchain as a means of improving identity management that includes online identity protocol OneName, which has raised $1.62m in funding from investors including Union Square Ventures.

42398502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURwy,1437154388,European Bitcoiners React to VAT Exemption Proposal,"Bitcoin entrepreneurs and digital currency enthusiasts in the European Union (EU) have spoken out following the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) proposal for bitcoin's exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT).      Formulated by the court's Advocate General Juliane Kokott, the opinion provided a long-awaited answer to the question of whether VAT should be applied to bitcoin purchases and sales.    Despite Spain's Ministerio de Hacienda clarifying its stance on bitcoin transactions earlier this year, Alberto Gomez Toribio was still optimistic about the proposal and the possible implications for his business.  The CEO of Spain-based bitcoin exchange Coinffeine told CoinDesk:  ""The Advocate General puts forward a very sensible argument: VAT is a form of tax that is applied to consumer goods and it therefore makes no sense that it should be applied to the transmission of bitcoin as there is no final consumer. Bitcoins are destined to be eternally transferable and act as a form of payment.""  Coinffeine, he said, would remain unaltered if the proposal was ever signed into law.  ""Our business model would remain unaffected as we don't store bitcoin nor fiat,"" he said.  Indication of things to come  Some entrepreneurs in the European space speculated that the Advocate General's opinion would have far-reaching implications for the continent and likely become the standard for how countries approach taxing digital currencies.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Filip Godecki, CCO at Polish bitcoin exchange Bitcurex, said of the decision:  ""Such an opinion of the EU's Advocate General is a very good sign. Business thrives best when the law is clear. Bitcoin's exemption from VAT is crucial for companies and ordinary people who want to be full scale users of bitcoin payments – which is its prime and natural function.""  ""We are looking forward to seeing an official decision regarding this issue, but as the EU legislative history shows, Advocate General's opinion is often a precise forecast of upcoming official regulations,"" he added.  As previously reported, Poland imposed a 23% VAT on bitcoin mining profits, but its position on bitcoin exchanges continues to remain unclear.  Twitter reaction  Twitter was also awash with comments following the publication of the proposal.  Erik Vorhees, CEO of instant bitcoin and altcoix exchange ShapeShift.io – previously critical of New York's BitLicense – celebrated the opinion released by the ECJ's Advocate General.    Positive ruling/advice from EU!! No VAT on bitcoin exchanges! https://t.co/ycHN1GHfCp #BTC #finance #cryptocurrency        — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) July 16, 2015    The opinion, however, was also well received by bitcoin entrepreneurs elsewhere. John Collins, a policy and public affairs officer at Coinbase urged EU member countries to pay attention to the exemption.    Excellent news from the ECJ regarding VAT exemption of bitcoin http://t.co/NpSb9Z8Q0G Countries should take note      — John Collins (@JohnCollins) July 16, 2015    Legal opinion  Legal experts from across Europe also reacted to the news.  ""We have been waiting for a long time for a clarification issued by the ECJ relating to the application of the VAT exemption to bitcoin transactions... In my opinion, the most important matter behind this issue is that if the ECJ accepts the arguments of the Advocate General, the VAT exemption would be applicable in the whole European Union, including those countries (Estonia and Poland) which stated the contrary [applied VAT to bitcoin transactions].""  Similarly to de la Cruz, Esteban van Goor, a tax advisor, praised the proposal and reflected on the implications for the bitcoin community.  He told CoinDesk:  ""In my opinion Advocate General Kokott did a great job in describing the VAT treatment of the exchange of bitcoin into fiat and vice versa. It is positive for the bitcoin community that a case like the one at hand is addressed by the Advocate General and the ECJ. ""  ""The ECJ may also provide guidance in relation to other possible VAT related discussions pertaining to bitcoin, such as bitcoin mining,"" he added.

42398505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURu1,1437148779,CEX.io Launches Bitcoin Exchange Service in Latin America,"Bitcoin exchange CEX.io has partnered with payment solution provider AstroPay to launch local currency account deposits and withdrawals in Latin America.  Prior to the partnership, CEX.io users in Latin America were only able to deposit and withdraw funds via bank transfers or cards.  ""Such operations were only possible in USD or EUR, which was very expensive for them,"" said Helga Danova, communications officer.  The new integration, she added, will enable customers in Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Uruguay to purchase bitcoin with local currency. Consumers in China and Turkey will also be able to fund their CEX.io accounts with their local currencies using AstroPay.  According to a statement released by CEX.io, AstroPay charges a 2.5% fee for both deposits and withdrawals carried out through online banking. Danova noted users may also be charged an additional fee by their bank.  Having pivoted away from bitcoin mining, CEX.io has a comparably low 24-hour trading volume (approx $102,624 for BTC/USD trades) in comparison to other exchanges such as Bitfinex ($13,587,900 for BTC/USD trades).  CEX.io launched account withdrawals and deposits in 23 US States in April in an attempt to advance in the market.  ""We are working on providing the best solutions for users from different parts of the world, aiming to become a global exchange with a local approach,""concluded Danova.

42398503,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURvz,1437140518,ING Bank: Customers Not Blocked From Buying Bitcoin,"A spokesperson for ING Group has clarified its customers are able to buy bitcoin via company bank accounts, despite conflicting statements from one of its social media representatives.  The statements follow a period of speculation about the Dutch multinational banking and financial services company's policies following ING's assertion that it was blocking bitcoin purchases from user accounts.  A spokesperson for the company indicated yesterday that it was not possible for ING users to attempt to acquire bitcoin using their accounts due to the ""increased risk of fraud"" associated with the transactions.  That statement was later retracted in comments to CoinDesk:  ""Our bitcoin policy, it is very simple, ING customers can buy bitcoins with their ING bank account.""  Company representatives on Twitter have also since clarified the matter.  Nonetheless, the comments are some of the first statements from ING regarding its bitcoin policy, though it had previously addressed the subject in its corporate materials.  ING boasts 32 million private and institutional clients, earning €1.3bn in retail banking and €739m from its commercial banking activities in Q1 2015.

42398495,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURo7,1437129544,Jeff Garzik Submits Proposal to Double Bitcoin Block Size Limit,"Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik has proposed increasing bitcoin's block size limit to 2MB.  Blocks – which are created every 10 minutes – currently hold only 1MB of transactions each. However, if the bitcoin network is to scale competitively it will need to exceed the three to seven transactions per second it currently supports.  With the 1MB limit looking to be reached within the next few months, Garzik says his proposal, BIP 102, is an emergency 'fallback' if consensus among bitcoin's stakeholders is not reached.  ""If we can find a more complete solution, yes, by all means, let's throw BIP 102 in the trash,"" the developer told Reddit.  Gavin Andresen first proposed to increase the block size to 20MB earlier this year. The idea has since sparked a highly politicised debate among fellow core developers and the wider community.
