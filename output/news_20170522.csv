42399888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5MQ,1495489818,Consensus 2017: Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Puts Blockchain Privacy Into Focus,"Privacy and confidentiality are big-ticket priorities for the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, ethereum-focused consortium launched in February.  The group – which last night announced the addition of 86 more members, including South Korean telecom Samsung and car manufacturer Toyota – took to the stage today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York, detailing the work its various members and working groups are pursuing.  In the words of one panelist: ""Everyone has a very long wish list.""  But it was transaction privacy – currently an unsolved problem with a number of potential solutions – that was a recurring topic over the course of the afternoon.  IC3 co-director Ari Juels perhaps summed up the sentiment best by saying:  “Without confidentiality, we're not reaping the full benefit of the blockchain.”  Maksym Petkus, an engineer for blockchain startup Chronicled, spoke to what he believes should be the next steps on this path.  ""I would like to see privacy moving from off-chain to on-chain maybe using zk-SNARKS. I think this is the way to go,” he said.  He added that optimizing zk-SNARKs to take up less space, as they are a bit roomy in a capacity-constrained blockchain, should be a priority.  Privacy love  The focus on privacy reigned throughout the panels, particularly when participants touched on the various ideas and concepts they're pursuing.  Sandeep Kumar, managing director for Synechron, noted that banks and insurance companies require privacy while keeping some information public in order to comply with KYC laws, for example. This area, Kumar said, is one for which he's seeking solutions.  Many panelists noted that privacy-oriented ideas sprung from private implementations of ethereum's EVM could help with the broader ethereum network, and vice visa, so that the two types of blockchains ultimately feed into each other.  One critical example of this privacy trend is the just-announced partnership between JPMorgan and the company behind Zcash to build zk-SNARKS into Quorum – JPMorgan's private blockchain contribution to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance – to make smart contract execution more private. Like Zcash, Quorum will support both private and public transactions.  That said, you might be thinking, automakers and cellphone manufacturers are a part of it now too? Is the alliance too sprawling in scope to solve specific problems such as privacy?  Yet during the event, one audience member brought up a potential problem: is the alliance too sprawling in scope to tackle specific problems like privacy? The attendee went on to ask what would keep the ethereum alliance together.  Bob Summerwill, lead architect of Enterprise Ethereum for ConsenSys, put his answer bluntly:  ""Because ethereum's a better technology.""

42399891,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5QM,1495485916,Deloitte Joins Blockchain Consortiums Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger,"Professional services giant Deloitte has announced it is joining two of the world's largest blockchain consortiums.  Revealed today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, Deloitte has officially joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, launched in February to promote corporate use of the ethereum blockchain, and the Hyperledger project, the Linux-led umbrella effort that houses various open-source enterprise distributed ledger technologies contributed by members.  Still, in interview, Deloitte principal Eric Piscini framed the news as more of a formalization of existing relationships with both groups.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We've done projects on Hyperledger and ethereum for a long time. What's new to us is we want to be part of those organizations and structure. We want to drive some of the activities in the consortium.""  Although the firm works on proofs-of-concept with corporates around the globe, Piscini remarked that the move wasn't driven by client demand, but rather by a desire for the firm to play a role in shaping how these technologies might be used by businesses.  Further, he stressed the general sentiment prevailing currently in the blockchain community that the entire industry needs to move toward launching projects that demonstrate the real-world utility of the projects.  He said:  ""Our client is not looking for Hyperledger or ethereum. They're looking for something that's working.""

42399906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5cA,1495485914,Over 30: Deloitte Adds 'Mercury' Project to Blockchain Prototypes,"Deloitte has unveiled a new trade finance proof-of-concept, a milestone that helps to bring the total number of blockchain projects in its portfolio to more than 30.  Called Deloitte Mercury, and revealed formally at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York today, the platform uses a blockchain-based infrastructure to explore newer models of credit and funding guarantees, representing and codifying obligations between parties via smart contracts.  Notably, the effort is being positioned by the professional services firm as one that could have the biggest impact on enterprise firms. Already, Deloitte is testing Mercury with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as a slew of partner banks in Asia.  Still, as Deloitte principal Eric Piscini articulated, the idea is to grow the Mercury platform even further, to encompass more participants along the global supply chain.  Piscini told CoinDesk:  ""This is the expansion on that foundation. We need participation in Europe, Asia and to expand the platform.""  In the months ahead, Piscini said Deloitte will be working to send real transactions on the platform, which to date it has not done as part of its work with HKMA. Despite the increasing work on the use case, only a few trade finance trials have yet graduated to this point.  Deloitte believes that adoption is around the corner, however, given that the platform can reduce costs and open up new revenue opportunities.  Elsewhere at Consensus 2017, Deloitte showcased a number of other technical platforms built on blockchain tech, including 'Regchain', a regulatory reporting platform it believes could become a significant tool in its arsenal.  Also demonstrated were technical builds focused on know-your-customer regulations, real estate leasing and mutual fund administration.

42399896,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5VH,1495481550,Consensus 2017: 'The Future Is Here' For Blockchain's Cross-Border Impact,"The use of blockchain to conduct business across international lines has long been seen as a major application for the tech – but where it offers the most benefits is still open to debate.  During a panel on cross-border payments at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference in New York, Sheila James, vice president of operations at blockchain startup Veem, argued that, for this purpose, transparency is blockchain's biggest boon.  ""By using the blockchain, we are able to move money from country A to country B quickly, and give our customers more precise information about their transactions, which is what they are looking for,"" she said.  It's a sentiment shared by a number of proponents in both the blockchain and wider finance space – but not all of the panelists were convinced.  Harry Newman, who serves as global head of banking for Swift, made the pitch that the ability to link disparate databases together was a major benefit, though he went on to dismiss its use for cryptocurrencies.  ""To use distributed ledger technology, we don't need to have this association with a cryptocurrency. I think that is unhelpful,"" he said.  That comment led to another point of contention, raised by Elizabeth Rossiello, founder and CEO of BitPesa, a bitcoin payments startup.  ""The future is here,"" she argued, going on to say:  ""We already have non-central bank currencies floating around and there are going to be more. I see the weakness as this fear of how are we going to get away from something that is not a central bank. There are uses for each kind of thing, and we need to embrace that and use tokens for different part of life. The best ones will rise to the top.""  Streamlining trade  Elsewhere at the conference, another panel discussed blockchain's potential to reduce friction in the cross-border trade process.  Lamar Wilson, founder of blockchain startup Hijro, argued that the trade finance system as it exists today is too archaic, wherein people use email to send spreadsheets and PDFs to manage the different aspects of the process. Blockchain, he went on to posit, would allow companies to share that information more easily.  ""When it comes to information, say you validate an invoice, and you tell everyone this invoice is real, and now that supplier can go to other banks. It is not about sharing an entire book that gives out too much information. It is around the market, but also around information. Information is where the value is,"" he said.  But some felt strongly that bringing disparate parties together was the key to setting the stage for trade finance applications. Lata Varghese, senior partner at IT firm Cognizant, argued that not enough work to build real network effects.  ""What do you put on ledger? Who gets to see what data? Without knowing that, people are afraid to take next step,"" she said. ""The tech works, but we need infrastructure, we need people adopting. Execs may think is a great technology, so why don't we all do the work to bring all this to life?""  Soumak Chatterjee, senior manager at Deloitte, agreed that the tech has lived up to its promise, but aspects like privacy, as well as broader technology standards, remain an issue in his opinion.  ""What is standard trade contract going to look like?"" Chatterjee asked.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPesa and Hijro.

42399909,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5e8,1495480533,131 Countries: BitPay Goes International With Bitcoin Prepaid Visa Card,"BitPay is expanding its prepaid Visa debit card offering to more than 100 new countries.  Unveiled today by BitPay chief commercial officer Sonny Singh at Consensus 2017, the Visa-branded offering enables users to top up its BitPay Prepaid Visa Card with dollars using cryptocurrency, which can then be spent as euros, British pounds or US dollars at merchants around the globe.  ""This will be the first prepaid debit card that will be available in 131 countries,"" BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said in interview.  As such, the announcements marks perhaps the boldest execution on an idea that has been pursued by bitcoin-focused startups since 2014. But while early attempts at executing on the idea were met with setbacks, Pair said its partnership with Visa would ease issues.  Pair continued:  ""This is about as broad as you can go with bitcoin cards. It's really putting the card out into a far-reaching population.""  So far, BitPay reports that 15,000 cards from its domestic product, unveiled last year at Consensus 2016, have been ordered. Further, the startup reported that it has seen growing demand for an international version of the offering since last year.  ""We have a waiting list of over 20,000 people who have asked,"" BitPay marketing and communications manager James Walpole told CoinDesk. ""This provides a lot of value, especially in emerging markets where bitcoin is used for real-world payments.""  Still, the product launch notably come at a time when some projects and startups formerly using the bitcoin blockchain as a payment rail have begun to adopt other solutions due to escalating network fees. (As transaction volumes have grown, the hard-coded limit on block size has effectively created a market for space on the bitcoin ledger).  But while Circle, another payments-focused startup, migrated to a new platform unveiled in December, Pair appeared less interested in this idea, stating that BitPay needs a ""cryptocurrency that is secure, liquid and sufficiently scalable"".  ""We're committed to one blockchain in the long term, but if there's a problem with that network, we'd evaluate some other currency or a fork of the bitcoin blockchain,"" he stated.  Users have to pay the associated bitcoin network transaction fees to load the BitPay Prepaid Visa Card, but the BitPay team stressed the utility of its product and the benefits of cryptocurrency would be enough to override those concerns.  Founded in 2011, BitPay is one of the longest-operating bitcoin startups, having raised just over $30m in three public funding rounds.

42399890,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5NP,1495479642,Nuco Launches Blockchain Beta for TMX Group Natural Gas Exchange,"When the gas goes out in your apartment, chances are someone will pay – the various members of the supply chain that move the gas from the earth to your home can face serious penalties if you're unable to stay warm or cook your food.  Yet, until now, identifying just who was at fault in serving them the appropriate penalty has been a long and tedious manual process that can take weeks to complete. But with today's announcement that blockchain startup Nuco has launched into beta with a partnership with TMX Group in Canada, that time stands to be reduced to just a matter of seconds.  Revealed onstage at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 Conference in New York, the solution is designed to programmatically execute smart contracts between every level of the gas supply chain so breaches can be pinpointed as soon as a block settles.  TMX Group vice president and head of innovation and enterprise delivery, John Lee, described to CoinDesk how Nuco helped his firm translate the terms of various service level agreements (SLAs) that hold providers accountable for lapses into self-executing smart contracts designed to sense when something goes wrong.  He said:  ""They were able to actually take the transaction activity with the commitments and put them on the chain so as soon as that happens you know where the breach is.""  The blockchain solution was custom built for NGX natural gas exchange — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calgary, Canada-based TMX Group — using Nuco's newly revealed modular blockchain solutions.  Inspired by the ethereum blockchain, the beta solution consists of a series of modular offerings, including various plug-and-play consensus mechanisms, throughput capacities and privacy settings.  Modular blockchains  Currently, when a gas outage occurs a combination of automated and manual checks can take as long as 30 days to identify an SLA violation. But with the Nuco solution, now in beta, Lee said that time is cut down to a few seconds.  Since breaches in service are punishable by penalties based on how long the service is out and other criteria, quickly and cheaply identifying the problem means less of the penalty is consumed by the act of identifying the breach.  To give an idea of the potential scope of the project, last year NGX traded almost 1.4m tera-joules of energy on its exchange, but only a sliver of that was in natural gas, making it a good testbed for this early use case.  ""Now if you have each of the actors in place you can see who is adhering to the SLS,"" said Lee, adding:  ""You cut down on the administration and the inevitable penalization because its all being committed to the chain.""  While the solution is not yet production grade, Lee said he's confident the technology is suitable to help manage the gas supply chain. Instead, the biggest obstacle he expects relates to demonstrating the product to regulators and earning their trust.  Nuco beta  Lee first started working with Nuco last year following what he described as an ""elevator pitch"" by Nuco co-founder Matt Spoke.  Following a series of trial-and-error tests on multiple pain points identified by Lee within TMX Group, the companies settled on the natural gas supply chain as most ready to be moved to Nuco's distributed ledger technology.  Previously, Nuco had spent a year building proofs-of-concept for a number of clients, including professional services firm Deloitte, where Spoke previously co-founded the blockchain lab Rubix, and Terepac Corporation, an Internet of Things company.  During these early tests, PoCs were developed using the ethereum blockchain, but with the new suite of modules revealed today, Spoke expects an increase in enterprise firms interested in the solution.  Spoke concluded:  ""We're jumping from a version of ethereum that we've been using from proofs-of-concept to what I'd call a version of Nuco that is designed explicitly for use by enterprises.""

42399897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5UI,1495478754,"One for All? Citi, DTCC and PwC Talk Blockchain Teamwork at Consensus 2017","Enterprise blockchain was on full display at Consensus 2017 in New York City today.  There, leaders from some of the largest and most influential companies gathered on stage to address an audience of blockchain executives and coders alike. From infrastructure provider the DTCC, which conducts quadrillions of dollars worth of transactions each year, to legacy bank Citi, valued at $171bn, an enterprise blockchain track brought together a host of incumbents who have been active playing innovator.  Following shortly on the tail of news that Citi and Nasdaq have been running a live blockchain powered by Chain technology, Ian Lee, head of Citi's Global Lab Network, publicly discussed the importance of collaboration among incumbents.  Lee told the audience:  ""Partnerships have been integral to our strategy from the very beginning. They have accelerated our efforts and helped us bring products to market in a short period of time.""  Lee recounted the history of Citi Venture's blockchain work, which kicked off in 2015 with a partnership with Ideo to help create the Collab idea incubation facility. Lee credited this early move as leading to the business relationships that culminated today.  Yet, Lee put into perspective how this journey was not taken in isolation. He projects the number of blockchain proof-of-concepts has risen to 240 in 2016, up from 56 in 2015. At the same time, he tried to quantify the number of consortia engaged in this work, speculating the number has increased to 25, from just three a few years ago.  Saving money with network effect  Elsewhere, panelists from the DTCC discussed the creation of what they termed ""minimum viable networks"" that could showcase blockchain efficiencies.  In January, the DTCC revealed that IBM was helping build a platform to settle $11tn worth of credit derivatives using technology created by blockchain startup Axoni, and overseen by distributed ledger consortium R3. This is in spite of the fact that IBM, Axoni and R3 all have their own blockchain solutions.  As a result of their ability to work well together, DTCC chief technology architect Rob Palatnick said he expects the solution to go live in the first quarter of 2018, triggering savings for many of the clients actually using the DTCC framework.  Palatnick said:  ""Instead of just taking 25% out of DTCC’s cost, we could take 25% of the entire industry costs.""  Complement not compete  In a twist on the idea of what a minimum viable network might look like, ""Big Four"" accounting firm PwC revealed more details about its work to make cryptocurrencies more palatable for big banks.  Launched in November 2016, PwC's Project Vulcan is also a collaborative effort between a number of startups with little more in common that that they serve complimentary parts of what its leaders believe will help lay the foundation for wide-spread use of cryptocurrencies.  Initially focused on using public blockchains such those that power the bitcoin and ethereum, the collaborators including infrastructure provider Bloq, auditing firm Libra and identity platform Netki, are now working with a bank to build out a private blockchain solution.  Instead of building solutions from scratch for bridging banks and cryptocurrency products, PwC's Robert Allen, the co-founder of Project Vulcan, formally now as Vulcan Digital Asset Services, recommended that the audience to use a ""plug and play"" solution to integrate their existing data into a blockchain.  As such, the presentation served to underscore the theme of the day – startups and enterprises need to work together, both among themselves and with each other.

42399889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5OO,1495477819,IC3 Debuts Upgraded Off-Chain Transaction Protocol 'Teechain',"The Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3) has unveiled a new version of its Teechan off-chain transaction protocol.  First put forward last year, Teechan relies on the utilization of specialized hardware, the Intel SGX, which provides a kind of masking layer for the data it contains. Conceptually, the protocol is similar to the Lightning Network, a proposed transaction layer to bitcoin aimed at creating payment channels – and with them, the potential to enable millions of transactions per second.  It's the promise of huge throughput that has led to projects like Teechan, and the Cornell University-based team behind it is releasing several new changes to the original design, now dubbed ""Teechain"".  Among those upgrades: the ability to direct payments to parties that aren't directly linked via an existing channel.  Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer explained in an email:  ""In the jump from 'teechan' (peer-to-peer TEE-backed payment channels) to 'teechain', we added the ability to route payments along paths. So, the system can now route money along teechan paths from one user to another, even if they are not directly connected. The system guarantees atomicity, namely, that no money will be lost or stuck if there's a failure anywhere along a route while funds are being transferred.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, IC3 – the research effort launched in 2015 with federal funding – has been pursuing a range of blockchain applications, including those that utilize trusted hardware.  The group also recently added asset manager Fidelity to its ranks.

42399910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz5f7,1495476008,ShapeShift Breaks New Ground With 'Prism' Digital Asset Portfolio Product,"Amid a booming market for cryptocurrencies, Swiss startup ShapeShift is launching a new kind of exchange that specializes in the sale of synthetic ethereum assets.  In short, its newest product, Prism, available today in closed beta, is less of an exchange and more a new way to trade cryptocurrencies, enabling users to create custom ""prisms"" by putting ether into a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain that is designed to mimic the price fluctuations of any of the hundreds of available cryptographic assets traded on exchanges.  And that's where ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees believes the company's second product could come to solve problems for traders and investors.  Voorhees told CoinDesk:  ""If you want to get 20 different coins today, you have two ways of doing it. What most people do they make an account at the exchange, they make an account at the exchange and they just leave them there. It causes a huge counterparty risk.""  Still, Voorhees cautioned that Prism isn't meant to be ""all things to all people"", but rather just a product for the growing number of more casual cryptocurrency users who want to gain exposure to certain assets without the risk created when dealing with exchanges.  And that's a valid concern in an industry where exchanges have proven susceptible to hacks, fraud and issues with banking providers that have impaired their operations and cost users money.  With Prism, the user experience changes. Instead of buying a cryptocurrency and keeping those funds on an exchange (or holding the keys in an offline wallet), users put a dollar amount, invest it in ""bitcoin"", ""ether"" and ""monero"" and select the exposure they would like the ""portfolio"" to have relative to the price fluctuations of each asset.  In this case, there is no bitcoin or monero, only ether in a smart contract that changes its value based on data fed to an oracle that receives its prices from traditional exchanges.  ""Now that the Prism has been created, the investor can watch the current value of their portfolio, which will rise and fall with the value of the underlying assets,"" the company stated.  There's also a social component, with the most successful prisms showing up on a leaderboard of where these custom assets are ranked. ""People can see the Prism you made, and they can clone it and make their own portfolio,"" Voorhees said.  In this way, the product is the latest that seeks to capitalize in the run-up of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, which exceeded $60bn for the first time this year, reaching a new all-time high last week.  The basics  Users create Prisms by first putting up a certain amount of collateral (denominated in ether) into a smart contract. (Behind the scenes, a smart contract operated by ShapeShift deploys a smart contract that represents the portfolio.)  Users then fund the address they provide, and for which they responsible for maintaining, keeping the custody of the assets underlying the portfolio.  Finally, users send funds to the address, thereby creating a contract. The result is that the portfolio doesn't even hold ether assets, but rather it tracks contract terms, which are set up to change to track the value of all the assets.  ""A prism portfolio doesn't have a bunch of proxy tokens sitting somewhere, it is simply ethereum as collateral put into the contract by the buyer and ether put into the contract from the seller, and the price can rise and fall,"" he continued.  Still, to create the Prism, another user needs to take the other side of the trade that sets up the account, effectively betting against each investment in the portfolio.  Future versions of the product, Voorhees said, may enable users to enter into such agreements with other users, but to start, ShapeShift will be the counterparty to every transaction, hedging its trades in the background to ensure the integrity of its finances.  ""The simplest explanation is you make a prism of 1 bitcoin, that's the whole prism. It's worth 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift takes the other side of that, so that means ShapeShift is short 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift just buys a bitcoin from someone, then if bitcoin goes up it lost $10 on the prism, but gained $10 on bitcoin, so it's a wash,"" he explained.  In this way, ShapeShift will make its money on closing costs associated with the accounts.  Users will be charged a 2.4% fee to close out Prisms, plus 0.05 ETH (about $6 today), a fee that covers the gas cost the ShapeShift must pay to run the smart contracts on the public ethereum blockchain.  As the Prisms are fully with ether capital, there's also a 1% per month fee paid to cover that cost of capital.  Iterative drive  The product launch also marks an evolution for ShapeShift, originally founded in 2013 as an advancement over traditional order-book exchanges.  Instead of trading, users of the original ShapeShift project swap between cryptocurrencies, a process that occurs without the need for account creation or management, reducing trust in the service, and as long argued by Voorhees, creating a value proposition in line with the spirit of decentralized economic networks.  Still, Voorhees appears to already be thinking ahead to the next step.  In conversation, he mentions how the technology exists for users to take their Prism and issue tokens on the ethereum blockchain representing shares in that Prism.  ""There's no block on someone doing that,"" he said.  Voorhees has even gone so far as to conceptualize a time when regulated firms may even use a white-label version of the service, or a similar type of technology, for the more traditional financial assets that are well-known by Wall Street.  When broaching the subject, I even float the idea, speculating it could as far as 20 years into the future, should the technology mature sufficiently.  Voorhees concluded:  ""Well, more like in five years, but I don't want to get into that too much.""

Centered on a two-year debate focusing on the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network, global discussion on the issue has so far passed through a few phases with varying proposals to increase the throughput of the system being put forward along the way.  Most recently, investment firm Digital Currency Group advanced a proposal that would see the Segregated Witness upgrade activate and start a countdown to a 2MB block size increase – though, a similar idea has been proposed and rejected by developers before.  As this debate has been raging for a couple of years now, members of the scaling panel were quick to note their frustration.  Payment processor BitPay, for one, has been toying with different options in search of a solution, a path that has included the exploration of alternative implementations. Stephen Pair, the company's CEO, went as far as to call for a fork that would end in two bitcoins.  Pair said:  ""It's not working for us. The first option is to use a fork of bitcoin, second option is to use a fork of bitcoin, third option is to use a fork of bitcoin. We don't have any other option right now.""  ""Long-term we need one chain that's liquid and secure. But for a while we might run two versions of bitcoin to see which one works out,"" he added later, arguing that the market should decide which version ultimately prevails.  Not everyone agreed that this is the best way forward.  ""Nobody that I've talked to wants chain to split. I don't think there will be,"" said Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, another bitcoin client that has been the center of the bitcoin debate for the past year or so.  The DCG proposal was also raised during the panel, with Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo calling the proposal a ""logistics nightmare"" – but chatter on that subject was quickly derailed.  Other options?  In a way, the panel showcased the many dimensions of the debate. Much of the discussion that took place centered on what role users on the bitcoin network play.  One of the more recent developments in the scaling debate is a proposed effort known as a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF), a mechanism that has been used in the past to push through a particular type of critical change to bitcoin (known as the ""consensus level""). Yet it didn't see much of the limelight until an unknown developer posted the idea as an alternative to the current mechanism, which requires near-universal support among miners.  Advocates have been advancing the concept as a way to push SegWit across the finish line. It's not a change mechanism that everyone agree is safe, but some on the panel seemed open to the idea.  In fact, Lombrozo put on a UASF hat several minutes into the panel.  ""We don't have to stay on the same chain. That's the freedom and the right that everyone has. Including the user-activated soft fork. I would never say that you can't do that,"" Pair said, agreeing that users have options.  Still, the panel itself demonstrated how the debate has grown even more complex over time, with alternative implementations like Unlimited and Bcoin seeking a path forward. Bcoin is an alternative client that tries to solve the debate with an experimental technology that would effectively allow users to choose their own block size.  Purse CEO Andrew Lee posited that Bcoin is a way to help diversify the community of developers in the bitcoin sphere, which he believes has been monopolized by one implementation, Bitcoin Core.  Despite all the new developments and proposals, though, moderator Jameson Lopp argued that users should expect this kind of debate for the long haul, concluding:  ""This is a debate that in my opinion will probably never end.""

42399881,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1xs,1495472405,Toyota's R&D Division is Building a Blockchain Consortium,"Toyota Research Institute (TRI) is going big with a bold blockchain strategy.  Announced today at Consensus 2017, TRI is revealing a series of notable partnerships and publishing an expansive overview for its vision for how blockchain tech could move the automotive giant into the future. Already, TRI is working with MIT Media Lab to explore how blockchain could impact the exchange of automobile data and even power a future generation of autonomous vehicles.  TRI's startup partners include BigchainDB, Oaken Innovations, Commuterz and Gem, each of which is working with the Toyota Motor North America subsidiary to explore a different potential use case for the emerging technology.  Why it matters: While startups have been working on Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with its connection to Toyota Motors, TRI is emerging as a potentially significant backer.  Further, given the reach of its brand, TRI could be the right champion to form a consortium for the industry. Already, similar efforts have emerged in the IoT and insurance sectors, where dozens of incumbents have committed to invest in furthering tech R&D.  The announcement also does much to position blockchain as a potential driver of the larger movement to autonomous vehicles – giving clout to the theory that gas-powered vehicles could come to function like wallets on a blockchain, capable of receiving and carrying out complex instructions.  Neha Narula, director of Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab, said in a statement:  ""Our hope is that other industry stakeholders will join this effort to bring safe and reliable autonomous vehicles one step closer to reality.""  The strategy: Of equal interest is the specificity of the strategy as outlined by TRI – the company said it believes blockchain could come to impact three areas – data sharing, ride-sharing transactions and user-based insurance.  Further, it provided detail about its goals in each area and the partnerships that are helping it enhance its ideas.  – Data sharing:As put forward by Ballinger, blockchain could come to serve as the basis for new way to transact data – a problem he identified as essential for automation in the auto industry.  ""Blockchains and distributed ledgers may enable pooling data from vehicle owners, fleet managers, and manufacturers to shorten the time for reaching this goal, thereby bringing forward the safety, efficiency and convenience benefits of autonomous driving technology,"" said Ballinger.  In this way, TRI positioned the tech as one that would connect the varied onboard sensors used today by vehicles, while making true ownership by consumers possible. Partner BigchainDB is now building a data exchange for driver data sharing as part of its work with TRI.  – Car sharing: Also envisioned is how blockchain could make cars more monetizable. TRI projects that its use could help its vehicles provide more value to owners, by enabling seats, trunk space and other unused, but potentially valuable, resources be monetized.  ""The blockchain can store data about the vehicle’s usage and information about vehicle owners, drivers and passengers,"" the company said.  Here, TRI is working with Oaken Innovations – a finalist in CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 startup competition – and Israel-based Commuterz to deliver a peer-to-peer application for car sharing that could one day enable this possibility.  – Usage-based insurance:Last, but not least, TRI is envisioning how blockchain could help users save money on insurance rates, working with startup Gem on this specific area of research.  ""By allowing the vehicle’s sensors to collect driving data and store it in a blockchain, vehicle owners may be eligible to further lower their insurance costs by giving their insurance companies increased transparency to reduce fraud plus granting them access to driving data to measure safe driving habits,"" the company wrote.  The idea fits within the broader narrative of opportunities for blockchain in the insurance sector.

42399885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1zq,1495472372,"RSK Raises $3.5 Million, Launches Bitcoin Smart Contract Testnet","Bitcoin, long recognized for its stability and security, tends to falls short when it comes to newer innovations. Meanwhile, smart contracts platform ethereum is drawing increasingly more attention.  But what if you could combine those two networks and come up with the best of both worlds? That is what blockchain startup RSK Labs has long sought to do.  The company’s blockchain solution, RSK (or Rootstock), aims to draw on the strengths of the bitcoin network, while bringing new options, like flexible smart contracts, into the picture.  A little more than a year ago, the Buenos Aires-based company received $1m in seed funding to create a functioning testnet. But, to move forward with its technical plans, more cash was needed.    Development funds        To that end, RSK Labs announced today at Consensus 2017, that it has received an additional $3.5m in pre-Series A funding.  This latest round comes in the form of contributions from a long list of supporters, including, Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Decentral and Jaxx, and bitcoin mining firms such as Bitfury and Bitmain.  According to RSK executives, the company plans to put that money toward R&D, increasing the network's security and deploying a mainnet in a few months. Also during Consensus, the company announced that it will be opening its production testnet (called Ginger) to the public, so that more users can begin building and testing out their own smart contracts on the platform.  Gabriel Kurman, co-founder of RSK, told CoinDesk:  ""More than 40 companies are currently testing Ginger, including banks, corporations and startups from all around the world. But once we open the code to the world, we expect hundreds of companies – and partners – to start testing the platform, which, until now, was closed.""  Added features  At this point, you're probably wondering how the platform works.  Put simply, RSK is a two-way pegged sidechain that grafts smart contract functionality onto the bitcoin network. It also introduces an off-chain protocol for claimed ""near-instant"" payments.  As an idea, sidechains were originally put forth in a proposal by cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back and others in 2014 as a bid to extend the functions of bitcoin.  That proposal came at a time when many were frustrated with bitcoin’s inability to keep up with newer innovations.  So, as a sidechain, RSK is an independent blockchain. However, it does not have its own token, relying instead on bitcoin for its currency.  RSK does this by pegging, or matching, its smart token to bitcoin, so that the value of an RSK token is exactly that of a bitcoin. Also, users (and this is the 'two-way' part) can freely move their tokens back and forth between the two chains.  Essentially, a user's bitcoin goes into a type of reserve where it is locked up, and then used to back the RSK token, known as smartBTC. You can think of it as putting your bitcoin into a checking account, and then using the RSK network to spend that money.  Smarter chain  But RSK goes further than simply giving users a new set of tokens to spend – it also adds smart contract capabilities to bitcoin.  Bitcoin already allows users to create simple smart contracts, like multisig, which requires two or more users to sign off on a payment before it can be released. But RSK takes that to another level, with Turing-complete smart contract capabilities that go head-to-head with ethereum's offerings.  RSK also addresses another short coming of the bitcoin network: its ability to scale.  According to the company's website, RSK currently achieves 400 payment transactions per second, compared to bitcoin, which only handles only around seven.  However, the goal is to eventually push that to 2,000 transactions per second using a second layer technology, which the company calls Lumino. Outlined in this white paper, the Lumino Network is an off-chain payment system that relies a protocol known as the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP).  Lumino is touted as being similar to the Lightning Network, a popular scaling solution originally designed for bitcoin, currently being tested on litecoin.  Twin challenges  Moving forward, the company faces two main challenges.  One is how it will peg its token to the bitcoin blockchain. Tether, another sidechain company, made news earlier this year when it lost its peg to the US dollar, creating a large price spread between exchanges that quote actual dollars and those that quote tether tokens.  So, RSK will need to prove to the community that it can hold onto its peg and not undermine the value of its token.  Securing the network is another issue.  In order for the RSK chain to be secure, a majority of bitcoin miners need to 'merge mine' the chain. And that requires the permission and active assistance of 50% of all the bitcoin mining pools.  Merge mining is a technology that allows a miner to mine more than one blockchain at a time. The miner’s computing power contributes to the total hashrate of both cryptocurrencies, and the miner gains block rewards for both networks.  According to RSK, its network is currently supported by bitcoin miners representing more than 55% of bitcoin's total hashing power. In addition, the company claims that more miners, accounting for 30% of the hashrate, have expressed their support for RSK and will start merge mining within the next few months.  If RSK can overcome those challenges, it stands to introduce some much-needed features to bitcoin, as well as help build a worthy alternative to the ethereum virtual machine.

42399877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1tw,1495466939,Consensus 2017: IBM Thinks Blockchain Could Save Shipping Industry 'Billions',"Blockchain technology is poised to recover billions of dollars lost to coordination costs in both capital markets and the shipping industry, according to Arvind Krishna, the director of research at IBM.  Krishna argued this point during a presentation at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Among other projects, Krishna described a partnership with Maersk, a Danish transport company, which he says will cut costs by streamlining the checks that shipping companies are required to go through as they transport goods across international borders.  A typical shipment, according to Krishna, must pass the scrutiny of about 30 organizations during its circuitous journey to the market. Every hold up in this process nicks dollars off the profitability of the product.  ""A single piece of paper, if it's missing when it arrives in Rotterdam, means that a container full of avocados just sits there. A few days extra of sitting there and you've got to throw out the whole container because you've crossed the limit of how long those goods can sit there without being considered spoiled,"" said Krishna.  Blockchains, he went on to say, are an ideal platform for aggregating and transmitting the certifications required at each step along the way and could shave twenty percent of the cost from international shipping.  ""We believe that just doing this kind of digitization can result in tens of billions of dollars saved across that network,"" he said.  Arvind also touted blockchains as a solution for verifying that diamonds originate from conflict-free zones and mentioned that Walmart is looking into the technology as a way to track and verify organic products. He further argued for the potential to cut coordination costs in capital markets by using blockchains as a common ledger for finalizing settlements in derivatives markets.  The struggle, according to Krishna, will be to craft blockchain applications in a way that is intuitive to people outside the enthusiast bubble. Increasing usability will be key, he argued.  ""Making it scalable, making it easy, making it possible for a lot more people to adopt the technology is where a lot of technologies and companies flounder,"" says Krishna.

Revealed today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference, the China-based e-commerce giant is reportedly collaborating with New Zealand dairy cooperative Fonterra, vitamin and supplement supplier Blackmores, as well as Australian Post and New Zealand Post on an effort to reduce fraud in the food supply chain.  The project was discussed in a talk by PwC's Digital Asset Services (DAS) division (first announced last November as a project called Vulcan), part of an effort to help enterprise businesses become more comfortable with advances in open, public blockchain protocols.  In interview, DAS founder Robert Allen explained that regional food safety is a focus area for PwC Australia and his team are helping advise the consortium with expertise developed within the DAS business.  Allen told CoinDesk:  ""We're looking at the use of blockchain from a requirements perspective. A lot of other supply chain trials are provenance based, but we're looking at it more from a protocol perspective to achieve end-to-end safety of the project.""  The work is an extension of DAS's earlier work to help enterprises launch digital assets, one that showcases how its architecture – designed in partnership with startups Bloq, Libra and Netki – can be flexible enough to satisfy multiple types of use cases.  ""What we're demonstrating is that the Vulcan-type layer actually is as applicable to one set of use cases as another,"" he said. ""We're finding we are able to apply it to remittance as much as supply chain.""      Allen said the project will be run over the next 13 weeks, with consortium teams working together on the trust framework, functional requirements and a technical proof of concept.

42399884,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz21o,1495466158,"Consensus 2017: EU, India Governments See Path to Global Blockchain Adoption","Speakers during the opening panel of Consensus 2017 agreed that blockchain is set to go global – but differed on how, exactly, the technology will get to that point.  Vincent Wang, chief innovation officer for China Wanxiang Group, argued that the path to success means reaching out to the businesses and industries that haven't yet begun any kind of meaningful experimentation.  ""If blockchain is to take off, which I believe it will, we need to address the silent majority that does not often speak up, that is the industries who will see value,"" he said.  He advocated that startups working with the tech aim for bold solutions that only blockchain can bring – while at the same time calling for new companies to work more closely with local regulators. Wanxiang launched its own startup accelerator, focused on applications like connected devices and next-generation cities, in March.  ""It is about harvesting the vast value that in many cases is enabled by blockchain only,"" he stressed.  Not everyone on the panel shared that view about regulation. Nick Giurietto, CEO of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), argued that reducing regulatory barriers would spur further adoption.  ""Investments decisions won't be made in an environment where there is regulatory uncertainly,"" he argued, adding that the traditionally slow process of updating regulations produces additional barriers.  Working together  Collaboration was a major theme during the panel, with participants discussing the approaches taken by governments and regulatory changes – and how they need to come around to the idea that they cannot act alone.  N.T. Arunkumar, special representative for IT & Innovation for the government of Andhra Pradesh, a state in India, said that opening up communication across borders is key.  ""There needs to be more cross-border orchestration,"" he said, going to add: ""We definitely believe after the internet, this is the next big thing that will change every aspect of person's life.""  Yet that change is likely to take time – a point recognized by the panelists.  ""China is known for strategic patience when it is known for economic polices,"" said Wang, voicing his belief that China's interest in blockchain isn't going anywhere soon.

42399870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1n3,1495465161,"DCG Signs Up IBM, MasterCard And More For Enterprise Blockchain Effort","Digital Currency Group (DCG) is getting into the enterprise blockchain game.  Announced today at Consensus 2017, the investment conglomerate (and CoinDesk parent entity) is launching DCG Connect, a fourth subsidiary that will seek to help select corporate partners leverage the insights and technology of industry startups.  Initial founding partners include Amazon Web Services, CME Group, Foxconn, IBM, Mastercard, New York Life, Prudential and Transamerica.  As explained by DCG director of development Meltem Demirors, the offer will differ from DCG's portfolio strategy (to date, largely focused on public blockchain startups) by creating a ""multi-vendor, brand-neutral"" marketplace that will open blockchain protocols like bitcoin, ethereum and ripple alongside permissioned versions from Hyperledger Fabric, Chain, R3 and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  In this way, Demirors, a sometimes vocal critic of enterprise blockchains, said the project will also enable enterprise firms to hear a more skeptical or analytical view of enterprise-facing blockchain technologies.  Demirors told CoinDesk:  ""Our view is that whatever gets people more familiar, more comfortable with a more distributed, open ledger, experimenting with this technology, then so be it. It's our jobs to be critical and analytical and not get caught up in the magical thinking.""  ""We're not committed just to working with one specific technology protocol,"" she added.  Shaping strategies  Demirors went on to contrast this approach to other consortium efforts, which she characterized as having developed, mostly around vendor-specific blockchain technology implementations, framing startups as better suited to the launch live projects using any derivative of the technology.  ""There are use case specific points, there [are] Hyperledger, R3 and other projects, but there isn't really a neutral aggregation point. In a way, DCG has already been filling that role, and we saw an opportunity to extend that to create something new,"" she said.  For startups, Demirors said DCG Connect would be opt-in, meaning firms (both in the portfolio and external to it) that want to help shape business strategies of enterprise companies would voluntarily provide information on their products so that DCG can distill best practices and take on the burden of educating enterprises that are more green on the technology.  ""DCG Connect will work with companies to build blueprints for how platforms, products and technologies can fit together to create enterprise-ready solutions for deployment,"" DCG said in its release.  In turn, Demirors said startups will be able to more actively focus on building products, while being selectively paired with more serious enterprise firms. ""Startups were getting hit with this wave of blockchain tourism,"" she said, explaining what drove the creation of DCG Connect.  In a sense, the project isn't dissimilar from efforts underway at major enterprise firms such as IBM, which have also moved to streamline services by more selectively working with corporates intent on launching live projects. For example, last week, IBM debuted its IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator, which moved its strategy toward that goal.  Going forward, Demirors said that DCG Connect will focus on projects that aim to help enterprises understand the industry, offering ecosystem maps, events and other networking opportunities, concluding:  ""We're highly leveraged in this industry and we have a profound interest in helping all digital asset companies grow and succeed.""

42399886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz20p,1495459128,JPMorgan Partners With Zcash on Blockchain Security,"The largest bank in the world has partnered with the makers of zcash to provide a new layer of privacy to the users of its enterprise-grade blockchain.  Revealed onstage today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017, JPMorgan and the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company are now in the process of integrating ZSL, a zero-knowledge security layer designed to securely – and anonymously – settle transactions on the blockchain that were previously conducted elsewhere.  While the zero-knowledge security layer is crucial to the anonymous transactions enabled in the zcash cryptocurrency, the technology itself was designed to let a wide range of networks securely settle the movements of digital assets.  But JPMorgan's implementation of ZSL marks the first time the technology is being formally adopted by a distributed ledger platform as part of its ethereum-based Quorum project.  Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox said that the tech integration could lead to major growth in the kinds of assets that can be utilized, with JPMorgan's open-source blockchain as a basis.  Wilcox said:  ""It's the same thing that we've deployed in the zcash cryptocurrency. We're fitting that on top of Quorum, and it's providing the same kind of security for Quorum that it provides for zcash.""  Though Quorum already lets enterprises execute privacy-oriented smart contracts, the new zero-knowledge security feature is designed to extend the actual settlement of those transactions onto the blockchain itself.  Similarly to how SSL was invented to provide a new layer of security on top of the public-facing HTTP in the early days of the internet, ZSL provides a degree of anonymity beneath the more public features of a blockchain.  But the heightened anonymity comes with a volume button of sorts – similar to the functionality of the zcash token – letting corporate policy makers give authorized individuals, regulators and investigators varying degrees of access to the underlying data.  ""The cryptographic and software engineering engine that implements secure transfer of ZEC tokens on the open blockchain is basically the same technology that implements the secure transfer of these digitized assets on an enterprise blockchain,"" said Wilcox.  Quorum evolution  Not that long ago, the idea that JPMorgan might integrate technology developed explicitly for a cryptocurrency would have seemed far-fetched.  Back in November 2015, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ruffled some feathers in the blockchain community when he publicly stated that ""no government"" would tolerate a cryptocurrency that is designed to evade government control. But in the same speech, he expressed interest in distributed ledger technology for its potential applications in the finance space.  Since then, the bank, valued at $300bn, has become a leader in the blockchain space, first with Juno, an early experiment with the technology unveiled at a Hyperledger meeting last March.  By October, the project had evolved into Quorum, an enterprise-grade blockchain designed specifically to let large financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements, especially on the privacy protection front.  This year has been a breakout year for the bank, which has seen Quorum accepted into Microsoft Azure's blockchain-as-a-service platform. The bank formally departed the R3 distributed ledger consortium to make a go of it as a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which the Zcash team formally joined earlier today.  ""By adding the Zero-knowledge Security Layer into Quorum,"" said Suresh Shetty, JPMorgan's lead architect at its Blockchain Center of Excellence in a statement. ""We are able to explore how state of the art cryptographic privacy technology will enhance the next generation of financial services applications.""

CoinDesk Research authors a quarterly industry overview report that summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors.  The full 'Q1 2017 State of Blockchain' report, which expands on much of the material presented below, will be published shortly after Consensus.      CoinDesk    It's been an eventful 2017 so far in the blockchain space.  Public protocols have gained over $40bn in market cap, enterprise consortia have formed and flourished, and the push towards interoperability can be seen across the ecosystem.  Regulation has shifted the composition of global trading volume, the usage of the industry's own investment structure continues to gain steam, and the amount and quality of traditional financial and technology giants getting involved in blockchain has never been higher.  CoinDesk Research also recently tapped into the community to gain more intimate insights into the perception and sentiment around bitcoin and ethereum and garnered north of 1,100 responses.  Below, we highlight some of the largest takeaways from the presentation:  Bitcoin averaged 287,000 transactions per day at fees averaging $0.62 each, leading 67% of the surveyed community to say they feel 'bad' about the current state of transaction fees and confirmation times  More people now view bitcoin as a 'digital gold' than a 'digital currency' and 86% of the community believes ethereum can be used just as well as a medium exchange or payment method  47% believe we will see a contentious hard fork of bitcoin, and rather than preferring SegWit or a block-size increase, more individuals believe some combination of solutions is the best short-term scaling solution  The majority of the community believes we will see the Lightning Network live on bitcoin, and both Raiden and proof-of-stake live on ethereum in 2018  The overall state of bitcoin is nearly exactly split between positive and negative responses, while less than 5% of people responded negatively to the current state of ethereum  Despite Hyperledger's multiple open-source frameworks, live proof of concepts, 130 plus member list and backing by the Linux Foundation, 87% of people have slight to no knowledge of the group  Enterprise Ethereum Alliance launching in February was seen as the primary price driver of ether in Q1  [optin-monster-shortcode id=""riuyojisrlntqyiu""]  Image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,Alex Sunnarborg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/05/22/coindesk-previews-new-state-of-blockchain-at-consensus-2017,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23d2bb277ee9a0a56d4aadff5a5121b9034625b1-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The startup revealed today that it is releasing an Asset Issuance and Custody toolkit that enables the creation of new tokens, utilizing protocols such as 'colored coins' (to build an ICO backed by bitcoin) or ERC-20 for ethereum-based launches.  Akin to the firm's white-label exchange software service, the new product provides a host of pre- and post-launch services for ICOs, including the creation of block explorers, community reporting and integration support for third-party exchanges  AlphaPoint founder Joe Ventura said that his startup (which raised $1.35m in 2014 to fuel its efforts) is making the move due to the growing interest in the ICO model among blockchain startups and entrepreneurs.  ""ICOs create a new source of funding to drive faster innovation for blockchain projects. We are building the technology platform to support those initiatives,"" Ventura, who serves as both CEO and CTO of the startup, said of the launch.  That AlphaPoint would enter the market for ICOs is perhaps unsurprising, given its past white-label product launches. The news comes as an increasing number of projects tap the ICO model to raise capital, a state of affairs that is disrupting the way traditional VCs interact with startups.

42399878,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1sx,1495454404,"Healthcare IT Firm Joins Hyperledger Blockchain Project, Codebases Activated","The Linux-led Hyperledger project today took several new steps toward its goal of creating enterprise-grade blockchain solutions for enterprise.  The consortium was joined by its first US healthcare IT firm, Change Healthcare, and graduated two of its code bases, Intel's Sawtooth Lake and blockchain startup Soramitsu's Iroha, into active status.  The moves come just months after Change Healthcare merged with the IT unit of the McKesson Corporation, a Fortune Global 500 pharmaceuticals firm. Further, the new frameworks join Hyperledger Fabric, developed by IBM, as the only graduates to reach active status at the consortium.  Hyperledger, an open-source consortium effort, began exploring healthcare applications not long after its formation in late 2015, tapping members such as managed care consortium Kaiser Permanente and blockchain startups like Gem and Hashed Health to form a working group focused on the industry last October.  According to Change Healthcare, the focus on technology solutions for the healthcare space factored into the decision to link up with Hyperledger.  Aaron Symanski, the firm's CTO, said in a statement:  ""Blockchain is a promising and exciting new technology for secure online transactions. But it’s crucial that healthcare leaders step up to champion innovation to help take blockchain from its early implementations to tomorrow’s healthcare IT solutions.""  As part of its entry to the consortium, Symanski will take a seat on its governing board.  ""Their expertise and global reach is sure to be a huge asset as we continue to bring the community together to advance open blockchain tools and services for healthcare and various other industries,"" said Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger’s executive director.

42399868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1k6,1495454403,It's Happening? Blockstream Opens 'Liquid' Sidechain in Beta,"Bitcoin startup Blockstream's first sidechain, dubbed Liquid, is now launching in beta.  The release marks the first time that the sidechain (announced in late 2015) will move out of the testing sphere and onto the real bitcoin network. Blockstream is demoing the sidechain at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference this week.  Liquid is a private blockchain. This means that, similar to other private blockchains being built today, there is some control over who can send transactions. This sets it apart from open systems, such as bitcoin or ethereum, that any user can join.  However, instead of being a self-contained system like some other private blockchains, Liquid is designed as a layer that sits on top of the bitcoin blockchain. The movement of bitcoin is basically on another layer within the sidechain, but users and companies have control over their funds since they're tied to the bitcoin asset.  The main idea behind Liquid is to help companies, such as exchanges, move big sums of bitcoin around – and quickly. More than 10 companies, including major bitcoin exchanges, have been testing the technology in production since April.  Blockstream CSO Samson Mow told CoinDesk:  ""With our updated roadmap, I think the value proposition to exchanges is immense: instant transactions, improved privacy, and the ability allow their users to hold Liquid funds off exchange.""  He added that Blockstream is talking with other bitcoin exchanges that are interested in signing up.  Further, some amount of privacy is built into Liquid by the use of 'confidential transactions' – another technique pioneered by Blockstream developers. In this case, balances are shielded from non-participants in a transaction.  Of course, most bitcoin users are more interested in the trustless version of the technology, where users can send their bitcoin to another sidechain without any third party overseeing the swap.

42399879,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1vu,1495443633,Banks Offering Cryptocurrency Services? A New Reality Is Arriving,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.    ***    Bitcoin might finally be overlapping the broader fintech industry's popularity.  Norway's largest online-only bank, Skandiabanken recently announced it plans to offer clients the ability to link bank accounts to cryptocurrency holdings.  While some might see this move as one of traditional banks embracing bitcoin, really, it heralds a new shift in the evolution of cryptocurrency into the greater fintech space.  Skandiabanken announced its intentions this week to let users connect a bank account with a Coinbase account, allowing users to view their cryptocurrency balances within the banking app.  The app allows users to view their holdings, just as they would other investments, and, for now, the functionality does not include the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The bank has stressed it does not yet view bitcoin as a currency, but instead another asset class.  This is likely the beginning of a trend that sees bitcoin merge with broader fintech trends of offering customers innovative, if not niche services.  Unbundling banking  Around the world, mobile banking is taking a lead over branch-centered activity – in Norway, for example, 91% of the population access online banking sites.  The proliferation of fintech services that ‘unbundle’ traditional banking functions, combined with the maturing of the internet-first generation, are accelerating this trend.  What’s more, the European Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) activates in 2018. The directive mandates that banks have to share customer data with third parties through APIs, which could include access to cryptocurrency services.  So, the combination of online banking, fintech services and open APIs point to a blurring of boundaries between traditional and alternative finance.  New banking institutions such as Skandiabanken, are taking steps towards accepting bitcoin and its altcoins as credible assets. Should this trend continue, cryptocurrencies could end up becoming a more firmly consolidated feature of the new fintech landscape.  This will place even more pressure on legislators to come up with comprehensive plans for regulating a new asset class.  It is also likely to encourage development of the next generation of cryptocurrency-related services.  And while this doesn't mean that bitcoin and similar assets are becoming mainstream, it shows that financial disruptors can start to change a narrative that's been stagnant for decades, and that cryptocurrency is here to stay in the large fintech ecosystem.

Black boxes have long been used to collect critical data during crashes and accidents, as explained Samuel Brooks, one of the team members, during BlockBox's presentation. But the team wanted to expand that idea to drones and smart cars.  ""We couldn't crash cars in here, but we could crash drones,"" said team member Nick Addison during the presentation, talking through how Node.js, ethereum, Truffle, and Microsoft Azure were used to build the app. The event took place at NYC’s Rockefeller Center.  The drone ""crash"" triggered event details which were fed into an ethereum smart contract. The smart contract showed the exact location of the hackathon – i.e., where the ""crash"" took place.  The team also included contributors Tim Bass, Yiseul Cho, William E. Bodell III, and Lucas Cullen, most of whom hailed from Australia. They joked that, during the two-day event, a few of them took naps due to some persistent jet lag.  The Consensus 2017 hackathon saw the work of developers, designers, and other contributors in professional services firm Deloitte’s 40th floor office. A total of 25 projects were created over the weekend – giving participants roughly 30 hours in total – amidst the backdrop of Manhattan and the Empire State Building.  Many contributors chose to tie blockchain with a mix of other up-and-coming technologies. Connected devices, artificial intelligence and microinsurance were just a few of the buzzwords invoked during the event.  Hackathon judges included Deloitte global blockchain leader Eric Piscini, CME Group blockchain lead Sandra Ro, Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf, IBM's Gary Singh, Microsoft Azure's Cale Teeter, Swiss Re microinsurance specialist Paula Pagniez, ViewFin founder Eric Gu, and Wanxiang's Rongge Luo.  There were many other ethereum projects presented, in addition to the apps that CoinDesk covered on Saturday.  To name just a few, Ethereum Remittance Network aims to send ether across borders; Ceremony is a smart city protocol using ethereum's proof-of-authority; Akiles is a decentralized app that seeks to boost government transparency with the help of tech developed by startup BlockApps.  Others tapped a mix of different protocols. Microinsurance.io built an entirely new privacy-minded protocol over ethereum, Tendermint, and decentralized file-sharing protocol IPFS.  ""This can be used for smart cities and everything else,"" developer Michael Smolenski said.  The event also drew some developers who are relatively new to the blockchain space.  Team members from Dewmast – a project for warehouses that gather data with sensors – mentioned that they've been working with blockchain protocols for just two weeks. Their interest paid off, winning ethereum startup Consensys's prize, which includes entry to an upcoming blockchain bootcamp.
