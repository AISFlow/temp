42397242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Rb,1379437218,Bitcoin mining difficulty soars as hashing power nudges 1 Petahash,"The hash rate of the bitcoin network has exceeded (or is very close to) 1 Petahash per second (PH/s), according to various charts online.  TradeBlock, which runs its own mining dashboard, reported that the computational power on the bitcoin network exceeded 1,000,000GH/sec over the weekend. As of last night, it was showing that the hash rate had crept down again to just under 914,000GH/s (914TH/s).  Blockchain.info had a lower estimate, suggesting a hash rate of a little under 950TH/s last night, while Bitwisdom put it at 955TH/s at the time of writing. Bitcoincharts had it at less - around 847.25TH/s (dropping to 802 by the time we finished writing). This in-depth chart set the hash rate's upper boundary at 881.7TH/s on Sunday.  All of these charts show two things: firstly, how difficult it is to arrive at an exact consensus of performance on a highly decentralised network of autonomous devices. And secondly, how quickly the hash rate can fluctuate.  While 1PH/s is a psychologically significant number, the important thing is the general upward trend of network hashing power, which has accelerated at breakneck speed. TGB’s mining dashboard shows the hash rate soaring through 420-440TH/s a month ago, and continuing to rise.  It can’t go on forever, says Tuur Demeester, editor of economic newsletter Macrotrends, who has also been handling PR for ASIC mining firm CoinTerra during its launch. He said:  “The first ASICs, which came out last year, were using ancient technology (+100nm transistor chips). The reason why the network difficulty is going up so fast, is that we are catching up with present day technology: 28nm is pretty much the industry standard.""  The question worrying most people who are still waiting for their miners is what the increasing hash rate will do to network difficulty.  “It's a crap shoot,” said Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Network. The network difficulty doesn't change in a linear fashion. Instead it increases in a single jump every time 2,016 blocks have been mined.  “They want six blocks per hour, or 2,016 every two weeks,” he says of the core development team that manages the Bitcoin protocol. “But we have seen blocks produced every five minutes.” This happens when the difficulty adjustment consistently lags the increase in network hash rate.  We saw network difficulty more than double in August, reaching 65,750. On Sunday 15th September, it leaped again, rising to 112,600,000.  Sam Cole, co-founder of CoinTerra competitor KnCMiner, argues that this can't continue forever. He said:  “Mathematically, for it to continue rising like this is nigh-on impossible. For network difficulty to double there has to be a doubling in hashing on the network.”  He says this because network difficulty is calculated based on the amount of time that it took to solve the last 2,016 blocks (also here). To halve the time taken to solve those blocks means adding the same amount of hashing power to the network again.  That’s fine when you’re increasing the total hash rate from 500TH/s to 1PH/s, or even to 2PH/s, he says. “But to jump to 20 to 40PH/s, I have to release 10,000 boxes. You can’t do that in two weeks. So it can't double this often forever, because there isn’t that much manufacturing in the world dedicated to ASICs.”  This means that while we’re seeing huge increases in difficulty now, we can expect to see it slow over time, say experts. But when?  “Its almost impossible to predict more than a month or two into the future,” said Cole. “We have simulations where all competition ships, and we have simulations where half of them ship. The numbers vary way too much, and long-term approaches are very varied to say the least.”  But we do know that large amounts of hashing capacity are due to hit the market in the next couple of months. Websites are littered with stories of how much hashing capacity people expect to ship. KnCMiner was originally looking at 450TH/s by the end of next month, and that figure may have grown (Cole isn’t saying).  CoinTerra expects to ship 2PH/s of ASICs in December, which would triple the current network hash rate. Bitmine reckons it’ll drop 4PH/s onto the network by March. Then, there's BitFury, and Alydian, which hopes to offer up to 1PH/s in single blocks to bit-ticket miners as of next month. All of this would push network difficulty substantially at least through the end of the year, and probably early into next.  There are unknown variables, however. For example, it's possible that people could turn off significant amounts of computing power between them for various reasons. If prices drop substantially, and people are spending expensive energy mining bitcoins, it may make sense to stop doing so until prices rise again, for example. That is a distinct possibility, because the bitcoin market is still relatively volatile thanks to a need for more liquidity.  One thing is pretty certain, said Demeester: GPU miners at this point are basically running their cards for nothing, at least on the bitcoin network. He explained:  “GPU mining is no longer profitable. We are seeing a switch happen to Scrypt-based coins. But also in that sphere I know of specialized software and hardware initiatives that will make life hard for GPU mining in the future.”  Perhaps he is speaking of FPGA miners, which some are configuring to mine Scrypt-based coins. KnCMiner is planning one of these.  To confuse matters, it isn't just the number of ASIC mining units being shipped that affects hashing power; it's also how well these units perform. 28nm ASICs may be the new 'norm' this month, but things are moving quickly, and sub-20nm is just round the corner, say commentators.  “I think all ASIC manufacturers are looking at sub-20 in some form that will produce another spike in hash rate, maybe by mid 2014,” says Cole. HashFast, which will itself dump significant amounts of hashing power onto the network this quarter, is also taping out its next-generation FinFet chip this quarter, which will up the ante yet again.  So, while exact difficulty is hard to predict, we can expect significant jumps for the next few months, and a probable spike again when next-generation ASICs ship.

42397243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Sa,1379427914,Bitcoin gaining market-based legitimacy as XBT,"Punctual trams run quietly along the street out front. It looks like any other office building in Zürich. But inside the nondescript building of SIX Interbank Clearing, a small unit of professionals maintains the list of the world's currency codes.  Last week in that very same building, I had the honor of presenting the bitcoin cryptocurrency to a gathered audience of various bank officials at an e-commerce conference. And I mentioned that the individual, or committee, that endorses and finalizes XBT as the ISO currency code for bitcoin will earn their spot in history next to Satoshi Nakamoto.  Of course, a new code for a brand new asset class is not comparable to an achievement in financial cryptography and distributed consensus, but it is significant nonetheless because of its impact on the evolution of math-based currencies.  The ISO 4217 standard for currency codes is published by a voluntary, non-governmental organization independent of any national agenda. It operates more or less as a body that approves the three-character currency codes of new countries or regions. In some cases, the code reflects a non-governmental unit such as gold (XAU) and silver (XAG).  Beyond the regulations and government approval that so frequently underpin discussions about the legitimacy of bitcoin, a different type of legitimacy is emerging and it has the ability to out-survive the elected administrations of legal jurisdictions.  This market-based legitimacy holds the key to bitcoin's success - not the sanctions and official blessings for what's an appropriate monetary unit. Governments and regulators may come and go, but customs and convention persevere.  Currency code XBT is a sign of this growing market-based influence, at least among the organizations currently depending on such codes. Governments generally follow rather than lead market adoption because it is too difficult to alter the course of momentum.  Uniquely, bitcoin operates as both a value transfer network and a separate unit of account. Therefore, it doesn't require the services of a third-party intermediary to approve and route transactions. However, as a monetary unit, bitcoin offers great opportunities for those who desire to trade or price in bitcoin and perhaps layering services on top of the protocol.  At the top of the pyramid is SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that provides the communication platform to connect more than 10,000 banking organizations in 210 countries (16 more countries than the United Nations).  SWIFT's influence is so pervasive that its ecosystem is a daily barometer of global economic performance such as GDP growth rates, capital flows, and foreign exchange trade volatility.  Once again, bitcoin is a major topic of conversation at Sibos, the annual SWIFT conference being held in Dubai this year.  In prepared remarks yesterday, SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt said, ""I would not see why we at Swift could not send transactions in bitcoin as a currency."" If they do, they will undoubtedly look to the ISO for the currency code. The Bitcoin Foundation had two scheduled appearances at the SWIFT conference.  Also, the payment networks like VISA, MasterCard, and American Express all rely on the ISO 4217 codes for international transactions and currency conversion. Once the member banks start requesting settlement in bitcoin for certain transactions, the payment networks will look to the ISO for the corresponding currency code.  XE.com  , one of the world's leading providers of Internet foreign exchange tools and services, recently began displaying bitcoin prices in XBT across their data feed. Founded in 1993, the company licenses over 35,000 XE Currency Converters, provides commercial currency data to over 1,000 clients, and serves 18 million unique users per month.  Service provider OANDA also displays bitcoin prices using the currency code XBT. OANDA is a market maker and a trusted source for currency data, serving both individuals and financial institutions. Founded in 1995, it provides access to one of the world's largest historical, high frequency, filtered currency databases serving over 30 million requests per month.  Not to be outdone, Bloomberg in August announced that they were testing XBT price quotes internally lending more ammunition to the push for formal code adoption.  In the bitcoin trading world, exchange operator Kraken became the first to make the formal switch to XBT this week and other bitcoin exchanges are expected to follow suit.  In the retail foreign exchange trading world, platform market leaders like MetaTrader 4 are witnessing client firms undertaking the bitcoin modifications on their own. Although not expressing trades in XBT yet, the gradual adoption of bitcoin into existing forex platforms signals a huge shift in market trading. So far, only three companies are known to have incorporated bitcoin into the MT4 environment, including AvaTrade, BTC-E, and Bit4X.  XBT may represent the beginning for bitcoin standards and market-based legitimacy, but it is certainly not the end. Next up on the standards agenda is the Unicode symbol for bitcoin with B⃦ or ฿ as the two leading contenders.

42397231,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Gm,1379419928,KnCMiner offers free speed increase with first bitcoin miner shipments,"KnCMiner is offering a bonus speed increase to customers awaiting delivery of its Jupiter bitcoin mining rig.  The company said the Jupiter bitcoin mining rig will mine at a significantly higher rate than the 400 GH/s its customers are expecting.  ""We will not down clock our chips to 400[GH/s], we will release all our machines with the greatest hashing power we can. So yes, the rumors are true – Jupiter will be greater than 400[GH/s] by a significant margin as a free gift from us to all our loyal customers,"" the KnCMiner team's statement reads.  Sam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner, said the fabrication process of the chips has been completed and they are now on their way to an assembly house in Asia, before being shipped to KnCMiner's offices in Sweden in around six days' time.  ""They have to then be assembled into devices here. Everything is still on track to meet our end-of-September deadline,"" he explained.  Cole said the deliveries will go out on a ""first-pay-first-serve"" basis. ""The guys who are at the front of the queue are the ones who paid the earliest.""  Production speed  The mining hardware producer revealed it has ""broken a few speed records"" in terms of the time it has taken to bring its products to market.  ""I don't think you'll find any other 28nm product that's gone from conception to production in this timeframe. Normally they're measured in years, and we started in April,"" Cole said.  He explained that most companies spend two or three years researching and then spend one year producing.  The company is doing everything it possibly can to ensure this month's deadline is met, with a number of safety measures being put in place to try and avoid any hold-ups.  ""We've got people personally carrying the chips so we can get through customs faster. We have personal couriers flying around the world handling these chips via different airlines so we can guarantee we will have at least half a delivery if there are any delays with customs or flights,"" Cole said.  KnCMiner customers can expect to see images and footage of the Jupiter and Saturn mining rigs in action over the next week.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/17/kncminer-offers-free-speed-increase-with-first-bitcoin-miner-shipments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06136b8f6227a0d804df1834d92bf77d25d0be50-1000x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
