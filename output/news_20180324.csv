42401344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQNR,1521889220,OFAC's Bitcoin Blacklist Could Change Crypto,"Joe Ciccolo is the president of BitAML, Inc., a compliance service provider. Andrew Hinkes is an adjunct professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and NYU School of Law.  This article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, legal advice.      With just one paragraph, an agency of the U.S. government may have just radically altered the dynamics of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  The Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) announced on March 19 that it was considering including digital currency addresses associated with its list of persons and entities with whom U.S. persons and businesses are forbidden to transact business.  In a new section of its website, labeled “Questions about Virtual Currency,” OFAC noted that it “may add digital currency addresses to the SDN List to alert the public of specific digital currency identifiers associated with a blocked person.”  The list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) includes individuals and entities associated with sanctioned governments, terrorism, trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, and illegal drug trafficking. This list includes varying types of records, including in some cases only names, but in other cases names, addresses, aliases, etc.  Financial institutions would be required to screen any virtual currency address provided for a transaction against a list to be provided by OFAC, and to either report, deny service to, or block transactions involving any listed addresses.  The agency's FAQ also encourages reporting of addresses associated with listed individuals, which suggests that they intend to supplement the SDN list on an ongoing basis.  This brings up innumerable questions, a few of which we tackle below:  Who decides what addresses are added to the SDN list?  OFAC is operated by the Department of Treasury, which currently maintains and updates the SDN list. It appears that the existing SDN list will be updated to include addresses associated with individuals and entities already listed by OFAC, and that OFAC is encouraging others to provide additional data to associate addresses with listed individuals and entities.  What if a digital currency address is wrongfully associated with a blacklisted individual?  There is an appeal process available. By appealing you necessarily divulge your identity and contact information to OFAC, which will likely investigate your connection to the listed individual.  If you appeal, expect a long conversation with the regulator, and expect to provide evidence that you are not involved in whatever illicit activity is associated with that listed person or entity.  Taint by association  What happens if you receive a transaction from a listed digital currency address?  It is possible that the received coins would then be “tainted” as being linked back to a listed individual or entity, and that your identity and digital currency address may then be added to the OFAC list.  It is unclear as to whether OFAC intends to add new addresses that send or receive coins to or from listed public key addresses, but it is clear that any transaction with an illicit actor who is listed on the SDN list is prohibited and can result in penalties.  If OFAC uses blockchain tracing software to identify the counterparty to transactions with listed digital currency addresses, it may add the addresses of those counterparties to the SDN list.  This could quickly multiply the number of addresses on the SDN list and would likely include addresses for individuals and entities that are not currently there.  This may also kick off a cat-and-mouse game between OFAC and illicit actors. Can OFAC update its list as fast as illicit actors can move their funds to new digital currency addresses?  Suppose that OFAC wants to add to its SDN list any new addresses that interact with listed addresses. Does that mean that if a listed public address sends a transaction to someone else and receives change, both the recipient address and change address could be added to the OFAC list?  Probably, although it is unclear as to how much of its resources the Department of Treasury intends to devote to reading the blockchain and updating the SDN list. Arguably, it would require full-time staffing or dedicated software to track this, and the list of barred addresses would grow extremely quickly.  We will quickly know what OFAC intends to do, as it regularly updates its SDN list with new data, and rapid-fire updates to add new addresses will be obvious.  What if a digital currency address listed is an address used by a third-party custody provider, (i.e. a multisig wallet provider or a custodial exchange)?  It is unclear, but the addition of a multisig wallet provider’s digital currency address to the SDN list could affect all users of that custody provider’s service who transfer their funds to that service provider.  Customers of that multisig wallet may find that their funds may be blocked, and thus not able to be transacted through any financial institution. Remember, business transactions with listed individuals and entities are prohibited.  Aren’t digital currency addresses typically single-use? If so, does this matter?  In some cases, if a crypto system user observes perfect hygiene, yes. But most crypto users trade security for convenience.  How likely is it that a transaction is reported?  A transaction should be reported if it passes through or is disclosed to an entity that has an obligation to check for OFAC compliance, which does not typically include retailers, or non-financial entities. This means that de minimis transactions will probably fall through the cracks, but large ones will be caught.  What is the duty of inquiry for OFAC-charged entities?  This is unclear. A direct transfer from a listed address would be detected, but it is not clear if the there is a duty to look further back for a transaction with a listed digital currency address, or how far back any entity is required to look.  Guidance suggests that financial institutions are required to identify parties that are majority-owned by listed individuals and entities. However, identification of the current user of any given digital currency address may be difficult.  If OFAC adds to the SDN list digital currency addresses of transferees from listed addresses and I receive a transaction from a listed digital currency address, are all of my assets associated with that digital currency address now tainted? What about my other unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that did not come from a listed digital currency address?  Under this hypothetical, it looks like it, unless OFAC distinguishes between UTXO’s based upon sending address, which is unlikely.  Unlike cash deposits in a depository account, receiving a crypto UTXO does not commingle assets – each one can be separated even when it resides in a wallet. So, while a distinction can be made, it is unclear how a regulator would approach this argument.  Again, it depends on the amount of resources that OFAC devotes to this project, and what software they use.  If OFAC is tracking transactions from listed addresses to other addresses and intends to add addresses of transferees, wouldn’t that mean that OFAC would have a list of addresses it wants to bar, but not necessarily have the identity of the persons who use that address?  Probably. In a sense, it is always difficult to entirely map identity to a specific address, as the assets associated with a public key address can be used by anyone with a private key for that public key address, and ownership can change without any information about that ownership change being reflected on the system.  Mapping between user and public key address may be more ephemeral than regulators expect, which may frustrate the exercise.  Nodes, miners and Lightning  Are node operators or miners required to screen out transactions from blacklisted addresses?  Maybe (we know, total cop-out).  Node operators arguably may not have any obligation, but miners may have a compliance obligation, which would radically change mining and confirmation of new transactions.  Mining pools may need to kick out any listed addresses participating in their mining pools for fear of pool-wide conspiracy or liability for aiding and abetting. Miners may be obligated to not confirm, or to block, transactions involving listed addresses, which runs counter to mining itself.  This would be an example of policy and law directly intersecting with code and governance of these systems, and would bring up lots of fun issues that law professors love to put in final exams.  How does this effect the Lightning Network?  If Lightning Network is deemed to be a money transmitter, Lightning Network node operators may have to comply and either refuse or block transactions involving listed addresses.  Does this affect coin fungibility?  Kiss fungibility goodbye. Expect a premium on freshly minted coins, or traced “clean” coins on the market provided they come from a “clean” miner.  This may cause a bifurcation in price between what was otherwise a functionally clean asset, and a “dirty” coin that has passed through a listed address.  We may even see a trifurcation, as “grey” tumbled or mixed coins reside somewhere in the middle.  What about tumblers and mixers?  Tumblers would likely produce “grey” tokens that would not be initially blacklisted, but ultimately would be tagged as tumbled and blacklisted once the regulators get the software tools, resources and staffing to allow this level of detailed analysis and implementation.  Transactions using tumbled or mixed coins will probably be reported on suspicious activity reports, anyway.  Will coins be permanently “marked” if they are transacted to or from a listed address?  Nobody knows at this point.  What about exchanges?  Exchanges would undoubtedly be required to comply, which would shut off liquidity in the U.S. for blacklisted addresses.  However, this may hasten the shift of trading volume to decentralized exchanges or overseas exchanges, whose participants would risk listing or trading at pain of enforcement by the U.S. government.  What about privacy-enabled coins like zcash or monero?  Expect an uptick in support, development, and usage of these tokens, and an uptick in their usage in their privacy-enabled mode.  What to do now  How do I make sure my coins are clean?  There will likely be tools developed to determine the “taint” of a given UTXO and vendors that provide OFAC-compliant coin services.  Could this backfire? What’s the doomsday scenario?  Sure. Operators of listed digital currency addresses could spray satoshis at any address they can find and essentially “taint” the entire blockchain.  After listing addresses and implementing appropriate tracking software, OFAC may find that all addresses are two or three transactions away from a listed address, and the tool becomes essentially worthless.  I run a [insert crypto business here] and I am concerned. What should I do?  Get a qualified lawyer or compliance consultant who understands banking law and understands crypto systems and pay that lawyer or consultant for real advice.

42401347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQSM,1521885605,Bitcoin's Next Year in Tech Is Coming Into Focus,"Developers of the most popular bitcoin implementation software have big dreams of crafting a truly global form of money, and as such, you can say they have a lot on their plates.  The breadth of their to-do lists was easy to see at a recent annual meeting in New York, where, in a change of pace from the internet channels they're known to frequent, many of the software's most-active developers come together to coordinate. In a conversation transcribed by contributor Bryan Bishop, they discussed a mish-mash of code priorities for the coming year, giving a peek into how the team makes decisions and the technical hurdles they hope to jump next.  Though not all developers were in attendance, the transcript provides an inside look into the near-term focus of a few key developers, including long-time Bitcoin Core contributors Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo and Cory Fields. It also provided a look behind the scenes, where contributors are toiling away on an array of changes to the code that now secures more than $147 billion.  Indeed, much of the conversation centered on touching up the way the team reviews and adds new code. One major pain point is that, while developers are submitting tons of code changes, there are only so many developers knowledgeable enough to battletest them for bugs, ensuring they're ready to be added to the code securing so much money.  ""As a reviewer, there's no way I'm going to get through all of this and it's actively discouraging,"" one developer said.  Some code changes are even getting lost due to the load. Another developer even went so far as to call the growing list of proposed changes ""a dead graveyard of cool ideas.""  Scattered priorities  Yet, this isn't stopping developers from working on other new features.  Fields, a contributor at MIT, has long been working on sprucing up the peer-to-peer network code connecting all the nodes across the global network.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, he called bitcoin's code a ""monolithic blob"" that developers have been trying to untangle since it was first put forth in 2009. Though he's been combing through the code's peer-to-peer layer for years, he revealed in the meeting that he's ""almost done.""  He's also working on a feature building upon bitcoin's unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), the pool of bitcoin transaction data that can be spent in new transactions. Though his description of the new feature was thin, he said he plans to reveal more ""soon"" in an email to the popular bitcoin developer mailing list.  This goes to highlight the distributed nature of working on open-source code, where each developer works on whatever he or she chooses. Though developers are constantly chatting about their work on the internet, some might not have any idea that someone else is working on a big feature until they post it to a widely-read forum - such as the official mailing list.  Then there's Wuille. Perhaps the best-known Bitcoin Core contributor, he's responsible for SegWit, a much-lauded scaling code change that activated on bitcoin last year.  His update at the meeting was succinct, but he reiterated that he's focused on another much-anticipated scaling change, signature aggregation. Plus, he's looking at increasing privacy by hiding messages sent across the with ""peer-to-peer"" network - the very same layer Fields is tearing apart.  Corallo's update was perhaps the most technical, describing in detail how he's splitting up the codebase into chunks that are easier for developers to manage.  There's one particularly messy piece that he describes as ""super complex,"" which more than one developer has tried to untangle. He's not fazed by it though. ""I want to take another shot,"" he said.  Defending sovereignty  Corallo is one of many developers focused on making Bitcoin Core full nodes software easier for non-technical people to use. Though the code is widely-considered to offer the most secure way of using bitcoin, it's notoriously difficult to set up, taking days or even weeks to download.  Chaincode co-founder and Bitcoin Core contributor Alex Morcos explained in the meeting why he believes it's so important to make it easier to run.  Though there's a ""cultural push"" to run nodes, Morcos said, he worries many users don't understand the ""real reason"" to run one. He thinks it's to be ""sovereign,"" or being able to tell if transactions are valid or not without trusting anyone else – basically the point of bitcoin in the first place.  Morcos put forward a few ideas for making this full-node-driven sovereignty possible for everyone.  Perhaps one of the biggest problems with bitcoin full nodes is the software is so large, smartphones can't handle them. The software is kind of stuck in one place, with users likely to spin up the node on a computer permanently located at home or at a business.  But Morcos believes there's a way around this. One day, users will hopefully be able to connect smartphones to the nodes running at home, boosting their security. ""And then it's ready to go wherever you go,"" he said.  Along these lines, Corallo broached the idea of making it possible to check a full node for information about keys stored elsewhere - in a hardware wallet, for example, which is considered one of the securest ways of storing private keys. But, though this would make using the software more convenient, he's been having trouble implementing it.  Morcos told CoinDesk that though he's interested in these ideas, it isn't his main focus right now. ""I don't know if I have a particular focus,"" he said, succinctly summarizing the loose open-source code process.  But it does highlight that full node inconveniences are a pressing concern.  Morcos added:  ""Certainly a goal is to make the time to get things set up and running as short as possible.""
