The average cost of production per Bitcoin for HIVE was $13,599 for the quarter ending December 31, 2022, representing a 37% increase from the previous quarter. Despite the recent rebound in crypto, HIVE's stock performance has lagged behind Bitcoin tokens, suggesting that investors may find more value in the token or other mining companies. It has been a turbulent year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies like HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ). HIVE is one of the smaller miners in the industry, but notable differences made it an interesting pick going into a macroeconomic slowdown. As expected, the massive selloff in Bitcoin brought the stock down to historic lows, but with the Federal Reserve making notable progress in its fight against inflation and a possible pasta interest rate increase on the cards, the stock does not seem to be performing as well as one would like. Today, will look at HIVE Blockchain and see if the company has underlying problems or if the stock lacks publicity. Data by YCharts Miners Getting Hammered One of the age-old debates with Bitcoin mining company investments has been whether it is better to buy the token or the mining company's stock. There are essential dynamics to remember when making this deliberation. Investors often point to the fact that the Bitcoin supply is being diluted daily, which is true. But as most investors know, Bitcoin's difficulty rates increase as more tokens are mined. HIVE Blockchain Technologies On the other hand, mining companies tend to rely on financing and secondary offerings to fund operations as they wait for advantageous prices to sell their tokens. As you can see below, HIVE has been no exception to this rule. It is important to note that this is understandable. If one is expecting outsized returns for Bitcoin, then it makes sense for the company to offer shares in the short term to preserve its treasury and reap future rewards. Data by YCharts While HIVE has been selling Bitcoin to help fund operations, it also benefits from building out its comprehensive mining fleet in low-cost regions. As a result, production figures have improved significantly over time, and the company can now sell tokens while maintaining a good treasury. Below, we can see the production figures from November through January. Month Bitcoin Produced Average Bitcoin per Exahash Income from Grid Balancing ((USD)) Additional Information November 2022 264 105 - 262 HIVE BuzzMiners received; 2,130 Bitmain S19j Pro Antminers purchased December 2022 213.8 113.2 3,150,000 2,050 Bitmain S19j Pro miners installed; 1,423 HIVE BuzzMiners installed; 4,752 BTC produced in 2022 January 2023 260 110 180,000 6,700 new ASIC miners deployed; 3,200 BuzzMiners installed; 3,570 S19j Pro miners fully deployed Author's Estimates In fact, one of the differentiating factors with this company is that they have managed to stabilize production at elevated levels with minimal disruptions, which should be welcome for investors. Still, we would like to see growth as other mining companies like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) are consistently managing to produce at a higher level. Bitcoin Production Landscape: Company Ticker March (2023) February (2023) January (2023) December (2022) Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) 825 683 687 475 Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF ) 424 387 486 496 Riot Platforms (RIOT) 695 675 740 659 CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK ) 598 576 697 464 HIVE Blockchain (NASDAQ:HIVE) 260 213.8 Core Scientific ( CORZQ ) 1360 1527 1435 Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ: ARBK ) 162 168 147 Iris Energy (NASDAQ: IREN ) 173 156 172 123 TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF ) 233 143 157 125 Average Bitcoins mined 491.3333333 517.75 308.6738 261.27875 Author's Estimates The table below shows that Bitcoin production trends have remained relatively stable for the company over a period of time. This aligns with the industry's overall trend lately, where mining companies prioritize capital preservation and solvency over increasing their fleet size, as was the case a year or two ago. HIVE Blockchain Technologies It is also important to note that the company has been earning substantial revenue from grid balancing. It is not ideal to be speaking about revenue from grid balancing from an investment standpoint. Ideally, investors will want to hear about surging production numbers and, most importantly, tokens being sold at elevated prices. But the company seems to be doing its best with the cards it has been dealt, which has recently strengthened the balance sheet. One could argue that this is a result of the trade-off made by management, where they seem to have prioritized the long-term future of the company over short-term sensational headlines. When we think about Bitcoin mining companies over the past few years, we think about companies who have done just about anything to increase to mining fleet due to surging Bitcoin prices. A part of this effort has seen companies rely on external financing to maintain a large fleet and general corporate responsibilities. The problem is that the debt can become burdensome if there is a sustained negative move in Bitcoin prices, as we have seen recently. HIVE may be unable to match the production numbers of some of the more popular names in the industry, but they have been very responsible with the amount of debt they have taken on. We can see below how the company stacks up against its competitors in the space. Riot Platforms is still one of the best in this regard, but HIVE is not far behind and probably deserves more recognition. Data by YCharts When we look at what happened with Core Scientific (CORZQ), this is certainly a respectable position to have. These production achievements have made for some polarizing earnings reports. On the one hand, the management team has clearly made some great progress on production numbers and has even managed to keep direct production costs low at roughly 13.6K per token. I always like to see miners keep direct costs as close to $10,000 as possible. However, with surging energy prices causing challenges for the entire industry late last year, I think that's a great number despite the 37% increase from the same quarter in the year prior. Key Data Points: Data Point Value Quarterly Revenue $14.3 million Gross Mining Margin $3.6 million Adjusted EBITDA $1.5 million HPC Revenue Strategy Annual Run Rate $1.3 million Bitcoin Mined in Recent Quarter 787 Bitcoin Mined in the Same Quarter Last Year 697 YoY Bitcoin Production Increase 13% Average Cost of Production per Bitcoin (excl. SG&A) $13,599 Cost of Production Increase from Last Quarter 37% But on the other hand, we have seen some truly terrifying EPS numbers. This has been standard across the industry since impairment changes and the crypto crash. Seeking Alpha HIVE prides itself on efficient operations, and we can see that admin costs have been controlled despite notable growth for the company. HIVE Blockchain Technologies As one would expect, revenue fell significantly with Bitcoin prices, but the reverse would also be true if the company makes it to the other side of this crypto winter, which makes what the management team has been achieving even more important. HIVE Blockchain Technologies Challenges in the Future It is unlikely that the crypto market is completely out of the woods despite the strong rebound. People have been prematurely celebrating the end of inflation due to the recent achievements of the Federal Reserve, but it is likely that interest rates to remain elevated throughout the end of calendar year 2023. The Federal Reserve has made it clear that rate cuts are not in their base case for the end of the year though I suspect we may see one or two cuts due to the recent banking crisis and the general unwillingness to spark a needless recession. If inflation were to become sticky, forcing the Fed to do more damage to the economy to cool down prices, then that would be catastrophic for smaller growth stocks like HIVE. HIVE's fleet is also geographically located in Canada, Iceland and Sweden. Many countries have been facing energy crises due to the Russia - Ukraine conflict but interestingly, Iceland and Sweden derive a significant portion of their energy supply from renewable sources, which has made them a great pick for miners. This was not by accident, the HIVE management team has been deliberate about where they deploy their miners, and investors are now seeing some benefits from this strategy. Valuation and Forward-Looking Commentary We can see in the charts below that the stock is trading near historic lows, but the valuation makes sense because of the widespread uncertainty in the crypto mining industry, Bitcoin prices and the macroeconomic outlook in short to medium term. Data by YCharts One of the major concerns gripping the industry right now is liquidity. Following the issues that have hit Core Scientific, which was among the biggest producers in the industry, there is a feeling that no Bitcoin mining company can be completely safe right now. As I mentioned earlier, HIVE is one of the more responsible names in the industry, but it is not immune to the profound impact of a prolonged depressed crypto bear market. Operating losses can pile up quickly as energy prices, the need to sell Bitcoin holdings, and a depreciating mining fleet can take a toll. The good thing is a strong upward move in Bitcoin will solve all the problems that matter if these companies can maintain a good treasury. Nevertheless, there isn't an awful lot of cash here in the event that HIVE has to weather an extremely long crypto bear market. Data by YCharts We can also see that the stock has not performed reasonably well despite the strong rebound in crypto. In fact, Bitcoin tokens have outperformed the stock, which is problematic when you consider the additional risks associated with the miners like dilution, regulation etc. Data by YCharts This is perhaps the most detrimental issue for HIVE. I like to think of Bitcoin mining companies as call options on their underlying token where theta decay is, in essence, the dilution. For this reason, I would expect negative variance when the token is going through a turbulent stint but would expect the stock to outpace the token on strong rebounds. We are not seeing this dynamic right now, which for me, suggests it is better to buy the token or another mining company. The Takeaway In closing, HIVE has demonstrated efficiency in its operations and strategic choices in its geographic locations, allowing it to navigate the challenges faced in the crypto-mining industry. Despite its achievements, HIVE's stock has not performed well during the strong rebound in the crypto market. This underperformance, combined with the risks associated with mining companies, such as dilution and regulation, is prohibitive right now. I respect what the management team is doing, but we aren't seeing the stock reflect that just yet. The stock likely needs a bigger move in Bitcoin to attract more attention to the space, which may not come soon. This was one of my picks for a recession, and in many ways, it still is, but for now, there a no great reasons to buy or sell if you're bullish on Bitcoin. I rate the stock a hold.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594582-hive-resilience-shines-through-challenging-crypto-landscape?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11870144.jpeg
42413980,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoHdO,1681771457,Ryuk Ransomware Gang’s Crypto Broker Gets Light Sentence After a Guilty Plea,"Denis Dubnikov, a founder of two over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in Russia tied to ransomware attacks, was sentenced to no jail time, fine of $10,000 and forfeiture of $2,000 last week after a guilty plea, court documents show.  Dubnikov is a founder of the Coyote Crypto and Eggchange OTC services in Russia. He was arrested in 2021 in Netherlands and extradited to the U.S. in 2022 for helping ransomware hackers cash out crypto. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Dubnikov helped the notorious Ryuk ransomware group launder more than $400,000 in ransom proceeds.  According to an indictment, Dubnikov was among the brokers who helped Ryuk launder the ransomware payouts by splitting payments into multiple smaller amounts, transferring them between self-hosted wallets and then exchanging bitcoin (BTC) for tether (USDT), other cryptocurrencies and fiat, especially the Chinese yuan.  If convicted, Dubnikov would have spent up to 20 years in prison. But in February he pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit money laundering,” and on April, 11, Dubnikov was sentenced for imprisonment of the time served, meaning he will be released on parole. Dubnikov was also ordered to pay a $10,000 penalty and forfeit $2,000, according to the court case documents.

42413985,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoHtJ,1681769879,Smurf Happens: Beloved Blue Characters Enter Web3,"Popular animated franchise The Smurfs, known from comics, cartoons and movies, are taking on a new adventure with the release of a new collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) from the Smurf Society that will expand the reach of the three-apple-tall characters to Web3.  Why the Smurfs? One of the draws of the intellectual property (IP) was its broad Web2 reach with “94% recognition globally.” Smurfs are known not only in Belgium where the comics began, but also broadly across Europe, the U.S. and China, where the Smurfs are welcomed for their spirit of community and collaboration, co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Arthur Salkin told CoinDesk.  That spirit was a key factor that appealed to Frédéric Montagnon, another Smurfs Society co-founder who focuses on strategy for the brand. Montagnon said the Smurfs are the ideal partner in onboarding Web2 fans to Web3 through an inclusive, welcoming community. The Smurfs' pedigree as a friendly, accessible brand that focuses on caring for others was a huge draw.  “We see NFTs as creating a community that doesn’t have borders,” Montagnon told CoinDesk. “Web3 provides less hassle and all the freedom to connect with others and provide digital sovereignty, which is very important.”  Starting April 18, the Smurf Society will open a bucket auction for 3,000 NFTs based on the Smurfs characters. While there are Smurfs avatars based on famous legacy characters including Papa Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Smurfette, the Smurfs’ Society Legendary Collection brings Web3 characters to the village like VR Smurf and Crypto Smurf.  “You can identify yourself with Smurfs,” Salkin noted, teasing that future drops would be even more inclusive in character design. Salkin lauded the work done by Daft Punk creative director Cedric Hervet in enlisting notable 3D artists to bring the Smurf profile pictures (PFP) to life.  All told, the collection will consist of 12,500 3D-rendered Smurf PFPs. There will be 250 different Smurf characters with 50 unique variants of each one with over 350 different traits, according to the projects’ website.  The Smurfs Society has been building over the past year with a smaller, closed community who have been testing the gamified Smurfy world, built on Polygon. Those early adopters have been rewarded with Crystals which can be traded on secondary markets like OpenSea and will provide access to a discounted allow-list sale following the public bucket auction.  Part of the gaming experience highlighted education as part of the quests. “Every day you had the opportunity to mint some ingredients and if you picked the right ingredients you could mint a potion and create a crystal,” Montagnon explained. “So there could be a quest that helped you understand what you needed to mint and how it worked with blockchain technology.”  The Smurfs joins other beloved children's TV shows that have recently made their way into Web3. In January, Jim Henson's ""Fraggle Rock"" released an NFT collection, and in March, ""Sesame Street"" launched NFTs with VeVe.

The virtual sneaker, called Our Force 1 (OF1), is a play on the brand's iconic Air Force 1 design. Beginning on April 18, Nike will begin airdropping ""posters"" to select .Swoosh users, granting them early access to the sale on May 8. On May 10, the entire .Swoosh community will be able to purchase the digital goods through its marketplace.  Users will have a choice of two digital boxes – the ""Classic Remix"" and the ""New Wave"" box – with each box type corresponding to different possible designs, including a design co-created by four Nike fans in January. Each box is priced at $19.82, a tribute to the year the Air Force 1 sneaker was first released.  Holders of the OF1 boxes will be able to open them at a later date. Nike says that each NFT will come with a paired 3D file that holders can use to ""express themselves in new ways,"" and that it plans to add broader utility, including ""exclusive physical products or experiences,"" in the future.  ""We are exploring new ways to tell stories and create relationships while removing the barriers and limitations of physical product,"" said Ron Faris, general manager of Nike Virtual Studios, in a press release.  Nike released a beta version of its .Swoosh platform in November, teasing that the platform would be used as a resource for Web3 education and as a platform to buy and trade digital collectibles. The company added that items purchased on .Swoosh can be worn in video games and other immersive experiences.  Members of .Swoosh will also be allowed to create their own collections and earn royalties from sales. In January, Nike held a contest with a $5,000 prize challenging .SWOOSH community members to build a visual storyboard on Instagram showcasing their footwear design ideas.

The upgrade has enabled withdrawals for the first time from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain, which has some 18 million ETH, worth $36 billion, locked in staking contracts.  Before the upgrade, some crypto watchers worried that the event would flood the market with millions of unlocked ETH and crash the second largest cryptocurrency’s price, although others predicted little impact or that the price would rise. News of a seamless implementation pushed ETH’s price above $2,100 the day following, its highest level since May 2022. ETH outperformed bitcoin (BTC) in that 24-hour period. ETH was recently trading at about $2,070, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours.  Data suggest that some traders have sold ETH during the price rally post-Shanghai.  Since the upgrade, the ETH-USD trading pair on crypto exchange Coinbase recorded $28 million more sell orders than buy orders, crypto market research platform Kaiko reported Monday.  Coinbase was one of the first exchanges that let users immediately unlock and withdraw their staked ETH via its platform. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, will follow suit on April 19, which “could result in more sell pressure for ETH,” Kaiko wrote.  ETH pared some of its earlier gains, and recently has been changing hands at $2,079, per CoinDesk data.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/17/exchanges-receive-375m-influx-of-ether-since-shanghai-upgrade-as-price-hits-11-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/984ba9187bd8e821f0c063127713086e62dd33f1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394058,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVk3D,1681767265,Nervous About Crypto Taxes? Donate Your Profitable Holdings Instead,"This year feels like the first time the U.S. government got serious about crypto, and with recent actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), you can’t blame investors for feeling a little nervous when filing their 2022 returns.  Crypto taxes can be confusing, even for experts in the industry. But if there was any confusion about the need to pay taxes on your crypto investments, that changed in 2020 when the IRS added it to the front page of Form 1040. As a result, many taxpayers are anxious about making sure they report their crypto taxes correctly.  Adam Nash is the co-founder and CEO of Daffy.org, a platform for charitable donations.  While there may be some debate between the SEC and the CFTC on how to regulate crypto, the IRS treats cryptocurrencies like stocks, bonds and other capital assets – and most types of crypto transactions are taxable events. So if you sold, converted, spent, earned or staked crypto you’ll need to report your gains and losses to the tax authority.  Unfortunately, without a standard 1099 (accountant speak for the form where you submit gains and losses on traders), it’s not surprising that many crypto investors have some level of dread and anxiety about potential tax issues with the crypto they hold. Further, now the IRS is better funded, the penalty for even honest mistakes feels higher.  However, there is a reliable and legal way to avoid many of the issues related to filing taxes for crypto transactions: making charitable donations.  If you are fortunate enough to hold crypto that has appreciated in value for more than one year, you can donate it. You won’t need to worry about paying capital gains taxes and you’ll reap the benefits of one of the most generous deductions in the tax code.  Understanding crypto and taxes  As per the IRS guidelines, crypto and other digital assets are classified as property (like stock) and cryptocurrency transactions are subject to capital gains taxes. Crypto held for less than one year that appreciates in value is subject to the short-term capital gains tax, which is the same rate as income taxes. Meanwhile, crypto held for more than a year that appreciates in value would qualify as ""long-term,"" which generally offers lower tax rates.  The length of time you have held an asset is very important when it comes to donating assets. The IRS has very different rules for assets that have been held short-term vs. long-term:  Donating crypto held less than a year: If you hold crypto for less than 365 days, then the IRS limits your deduction to the fair market value of the asset minus the capital gain. As a result, donating assets like stock or crypto that have been held for less than a year makes very little sense. If it is below your purchase price, you would lose out on claiming the capital loss. If it is above your purchase price, you lose out on the value of the gain.  Donating crypto held more than a year: When you donate crypto that you have held for more than a year to a qualified public charity, the IRS considers the donation value to be the fair market value of the asset at the time. Not the value you paid for it – the current fair market value.  If you itemize your tax deductions, this means donating appreciated crypto can result in money saved for the taxpayer and more money for the charity. The charitable deduction is one of the most generous in the tax code, allowing taxpayers to deduct donations of assets up to 30% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in any given year.  Serious savings  When it comes to crypto and taxes, sometimes an example can help illustrate how this simple strategy could work. Imagine a couple that has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $250,000 per year who purchased a whole bitcoin (BTC) in February 2020 for $10,000, and then decided to sell it in April 2023 for $30,000.  In a state like California, a couple earning $250,000 might be in a 15% federal tax bracket for long-term capital gains in addition to a 9.3% California tax bracket, for a total of 24.3%. Since that couple purchased BTC at $10,000 and then sold it for $30,000 after holding it for more than a year, they would owe a total of $4,860 in taxes on a reported gain of $20,000, leaving them with an after-tax gain of $15,140.  Of course, they could lighten this tax bill by donating the proceeds of the sale to charity. The couple, assuming their total income tax rate is 33.3% (24% for federal tax and California’s 9.3% state tax rate), could make a cash donation of $25,140 to get a tax reduction of $8,372.  However, the numbers are much better for our couple and the charities they support if they donate the bitcoin directly. Donating 1 BTC with a fair market value of $30,000 to charity would allow the couple to deduct $30,000 off of their income. At their 33.3% tax rate, that would potentially save them $9,990 in taxes.  So how much does the generous couple save? If they sell the Bitcoin and donate the proceeds, they could get a tax benefit of $3,512. If they donate the bitcoin, they could get a tax benefit of $9,990. That's a difference of $6,478! By donating the bitcoin directly, the generous couple wins twice because they (1) get a tax deduction for the larger donation, and (2) they never have to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation of their bitcoin.  Read more: How Will NFTs Be Taxed? Understanding the IRS' New Proposed Guidelines  But here is the amazing part: The charity wins too! In the first scenario, if the couple donated the proceeds to charity, they would have only been able to donate the proceeds of the sale: $25,140. However, in the second scenario, the couple donated a bitcoin worth $30,000. Since the not-for-profit organization does not have to pay taxes, they get the full benefit of that $30,000 – a 19.3% larger gift!

Here is a closer look at the rejection on the RSI, and what it could mean in the short-term price action. We’ll also show you a comparison that might suggest that any dips are for buying, and that when the correction is over, the next time BTC will crack through the key level. Bitcoin Price Fails To Break $30K Over 70 On The RSI The crypto market has had a very different year than it did int 2022. Last year, prices simply plummeted for the entire year, making new low after low. But since the start of 2023, the theme has reverted back to “only up.” However, the weekly Relative Strength Index could be indicating that it was “only up” for the time being, and that time is about to take a pause. The same technical indicator could also be suggesting that after a brief pullback, Bitcoin is more than likely to try again, regaining renewed strength and making it though the next time around. Related Reading: This “Super” Bitcoin Technical Tool Says Limited Resistance Remains The Relative Strength Index is a momentum-measuring technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder Jr. Readings of above 70 signals and overbought market. Conversely, below 30 is an oversold market. In the chart below, the weekly RSI shows that at the same time we are getting a pullback, the tool is showing a failure to reach overbought conditions. The weekly RSI failed to reach over 70 on a closing basis | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why This Could Be The Pullback Late Bulls Are Waiting For Normally, an asset reaching overbought conditions on the RSI could indicate a possible reversal. However, Bitcoin behaves abnormally and is most bullish when RSI levels are elevated. The same chart above shows that reaching such levels isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Failure to make it into the overbought zone, deposit an almost 100% rally from lows, could cause the current move to extend. In 2019, Bitcoin immediately made it into overbought levels and then became bearish for several months again. In 2020, Bitcoin also failed to rise above 70 on the RSI. Following the quick pullback that coincided, Bitcoin then went on a record rally. Related Reading: Brace Yourself: The Most Explosive Move In Bitcoin In Years Has Begun There is no telling how deep BTCUSD might retrace now that a pullback has begun. But if the top cryptocurrency by market cap behaves in similar fashion following similar conditions in the RSI and price, could we then see a similar breakout and follow through to the upside once BTC can regain some momentum? Once again, I can’t shake the red box vibes. All good, as it should be the ideal dip to buy in #Bitcoin If we do get the pullback, maybe $23K the deepest.

BLOK's holdings are concentrated within companies with cryptocurrency exposure in particular; its top holding owns BTC outright and its top 5 are all involved in cryptocurrency. It has been tightly correlated to BTC throughout its lifecycle while getting nowhere near the return. Considering this along with its relatively high expense ratio and subpar ETF metrics, it's a sell in my book. Overview The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), commonly referred to as ""the blockchain ETF,"" is exactly as it sounds. This ETF was established in Q1 2018 in order to invest in businesses that are leveraging blockchain technology as a core part of their businesses. Since its inception BLOK’s price has thus far ended up at par, with an appreciation of only 0.05% overall; it also significantly underperformed both the NASDAQ and S&P. While this ETF did trade above both of these indices throughout most of 2021, this price behavior reversed itself and the ETF is now trading significantly below either of these. Seeking Alpha It would be sensible to believe that this ETF is closely correlated with the performance of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and this turns out to be the case. The BLOK ETF tracked the price performance of Bitcoin to a tee until the end of 2020 – at which point it began to significantly underperform it. As it stands today, Bitcoin has appreciated 201.6% since the inception of BLOK while the ETF has only returned .05%. Seeking Alpha The correlation between BTC and BLOK also became tighter (0.9 +) at the time that the price performance between the two began to diverge, and it has held to that level since . A correlation of 0.9 and above really indicates a very close synchrony between the price movements of two assets, and that’s what you’re getting here. The technicals here indicate that this ETF presently constitutes low-beta exposure to BTC. For 2023, the beta is 0.45; this ETF has moved 4.54% for every 10% move in BTC while also retaining a very high correlation. As with any low-beta exposure, this should have the effect of limiting upside as well as downside. However, I don’t think this ETF really holds up in that regard - it isn’t really low-beta exposure to BTC. I can confidently assert this because of its miserly price performance since inception. If this ETF had matched the 0.45 beta against BTC that we’ve seen so far in 2023, then the ETF would have appreciated 90.72% inception-to-date. Instead, it gained 0.05%. On this basis, this ETF is something different entirely; it is exposure to a basket of stocks, each of which is leveraging blockchain in some capacity or another. Holdings Review The mandate underlying this ETF is for it to have exposure to stocks that are leveraging blockchain for their businesses. This exposure, however, comes in many different forms. The utility of blockchain – and thus the fundamental exposure to it – differs significantly across the totality of BLOK’s holdings. Looking at BLOK's top 5 holdings I see: A data company that buys Bitcoin and holds on to it while also building a payments layer for BTC (MicroStrategy ( MSTR )) A Bitcoin miner (Riot Platforms ( RIOT )) A Japanese internet conglomerate that mines Bitcoin (GMO Internet Group) A cryptocurrency market maker and derivatives structurer (Galaxy Digital Holdings Limited) And a crypto brokerage (Coinbase ( COIN )) Off the bat it is clear the crypto is the primary use case for businesses held by this ETF; each of the top 5 holdings are focused on having exposure to cryptocurrency as opposed to another blockchain use case. These top 5 also represent a material proportion of this ETF’s portfolio at 24.96% overall. Since these are the largest holdings we can also infer that they are the highest priority bets for the managers of the ETF. Exposure This concentration in cryptocurrency makes me skeptical that this ETF constitutes quality exposure for the astute investor. We must recall that this ETF has failed to even come close to matching the price return to BTC throughout its lifecycle; this remains true YTD. This has also occurred while the ETF has maintained a very high (0.9+) correlation to BTC. That’s not a winning combination in my opinion; if at least 25% of its exposure is to cryptocurrency, it should at least have generated 25% of the return on the most popular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) – but it hasn’t. Additionally, we must also consider the relatively significant 0.75% expense ratio for this ETF as well as its risk metrics, which appear to be poor across the board. We see that BLOK has a beta more than double to the average ETF, indicating a high correlation between its holdings as well as a high beta to the market overall. This is a significant kind of risk as the ETF tends to fall far into the red, creating severe drawdowns. Additionally, it has posted a severe tracking error that seems to be getting higher – 49.67% over the past year alone. This means it is basically fluctuating 50% more than its underlying holdings. Finally we can see that there is a decent amount of short interest outstanding for this ETF, as well. Seeking Alpha Conclusion Considering all of this, I just don’t think this ETF makes much sense. It is concentrated in cryptocurrency – its number one holding simply owns Bitcoin outright – and all the while it isn’t able to generate even a fraction of the returns of BTC. All of this while being extremely correlated with BTC. With the expenses one has to pay here, as well as the poor ETF metrics, this one’s a sell in my book.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594553-blok-etf-subpar-crypto-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11866021.jpeg

42421076,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRen,1681758424,Hannah Siegel-Gardner: What's Next for NFTs?,"Imagine getting a phone call from your high school buddy offering you the next-best career opportunity of your life. Sounds too good to be true, right?  That’s exactly what happened with Hannah Siegel-Gardner who first entered the non-fungible token (NFT) space after her high school buddy Erick Calderon called her to join his Ethereum-based NFT project Art Blocks.  “Erick and I went to high school together. So we've known each other for a really long time. He's always been an innovator and creator. I was really curious to see why he thought this [Art Blocks] had legs and where he was going with that.”  Hannah Siegel-Gardner is a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival April 26-29.  For Siegel-Gardner, Art Blocks was the perfect platform to integrate her diverse professional experiences. She had worked in contemporary arts and with tech firms, which is why this move felt more like a symbiotic integration of her talents. Siegel-Gardner left no stone unturned in understanding the ever-evolving world of NFTs.  “I just had my third baby. And she was, like, nine weeks old. And so I was up a lot at night and that's when I got my Ph.D. in NFTs. Because I would just read everything I [could] get my hands on,” she told CoinDesk in an interview.  Today, Art Blocks is known as a pioneer in generative art, which takes styles and palettes chosen by artists and then, by using an algorithm, creates a randomized image. Last year the company transacted more than $172 million in primary sales, while total lifetime sales have topped $2 billion.  It took a lot more from Siegel-Gardner’s side to establish a successful company in the crypto world. Think of her and Calderon’s effort as a fusing of centralized rules with decentralized values. They were working towards creating a company culture that is growth-oriented, empathetic and supportive of its employees.  “We're both honoring the decentralization that’s at the core of what we do, but also having some centralized processes in terms of how we conduct our finances and how we operationalize our company,” she said.  We reached out to Hannah Siegel-Gardner to talk about what makes a crypto firm successful.  This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.  What made you shift to the NFT generative art space? Especially since your background was in traditional media platforms like public radio.  Everybody looks at public media in my background and is, like, “That's a bold choice!” And I’m, like, “Oh, is that a backhanded compliment?” So, I was the fourth hire at Art Blocks and I think a good 75% of the Art Blocks staff would say that a lot of us came to work at the firm because of Erick Calderon, also known as Snowfro.  So Erick called me one day and he had a really compelling vision. He was so excited about this thing that he was calling his passion project, which is kind of a funny way to describe it at this point. And the vision was at the intersection of this interesting work area for me. I have an art background, I've worked in contemporary art and I've worked in tech, and I never saw this kind of symbiotic relationship come together in the way that he was describing. So that was really interesting to me.  The other parts of this were that Erick and I went to high school together. So we've known each other for a really long time. He's always been an innovator and creator. I was really curious to see why he thought this has legs and, like, where he was going with that. And then I just had my third baby, and she was, like, nine weeks old. And so I was up a lot at night and that's when I got my Ph.D. in NFTs, because I would just read everything I [could] get my hands on.  And were you nervous making that move?  The other part of this was Erick and I did everything, including my job responsibilities, which at that time were legal, HR, accounting, marketing, very traditional like, Web3 stuff. And so it was really about building for me and I'm really happy. That's my sweet spot when I'm building. I could really be doing anything. So yeah, it was scary, but also Art Blocks was already profitable at that point. So to join his startup to capitalize and have a profitable project, it felt like it was a pretty safe bet. And also, I trust Erick.  In your experiences, has marketing ever felt like lying?  Oh, interesting. It has in the past. But now I meet with a lot of big brands that are kind of, like, what is the secret sauce to what Art Blocks is doing? How have you crafted this community? Why are people interested in this project? Like there’s some magic bean that I can hand over, when, candidly, it is all about being honest and transparent, and I've never seen anything like it.  This is an audience that can see through the information. They don't like brands that are recessive to what community is. And for one of the first times in my career, you're not hiding behind a cell. You're having to be like a real human with other humans. I love it. It's demanding because of the freshness, newness and immediacy. But it doesn't feel like there's anything to hide.  Coming back to your work at Art Blocks, how much do you think artists are willing to embrace [artificial intelligence] in their work? Do they see it as a collaboration or interference?  So I'm not an expert on AI by any means. I think AI is a tool in the creative process. It can be a tool utilized by artists just like a unique algorithm is used by an artist to make creative content. I'm interested to see what the future holds, like how these tools come together and how people decide what lies in its purpose from an artistic point of view. Personally, I see it as a tool.  What is the most interesting metaphor you can think of to describe Art Blocks?  I think our brand reflects Erick, honestly. I think we're like nerdy tinkerers that really love building and understanding the next proof of concept. Like, what's next? Where does this go? How far can this take us?  OK, I’m curious now. What is Erick Calderon, aka Snowfro, like in person?  I would say one of our core values [at] our company is being humble and having empathy. And he's a reflection of that. He's also really enthusiastic and will give you his time, probably to his own detriment, about any topic that's of interest to you. Like, his full attention and time. A really great example [is] when I started [at] Art Blocks early on, I would email him an idea and I would get a whole dissertation back of how he had thought about it, what might be next steps, where he could see it out in the world. So he's really thoughtful.  What does it mean to be an “adult” company in the crypto space?  Early on I think we did some fundamental culture building and operational building. And a lot of that was put together by our chief operating officer, who understood that we needed to really pay attention to the regulatory space. That we're both honoring the decentralization that’s at the core of what we do, but also having some centralized processes in terms of how we conduct our finances and how we operationalize our company.  I think a startup can work where it is super-scrappy, all hands on deck or hair's on fire all the time. But to retain employees you have to understand that there is a life outside of this company, and have a consistent set of values. So we worked really hard on understanding what our corporate values were and then translating that into actionable steps and pieces of the pie that employees could access. We have three months of maternity and paternity leave. I've actually never had that. So I think we formalized some things that we had always probably wanted in our own corporate lives and made them come to life in Art Blocks.  What do you think of Doodle’s attempt at rebranding itself away from NFTs? Would Art Blocks ever make a similar move?  Generative art works on the blockchain. It's like [a] blockchain-native form of creative expression. Who knows what's gonna happen? Never say never, but I don't think media is a next step for us. Like I said, proof of concept and understanding the edges of where this goes is really where our hearts are. And that's directly tied to creative expression with blockchain.

11864508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527190,1681758029,"Bitcoin Takes A Dive Below $30,000, What’s Next For BTC?","Bitcoin (BTC) has failed again to remain above its critical psychological level at $30,000, and it’s currently trading at $29,500. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to revisit lower levels to regain its bullish momentum. Most altcoins are reaching new highs and gaining dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Transaction Count Near Cycle Highs, Bullish Sign? Bitcoin Dominance Hits Range Highs Daan Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently commented on the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. According to Daan, when Bitcoin dominance hits the top of its range, it often precedes a move down to the bottom of the range. To illustrate this point, Daan marked out three previous periods where BTC.D hit (near) the top of the range and moved down to the bottom. The range that Daan marked out sits at approximately 39-49%. During the first move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2021, Bitcoin’s price remained flat with a slight upward trend. However, during the second move down on BTC.D from October 2021 to January 2022, Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant correction, dropping from the $60K region to the $40K region. The third move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2022 saw Bitcoin’s price drop from approximately $30K to $20K. We are again witnessing a rejection from the Bitcoin dominance range highs, which could signal a potential move down to the bottom of the range. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin has a near-term support level of $29,500. This level was previously a strong resistance but has now flipped to become an essential support for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency experiences a further decline, the $28,600 level is expected to serve as another key support floor. Red Months For BTC Incoming? Onchain Edge, a crypto analyst, recently examined the historical price performance of Bitcoin during May and June over the past 10 years. The analysis revealed five red and five green months in May, indicating a 50% chance of either outcome. Furthermore, there has only been one other year, 2013, where Bitcoin had four green months in a row, suggesting that predicting the May price trend is challenging. However, the analysis also looked at the performance of Bitcoin in June, where the trend continuation was observed in seven out of ten months. If May was red, then June was also red, and if May was green, then June was also green. This trend indicates that June’s price performance highly depends on May’s performance. As of this writing, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours. If Bitcoin’s dominance coincides with a potential red month of May, then bulls may face a challenging ride ahead. However, it is worth noting that the tides of the crypto winter seem to be fully in order, indicating that bulls may need to exercise patience.

42410813,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrhhl,1681758011,SEC Lays Its Cards on the Table With Assertion That DeFi Falls Under Securities Rules,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) warning shot last week that decentralized finance (DeFi) could be thrown into its expanding definition of what makes a securities exchange is the latest move to formalize what Chairman Gary Gensler has been saying: Crypto belongs in the securities world and will be regulated that way.  The crypto industry had long pleaded for specific rules or guidance from the SEC that would give digital-assets businesses certainty about how to comply or properly steer clear of the agency’s jurisdiction. The agency’s decision to explicitly fold DeFi into its proposal for a new exchange definition further underlines that the crypto financial movement won’t get tailored regulations. On the contrary, the agency is making targeted adjustments to its rules to ensure crypto will be held to existing securities regulations.  “We see this new technology, and we're not willing to make any adjustments to accommodate it,” SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said Monday on CoinDesk TV, further detailing her criticism of last week's move, which she opposed. “If you don't look exactly like incumbent firms, then we're just going to be fine with killing you off or driving you offshore or forcing you to turn yourself into a centralized entity.”  The latest maneuver, in which the agency voted 3-2 to reopen an existing proposal to widen how it defines operations that need to be regulated as securities exchanges, is aimed at bringing in new technologies that would now include DeFi. To comply with this and other SEC initiatives, crypto operations would have to decide whether to make fundamental changes – such as increased centralization. Some of those changes could threaten what’s different about their approach to money and investing.  ""The SEC is simply seeking to ban DeFi protocols in America,"" said Jason Gottlieb, a lawyer with crypto clients at Morrison Cohen in New York. ""In doing so, the SEC is substituting its own opinions for Congress' prerogative on a major question, central to the future of the American economy.""  Gottlieb said the change ""would sweep decentralized software protocols into a regulatory framework that was not built for them, and with which they literally, technologically cannot comply.""  Gensler stuck to his customary message as the commission voted on the exchange definition proposal, which is now open to a 30-day comment period before the rule can be finalized in another vote.  “Investors in the crypto markets must receive the same time-tested protections that the securities laws provide in all other markets,” Gensler said.  His SEC has now mostly arrayed its pieces on the regulatory battlefield:  It targeted trading platforms as unregistered exchanges, and has warned Coinbase its turn for an enforcement action is coming.  It labeled a number of tokens, yield products and staking services as securities.  It proposed a rule that would likely insist investment firms custody their crypto assets outside of the industry.  It proposed a “best execution” rule that would include any firms trading crypto security tokens.  Apart from last week’s vote to add DeFi to its exchange definition, last year the agency proposed a new way to define securities dealers that could similarly rope in DeFi activity.  “Nothing about the crypto markets is incompatible with the securities laws,” Gensler said in testimony prepared for a Tuesday hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. The chairman is facing the Republican-majority committee for the first time this year and is expected to be grilled on his crypto positions, which frequently run afoul of GOP preferences.  “Calling yourself a DeFi platform, for instance, is not an excuse to defy the securities laws,” Gensler intends to tell the lawmakers.  At this stage the SEC’s approach to crypto could probably only be steered in a different direction by legislation from Congress or developments in court cases, such as the outcome of its legal dispute with Ripple Labs over whether XRP is an unregistered security.  The latest enforcement action against exchange Bittrex on Monday – and a similar case last month against Beaxy – are putting into action Gensler’s rhetoric that today’s crypto exchanges are improperly trying to fulfill multiple (and sometimes conflictong) roles without registering. Gensler has often criticized crypto platforms for setting themselves up as exchanges, brokerages, custody operations and clearinghouses – each of which should properly be registered for federal oversight.  But DeFi proponents had hoped their decentralized approach would keep them out of such regulations by putting the transactions on a peer-to-peer level without companies acting as go-betweens. If the SEC approves a final version of its proposed exchange definition, calling the transactions “decentralized” won’t beenough.  “If pushed, there will be ways to innovate,” said Joshua Ashley Klayman, who heads the crypto practice at Linklaters in New York. She said the industry is replete with “exceptionally smart people” who will find ways to continue. “It may not look the way it looks now, but I think the industry will continue to evolve.""  Commissioner Peirce, who has routinely been called “Crypto Mom” for her past support of the sector, said this latest move on DeFi marks a “very consequential moment.” Several of the questions she tried to ask the SEC’s legal team before the commission’s vote were met with uncertainty from the staff. The agency’s proposal didn’t define DeFi or say exactly how those transactions would fit into its rules, but SEC officials said such operations would be measured case-by-case against its standards.  “At the end of the day, it's going to be the enforcement division that will end up making those calls,” Peirce said.

The regulator said Bittrex facilitated trading of cryptos since 2014, which it alleged were offered and sold as securities. ""From 2017 through 2022, Bittrex earned at least $1.3B in revenues from, among other things, transaction fees from investors, while servicing them as a broker, exchange, and clearing agency without registering these activities.""

42413977,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoHNT,1681754311,"Bitcoin Sinks Below $30K Amid Dollar Jump, Mixed Q1 Earnings","Bitcoin's (BTC) rally above $30,000 has stalled – at least temporarily.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $29,500, off 2.6% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin began sinking on Sunday and dropped as low as $29,292 before rebounding slightly, according to CoinDesk data.  Encouraged by mildly upbeat inflation data last week, investors sent bitcoin’s price over $30,000 for the first time since last June. The surge from $28,000, however, was ""largely untested,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto-asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Even though it breached $30,000, the price was likely to look for support on the downside and potentially consolidate before another leg up,” DiPasquale said, adding that with bitcoin recently sticking around mid-$29,000, most indicators on hourly time frames, such as the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic RSI, hint at a spike upward.  “What the bulls will want to see is a strong bounce from between the $28,000 and $29,000 range and a reclaim of $30,000 in the coming days,"" he said, although he also noted that bitcoin's price could decline to $23,000 before rebounding. In that case, “it may take longer for the upside to materialize,"" he said.  Coinglass data showed that traders who bet on shifts in price have liquidated over $32 million worth of BTC long positions since Sunday evening versus $1 million of BTC short positions. These types of long squeezes tend to send prices lower.  Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, said that several macroeconomic factors, including Monday’s U.S. dollar jump and a mixed bag of first-quarter earnings results, might have sent bitcoin’s price downward. The U.S. Dollar Index and bitcoin's price is negatively correlated, Carey told CoinDesk, adding that that correlation has decreased since the start of the year.  Elsewhere in markets  Ether (ETH) was recently hovering at about $2,084 Monday, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours but holding steady after the Ethereum blockchain's major software upgrade last week. Among other altcoins, Avalanche's AVAX token recently rallied over 7% to $20.70. Perpetuals-focused decentralized exchange dYdX's DYDX token rose by 5% to trade over $3.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down 2% in the past 24 hours.  After surging late last week, crypto-related stocks also dropped on Monday: Shares of exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) lost over 3%. MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business software company that holds a large amount of bitcoin, fell 5%.  Equity markets were mixed as investors awaited earnings reports from a number of major banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

42394064,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkSr,1681753486,Draft U.S. Stablecoin Bill Shows Major Difference Between Stablecoins and CBDCs,"A draft of a stablecoin bill that had been circulating among U.S. lawmakers since last fall was published over the weekend. At its center are stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which have conveniently been set up as a hot button issue for the upcoming election cycle.  The stablecoin part of the bill is largely concerned with Endogenously Collateralized Stablecoins and Qualified Payment Stablecoin Issuers – absurdly named if you ask me (apt for the government though).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On the former, if the bill becomes law “endogenously collateralized” stablecoins (aka algorithmic stables or ones backed by digital assets issued by the stablecoin issuer itself) would be unlawful to issue, create or originate for two years.  This seems like a good rule for U.S. lawmakers to pursue in the name of protecting Americans. Algorithmic stablecoins do not work, period. And they probably never will because they depend on a flywheel effect that works perfectly fine when things are going according to plan, but are quite literally designed to spiral to zero once hit by some exogenous shock.  The rest of the bill, however, might lean more toward bad than good.  The parts of the bill about Qualified Payment Stablecoin Issuers lay out a framework for who is allowed to issue stablecoins in the United States. The framework seems to boil down to banks, depository institutions and nonbank institutions that apply for regulatory clearance. This could be fine if we haven’t seen evidence of cloudy processes when it comes to crypto-adjacent banks.  Just ask fully reserved Wyoming bank Custodia, which has had its own fair share of issues even as it appears to be following all the proper procedures. The bill is overly paternalistic when no courter can get through. Not to be cynical, but future stablecoin issuers not named “Big Bank XYZ” might have issues providing stablecoin services because they look different than what regulators are used to seeing.  All said, where the bill definitely leans more bad than good has to do with CBDCs (which feel like stablecoins even though they’re not the same). To be clear, this bill isn’t calling for the issuance of a Federal Reserve-controlled U.S. dollar CBDC. Instead it is calling for a study on a Federal Reserve Digital Dollar to be released within one year and a briefing on CBDCs within 180 days of the bill becoming law.  Yeah, yeah – studies and briefings are just studies and briefings, but the conversation around CBDCs in Washington, D.C., will be critically important. If the U.S. government does implement a CBDC one day, it should be done in a way that maintains personal privacy and doesn’t allow the government to implement draconian monetary policy on a whim.  It sounds dramatic, but a fully surveillable, programmable and centrally controlled CBDC would benefit almost no Americans and should generally not be adopted by the government as a genuine path forward into the “digital future.”  See also: Centralized Stablecoins Are Problematic.

While the Ethereum Shapella launch was much about allowing validators to withdraw staked ETH rewards, crypto enthusiasts and the blockchain community felt some uneasiness and worry about the impact these developments would have on Ethereum price and its staking pool platforms. For one, the RPL token cleared the doubts of many as it followed suit with Ethereum’s previous week’s rally, recording a whooping 4-day bullish streak on the daily price chart. But this leaves us with a question – will it continue and ride on to a fifth-day streak? Rocket Pool Token Hovers Around Previous Day Close, Will It Step Up? The Ethereum staking pool platform, Rocket Pool has seen a drop in the price of its native token which hovers around the previous day’s close after tentatively reaching a daily high of $64.29. According to Coinmarketcap data, the RPL token is trading at $58.31 which is a 5.25% increase from its daily lows sitting at $55.22 earlier today. Related Reading: Changes in the Crypto Market Following the Shapella Upgrade As many crypto analysts and traders speculate on RPL closing prices for today’s trade session, it is important to note that Bitcoin had a role to play in determining the direction and price continuation of the staking pool platform token. From time immemorial, Bitcoin price action and movements have always had an effect on Altcoin prices with its previous week’s euphoric rally changing the dimensions of market sentiments and outlook in the crypto markets Earlier today, Bitcoin failed to scale through its $30,400 resistance area, and as such, has fallen sharply to the $29,600 price level, thereby tanking the prices of some Altcoins, including Rocket Pool. However, RPL has maintained some sort of resilience and price balance despite BTC retracement and could be a good sign of bullish strength and continuation if Bitcoin somehow recovers and reclaim the $30,000 region. Rocket Pool token trading activity on the daily timeframe |Source: RPLUSD on TradingView RPL Liquid Staking Pool Ranks High On Defillama Despite Ethereum withdrawals surpassing $2 billion as a result of the recent Shapella launch, ETH staking on staking pools has seen tremendous activity and awareness. Related Reading: Bears Drag Ethereum Below $2,100 Support As ETH Withdrawals Cross $2 Billion To get a clearer picture of this, Rocket Pool is now ranked by Defillama as the third ETH staking pool by total value locked (TVL).

San Francisco-based Founders Fund was founded in 2005 by a big-name roster of partners, including billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel. The firm broadly invests across all stages and sectors and its portfolio companies include Lyft, Facebook, SpaceX and Stripe.  “Historically, crypto founders have felt the need to bring on a specialized, crypto-only investment fund alongside traditional VCs,"" said Krug in a Medium blog post.

The three-day-long flagship non-fungible token (NFT) conference took place as temperatures ranged between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, uncharacteristically hot for mid-April.  The main programming took place at New York City's Javits Center, a convention venue on the west side of Manhattan where over 6,000 attendees flowed through the glass doors. Sponsored by companies including layer 2 blockchain Immutable, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea and Amazon Web Services, event partners hosted galleries, metaverse exhibitions and lounges for degens to do their networking.  While 2023’s event used a single location (unlike NFT.NYC 2022’s scattered approach, which had programming in seven venues in Times Square), the Javits Center felt empty despite the 1,300 speakers on eight stages over three full days.  From programming covering such topics as NFT regulation, intellectual property (IP) gaming, fashion, health and the metaverse, the content of the event itself seemed to mature as Web3 has become synonymous with the emerging industry of tokenized assets.  Stepping out of the air-conditioned building onto the sunny roof of the Javits Center, looking over the Hudson River, it felt as if the blazing sun wasn’t penetrating into the panels and sessions inside the glossy building.  But the heat was real, begging the question, where did the surge in NFT energy across NYC really come from? The answer – the side events.  Yat Siu, chairman of Web3 gaming and venture capital firm Animoca Brands, told CoinDesk in an interview immediately following an event he hosted that although NFT.NYC itself may have not been well attended, the side events fueled the energy of the week.  “All of these events bring people together,” said Siu. “The actual excitement happens in all sorts of restaurants and bars, and other people you connect with and so, I think that's really the magic.”  But although the true value of the conference may, as in past years, be found in the events scattered around New York City, NFT.NYC was also characterized by the drama that emerged from these side events, both from real-life parties in the city as well as online activities and crypto Twitter.  NFT Now Gala celebrates 100, but one sparks controversy  The hours that followed Web3 publication NFT Now’s release of the NFT100 list on April 11, a list recognizing the biggest names in the NFT space, were joyous for the creators, collectors, builders and influencers featured. Everyone named on the list, holders of its loyalty token the Now Pass and other guests were invited to the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center for the NFT100 Gala, which CoinDesk was invited to attend.  Drinks flowed, artists and executives caught up and attendees cheered as Matt Medved, CEO and editor in chief of NFT Now, lauded the audience for its persistence in fighting through a tough year for Web3.  However, less than a day later, NFT Now said it was removng one of the names from the list due to an infraction of the publication’s editorial guidelines.  “We aim to be a positive force in the space and we are committed to not encouraging harassment, so we are not naming this individual here per our editorial guidelines,” NFT Now wrote in a tweet. “Interested individuals can learn who was redacted and why by visiting the site.”  Upon visiting the site, it’s obvious the individual was Nicole Benham, founder and CEO of media company Beyond the Interview. Benham’s photo was removed and the word “redacted” follows her name. An editor’s note on her profile explains that “it has been determined they violate our criteria.”  The Wednesday following the gala, Benham posted a Twitter thread explaining her involvement in what appears to have been a pump-and-dump scheme. Tuesday afternoon, Benham promoted the free mint of NFT collection Blocky Doge 3 created by Dogecoin creator BillyM2k, featuring pixelated profile pictures (PFP) of the iconic Shiba Inu dog.  As she hyped the collection on Twitter spaces, she dumped 220 of the 250 Blocky Doge 3 NFTs she owned. According to data from OpenSea, the collection’s average price lost half of its value in 24 hours.  “There were mistakes made in a wallet that I controlled,” said Benham in a tweet. “How the last 24 hours went down was not cool and I’m doing my best to rectify the situation.”  Benham received backlash from followers for not only her actions, but the language surrounding her “apology” – which noted she never said the word “sorry.”  Betty, the creator of popular NFT collection Deadfellaz, said in a tweet that NFT Now’s choice to single out Benham was “discriminatory,” and that many other names on the list have participated in the same behavior that forced Benham to be removed from the list.  “There is nowhere in this statement that I say the behavior is correct or right or justified,” said Betty. “I’m saying apply it to all if it's going to be applied.”  Sotheby’s reboots glitch art auction following outcry  On Thursday, the long-awaited, tumultuous Sotheby’s “glitch art” sale finally went live for the public during NFT.NYC, this time with more diverse artists included.  Sotheby’s original glitch art NFT auction was set for the end of March and called “Natively Digital: Glitch-ism,” and featured work from digital artists XCopy, Luis Ponce, jakethedegen and others.  However, immediately after the collection launched, it was taken down after a lack of diverse representation was called out by both the featured artists and others in the glitch art community.  NFT artist Patrick Amadon, who was featured in the original sale, pulled his work a day after the sale went live due to the lack of female-identifying artists represented in the collection.  “Representation is important. Inclusivity is important,” said Amadon in a tweet. “It's critical that we build this movement correctly since everything we do now not only affects our community today, it will affect thousands on thousands of future artists that inherit what we've left them.”  Sotheby’s announced the new collection, “Glitch: Beyond Binary,” to better showcase the diverse artists who have contributed to the glitch art movement. The new collection, curated by glitch artists Dawnia Darkstone and Dina Chang, incorporates works from female artist Ina Vare, non-binary artist Sky Goodman and many others who deserved representation in the sale.  “In co-curating Glitch: Beyond Binary, I aspired to present an eclectic ensemble of exceptional artists, each with their distinct vision and approach to the realm of glitch art,” said Darkstone in a tweet. “My selection was driven by a desire to reveal the multifaceted nature of this genre.”  Sotheby’s plans to open the sale on April 19.  Bored Apes slip as a whale’s fortune fails  It was perhaps a good thing that NFT behemoth Yuga Labs decided not to host its annual Ape Fest, an event token-gated for Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holders, at the same time as NFT.NYC this year.  On April 13, the floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection slid to a five-month low of 55.59 ether (ETH), or about $116,00.  What happened? Twitter user “Franklinisbored,” a noted BAYC whale, sold at least 37 of his apes according to data from OpenSea. He cited “liquidity issues,” and the need to pay off loans on NFT lending platform BendDAO, prompting him to sell his tokens.  He later shared that he was scammed out of 2,000 ETH, about $4.2 million, in what he said was a “casino gambling [P]onzi.”  “Please learn any lessons possible from this,” said Franklinisbored in a tweet.  Adam Clegg, studio design director at Web3 gaming company Liithos and active Bored Ape holder told CoinDesk that NFT markets aren’t mature enough to handle whales making such large trades, thus contributing to collection values tanking so drastically when one person sells.  “In traditional finance, or even with larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or [ether], two retail investors could never swing an entire market like that,” said Clegg. “I think that people need to understand that when you’re investing in NFTs you’re taking on a large risk and personal responsibility of keeping them safe.”  As of writing, the Bored Ape NFT floor price has fallen to 54.91 ETH, about $114,000.  Despite crypto winter, there’s still warmth for NFTs  The 10 months that followed NFT.NYC 2022 couldn’t have been worse for crypto.  Between the fall of crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, the explosion of leading exchange FTX, and the most recent banking crises of Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, events have made liquidity low across the cryptocurrency market. Add in growing regulatory scrutiny and general economic uncertainty, and the vibe had definitely shifted from 2022.  Although last year’s conference immediately followed a sharp collapse of ETH, energy was still high among attendees. NFT collections Pudgy Penguin and Cool Cats owners attended token-gated parties, marketplace Magic Eden hosted a yacht party and Yuga Labs hosted its first Ape Fest. Madonna even performed at an event hosted by the World of Women NFT project.  While this year’s side events were less lavish in comparison, they still had plenty of attendees flocking to events all over the New York metro area.  From artist Beeple’s event with NFT collective Proof in Brooklyn celebrating the new Moonbird Diamond collection, to Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova’ and NFT platform Palm DAO’s “Call for Feminist Art” celebration in Soho, to Steve Aoki’s performance at the Animoca Brands and Sandbox party in Midtown, NFT.NYC wasn’t shy of parties and people sharing their enthusiasm and plans for Web3.

42394059,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVk8L,1681749800,Who Really Benefits From CBDCs? It’s Not the Public,"It’s hard to imagine why anyone would be in favor of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The benefits are few and far between but the risks of abuse are severe.  While CBDC boosters may profit from advocacy or working to secure CBDC design contracts with governments, it is governments that are likely to see the lion’s share of potential CBDC benefits.  Nicholas Anthony is a policy analyst in the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Norbert J. Michel is vice president and director of the CMFA.  Even longtime supporters of central banking recognize that CBDCs would offer no unique benefits to the general public. “I keep asking anybody … to explain to me what problem [CBDCs are] solving,” said Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “And all I get is a bunch of hand-waving.”  As we have explained at length in a new policy paper for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, CBDC proponents have been quick to list many potential benefits – but these benefits largely fail under any amount of scrutiny.  Read more: U.S. House Committee Publishes Draft Stablecoin Bill  Consider just one of the arguments: that a CBDC will improve financial inclusion. According to surveys by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), people most commonly lack bank accounts because they either do not have enough money to meet minimum requirements, want to preserve their privacy or do not trust banks. A CBDC is unlikely to help with any of these issues.  Let’s start with trust. A CBDC might sound like an attractive alternative for people that don’t trust the banks, but there’s a problem: People don’t trust the government either. Pew Research has found public trust in the U.S. government is at historic lows. Scratch that off the list, then.  What about privacy? Banks do ask a long list of questions and make customers jump through several hoops. But it would be a mistake to think a CBDC is a solution when much of this information is collected because the government has deputized banks as law enforcement investigators under the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act regime. Although privacy enhancing technology is available, central bankers from the Federal Reserve to the European Central bank have already said anonymity is off the table. In other words, a CBDC may very well be the capstone in the Bank Secrecy Act regime.  That just leaves the minimum balance requirements to consider. Set aside that income levels are a broader economic problem and assume that a CBDC is subsidized so that there are zero minimum requirements and even zero fees. That might fix the cost barrier at first glance, but it brings forth a larger problem that has been looming in the background this whole time: money and finance are not one in the same.  A no-fee CBDC account might let someone holding cash to then convert it in order to transact digitally, but a person is no more integrated into the financial system than if they were simply given a prepaid card. And giving them a prepaid card is something that can be done today. Better yet, it does not require reinventing the money in everyone’s pockets.  It only takes a small amount of scrutiny to see how problems plague other purported use cases. Put simply, CBDCs are ill suited to help financial inclusion, too late to improve payments, unlikely to advance monetary policy and simply no solution for maintaining the dollar’s world reserve currency status.  CBDC support (or lack thereof)  So why would people be for CBDCs? Most people who know about CBDCs are not for them. Yet government officials, CBDC advocacy groups and government contractors are another matter.  Unfortunately, it seems governments recognize that CBDCs are one of the best tools for solidifying their control over money and payments. It was only just recently that a former adviser to President Biden testified before Congress that a CBDC would be the “single best step” to crowd out cryptocurrencies.  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde even said that if central banks do not push forward with CBDCs amidst the rise of cryptocurrencies then they risk losing their control over money and payments. The Central Bank of Indonesia has said much of the same.  Government officials are not alone in thinking like this. An entire industry of private sector players has emerged in hopes of profiting from CBDC development. From advocating CBDC research to developing CBDC technology, many have recognized that there is a huge profit opportunity on the table. In fact, at a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has declared war on cryptocurrencies, it shouldn’t be a surprise that some are shifting the application of cryptocurrency technology to CBDCs.  Government officials and their cronies may stand to benefit from the rise of CBDCs, but the potential for abuse is likely to leave everyone else paying for it. It’s for this reason that Congress should prohibit both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury from moving forward with any form of CBDC. Fortunately, that just may happen. Representative Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have all introduced legislation to ban a government CBDC. Even state officials, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have taken notice.  If efforts like these are successful, it may just be that the public does not end up paying the price for a CBDC.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,"Nicholas Anthony, Norbert Michel",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/17/who-really-benefits-from-cbdcs-its-not-the-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s What This Metric Says,"Is Bitcoin truly done with the bear market bottom or is there more to come still? Here’s what the “RHODL ratio” has to say about it. Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Has Been Declining In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, the leg for the next bull run could be here according to the RHODL ratio. The “Realized HODL” (RHODL) ratio is an indicator that measures the ratio between two RHODL waves. The RHODL wave bands are groups of the Bitcoin supply divided based on the age of the coins. For example, the 1-2 years wave band includes all coins that are between one and two years old. Usually, the RHODL ratio is taken between segments of the “long-term holder” (LTH) and “short-term holder” (STH) groups. The LTHs include all investors that have been holding their coins since at least six months ago, while the STHs have been holding them since less than this threshold amount. In the context of the current discussion, the wavebands of interest are the 6 months to 2 years (meaning that the LTHs who bought within a cycle) and 1 day to 3 months (the youngest of the STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Transaction Count Near Cycle Highs, Bullish Sign? The analyst here has taken the RHODL ratio between these two bands, meaning that its trend can provide hints about how the capital is rotating between the STHs and LTHs. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Bitcoin RHODL ratio for these two groups has changed over the entire history of the cryptocurrency: The value of the metric seems to have sharply declined in the last few months | Source: James V. Straten on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin RHODL ratio for the 6 months to 2 years and 1 day to 3 months wave bands had hit some pretty high values back when the crash due to the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX took place. So far, the lows that were observed after this crash have been the lowest the cryptocurrency has gone during the current cycle. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the trend that the indicator showed during the bear market bottoms of the past cycles. It looks like the RHODL ratio for these cohorts has always hit relatively high values during the major bottoms in the asset’s price. If this historical trend is anything to go by, the fact that the lows after the FTX crash displayed a similar pattern may suggest that those prices were indeed cyclical lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise Fueled By Stablecoins, On-Chain Data Suggests There is always the chance, though, that the indicator could reverse its trend and rise to even higher highs, which would then coincide with the true cyclical lows for the asset. However, considering that the metric has been going down pretty sharply in the past few months, it would be quite unprecedented if the trend reverses now.

42413993,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoIZl,1681748264,BoE Considers Limits on Stablecoin Payments as Parliament Debates New Crypto Rules,"The Bank of England (BoE) will consider whether to put limits on stablecoins used for payments in new rules for the sector, Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said in a speech on Monday.  The BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority plan on consulting on new rules for stablecoins later this year, Cunliffe said. Last May the bank said it will regulate stablecoins that could have an impact on financial stability. Meantime, the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will help regulators put in place rules for crypto and bring stablecoins under existing payment legislation, is nearing its final stages in Parliament.  “While, from a public policy perspective, we want competition and innovation in payments we need to guard against rapid, disruptive change that does not allow the financial system time to adjust and could therefore threaten financial stability,” Cunliffe said at the annual Innovate Finance Global Summit.  Read more: What the Bank of England’s Stablecoins Regime Could Look Like  The new rules will look to regulate stablecoins like commercial bank money, “including the requirement that the coins should be redeemable from the stablecoin arrangement, in fiat money, at par value and on demand,” Cunliffe said. Stablecoins, however, will not receive protection against failure in the same way that commercial bank deposits do. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) provides deposit insurance of up to 85,000 pounds (US$105,059) for bank customers.  The stablecoin rules will follow principles established by the Bank for International Settlements' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure and the International Organization of Securities Commissions last year, Cunliffe said.  New ledger technology that powers crypto could also make way for digital bank notes issued by central banks, or tokenized bank deposits, Cunliffe said. These could use smart contracts to settle transactions. He stressed the importance of developing an approach for tokenized bank deposits alongside the stablecoins regime.  ""This will allow banks and nonbanks alike that want to develop payment solutions using new technologies to understand clearly what is possible and what is required in the respective regulatory regimes,"" Cunliffe said.

The token bucked all bearish trends last week, soaring higher amid a market-wide downturn. These impressive moves place INJ in the 9th place among top-gaining coins today, with an over 5% price increase over the past 24 hours. At press time, INJ trades at $9.31, slowly edging near the $10 mark. The token could be on its way to higher highs in the coming days. INJ Price Surges Amid Increased Ecosystem Development Activity The last few days have been bubbling with activities in the Injective ecosystem. According to an April 16 tweet, Injective mainnet integrated with Kraken Exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only that, the proposal to migrate Pyth Network to an Injective mainnet received a 98% approval rate. This integration will make Injective the only IBC-enabled Layer1 blockchain with Pyth on-chain, allowing users to access crypto and real-world asset data. Related Reading: Little-Known Crypto WOO Outshines DEX Tokens With Surprise 32% Spike Also, Fiat on-ramps for native INJ went live last week. In addition, the network launched its first Hackathon program and integrated dual rewards on Astroport, a Cosmos-based liquidity provider. The Dual Rewards Proposals aim to incentivize INJ staking on Astroport. It allows the INJ community to earn staking rewards on liquid stakes while earning yield from stINJ. The project’s success has already manifested in INJ Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data on Defilama, the IJN’s TVL on Astroport has increased by 48%, while that of Helix rose by 23.53% over the past seven days. Data on Stelareum shows a rapid rise in the total value locked on Injective protocol from $9.66 million on April 13 to $12.488 million on April 17. As of April 12, total assets on the Injective blockchain exceeded $500 million. The increased network activity could be related to the INJ token’s impressive price moves. Besides the price increase, INJ has recorded a notable increase in trading volume of 24.01% over the past 24 hours. INJ Token Price Outlook Although the global cryptocurrency market cap decreased today, investor sentiment remains bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index at 69. Therefore, most cryptocurrency prices are trading with gains as the bulls take control of the market. INJ’s sentiment is even more bullish with the numerous ongoing activities in the Injective ecosystem. Since the start of April, INJ’s price moved with bullish momentum, rising from $4.19 on March 29 to its current price of $9.3, an over 115% increase. INJ price has more than tripled since starting January at $1.2714 and rising bullishly above $3 in February. INJ is 1,260% higher than its all-time low price of $0.6557, recorded on November 3, 2020. Despite being over 60% lower than its April 2021 all-time high, INJ has increased by over 2,000% since its launch.

Greg Siourounis, an economics professor at Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences in Athens, Greece, and formerly with Barclays Capital, takes the newly created position immediately.  The appointment forms part of the year-old blockchain’s efforts to bolster activity across the network by promoting the development of decentralized applications and expanding the user base. It’s a goal that will require Sui to foster an inclusive community that brings many different types of people into the fold, Siourounis told CoinDesk.  “Our aim as a foundation is to increase awareness about the blockchain, not only with the developers community … but also with the rest of the world, which is entrepreneurs, startups, corporates, governments,” Siourounis said.  The Sui Foundation will continue to fund grants to the network’s builders and support initiatives to educate the community on the technology underpinning its network, he said. The foundation currently funds developer grants ranging between $10,000 and $100,000 in addition to distributing its native SUI token as supplements to those awards.  The Sui Foundation will also promote research into blockchain technologies, knowledge of which remains limited. It’s a move that will foster more compassion and collaboration within and beyond the decentralized finance world as regulators continue to crack down on the digital asset industry, Siourounis said.  “The main issue we have is that there's not enough knowledge about blockchain technology and what it can bring to our community and the world, and how this can help actually change the everyday life of everyone out there,” Siourounis said.  Mysten Labs-backed Sui, the brainchild of ex-Meta Platforms engineers, launched early last year as a high throughput, low latency and inexpensive platform to execute smart contracts and power applications. The blockchain is in the process of launching an initial coin offering for its native token SUI.

This recent purchase showcases the growing interest of crypto whales on SHIB after the Shibarium Beta Testnet, Puppynet launch. According to a report by Bitcoin World, Puppynet fueled unprecedented growth in the Shiba Inu network, evidenced by the exploding number of new wallets and transactions. New Whale Bought SHIB Worth $40.24 Million In A Single Transaction According to recent data from Etherscan.io, a new whale bought 3,484,812,794,902.91 Shiba Inu tokens worth $40.24M in one transaction. The whale only holds SHIB tokens in their wallet and is currently the 29th-highest Shiba Inu holder. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slowdown At $30,000 Only Temporary, Here’s Why Apart from the new investor, another SHIB whale ranked the 19th largest SHIB buyer accumulated 171,680,526,401 SHIB worth $1,885,051 in four different transactions. The whale amassed these large tokens on April 13, making it 3,656,493,321,303 accumulated by two whales within five days. These accumulations followed an announcement that the Shiba Inu team intends to launch a crypto portal in addition to the updated ShibaSwap. The portal will offer a venue for news, data, graphs, trends, and other community-related material. Interest In Shiba Inu Spikes With Continuous Development Puppynet’s most recent data shows that in the last 24 hours alone, new wallet addresses have joined the network, increasing the total number of addresses to 10,674,798, a notable rise over the previous two days. Additionally, with an average block time of approximately 7.6 seconds, the Puppynet network has already processed 3,292,323 transactions. Gas prices on the network are currently 1.01 Gwei, making transactions accessible to users. Another notable development is that Shiba Inu project leader Shytoshi Kusama pointed out the arrival of ShibaSwap 2.0 in a Telegram message, writing, “Ignore anything that says otherwise.” During the same session, Kusama shared his happiness with the advancements achieved on the beta version of Shibarium, Puppynet. He did stress that SHIB still has “a long way to go.” Related Reading: FTX Token (FTT) Price Doubles In 24 Hours, Here’s Why Although specifics of ShibaSwap 2.0 are not yet out, the community anticipates several improvements and innovations.

42394072,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkxd,1681741732,"Decentralization Is the Point, and We’re Not Talking Enough About Why","Lots of critics have a hard time seeing the value proposition of blockchains, and I can’t entirely blame them. As I often have to tell my clients, anything you can do on a blockchain you can do better, faster and cheaper with a centralized system. So why bother at all?  Blockchains are absurdly complicated systems where everyone is checking everyone else’s work. You thought public key encryption was tedious? Try wrapping your head around zero-knowledge proofs. I have, frankly, given up and just trust the EY R&D staff when they tell me the math works.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  So what is the value proposition of a public blockchain? Why go to all that trouble? The answer is decentralization. It’s the only thing you can truly have on a public blockchain that you cannot have in any other system. And we’re not talking very much about why decentralization is immensely important for every single company on Earth and for all our longer-term prosperity. A reasonable guess as to how much decentralization is worth is about $1 trillion a year in the U.S. alone, and it’s growing every day.  Decentralization has always mattered, but we’ve rarely noticed because it used to just be the way the world worked. We used to have a great deal more decentralization than we do today. As a child, visits to my grandparents in Europe were this amazing world of nearly the same but not quite: Blaupunkt radios, Grundig televisions, Marks & Spencer clothes – all things I did not see in the United States. Even the things that you might expect to be the same were not. Ford Escorts in Europe bore little resemblance to the cars sold in the United States.  This decentralization didn’t require any planning and conscious work. It was basically impossible in the old days to run global organizations. Before we had global companies we had multinationals. The names are different because multinationals were companies that operated in many countries, but they were unique firms in different countries. Products looked different around the world because there were no real-time data networks for design collaboration. When a five-minute international phone call cost as much as a dinner for the whole family, it was not practical to have global design or engineering teams. And we didn’t have global software products or data networks either.  Decentralized networks have a wonderful track record of becoming monopolies without becoming predatory.  Gradually, one bit at a time, that world of local products and variations has disappeared, largely because digital technology enables scale and integration. Over the decades manufacturing scale and digitization have obliterated thousands of smaller brands and companies. This has been a good thing for all of us. In our modern global economy, radios, televisions and clothes are all much cheaper than they used to be.  But while scale has consolidated manufacturing and made stuff very inexpensive (and uniform), digitization has brought us a new global age of centralized digital monopolies and cartels, and that’s not a good result.  The root cause here is that digital marketplaces are pretty much all natural monopolies, and software and networks are turning just about everything into a digital marketplace.  Take something simple like a taxi ride. As a child, taxi rides were different everywhere. In London they were an expensive luxury. In Athens, an affordable convenience. In New York, an unavoidable expense, especially if you were going to and from an airport. They were all different and unique. Now, they’re all digital marketplaces for ride sharing. Two companies dominate that business globally.  Read more: Paul Brody – Policymakers Should Embrace DAOs in the New Future of Abundance  The economics of software and networks make this unavoidable. The value of a network, whether it is for instant messaging or ride sharing, gets bigger as you add more users. The more users you have, the more attractive it is for other users to join the network. Over time it becomes increasingly difficult, and eventually nearly impossible, to catch up with the market leader.  Don’t get me wrong. This process is immensely valuable for business transformation. Early stages of investment to digitize and perfect a marketplace are immensely difficult and create enormous value. Building a real-time system to match drivers and riders in nearly every city, integrated with GPS maps and directions, pricing models, reputation systems and payment systems is a Herculean task. The results are so amazing when you first take one of these rides, it almost feels like magic. You get in, you ride and you get out and walk away.  Though the early days of digital integration and marketplace development produce enormous value for buyers and sellers, eventually, things start to go wrong. At a certain point these emerging monopolies start to behave less like valuable ecosystem builders and more like extractive monopolists. Prices and fees start to rise and these companies begin an endless cycle of data mining and marketplace exploitation.  It’s the only thing you can truly have on a public blockchain that you cannot have in any other system.  This isn’t just me whining about the cost of cab fare or the occasional dishonest cabbie. The academic evidence is piling up at both the micro and macro levels. Big retailers that dominate the market are taking ever bigger shares of third-party sales. Ride-sharing companies have raised fees and “take rates” significantly in the last couple of years as the market has consolidated. At the macro level, corporate profits and industry consolidation driven by technology are at the highest levels since the gilded age of monopolies in the 1920s. We’re living in a global golden age of centralized monopolies, many of them facilitated and driven by technology.  Not all network-enabled technologies produce extractive monopolies. Decentralized networks have a wonderful track record of becoming monopolies without becoming predatory. The internet is a perfect example. TCP/IP, the core technology that underpins all our internet communications, is free, open and permissionless. Internet usage has literally become too cheap to meter in much of the world. Email is another decentralized protocol. There’s no monopoly because there’s no company at the center of these networks obliged to maximize shareholder value.  How is it that we can have a global network for nearly instant communications that is astoundingly reliable and for which the cost of usage is nearly too cheap to meter and has been running for decades without interruption, but we need to pay 30% of our cab fare to a software company?  The internet as a whole is not radically simpler than ride-sharing. The only real difference is that one is run by a couple of centralized companies and the other is a decentralized and open network. This is not about being against capitalism or free markets, this about being against monopolies and the damage they present to our prosperity.  To avoid a world of endless monopolies, we have three choices. We can stop the march of digitization and networks. We can regulate the heck out of all these monopolists. Or we can build decentralized systems that can’t become monopolies.  The first choice isn’t a real option. The second choice is a political nightmare. The third choice is called Ethereum. It’s TCP/IP for business value, a pathway to digitization without the risk that you’ll end up a cab company in a ride-sharing world.  Read more: Paul Brody - Regulators Are Bringing the Multichain Era to a Close  And how does this fit back into the bigger picture about the economy and policy? Because commercial profit-maximizing monopolies create something that economists call “deadweight losses.” That is, profit-maximizing monopolists set the price of a product at a level that maximizes their profit, regardless of what that might have to do with the cost of a product. That price, no surprise, is going to be higher than it would be in a competitive market, and therefore there will be less product consumption.  Nor is this just a matter of transferring wealth from customers to the monopolist. Yes, for sure, the monopolist makes more money, but the economy as a whole is also smaller because there is less production and less consumption overall.  How much does this all add up to? Quite a bit. Thomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University, estimates that monopolies cost American consumers about $3,600 a year, about 5% of our national output. Across the total U.S. economy that means additional costs of roughly $1 trillion.

Although there were concerns that this upgrade would cause a selloff, the opposite happened as investors focused on the long term positives of the upgrade. Ethereum has many more impactful upgrades in the pipeline. Thesis Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) remains one of the most compelling cryptocurrency investments because its developers are constantly striving to improve it. The Shapella Upgrade is just the latest example of that, as staked Ethereum can now be withdrawn. The Shapella Upgrade In an article I wrote in February, I noted that an Ethereum upgrade enabling staking withdrawals was imminent based on successful testnets run by Ethereum's development team. As I stated then, the key benefits of this upgrade include: The ability to earn a yield without sacrificing liquidity. Increasing the network security by making staking (and thus decentralized transaction validation) more attractive to more Ethereum holders. De-risking investment by putting a major upgrade in the rear view and further proving the competence of the development team. The Shapella Upgrade finally went live on April 12th, enabling staking withdrawals for all users. Some investors were concerned that despite the aforementioned benefits, this upgrade would increase short-term selling pressure as staked Ethereum became readily available for sale. However, Ethereum has risen 12% against the U.S. Dollar over the past week, essentially invalidating this concern. As noted by CoinDesk , less than 1% of staked Ethereum was queued up to be withdrawn the day of the upgrade, proving that those who staked Ethereum are mostly long term holders. While it's important to remember that Ethereum is still a risky and volatile asset that can rapidly decline for any reason (or no reason at all), the Shapella Upgrade has only increased my long-term bullishness about Ethereum. After the Shapella Upgrade, Ethereum becomes very similar to an appealing growth stock. It's deflationary, offers a yield, is liquid, is growing quickly, and has proven that it has some practical uses in areas like decentralized finance and smart contracts. Thus, I continue to expect Ethereum to outperform the market in the long term despite some volatility along the way. Caveats It's difficult to find arguments that the Shapella Upgrade will have negative impact, but for balance I'll point out a couple issues. Even after the upgrade, there's still a limit to how much ETH can be unstaked each day, an issue which is arguably exacerbated by exchanges that offer staking. Coinbase is currently quoting a ~21 day wait time to unstake Ethereum. Until this wait time declines, it's fair to argue that staked Ethereum isn't fully liquid. Another concern for risk-adverse investors is that Ethereum's staking yield is offered in ETH rather than USD, which means that its value will fluctuate with Ethereum's price. This differs from a dividend on a stock, which has a fixed USD value regardless of fluctuations in the stock price. Thus, Ethereum offering a liquid yield won't necessarily help it establish a price floor or reduce volatility. A final concern is that the success of this upgrade and Ethereum's rapid price increase over the past few months has created a sense of euphoria among many investors. Although Ethereum is still well below its all-time highs and we're just now entering a historically bullish point in crypto's four-year cycle, contrarians would argue that it's not ideal to buy when investors are happy. What Comes Next ethereum.org Since my last article, Ethereum's team has made significant updates to their roadmap . The next step after the Shapella Upgrade was formerly sharding, which would improve Ethereum's scalability by decreasing the memory footprint of validators. However, the roadmap now has this note about sharding: Layer 2 rollups have developed much faster than expected and have provided a lot of scaling already, and will provide much more after Proto-Danksharding is implemented. This means ""shard chains"" are no longer needed and have been dropped from the roadmap. The removal of sharding from the roadmap frees up developers' time to focus on other upgrades, which arguably will be more impactful to average Ethereum users. Among other ideas, these upgrades focus on lowering Ethereum's fees, strengthening security and improving the user experience: Danksharding: A way to include temporary data in transactions, which should lower transaction costs and improve scalability to >100,000 TPS. Single Slot Finality: Decreasing the time to finalize a transaction from 15 minutes to essentially instantaneous. Proposer-Builder Separation: Making it harder for validators to censor transactions by hiding transaction data prior to validation (this also enables Danksharding). Secret Leader Election: Making it more difficult to hack validators by obfuscating information about which validator will be the next to propose a block. Account Abstraction: Allowing smart contracts to serve as wallets so that users don't need a separate account/wallet to use Ethereum. This will result in better user onboarding experiences and enable new functionality like batched transactions, shared transaction fees, and account restoration without a seed phrase. Verkle Trees & Statelessness: Allowing validators to work without storing the entire state database. This will make it possible to run validators on lower end hardware with less disk space. It's unlikely that any of these upgrades will be as immediately significant for investors as Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake, which made Ethereum deflationary instead of inflationary, lowered transaction fees, reduced environmental impact, and allowed investors to earn a staking yield. However, the impact of these upgrades on end users is still profound, as Ethereum is constantly working to become faster, cheaper, more secure, and easier to use. Of these upgrades, the one that I'm most excited for is account abstraction. I believe that allowing people to use Ethereum for transactions without making them set up an unintuitive Web3 wallet will make the network accessible to a lot more people. Single Slot Finality is also an exciting one, because a faster network is objectively better. Conclusion Now that staking withdrawals are live, Ethereum is a more compelling investment because it offers a more liquid yield.

42412281,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yM2,1681740684,"Crypto Exchange Bittrex Violated Federal Laws, SEC Charges in Lawsuit","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that crypto exchange Bittrex simultaneously operated a national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency in violation of federal statutes. Former CEO Bill Shihara and Bittrex Global GmbH are also facing charges.  Bittrex worked with crypto issuers to ""delete ... 'problematic statements'"" that the SEC would investigate, the regulator said in a press release Monday, including price predictions and statements implying an ""expectation of profit."" The SEC also claims Bittrex should have registered as an exchange, clearing agency and broker, as it provided the services of all three types of entities.  SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the lawsuit against Bittrex ""should send a message to other non-compliant crypto market intermediaries.  ""As laid out in our complaint, Bittrex’s business model was based on three things: circumventing the registration requirements of the federal securities laws; counseling issuers of crypto asset securities to do the same by altering their offering materials; and combining multiple market intermediary functions under one roof to maximize profits,"" he said.  Bittrex announced last month it planned to exit the U.S. by the end of April, citing ""the current U.S. regulatory and economic environment."" This past weekend, the company shared more information, when general counsel David Maria told the Wall Street Journal that the company had received a Wells Notice – a statement that the SEC's Enforcement Division found evidence of legal violations – in March. Maria told the Journal that Bittrex would fight the suit unless the SEC provided a ""reasonable settlement offer.""  The SEC's suit is reminiscent of a recent action against Beaxy, a company that settled similar charges, and is suggestive of the charges it may bring against Coinbase (COIN), the largest exchange in the U.S., which received a Wells Notice last month.  According to the complaint against Bittrex, the SEC alleges omise go (OMG), algorand (ALGO), dash (DASH), tokencard (TKN), i-house token (IHT) and naga (NGC) are securities. Algorand's token fell on the news, dropping 2.5% in intraday trading with volume spiking.  In a statement issued following the publication of this article, Bittrex said the regulator had refused to flag the tokens it thought were securities.  ""For over five years, and despite multiple, specific requests to do so, the SEC would not provide notice of the specific conduct that it thought violated the federal securities laws,"" the statement said. ""Specifically, on multiple occasions, we asked them to tell us what digital assets on our platform they viewed as securities, so that we could review and potentially delist them. They refused to do so.""  The company said it had operated within the parameters of the law at all times, and will look forward to ""vindicating"" its position in court.  ""The SEC’s actions will directly and substantially harm U.S. customers and U.S. employees in this industry and will ultimately put our country at a significant disadvantage in the development of blockchain technology, including uses far beyond cryptocurrency, in the future,"" the company said.

At the time of writing, BTC’s low was at $29,410. The decline comes as a surprise in that the market is actually in a “bullish vacuum” at the moment. Last week, both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) were a significant positive surprise, propelling the Bitcoin price to its new yearly high. In the next two weeks, there is no major macro data coming up that is likely to move the Bitcoin price heavily. Only on May 03, this will change, when the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve is about to take place. Thus, one can currently speak of a bullish vacuum. So why is the price falling today? Why Is The Bitcoin Price Falling Today? The current movement of Bitcoin price can be considered as a technical correction. As analyst Ali Martinez writes, the resistance area between $30,270-$32,150 has established itself as a tough hurdle for BTC. Around 770,000 BTC were bought from 360,000 addresses in this area. Support for Bitcoin is provided by the area between $29,330 and $30,200, where 700,000 addresses bought around 390,000 BTC. “Be cautious. If this level breaks, the next key support is at $27,600-$28,450,” Martinez warns. Related Reading: Company Of Legendary Peter Brandt Goes Long Bitcoin, Here’s His Target Price Meanwhile, analyst “@exitpump” has pinpointed a reason for the current movement. “BTC spot dumping their coins, unusual big sell delta from Bitfinex. Walk price down and nuke it, perfect,” writes the analyst. He also shared the chart below, which shows that greater selling pressure is also coming from Binance, while the pressure from Coinbase is comparatively low. A similar analysis is also shared by @52kskew. According to him, there is a spot-driven sell-off from the day opening, while there was a clean divergence between spot selling the bounce early and perps longing into the bounce. A look at liquidation data from Coinglass shows that about $56.57 million in BTC longs were liquidated, supporting the thesis of a technical analysis.

42393886,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbffv,1681738329,Las stablecoins ganan terreno en América Latina ante la inflación mientras crecen entre los negocios europeos,"La adopción de stablecoins en todo el mundo sigue teniendo un buen ritmo a pesar del mercado bajista y la crisis bancaria que provocaron que algunos proyectos —particularmente, USDC— perdieran su paridad con el dólar estadounidense, dijeron especialistas en criptomonedas latinoamericanos y europeos durante una reciente charla en un space de Twitter de CoinDesk En Español.  “Vemos que la adopción de stablecoins sigue creciendo sin parar desde 2019. De hecho, las stablecoins hoy representan más del 50% del volumen de trading de Belo”, aseguró Manuel Beaudroit, CEO y cofundador de Belo, un exchange de criptomonedas con sede en Argentina que opera en 136 países.  Sigue a CoinDesk en Español.  “Nuestro segundo mercado más importante es El Salvador, donde bitcoin es moneda de curso legal, y muchos usuarios utilizan nuestra plataforma para depositar bitcoin a cambio de USDT”, agregó. Cabe recordar que USDT es el nombre que recibe tether, la mayor stablecoin por volumen.  Read this article in English.  La participación del mercado de las stablecoins continuó aumentando durante el mercado bajista, incluso con la caída de bitcoin, ether y otras altcoins, aseguró Agustín Liserra, CEO y cofundador de Num Finance, una empresa con sede en Argentina que emite stablecoins vinculadas a divisas de países en desarrollo.  “Si bien es cierto que la actividad cripto se redujo por el mercado bajista, la participación y capitalización del mercado de stablecoins creció bastante”, afirmó Liserra.  La adopción varía según la región. En las economías más desarrolladas, el crecimiento se vio impulsado principalmente por los traders e inversores experimentados. Pero en América Latina, son los ciudadanos comunes intentando proteger su dinero de la inflación quienes motivaron el incremento.  En Europa, la adopción de las stablecoins ha estado en aumento desde el invierno cripto de 2017, cuando la mayoría de los inversores y traders buscaban protegerse de la volatilidad dentro del sistema de criptomonedas, señaló Cristina Carrascosa, CEO y cofundadora de ATH21, una firma legal de España que se especializa en empresas de criptomonedas y blockchain.  “La adopción en Europa no vino del miedo o de la necesidad de resguardarse, sino que tuvo que ver con la especulación y el hecho de usar los protocolos DeFi para aprovechar el beneficio de los rendimientos”, afirmó Carrascosa.  De la manera latinoamericana  América Latina tiene una de las tasas de inflación más altas del mundo y hasta el 50% de su población activa trabaja en condiciones de informalidad, lo que hace que operen por fuera del sistema bancario.  En Argentina, el banco central impuso fuertes restricciones a los ciudadanos para comprar dólares estadounidenses con la esperanza de mantener sus reservas federales. Esta decisión no hace más que aumentar el atractivo de comprar stablecoins vinculadas al dólar a través de Internet. “Con una stablecoin puedes acceder a una cuenta en dólares sin tener una cuenta en dólares”, dijo Beaudroit.  “Muchas personas buscaban una manera de ‘dolarizar’ sus ahorros, y encontraron en DAI, USDC y USDT una forma muy amigable de hacerlo”, sostuvo Liserra.  Según el informe Geografía de las Criptomonedas 2022 de Chainalysis, los principales impulsores de la adopción de las criptomonedas en América Latina son el almacenamiento de valor y el envío de dinero a sus países de origen, para lo cual las stablecoins son ampliamente utilizadas.  Mientras tanto, Europa Central, del Norte y Occidental representan las economías de criptomonedas más importantes a nivel mundial gracias a las DeFi, los NFT y a la creciente claridad regulatoria, con un menor uso diario de las stablecoins.  “La nueva regulación afecta a todos los participantes, como proveedores de servicios y emisores de tokens y stablecoins, quienes necesitan solicitar licencias para operar y tener un white paper publicado”, expresó Carrascosa sobre la regulación MiCA recientemente aprobada. “Las exigencias regulatorias aumentan para los emisores de stablecoins que se vuelven ‘relevantes’ para los reguladores”, agregó.  “Los usuarios [europeos] están comenzando a olvidarse de las monedas fiduciarias, dado que el flujo de sus negocios se gana y se paga directamente en stablecoins”, añadió Carrascosa.  Esto también es una tendencia en América Latina, donde más personas ahora están ganando su salario directamente en “dólar cripto” o stablecoins para luego depositarlos en billeteras digitale y utilizarlos en la vida cotidiana, según Beaudroit.

In fact, stablecoins today represent more than 50% of Belo’s trading volume,” said Manuel Beaudroit, CEO and co-founder of Belo, an Argentina-based crypto exchange that operates in 136 countries.  Read this article in Spanish.  “Our second-biggest market is El Salvador, where bitcoin is a legal tender, and many users use our platform to deposit bitcoin in exchange for USDT,” he added. (USDT is the symbol for tether, the biggest stablecoin by volume.)  Stablecoin market share kept growing during the bear market, even with the fall in price of bitcoin, ether and other alternative coins, said Agustín Liserra, CEO and co-founder of Num Finance, an Argentina-based company that issues stablecoins pegged to developing countries currencies.  “Although it is true that crypto activity has decreased since the bear market, the participation and capitalization of the stablecoin market has grown a lot,” Liserra said.  Adoption varies by region. In more developed economies the growth was driven mainly by seasoned traders and investors while in Latin America it came more from everyday citizens trying to protect their money from inflation.  In Europe, stablecoin adoption has been increasing since the crypto winter of 2017, when most investors and traders wanted to protect themselves from volatility within the crypto system, says Cristina Carrascosa, CEO and co-founder of ATH21, a Spain-based legal firm specializing in crypto and blockchain companies.  “The adoption in Europe didn’t come from fear or from wanting to protect savings, but more from speculation and using [decentralized finance] protocols to seize the benefit of the returns,” Carrascosa said.  A Latin American way  Latin America has some of the world’s highest inflation rates, with up to 50% of its workforce working in informal conditions and therefore operating outside the banking system.  In Argentina, the central bank imposed severe restrictions on citizens from buying U.S. dollars, hoping to maintain its own federal reserves. That increases the attraction of buying a dollar-denominated stablecoin via the internet. “With a stablecoin, you can access a dollar account without having a dollar account,” Beaudroit said.  “Many people wanted to find a way to ‘dollarize’ their savings and found in DAI, USDC and USDT a very friendly way to do it,” Liserra said, referring to the stablecoins.  According to Chainalysis' 2022 ""Geography of Currency"" report, Latin America’s key crypto adoption drivers are storing value and sending remittances, for which stablecoins are widely used.  Meanwhile, central, northern and western Europe are the largest crypto economies worldwide thanks to DeFi, non-fungible tokens and increasing regulatory clarity, with a lower daily usage for stablecoins. “The new regulation affects all players such as service providers, token and stablecoin issuers who need to apply for licenses to operate and a published white paper,” Carrascosa said about the EU's recently approved MiCA regulation. “Regulatory demands increase for stablecoin issuers that become ‘relevant’ to supervisors,” she added.  “[European] users are beginning to forget about fiat currency as their business flow is earned and spent directly in stablecoins,” Carrascosa said.  This is also a trend in Latin America, where more people now earn their salary directly in “crypto dollars” or stablecoins, depositing them in wallets and using them to live every day, according to Beaudroit.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,Marina Lammertyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/17/stablecoins-gain-traction-as-inflationary-shield-in-latin-america-europe-also-sees-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2496a01a931cefc56d6e4b9453dc2068125fd8e5-2127x1196.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its positive price trend in April sparked hope for a significant rally. However, the bears returned to provide resistance to the ongoing rally. ADA’s price dropped by more than 2% in the last 24 hours, while the trading volume is down by 22.72% within the same time frame. Despite the prevailing bearish trend, ADA has retained most of its gains in 2023. It traded at $0.2498 on January 1, 2023, and is currently at $0.44 at press time, a significant increase. Like other cryptocurrencies, ADA is volatile. So, is this recent move a new bearish trend or a temporary correction? ADA Loses Momentum At $0.45 But Still Primed To Explode ADA dipped at the $0.45 mark today to retest old support levels. However, this drop in its price will likely be temporary as the previous price action stemmed from recent developmental activities. The Cardano community has distinguished itself as a developmental hub with approximately 1,225 projects currently building on Cardano. These projects make the ecosystem attractive for developers and investors alike. Related Reading: FTX Token (FTT) Price Doubles In 24 Hours, Here’s Why One such new addition is Lace 1.0, a light multifunctional wallet platform launched on the Mainnet on April 11, 2023. Such innovations spiked interest in the crypto community for Cardano as an operational base. Also, these activities helped boost its price from the $0.2 level to the $0.44 level. Despite the current slump, ADA may resume its uptrend once there is sufficient bullish pressure. When Will The Cardano Price Rally? ADA formed a red candle, seeing a second consecutive red day on the daily chart. The bulls rallied since April 7, with the price increase between April 13-15 being the most significant. Cardano exhibited a similar price pattern when it rallied between January 4 -14. A price decline occurred between January 15-18 before a resumption of the uptrend on January 19. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slowdown At $30,000 Only Temporary, Here’s Why ADA is still trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bullish sentiment in the short and long term. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 68.38, close to the overbought region of 70. The RSI is returning from the overbought zone back into the channel. However, it still reflects the buying pressure in the market. ADA’s Moving Average Convergence/ Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, indicating bullish pressure. The current price decrease for ADA closely mirrors its past price action in January 2023. ADA will likely resume its uptrend by April 20 and reclaim the $0.45 price level if the bulls prevail.

42394063,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkIb,1681737127,What DeFi Must Sacrifice to Appease Regulators,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a revolutionary force in the financial industry. When traditional banks narrowly avoided a systemic bank run, and centralized exchanges (CEX) collapsed spectacularly, DeFi kept working, providing trustless financial services to people around the globe.  Markus Maier is the founder and managing director of Violet, a privacy-focused DeFi platform.  Success, however, brought with it bad actors and illicit financial transactions that troubled regulators worldwide. An unusually successful algorithmic stablecoin soared and then collapsed, whipping out billions in dollars of capital and the loss of retail enthusiasm. Hackers stole nearly $4 billion by exploiting crypto protocols in 2022 alone (with North Korea as the prominent perpetrator). To say there’s been a loss of regulatory goodwill is an understatement – the U.S. Treasury Department now considers DeFi a national security threat.  These problems have kept most traditional financial institutions out of DeFi, which is detrimental to long-term growth and adoption of crypto. In the depth of crypto winter, the industry must find a solution to spark the next cycle and bring mass adoption.  The solution is called the “internet financial system,” or IFS, which combines the best of DeFi and traditional finance (TradFi) in one unified network. An idea championed first by Chris Burniske, IFS is built on open crypto rails and preserves blockchain’s most important attributes such as decentralized settlement, self-custody, transparency and composability.  However, the IFS tries to be genuinely inclusive, enabling the billions of people already part of TradFi and financial institutions to benefit from on-chain innovation. Connecting crypto to TradFi will not only bring more users, but also unlock trillions of assets that are currently trapped in these siloed financial systems.  To achieve this feat, the IFS must square the circle: It must be built on top of decentralized architecture while still mapping TradFi compliance and national regulatory requirements (all without giving up on privacy). It’s a monumental effort that requires new tech, standards and laws. Thankfully, this second revolution has already begun, charging ahead on three fronts:  Programmable compliance: Illicit finance is a national security issue, and lawmakers reasonably expect a new IFS to improve upon the compliance sophistication in TradFi, not jettison it entirely. The IFS must find a way to map rigorous anti-money laundering (AML) compliance in a programmatic, on-chain execution environment. Effectively, this means adopting programmable on-chain compliance, which can handle ongoing AML checks and differentiate between different laws by national origin.  Regulation: The IFS’ long-term success hinges on regulatory acceptance. We understand the DeFi community’s frustration with regulators. However, if we engage in good faith and show policymakers solutions to illicit finance problems – e.g., technology that stops bad actors before they enter the system – policymakers will craft smart, workable guidelines that balance investor and consumer protections. It has already happened years ago: the Cayman Islands included decentralized exchanges in its initial VASP [virtual asset service provider] law, signaling the country felt AML rules needed to be compatible with decentralized finance. The EU is following suit, working on comprehensive crypto regulation called MiCA.  Privacy-preserving Identity: In the IFS, compliance must not come at the expense of user privacy, even if it adheres to strict know-your-customer rules. For instance, smart contracts must not intake or expose personal data on an immutable blockchain. Smart contracts can readily accept composable access tokens that provide binary answers (yes or no) to any compliance risk a project needs to address, leaving the wallet’s on-chain anonymity intact. Standards for those privacy-preserving identity credentials have been developed for years and are now ready for prime-time in the IFS.  Consumers, institutions and regulators demand more compliant, more secure and regulatory-friendly decentralized services – and that’s precisely what we will continue striving to build.  See also: Will DeFi Emerge From Crypto Winter Stronger? / Opinion  Solving regulatory and compliance concerns in a privacy-protective way will usher in a new era where the IFS delivers on DeFi’s original promises – running all financial applications on-chain and enabling new use cases. As a result, we will make tokenized real-world assets more liquid and composable, benefit from cheaper and faster remittances, and make finance as a whole more robust and accessible.  We invite everyone to join this collective effort, which needs the best and brightest minds from various disciplines: crypto, tech, law, policy, finance and more. It will be about breaking new ground, making some compromises and delivering the future of finance.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Markus Maier,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/17/what-defi-must-sacrifice-to-appease-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfe32c5524c85bc51f0023550597b6b7f657655e-4144x2331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394074,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVlD1,1681737055,Centralized Stablecoins Are Problematic. Is a Decentralized Alternative on the Way?,"Stablecoins have become an indispensable component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, denominating 80% of centralized exchange (CEX) trades and playing a crucial role in the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Providing a stable store of value and enabling seamless transactions in a volatile market, stablecoins act as a vital link between fiat and crypto – their importance cannot be overstated.  Riyad Carey is a research analyst at Kaiko.  However, recent developments reveal a troubling trend: The most transparent stablecoins are shrinking, while their opaque counterparts are thriving. This not only undermines the trust the industry desperately needs but also poses a significant threat to the future of the crypto market.  A bad year for stablecoins  USDC  Just one month ago, USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, depegged from the U.S. dollar and dropped to 80 cents after the asset’s issuer, Circle, confirmed it had exposure to the failed Silicon Valley Bank. This price collapse can be illustrated through on-chain data; below is a chart showing how the popular stablecoin swapping pool on Curve (3pool) saw the balance of tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, drop as rumors of a banking crisis swirled. Users were selling USDC and DAI for USDT, causing the latter’s balance to fall.  In a more general sense, this chart shows a flight from two stablecoins that are transparent about their backing – USDC and the DAI token from MakerDAO – into the perceived safety of a stablecoin that hasn’t released an independent reserve report this year and whose issuer was fined by the CFTC for lying about its backing, USDT.  Last year, USDT’s issuer, Tether, was fined by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for lying about its reserve assets meant to back USDT.  USDC has since returned to its peg and the 3pool has moved closer into balance. However, USDC’s market cap has continued to fall while USDT’s is approaching all-time highs.  BUSD  Earlier this year, Paxos was forced to halt issuance of BUSD after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) stated the issuer hadn’t met its obligation to conduct risk assessments and due diligence to prevent “bad actors” from using the platform. Despite some confusion over the difference between the Paxos-issued BUSD and the wrapped versions that live on multiple chains called “Binance-Peg BUSD,” the former was one of the most transparent centralized stablecoins. Paxos was regulated by the NYDFS and published monthly independent attestations.  Before this regulatory action, the Binance exchange promoted BUSD as its stablecoin of choice, and I believed there was a decent possibility Binance would eventually delist USDT (the exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, delisted USDC last year).  With BUSD on its way out, Binance has instead turned to trueUSD, making BTC-TUSD its only no-fee BTC trading pair. In February, TUSD had a market cap of under $1 billion. Today, as a direct result of Binance’s backing, its market cap is over $2.5 billion and accounts for over one-third of BTC trading volumes on the exchange.  A quick scan of TUSD’s website is not comforting. It states that TUSD is the “first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the U.S. dollar.” The question is: Regulated by whom? TUSD’s white paper says that TrueCoin, LLC (which does business as TrustToken) is a money service business registered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). That’s well and good, but after some digging it appears that TrustToken isn’t the issuer of TUSD, Archblock is.  I’m left wondering why Binance, which is currently being sued by the CFTC, is promoting a stablecoin to which it has no public ties. The lack of transparency makes it hard to tell how much we can trust TUSD, and therein lies the problem.  A stable of solutions  It’s not totally surprising that two of the most regulated and transparent stablecoins have been punished this year. It's reflective of an age-old business problem in which companies are incentivized to grow at all costs. This trend was supercharged in the Web2 era, when tech companies sought to “move fast and break things” and deal with the fallout later. But much of the appeal of crypto – or Web3 – is its potential to write the wrongs of an internet that grew quickly without direction or cohesion.  An obvious, but so far intractable, solution to this problem would be a decentralized stablecoin. Or ideally stablecoins. Unfortunately, most of the top DeFi-native stablecoins depegged along with USDC, a centralized and censorable asset that makes up a significant portion of supposedly decentralized asset’s backing. LUSD, for instance, tied to the Liquity protocol, has been the most successful, truly decentralized stablecoin – unfortunately, it’s not that stable (it was trading above $1.01 at time of writing).  Luckily, there is some exciting innovation on the way. The obvious contender is crvUSD, created by Curve Finance, which can rightfully be considered a stablecoin kingmaker. This stablecoin will seemingly be backed with decentralized collateral like ether (ETH) and should benefit from extremely deep liquidity. There are others, too, like dinero from Redacted Cartel, which will be mostly backed by ETH. While we haven’t yet cracked the decentralized stablecoin problem, I’m confident that builders are taking steps to bring us closer.  In the meantime, centralized stablecoins will maintain their dominance. Exchanges must bear the brunt of responsibility by listing only trustworthy and transparent stablecoins. So too should institutions carefully consider which stablecoins they use.

The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  Q1: What are you hearing from your customers about investments and crypto?  We think of today’s market as quite dynamic; despite recent downturns, we’re still seeing continued demand for diversified exposure to crypto. Luno is a trusted crypto guide to over 11 million global customers with a 10-year track record. Despite the complexity of investing in digital assets, customers know that we are highly selective and undertake a rigorous process prior to adding coins to the Luno app or working with any third parties. Our customers receive the trusted crypto experience that they expect from us and are accustomed to while being exposed to diverse opportunities that are available to them in the digital asset ecosystem.  Q2: What’s the appeal of crypto investment bundles?  Investing in crypto can be intimidating, with a degree of confusion infused into it as there are over 10,000 digital assets. Not many managers have the time and expert-level knowledge to investigate which coins are likely to succeed and assess their potential risks. If you cannot pick individual winners and losers, then it usually makes sense to diversify. So, customers are looking for an easy way to build their crypto investment portfolio in a diversified manner. I’d like to underline that our diligently selected and structured crypto bundle offers customers an easy way to control their investments that is simplified for them and easy to manage.  Q3: What made you choose CoinDesk Indices as the underlying index provider for your investment bundle?  On one hand, Luno is dedicated to empowering customers in their investment decisions, so the ability to offer a chance to explore diversified investment bundles makes sense for us. On the other hand, quality and reliability are always the most important considerations at Luno, and so we only work with companies for whom quality and reliability are of paramount importance as well. With that in mind, we saw that CoinDesk Indices already applies our desired quality standards that are intended for investability; only crypto assets that meet CoinDesk’s selection criteria are included, so assets like meme coins won’t be included. In addition, according to data from Bloomberg as of March 31, approximately 70% of global crypto product assets under management track indices that are provided by CoinDesk Indices. Lastly, CoinDesk Indices has the longest track record of any crypto index provider with the broadest suite of multi-asset offerings in the digital asset space, which means customers can access reliable and diversified options to expand their investment portfolios.  Q4: Does the bundle stay up to date with the movements in the market?  The investment bundle moves with the market and is updated automatically by Luno to track CoinDesk’s indices. This means that your portfolio is always kept up-to-date with the crypto market exposure you’ve selected to best suit your investment approach. We rebalance bundles every three months in line with the rebalancing of the indices at CoinDesk Indices.  Q5: Why should customers invest in a bundle with Luno?  Our app makes it easy to learn more about bundles and the CoinDesk indices that they track. They can conveniently see the balance of their bundle, including a clear profit and loss statement and a table showing the weighting per coin, all in one place.

In October, Bittrex paid the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions and money-laundering watchdogs $30 million over allegations that the company had a poor compliance program between 2014 and 2017.  Bittrex and the SEC didn't immediately return requests for comment.

42412275,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yKA,1681734913,"Bitcoin, Ether See Bull Breather as Higher Bond Yields Support Dollar","Major cryptocurrencies traded with moderate losses Monday, while the U.S. Dollar Index tracked Treasury yields higher as the market grew more comfortable with the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue its liquidity tightening cycle in May.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell 1.7% in the last 24 hours to below $30,000, and ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain – which had a big software upgrade last week – fell 1.8% to $2,084.  The DeFi dominance index, which measures the market cap of a basket of top decentralized-finance coins as a percentage of the total crypto market, held steady at 4.3%, according to data source TradingView. On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reopened a proposal from last year to target DeFi explicitly.  In traditional markets, the U.S. Dollar Index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against other major currencies, rose to 101.80, extending Friday's 0.5% jump from 101.00. The yield on the two-year Treasury note gained nearly five basis points to 4.16%, extending the past week's 15 basis points rise. The yield on the 10-year note rose to its highest level in a month at 3.54%. Bond yields began rising on Friday after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank hasn't made much progress in bringing inflation down to the Fed's target of 2% and needs to lift interest rates further.  Traders priced an 85% probability that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5% to 5.25% next month, compared with the 66% probability seen following the release of inflation data on Wednesday, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The central bank has raised rates by 4.75 percentage points in the past 12 months, injecting volatility into risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""The 10-year Treasury yield is quietly climbing back up,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said in a daily market update. ""This needs monitoring in terms of a warning sign.  ""We would consider taking some profits as the crypto market is showing exuberant signs,"" Thielen added. ""Ideally, the delta should be replaced with upside call spreads in case prices continue to rally.""  According to Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at the FxPro, bitcoin may struggle to establish a foothold above the former support-turned-resistance level of $30,000 in the short term.  ""Traders should be prepared that the $30,000 mark for the first cryptocurrency could act as solid resistance after it was rigid support in 2021,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email.

42393884,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbfan,1681734716,Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto: CoinDesk's Projects to Watch 2023,"For the past three years the Pew Research Center has polled Americans about their exposure to cryptocurrency. The percentage of people who have “ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ether” has remained roughly 16% since 2020. But this spring, Pew sought to identify how people feel about crypto. Among the 88% who have ever heard of cryptocurrency, 75% are “not very or not at all confident that cryptocurrencies are reliable or safe.” Only 6% are very confident.  Trust in crypto is very low.  The CoinDesk editorial team didn’t need a poll to see this. Our Most Influential 2022 list, published in December, subjectively identified the 50 people who defined the year in crypto. A significant percentage of the list was feel-bad stories of scammers and hucksters and possible sociopaths who depleted customer’s savings. The list came out less than a month after the sudden and shocking collapse of FTX, capping off a year of scandals. Understandably in response, Congress, mainstream media and the public are ready to punish crypto.  To state the obvious, 2022 was the antithesis of crypto, which was invented as a remedy in 2009 to broken global financial systems and not to make sharks and charlatans rich. Bitcoin made peer-to-peer transactions possible, bypassing banks that make the transfers slow, costly and intrusive. By solving the trusted-mediator problem, bitcoin allowed transactions to be quicker and cheaper and therefore more accessible.  The CoinDesk team set about to find projects that fulfill the ethos of crypto by solving a problem. In brainstorming sessions, we debated what problems crypto could be employed to solve, which quickly split into two baskets: problems within the crypto ecosystem itself, and problems in the world generally.  Then the team explored the merits of projects aiming to solve the identified problems. From a list of more than 35 projects, we selected 19. Some haven’t launched yet, others have been around for years. Funding ranges from bootstrapped to tens of millions of dollars, to undisclosed support from a parent foundation or project. We didn't put a lot of restrictions or parameters on these projects. Crypto organizations come in many forms (from traditional startups to DAOs to major corporations). It is still relatively new and many of its brands – even if valued in the billions of dollars – are not widely recognized.     What the CoinDesk team looked for are innovative ideas, convincing proposals or evidence of success, and talented, committed people. Moreover, the problems the projects were aiming to solve had to be real, and the remedies needed. They could not just be a crypto version of something that is adequately managed in traditional finance, for instance, or purely meant for speculation or fun.  Below are CoinDesk's Projects to Watch 2023, grouped by the broad problem they aim to solve.  Making financial services accessible  The COVID-19 pandemic sped up adoption of digital services such as banking, and proved that they could be fast, flexible and reliable. But there are 1.4 billion adults – often rural, undereducated women – who are unbanked, according to the World Bank. Crypto can lower the barriers to access.  Bitcoin Beach  Machankura  Send Globally     Onboarding the next billion  This is the existential question of the entire crypto ecosystem.

BTQ  StarkNet     Making blockchains transparent  While every transaction on a blockchain is public, the details are stubbornly not transparent, at least to most users.

11855805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527119,1681734656,"Bitcoin 30-Day Transaction Count Near Cycle Highs, Bullish Sign?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin network has been observing a rising amount of transactions recently, something that may be bullish for the price. Bitcoin 30-Day SMA Transaction Count Is Near Cycle Highs Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, more than 270,000 transfers per day are occurring on the BTC network right now. The relevant indicator here is the “transaction count,” which, as its name already implies, measures the total amount of transactions taking place on the Bitcoin blockchain per day. When the value of this metric is high, it means a large number of movements are taking place on the network currently. Such a trend suggests that traders are active in the market right now. On the other hand, low values of the indicator imply the network is observing low activity at the moment, signaling that there isn’t much interest in making transfers on the blockchain among the investors. Now, the version of the metric that’s of interest in the current discussion is the “entity-adjusted” one, which means that it only counts the transactions taking place between separate entities. Here, an “entity” is defined as a single wallet or a group of them controlled by the same investor. Related Reading: Ark Invest Analyst Believes Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million, But How? The benefit of making this adjustment is that it filters out all internal wallet transactions being made by investors and exchanges, thus providing a more accurate picture of the activity taking place on the network. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the entity-adjusted Bitcoin transaction count, as well as in its 30-day and 365-day simple moving averages (SMAs), over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin transaction count had been at relatively low levels during much of the bear market, but during the past few months, the indicator has come alive again as the rally in the cryptocurrency’s price has occurred. These patterns make sense as investors show little interest in the coin whenever the price is showing a boring, consolidating movement, while they rush to make moves whenever some exciting volatile price action takes place (like the latest rally). In the last few days, the metric has hit some especially high values as the asset’s surge has continued, leading to the 30-day SMA of the indicator also rising to some high levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise Fueled By Stablecoins, On-Chain Data Suggests According to the current value of the 30-day SMA transaction count, transfers are taking place at a rate of 270,700 per day on the Bitcoin network. This isn’t too far from the cyclical peak observed back during the start of the bull run. The latest sharp growth in the indicator is a sign that the BTC network has been growing after the stagnation observed in the bear market. Generally, such growth is constructive for the price in the long term. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,900, up 5% in the last week.

The cryptocurrency’s upward movement comes after the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai software upgrade last week, although Simon Peters, an analyst at investment firm eToro, wrote in a morning note that the reaction to the upgrade was largely muted and that ether’s price jump was more of a response to macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, lost 2% in the past 24 hours to fall below $30,000. Layer 1 network Avalanche’s AVAX led gains on Monday, up 7% in the past 24 hours.

Dubbed ""Shaqtoshi"" in an FTX commercial, O'Neal is one of several celebrities, including “Shark Tank” host Kevin O'Leary, football star Tom Brady and basketball player Steph Curry, who are facing a class-action lawsuit for promoting a “fraudulent scheme.” When crypto exchange FTX collapsed O'Neal said, “I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial.”  Bitcoin is closely following its early 2019 surge and its price could peak at around $45,000 next month, according to Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research. The cryptocurrency has soared 80% this year, beating traditional risky assets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, by a wide margin. The rally comes after a 12-month decline when prices fell 76% and bottomed out in November 2022. The drop and subsequent recovery are analogous to the pattern seen in the 2018-19 bear market in terms of length and trajectory, according to Lunde. ""Bottoms in both cycles lasted for approximately 370 days. And the peak-to-trough return after 510 days of both cycles reached 60%,"" Lunde said in a note sent to clients last week. ""In 2018, the bear market rally topped 556 days after the 2017 peak, on June 29, 2019, with a 34% drawdown from the peak.""

42393888,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbg0R,1681733745,Much Ado About =Nil;,"The problem:  Blockchain companies are adopting zero-knowledge (ZK) technology for everything from scaling to security – making the rapidly-advancing field of cryptography the biggest buzzword in crypto. As companies race to introduce ZK-based products to the market, however, they may encounter challenges stemming from the high expense and expertise needed to build and operate ZK systems. As ZK becomes more mainstream, new infrastructure will be needed to onboard developers and bootstrap newer projects.  The idea: =nil;  If “Seinfeld” was “a show about nothing,” the =nil; Foundation is a cryptically captioned crypto company borne of the same ethos. Like the irreverent 1990s sitcom, =nil;’s unassuming exterior hides ideas that demand attention. You may find those ideas difficult to decipher, however.  For starters, there’s that name: “=nil;” Foundation. Stylized to look like computer code, “=nil;” literally translates as programmer-speak for “nothing.” Not so revealing, in other words, and a syntactical nightmare for a journalist tasked with writing a story about something (and an even bigger headache for his website’s SEO team, he’s told).  And then there’s the fact that the =nil; Foundation is not really a “foundation” – at least not in the traditional sense. Venture capitalists, take note: This foundation is for-profit, and its founders say they plan to formally drop the “foundation” label sometime soon. (=nil; started as a nonprofit in 2018 but raised a conspicuous $22 million from investors this year.)  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  On its website =nil; describes itself as providing “trustless data accessibility” – a tagline impenetrable for all but the crypto native, but decidedly not nothing. According to the site, =nil; was established to “facilitate and support research and development in database management systems and applied cryptography.” For those equipped to parse the jargon, this is where things may begin to make sense: =nil; aims to help manage databases (read: blockchains) through its expertise in advanced cryptography.  Still confused? That might be the point. In an interview with CoinDesk, =nil; co-founder Mikhail Komarov seemed to take pleasure in his company’s elusiveness. “Everything I give a name to is about ‘nothing,’ ‘nobody,’ ‘no one’, like ‘f**k off’ and all that stuff,” said Komarov, who added that his childhood nickname was “Nobody the Nobody.” Komarov isn’t worried that =nil;’s nonstandard naming will push it below the radar, however. The tech can do the talking.  Defining =nil;  Komarov, a wispy-haired Russian transplant based in Cyprus, is what some in crypto would call an OG. With a penchant for black clothes and a wry smile seemingly glued permanently to his face, Komarov has the coy, knowing disposition of a hacker’s hacker – an only-in-crypto character that may well have been plucked off the set of “Mr. Robot.”.  Komarov studied Algebraic Topology at Moscow University, and says =nil; kicked off as a rag-tag group of programmers eager to consult and deploy their skills on projects across the crypto-verse.  Komarov’s driving thesis is that blockchains are just glorified databases, and he describes the =nil; of the early days as a nonprofit “think tank” driven by a single question: “What if this industry was not invented by a cryptographer, but by someone who does database management systems?”  From the once-hyped EOS blockchain to the Ethereum staking juggernaut Lido (which Komarov helped architect), the team’s digital fingerprints can be found on some of the buzziest crypto projects of the past few years.  “In the beginning, it was actually a foundation. It was just trying to prove that this thing is worth something, that it can be done,” explained Komarov. “It was not really known whether it was possible to merge these industries,” database management and cryptography.  Komarov began tinkering with blockchains in 2013, but he says his interest in database management stemmed from challenges he faced in 2017 as the chief technology officer of Golos, a Russian-language spin-off of the blockchain-based social network Steemit. Komarov describes Golos as a “decentralized” Reddit – a kind of forum site with its own built-in token. As the platform became more popular – including in Ukraine where, Komarov says, people used it to spread anti-Russian political articles – it began to outgrow its underlying blockchain.  “The amount of data that got put inside this thing got too large,” Komarov recalled. “It became a big pile of problems. It was so big that exchanges were not willing to list the GLS token because they knew that they wouldn’t be able to support and maintain the deposits and withdrawals.”  Frustrated from his Golos experience and aware that blockchain scaling issues were by no means unique to him, Komarov’s first big product push with =nil; was to build out a database management system – a tool like mySQL that aimed to help blockchain projects conveniently store, view and edit their data.  As the company expanded to 40 employees worldwide, it broadened its focus to serve the growing market of crypto companies that use zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a type of cryptography that can help scale blockchains.  So what is ZK? It’s a kind of technology that allows one to prove a statement is true without showing the statement itself. Without getting into the mechanics of how this all works (the Ethereum Foundation has a useful explainer), the key unlock of ZK tech is in allowing two parties to pass data back and forth in compressed form, and with certain privacy-preserving features.  The usefulness of ZK may be difficult to grasp in the abstract, but the tech has been looked to as a key solution for blockchain scaling – enabling Ethereum, mainly, but theoretically any blockchain to offload traffic to ZK-based chains that can securely and cheaply process data on their behalf. (ZK can help solve, in other words, some of the main problems that Komarov faced when building the data-heavy Golos.)  =nil;’s ZK play  =nil; is wooing investors with plans to launch two flagship ZK products, each aimed at helping zero-knowledge development teams build out their tech.  The first new product, =nil;’s “zkLLVM,” is oriented towards helping developers build ZK crypto apps more quickly. It does this through a suite of compiler tools – software libraries that will help programmers write complex ZK applications using familiar programming languages (rather than arcane, ZK-specific languages.)  The next product, a “proof market,” addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks for getting ZK apps up and running once they go live: the high computation costs of ZK systems.  ZK crypto apps are built around trustlessness, the idea that a far-flung network of people – rather than one central company – should be able to pitch in to keep a given system alive and accountable. But organically building up a network of people to operate a ZK service is difficult. This difficulty stems partly from the complexity of generating ZK-proofs – the computation-hungry math problems that power ZK systems.  ZK-proofs are best generated by specialized machines. Due to the large requirements for generating proofs, many ZK apps are forced to generate proofs entirely in-house rather than outsource the work to a community. While convenient, this sort of vertical integration is hardly “trustless” and could become infeasible should a given ZK system scale up and demand more resources than a single firm can provide.  =nil;’s proof market aims to give ZK upstarts easier access to companies and individuals with ZK-proof-generating goods – building up a platform that connects capable ZK-proof generators with projects needing proofs.  Should =nil; succeed, it could reach the kind of status of something like Flashbots – the Ethereum software builder whose “MEV-boost” middleware (a block marketplace) is now used by virtually every validator that operates the network. It’s no coincidence that =nil; counts Hasu, Flashbots’ head of strategy, as a lead investor.  =nil;’s success is not guaranteed, however. The ZK-proof market will struggle to take off unless it manages to attract an acceptably large, trustworthy community of proof-generators. This may prove difficult: It remains to be seen whether the ZK community can bake in the incentive systems/economic model required to support =nil’s marketplace.  There are also potential weaknesses with =nil;’s zkLLVM compiler. Most obviously, =nil; will need to build up trust before developer teams readily use its code to create applications that secure millions of dollars in crypto.  Despite the big questions, =nil;’s big swing at ZK tech is well-timed. The field of ZK cryptography is now to the blockchain industry what artificial intelligence (AI) is to the rest of the technology industry: ubiquitous, buzzy, and probably important for the long haul. If =nil; succeeds, it’s hard to imagine it will stay stealthy for too much longer.  CORRECTION (Apr. 19, 2023 19:40 UTC): An earlier version of this article referred to Mikhail Komarov as a ""co-founder"" of Lido. According to a =Nil; spokesperson, ""the technically accurate description would be that Mikhail 'co-authored the protocol and its implementation.'""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/cryptocurrency-zero-knowledge-blockchain-nil-foundation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09db1c0e51d57615ee47948dcd23a5a055537daf-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, cash is making up an increasingly large portion of all humanitarian aid.  Cash, unlike in-kind donations, lets recipients make their own choices about when and how to care for themselves and their families in emergency situations.  However, distributing cash aid comes with its own challenges. Moving physical cash around can be difficult and dangerous, especially in the aftermath of natural disasters. Other issues – like corruption or currency devaluation – can also be a problem.  Digital cash transfers can make things easier, but not everyone who needs aid has a bank account – or access to the internet. Crypto has been floated as a potential solution to these issues, but how can crypto serve disaster victims who do not have smartphones, bank accounts, or internet access?  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Sempo  Sempo was started in July 2017 by a pair of young Australians entrepreneurs, Tristan Cole and Nick Williams.  Their inspiration was a Web 2 humanitarian aid distribution platform called GiveDirectly, which allows donors to send cash to people living in poverty.  “What they do is give people money in Africa and other underserved communities,” Cole said. “They raise funds in places like Australia and the United States – all over the world – and they give people money. And for me, I found that very interesting.”  Cole pointed out that 90% of money sent through GiveDirectly goes to beneficiaries.  “With traditional NGOs, it’s not that at all,” Cole said. Overhead costs and administrative fees for traditional donation methods can eat up as much as 30% of the cash value. “I was, like, why can’t we do this with Oxfam or any of these other NGOs?” Cole said when he and Williams reached out to humanitarian aid organizations, they found that the organizations were struggling with major technological challenges in running their cash transfer programs.  “There’s no infrastructure in the places we work,” Cole said. “Like, in Vanuatu, the banking infrastructure isn’t great. Most people are unbanked who actually need the assistance. So that’s what really inspired me. I’m very interested in how we can do more financial empowerment for others … there’s still so many people who don’t have access to things that we take for granted.”  One such thing is access to the internet, which is a major challenge for many projects Sempo works with. Other crypto-native aid distribution programs, like Stellar Aid Assist, require the internet to function. But blockchain-powered Sempo has an option that doesn’t require the internet to function. Instead of sending crypto between beneficiaries and local merchants, beneficiaries can instead use a tap-to-pay card that doesn’t require an internet connection.  “The pay card is used by Oxfam as well as others,” Cole said. “It's used in places that maybe have lower levels of digital literacy, lower financial literacy and ultimately, places that don't have great internet infrastructure because it can work offline at times, which is the real key selling point there.”  Open-source aid  The project went through several accelerators in Australia and the U.S., including dlab, an early-stage crypto accelerator. Between all the programs, Sempo’s founders raised approximately AU$450,000 – a little over US$300,000.  “It's pretty much been bootstrapped the whole way,” Cole told CoinDesk. “Just Nick and myself funding it, and revenue from customers.” Williams left Sempo in 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Sempo’s core infrastructure was made open source in 2019, which means organizations that want to run projects on Sempo don’t need to pay for the privilege of doing so – something that was important to Cole, who wanted to make the software accessible to organizations helping people in need. There are a number of organizations, including the Red Cross, who use the open-source software for free, said Cole.  However, if organizations aren’t tech savvy enough to set up and run the project on their own using Sempo’s free tutorials, they can use Sempo’s hosted model, paying Cole a software service fee and consulting fees to get their help designing and running the project.  “It’s much more hand-holding from the start of the program – the ideation phase all the way to monitoring, evaluation and then scaling it up,” Cole said of the hosted model.  Eventually, once a project is set up, it can transition to an unpaid, self-run project, which happened with the Red Cross and another project called Grassroots Economics, Cole said. He said he is currently working with Oxfam to help it transition its hosted project to a self-run project as well.  Cole’s ambition for Sempo is to eventually help all projects transition to a self-hosted model.  “It’s a part of growing up – you have to learn to let go,” Cole said. “The best transition for [Sempo] was to move to just a fully open-source model because it’s the purpose of working with nonprofits.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/humanitarian-aid-transformed-crypto-startup-sempo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2df6d0f43251ea5fbd629514f40e2751e935ea50-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393897,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgfT,1681733703,BTQ Prepares Today to Defend Against Tomorrow’s Quantum-Computing Threat,"The problem  Right now, nations are engaging in a technological arms race to develop quantum computing technology. Chinese researchers, who hold over half of the world's quantum technology patents and have allocated $15 billion towards quantum technology to be spent before 2025, claim their technology can break the RSA algorithm that is used to encrypt the majority of the web’s traffic.  Encryption is the backbone of a modern connected world. It ensures that banking is done securely, sensitive emails are not read by a third party and blockchain networks remain secure, trustworthy and free of double-spent transactions.  Quantum computing poses a threat to current encryption methods because it has the potential to break many of the most widely used encryption protocols. This is because quantum computers are capable of performing certain types of calculations much faster than traditional computers, which makes it possible for them to quickly factor large numbers that are used in many encryption algorithms.  For blockchain, encryption is essential and therefore its vulnerability is an Achilles' heel. The entire idea of on-chain scarcity is anchored in encryption. Data can be stored, but never edited, which is why the same bitcoin or non-fungible token (NFT) can’t exist twice.  The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the most widely used cryptographic algorithm implemented by blockchains today. It has a severe weakness to a quantum attack because it was designed to be used in pre-quantum computers, which could be exploited by hostile actors ranging from market manipulators to states that are anti-crypto.  Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has made post-quantum computing (PQC) security upgrades a primary focus of the platform. In order for blockchains to remain secure and viable in the next era of computing, when traditional encryption mechanisms are vulnerable to quantum attacks, they will need to upgrade their security.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: BTQ  BTQ isn’t the first quantum computing startup on the market. Dozens of quantum startups have been around for the better part of a decade, backed by recognizable names in computing and technology. But BTQ is the first quantum computing startup with a specific focus on blockchain technology.  “Large-scale quantum computers won't exist for many years. However, that doesn't mean we should sit idle,” says Nicolas Roussy Newton, BTQ’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “There's a real risk attackers will be able to forge signatures for old keys such as blockchains. And deploying new post-quantum cryptography at scale could take 10 years.”  Roussy Newton, a Canadian with prior experience in venture capital, says this from Taiwan, a frontier state at the doorstep of China – one of the world’s leaders in quantum computing research. Taiwan doesn’t have the same scale of quantum computing research, yet, but it does have a workforce with plenty of experience in marrying hardware and software, given the island’s leading industry of chip making. BTQ’s leadership, such as Chief Cryptographer Chen-Mou Cheng, have a heavy roster of academic citations in computer science and other technical journals.  While China’s quantum research seems to be focused on military purposes, such as decrypting classified military communications between Taipei and Washington, D.C., the same technology could be used to disrupt crypto and digital assets.  Over the next few years there will be a rapid “quantum transition,” where all of Web2 – which drives hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce every year – moves towards quantum-proof standards.  But what about Web3? Digital assets are a $1.27 trillion asset class and are now facing an existential threat. Chains will need to transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards to remain viable in the long term, or else the entire idea of scarcity and ownership on the web will cease to exist.  BTQ is unique as instead of having a broad, theoretical, focus on Quantum computing, it has four products that address different aspects of the “quantum problem"": PQScale, Keelung, Kenting, and QCIM.  PQScale  Digital signature algorithms, the code that helps transition and secure post-quantum encryption, can’t be fit into blockchains like a lego block. It’s as if the blocks are misshapen and the wrong size.  Last year the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a branch of the Department of Commerce with a mandate to help assist the advancement of technology, announced three post-quantum digital signature algorithms, CRYSTALS–Dilithium, Falcon and SPHINCS+, designed to protect encryption schemes from Quantum-computing based attacks.  While it would make sense to try and immediately integrate these algorithms into blockchains, it’s not that simple. Adding in these signatures would be computationally intense and would enlarge the blockchain to a point where it has efficiency issues.  BTQ is positioning PQScale as a solution to this problem.  PQScale’s approach involves combining multiple Falcon signatures while significantly reducing the size of the combined signature. This method can potentially be adapted for other similar security frameworks as well.  Keelung and Kenting  Zero-knowledge proofs are a pillar of security for the next generation of blockchain technology. But how can these be implemented on both the hardware and software side?  A zero-knowledge proof is like a secret password game where one person can prove they know the password without actually saying it out loud. In this game, one person (the ""prover"") wants to show they know the secret, while the other person (the ""verifier"") wants to check if it's true without learning the secret themselves. The game uses special rules that help the prover show they know the secret without revealing it.  For blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs have vast potential to enhance privacy and security. With ZKPs, counterparties don't need to trust each other or use a third-party escrow service to complete a transaction.  BTQ is positioning Keelung and Kenting – named for two coastal cities in Taiwan – as a system for ZKP implementation, with Keelung on the software side and Kenting on the hardware side.  With Keelung, users can create ZKPs without specific expertise in cryptography, while Kenting is a hardware system that uses field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), a special type of computer chip that can be reconfigured and customized to perform specific tasks, to support the intense computational demands of ZKPs.  QCIM  Eventually, everything that uses encryption will need to have some sort of compatibility with quantum cryptography. But what about smart devices that have a low-powered processor inside?  QCIM is BTQ’s specialized processor for post-quantum cryptography but is targeted specifically at lower-power applications such as the Internet of Things.  QCIM leverages compute-in-memory technology that integrates logic circuits into memory blocks in order to achieve highly energy-efficient computations by reducing data movements.  While quantum computing is thought of as only existing in laboratories, the proliferation of post-quantum encryption will mean that chips capable of post-quantum cryptography will need to be wherever encryption is needed, from security cameras to drones to smartphones and even satellites.  Quantum computing is an esoteric subject that, to many, looks like a moon shot. After all, the threat of quantum currently only exists on paper.  But in the tech world, the pace of research and development is fast and furious. Rewind to a few years ago, and artificial intelligence language learning models were relatively primitive. Today, ChatGPT is able to pass any state’s bar exam.  If tokenization and digital assets are the future of money, they need to be able to survive the rise of quantum computing and its ability to destroy encryption algorithms that form the basis of blockchain.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/btq,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b29fff42a7a4c116287993ac1c1bdd9863e5d88a-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The finance is too heavy on the numbers. The industry is replete with scams. Some decentralized apps, or dapps, to use crypto’s preferred terminology (jargon is another issue), take pride in the fact that they look like they were released in the early 1990s – when you still needed to type the command line to do anything fun online.  One prominent example of this is Web3’s most used application, the browser-based wallet MetaMask. Developed by ConsenSys as one of the Ethereum software developer’s first in-house projects, MetaMask has become crucially important to the Web3 ecosystem. At last count it had over 30 million active monthly users, and is the default way for crypto users to manage their keys.  Wallets are the most important tools for crypto adoption, at least coming from a consumer perspective. They are front and center in how people protect their wealth, spend their funds and manage their Web3 lives. MetaMask is by no means a bad wallet, but crypto – an industry that puts full faith in the invisible hand of the market – needs competitive alternatives.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Rainbow  When Mike Demarais sent the rapper Soulja Boy his ""passport"" to the world of Web3, the Rainbow wallet co-founder said it might require ""some mildly elite nerd s**t"" for the artist best known for 2007's hit ""Crank That"" to set it up. Demarais had purchased soujaboy.eth nearly a year earlier, along with the ENS addresses for a number of potential celebrity crypto users with the hope of gifting them to bring attention to his mobile-first Ethereum wallet and Web3.  Rainbow, founded in 2018, wants to be the general public’s portal to the new crypto economy. It has a sleek user interface – closer to CashApp than to Chase bank – and an easy onboarding process. Although there was a technical hiccup when Soulja Boy was trying to set up the Ethereum Name Service name Demarais gifted him (the rapper initially tweeted out a Coinbase deposit address he did not fully control), Demarais thinks the situation spoke to Rainbow's strengths and the reason for dead-simple sign-on processes his team is trying to make the norm in crypto.  ""We'd like to make all things crypto easy, because right now it's not,"" Demarais said in an interview in Rainbow's Brooklyn open-floor office. Several users CoinDesk interviewed for this article said it’s easier to buy an ENS domain through the Rainbow app than on the Ethereum Naming Service website, just one of the areas where it's succeeded in smoothing out crypto's rough edges.  The Soulja Boy stunt was an obvious marketing gimmick, Demarais said, but also a natural outgrowth of the company's technical prowess and showmanship. Rainbow used a similar technique to attract strong developers to the team, including a few former ConsenSys project leads – buying their ENS names and sending it to them as a gift and ploy to get them to see what they've built. Download the app, port over your information from MetaMask and taste the Rainbow, so to say.  There are a number of “next-gen” crypto wallets that have hit the market since the “super cycle” began in 2020. Many, like Rainbow, chose to first tackle mobile users, a market left mostly unserved by the largest Ethereum interface today, the browser-focused MetaMask. Rainbow is arguably the most successful, largely due to its adoption by crypto “super users” and Web3 startups looking to bring strangers aboard. Although the company doesn’t advertise in the traditional sense, it has developed a voice and brand identity – irreverent, sarcastic – that is mostly Demarais being himself, posting on social media.  Rainbow takes a “design-first” approach to its product. One look at Rainbow, an app which is as colorful as the name implies, and you can tell the difference between Web3 products that are built with a mass audience in mind – (TechCrunch said Rainbow looked like an app that Snap or TikTok would design). It takes the streamlined approach to mainstream fintech and banking apps, but is built for modern money.  Or as Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit founder turned tech investor, puts it: “User experience matters so much – [Rainbow's] design choices are the reason they've already built a cult following and continue to educate and onboard scores of new users to Web3.”  The people's choice  Design and user experience sound like problems that are skin deep but are important. Everyone judges a book by its cover. Someone’s first experience with Web3 should be as seamless as what we’ve all come to expect from tech.  “We did an extensive deep dive on available wallets, comparing things like onboarding time, network compatibility, etc. Rainbow came out ahead for our use case,” said Darrell Jones, CEO and co-founder of City3, a Oakland-based community currency nonprofit backed by Coinbase Giving and the Ethereum Foundation. Jones added that City3 has “onboarded over 1,100 folks IRL” at four West Oakland Farmers Market events, with “more than 60% being folks of color,” he said. “Rainbow offers the best experience for newcomers by far.”  CoinDesk, when preparing the Projects to Watch series, received a number of recommendations for Rainbow, attesting to the level of brand awareness and actual use many of its wallet peers would envy. Under development since 2018, Rainbow has tried to “abstract away” many of the complications plaguing crypto.  One of its most successful open source products, Rainbow Kit, made it ""truly dumb easy"" for non-fungible token (NFT) developers to add a ""wallet connect flow"" for mobile, allowing people to mint tokens from their phone when that wasn't always possible. Others appreciate Rainbow as an aesthetic and secure place to store NFTs, users said, and for its built-in crypto swapping tool that removes the need to log into Coinbase.  “For newcomers and experienced Ethereum users alike, going from ‘no crypto’ to navigating across Web3 can be a painful experience. Historically, the process involved getting set up with a crypto exchange, linking back to your existing banking rails, depositing fiat, purchasing ETH, then sending ETH out of the exchange to a browser wallet” to Web3 apps, Derek Edws and Stephen McKeon, partners at venture fund Collab+Currency, wrote. (Collab+Currency invested in Rainbow.) What Rainbow has done and is trying to do is turn most crypto interactions into a “one-click” experience.  Launching first on Apple’s iOS, Rainbow quickly built the capability for people to use Apple Pay infrastructure to purchase ETH and many other Ethereum-based tokens to fund their Rainbow wallet. It has since expanded to Android, and in the coming months plans to launch its first browser wallet, allowing it to compete toe-to-toe with MetaMask. About 100 people right now have access to a pre-beta version of the wallet, Demarais said, which will see wider release next month.  “We're out here at fox hunting,” Demarais said, referencing MetaMask’s telltale origami fox icon. “You know, like, we're putting on our boots going to do some egregious murdering of foxes, British style. Direct quote.”  Despite the candor, Demarais said he has deep-felt respect for MetaMask, which at last count boasted 21 million active monthly users, making it by far the most used “crypto” product. But the wallet has become the default option for a new version of the Web that is supposed to foster consumer choice. Its association with ConsenSys, the developer of much core Ethereum software, also taints crypto’s anti-centralization ethos.  Reaching “platform parity” by releasing its browser would make Rainbow a “wholesale alternative” to MetaMask, but isn’t meant to fully replace the much-loved wallet. Ultimately, like many Web3 stoners, Demarais has a simple faith in free markets. He sees MetaMask as a lumbering project locked in to outdated design choices and slow to innovate. These are problems that a peppy startup doesn’t have, a selling point he’s used to poach more than one MetaMask developer.",NEUTRAL,ETH | ENS,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ENS,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/rainbow-ethereum-wallet-mobile-first-design,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af6105f4129167fd8ee2223d1688995e5f99c19b-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393889,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbfvJ,1681733665,Scroll Aims to Be the Turtle That Wins the Ethereum Scaling Race,"The problem  The most recent crypto boom pushed the Ethereum blockchain to its limits – with an unprecedented inflow of new users slowing down the network and pushing its traffic-based transaction fees sky high. This network congestion – and the accompanying fees and speeds – made Ethereum unworkable for some users, spurring a wide field of faster, cheaper blockchains bidding for Ethereum’s throne as the main hub for decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and blockchain research.  Ethereum’s core developers have long worked to scale up the network – refactoring its core code to boost speeds and decrease fees. But these interventions have only had a modest impact towards easing Ethereum’s expense and sluggishness, with more ambitious changes to Ethereum core code still years away. At this point, most of Etheruem’s core developers argue that third-party companion networks, called rollups, will need to be the primary method by which Ethereum maintains its status as the primary port of entry for the next billion crypto users. These rollups are separate blockchains that bundle up user transactions and write them in bulk to Ethereum’s transaction ledger.  But not all rollup networks are created equal. All rollups aim to “inherit” Ethereum’s security, meaning they all have special systems in place to (eventually) make transacting on them functionally equivalent to transacting on Ethereum itself. The most advanced breed of rollups, zkEVMs, have been competing to use cutting-edge zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to accomplish this goal.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Scroll  Nearly a year into Ethereum’s “zero-knowledge” arms race, two teams that promised to deliver faster, cheaper crypto transactions using the complex tech say they’re gearing for (or at least nearing) some form of launch. For Polygon,“mainnet beta” is right around the corner. For Matter Labs, registration for its new “era” is already here.  Both companies are betting their respective versions of a zkEVM – a layer 2 blockchain that Ethereum-based projects can utilize without much effort – will herald the next generation of scalability for the world’s largest smart contracts platform. First to the finish line gets bragging rights and media glory – not to mention a whole host of users that come with a “first mover” advantage.  It's a race that one other company called Scroll is more than happy to lose.  In an interview with CoinDesk, cofounders Sandy Peng and Ye Zhang repeatedly returned to the virtues of taking time (and plenty of it) to do the job right – as if the others were not. They fashioned Scroll as an open-source, open-door, community-driven entity that models itself in the shape of Ethereum itself. After all, the goal is to “help Ethereum scale” by using zkEVMs.  ZkEVMs are a kind of Ethereum rollup network – a layer 2 companion blockchain that records transactions to the base layer 1 Ethereum chain, but offers lower fees and faster speeds to users. In general, rollups work by bundling up big groups of transactions and then writing them to Ethereum in one fell swoop – drastically reducing the fees that would be required to make those transactions on Ethereum one at a time.  The bread and butter of any rollup network is its security system – the mechanism it uses to guarantee that the data it passes to Ethereum reflects real user activity.  The first rollups to market, such as those from Arbitrum and Optimism, operate using a dispute mechanism. When these networks pass a transaction down to Ethereum, watchdogs can dispute suspicious-looking activity within a set period of time (typically around seven days).  Upcoming zkEVMs, a more advanced breed of rollup, use zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for their security. Rather than rely on third parties to call out bad behavior, these rollups use fancy cryptography to proactively prove that the transactions they pass down to Ethereum have not been tampered with.  ZkEVMs have been a long time coming. Early rollups that used ZK proofs were all application specific, meaning they were restricted to specific crypto use-cases (like sending tokens from one blockchain address to another). Newer zkEVMs such as Scroll aim for compatibility with any Ethereum app – meaning NFT marketplaces, decentralized lending platforms, and blockchain-based gaming apps should all be able to port their code over to these cheaper rollup networks.  Scroll is hardly alone in its zkEVM mission and it knows it will not be the first to get there. With big competitors putting varying stages of a “final touch” on their renditions of a zkEVM, the only thing certain about Scroll’s platform is it will not win any awards for development speed. At the moment, much of the general attention for zkEVMs are trained squarely on what Polygon and Matter Labs are bringing to the table.  Better to be right than fast  As CoinDesk has documented, not all of Polygon’s or Matter Labs’ claims map precisely with reality. Both companies brag that their zkEVM launches are imminent, but the platforms they are introducing to market in 2023 will come with severe technical handicaps. (For instance, both networks will rely, in part, on trusted intermediaries for their security – rather than pure zero-knowledge cryptography – when they go live).  It's not lost on Scroll’s founders.  “We cannot ignore the marketing noise,” Zhang said during an interview. He said there will always be this or that claim to being first but Scroll is determined to “walk our own path” even if it comes at the expense of shipping fast.  The path they picked is slathered in molasses. Scroll is aiming to achieve a zkEVM that mimics the Ethereum Virtual Machine in every way possible. They want it so close to the real thing that builders on top of it won’t know – or even have to know – the difference.  Zhang said the team started building a zkEVM two years ago. Back then the consensus opinion on the feasibility of using ZK proofs to build a general purpose platform was just beginning to warm. It takes a lot of computing power to feed the complex cryptography underpinning ZK proofs; Zhang said generating a proof could take as long as a day. There was no guarantee of success.  “People still build only application-specific zk-rollups, like a DEX,” he said, referring to a decentralized exchange. “People think general purpose stuff is just so hard to build. And it’s very, very, very low efficiency.” But two years ago there were some breakthroughs in cryptography and also hardware acceleration, he added, that are now allowing the technology to zip ahead.  Scroll is taking a longer road by design. They are building “at the bytecode level” in order to “behave exactly like the Ethereum Virtual Machine” in every way, shape and form, according to Zhang. (Bytecode is the machine-readable form of code that dictates precisely how a program is to execute).  Being that granular can be one helluva drag on efficiency: Zhang says that the more equivalent one is to the EVM, the higher the “overhead” on the program. Higher overhead means more of a slog, and a more expensive slog, too. That’s prompted others in the zkEVM race to make efficiency “trade-offs,” by using compilers or other virtual machines. The result may be faster, but it’s not as compatible a design, he said.  To Zhang and the other employees at Scroll, the pain is worth the gain. They view the painstaking process of hammering out bytecode level equivalence as critical to their entire operation – it’s their raison d'etre.  “If you are bytecode level equivalent, you can be seamlessly compatible with all those toolings without any modification,” he said, referring to the Ethereum ecosystem’s “robust” developer toolkit landscape.  Simply put, a developer on top of a zkEVM won’t have to sweat the details or spend any time thinking about how their code will perform relative to how it does on Ethereum. For example, if you’ve got a relatively battle-tested protocol that’s been running for a few years on mainnet without a hitch, you can be sure it will do the same atop Scroll’s zkEVM. It will do exactly the same tasks and perform precisely in the same way. No extra audits or compilers necessary.  In crypto, what can go wrong will go wrong. It’s too soon to tell what might break in the nascent zkEVM space, but the founders of Scroll sounded sure that when it comes to their EVM-compatible-but-not-equivalent competitors, Murphy’s Law is destined to take the wheel.  “At the point of deployment, the difference is not visible. But where it will be majorly felt is when there is a security breach,” said Peng.  The lengths that Scroll is going to in its quest to replicate the Ethereum experience are borderline severe. Every detail of the tooling stack is reused, Zhang said.  Transparent, every step of the way  To make these matters harder (worse?) it's all being done in the open. Every Scroll pull request, comment, line of code and so forth is playing out in real time on its Github repository. That means anyone with an internet connection – anywhere in the world – can track the progress of Scroll’s codebase. It’s a little flourish of transparency that Zhang said is “a step above” the commonplace practice (even among open-source projects) of building code behind closed doors and then throwing them open at some point in time.  The recipe is catching on. Since announcing its “alpha testnet” during EthDenver, over 550 “hacks and projects” have deployed, Zhang said. So far it’s all running quite well, even if – critically – it's not yet a full representation of what Scroll aims to be.  Incomplete why? Because Scroll isn’t calling its testnet a “zk-rollup testnet” until the proofs are ready to rumble – and so far they are not. Zhang contrasted this “philosophical” decision with the more gung-ho approach seemingly employed by Scroll’s competitors in the zkEVM space. Without naming names, he said “some testnets don't have a proof” even though their host projects insinuate the liveness.  The tension between Scroll’s meticulous mantra and its competitors elsewhere in this bustling corner of crypto nerdism was palpable. It is perhaps a product of the yin-yang lane Scroll has cast for itself. Even as it sticks to its tortoise philosophy – or at least to talking up the virtues of slow-and-steady in the press – its captains are deeply uncomfortable with the fast-and-loose hares.  When asked about how Polygon – the current leader poised to launch some zkEVM something before anyone else does – is framing its achievements in the press, Zhang said Scroll “has already pointed out some of Polygon’s over-claims [sic] from the marketing side.”  “They kind of oversimplify” when making claims about “100% compatibility,” he said, adding “we know how many tests they have ignored.”  The team is even uncomfortable with talking about talking about this dynamic, however. Before a reporter could follow up, Peng interjected with a cheery demand: “Let’s move on from this question.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | ZK,"Danny Nelson, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/ethereum-zkevms-scroll-network-scalability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4929ee88e2a4bddf452c3da037c637638f3b14ee-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393894,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgKx,1681733631,Fedi Gives Bitcoiners a Community Custody Option,"The problem  Bitcoin custody is tricky. It’s always a trade-off between convenience and security when your two choices are to keep your bitcoin on a centralized service, such as an exchange or a custodial wallet, or keep it on your own device.  The first option means trusting the platform not to turn your bitcoin into a proverbial pumpkin (as FTX did, for example); the second option means knowing that if you lose your device and backup, no one will be able to help you.  Hardcore bitcoiners would say that you only truly own your bitcoin when you store it yourself, not entrusting to anyone else. But noncustodial storage is not easy to get right, and the idea of not having a reliable backup plan if you lose your keys – a private code consisting of a series of alphanumeric characters to provide access to your bitcoin – might make you feel as uncomfortable as storing your life savings under a mattress: In both cases, the loss would be permanent and irreversible, and the responsibility all yours.  Read also: Air Gap? Hardware Wallet? Multisig? Bitcoin Self-Storage Means Hard Choices  The idea: Fedi  Fedi is approaching bitcoin custody with an assumption that, although full self-custody is the best solution, most people would choose to trust someone else to keep their bitcoin safe. Many users start their exploration of bitcoin by asking a more experienced friend or family member to buy and store their bitcoin for them, Obi Nwosu, CEO of Fedi, wrote in a company blog post last March.  “As a long-time Bitcoin exchange operator, I have heard so many anecdotal examples of this happening that I would not be surprised if the majority of bitcoin ‘owners’ are actually acquiring their bitcoin through guardians already – but there is no way to know for sure,” Nwosu wrote.  By guardians, he means more tech-savvy friends, family members, etc. – someone you trust who helps you set up your wallet and buy your first bitcoin, so that you don’t worry about making a mistake and losing your money.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  Fedi is building a product to help communities store bitcoin together and simplify crypto transactions between members. Using an open-source protocol called Fedimint, Fedi is offering a compromise between the comfort of custodial storage and autonomy of self-custody: outsourcing backup storage to people you personally know and trust.  Users wary about the difficulties of self-custody would lock their bitcoin into a joint multisignature wallet guarded by several people they know – the guardians mentioned by Nwosu.  To be clear, Fedimint creators say right away: “If you are confident taking self-custody of your bitcoin and running your own nodes, we highly recommend you do so.” But Fedi allows you to share the burden with some people you know and trust, not big companies you hardly know anything about and have no reason to trust.  Bitcoin Ekasi, a community of people paying each other with bitcoin in a South African township, is piloting FediMint, said Herman Vivier, founder of Ekasi. He told CoinDesk it simplifies bitcoin custody for older and nontechnical people.  “Currently the only alternative to full self-custody is foreign custodial services. And these prove themselves untrustworthy time and time again,” Vivier said.  Encouraging new bitcoin communities  But there is more to it. Fedi’s ultimate ambition, according to Nwosu, is to achieve the functionality of other, more nimble cryptocurrencies, without surrendering the security of the Bitcoin protocol.  “It runs on top of Bitcoin alongside Lightning, providing the missing pieces to the Bitcoin ecosystem. We wanna be able to have more privacy if desired, similarly to zero-knowledge proofs; have additional functionality, similarly to smart contracts; and scale bitcoin to millions, similarly to rollups,” Nwosu told CoinDesk.  The concept of Fedi is that once a community – or “Federation” – has pooled their bitcoin together, they can mint tokens –“fm-BTC eCash notes” – running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and use those tokens for payments inside the community, while the bitcoin backing them is sitting inside the joint custodial wallet. This way, payments in the community will be faster and more private because they will be invisible to outside observers, unlike bitcoin transactions that can all be seen on a public blockchain.  The Fedimint protocol also allows members to pay each other inside the community using Bitcoin’s second-layer Lightning Network, according to the protocol’s website.  In this sense, Fedimint can be viewed as a bitcoin version of a popular privacy system on Ethereum: zero-knowledge rollups. “We take transactions off the Bitcoin network, provide privacy within the community and [additional] features inside the community,” Nwosu said.  A community can also agree to store other things in a joint backup wallet using Fedi, Nwosu said. For example, if they use decentralized identity tools, they can store backups for their credentials in joint storage instead of keeping them in a Google Docs or Dropbox file. They also can manage a joint cloud file storage for content important to this community.  Federations can also start small local funds to finance something the community wants to build, buy or do together. However, Fedi won’t offer any functionality for online voting as exists in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Nwosu believes communities of people whose livelihoods are naturally tied together can govern themselves without any sophisticated technical mechanisms.  DAOs are, essentially, an attempt “to reinvent the way people have been making decisions,” and people actually don’t need it on the everyday level, Nwosu said:  “There might be ten thousand communities, and they can make decisions in ten thousand ways. Communities already have their own processes, we just want to supercharge what they already do,” he said.  All the voting as to how to manage community funds can happen offline – or online, if a community decides – but definitely outside the Fedi environment.  According to Nwosu, likely users of Fedi are communities like a small village or town, a church or a friends’ circle. Over a hundred communities in Latin America and Africa have already signed up for a pilot version of Fedi, Nwosu said. These communities are large ones, counting tens of thousands of members, but Nwosu hopes that in the future, smaller groups will also start using Fedi.  For now, Fedi is still in a pilot phase. The public launch is tentatively expected by the end of this year, Nwosu said, but the long-term ambitions are big: “Hundreds of thousands of federations would be a target for the next several years.”  A potential weakness: too much trust?  The potential issues with federations stem from the very concept of the Fedimint protocol: It’s based on trust, which Fedimint’s creators admit on the project’s website.  The well-being of a community using Fedi relies on a group of technical maintainers from this community – the so-called guardians. They run Fedimint nodes, which can be, depending on the particular federation’s needs, any device: “laptops, towers, smartphones, mobile phones, single board systems or remotely operated computers in the cloud,” the website says.  Guardians take care of the community's multisignature wallet as a group and authorize spending of that bitcoin outside of the community, as well as bitcoin withdrawals by members. In a sense, they replace a centralized exchange or custodial wallet for the community they serve. Unlike an exchange, however, the Fedimint guardians cannot see users’ balances or who is transacting with whom inside the federation, according to the description.  And just as with any custodial system, there is a risk guardians would abscond with the community bitcoin or get hacked or just fail to properly secure their backups, and thus lose access to the bitcoin they had been entrusted to hold.  There are no technical safeguards against that in Fedi: The only guarantee against the guardians’ failure or fraud is the off-chain, offline trust they have already earned within their communities in real life.  “I have no doubt in my mind with all these different federations building up there will be some scandals in there,” Peter McCormack said on his podcast “What Bitcoin Did” in March, adding that he expects to hear news of federation guardians here and there absconding with community bitcoin. In this regard, reputable institutions such as Coinbase or Fidelity look like better guardians of one’s bitcoin than a federation, McCormack suggested.  Another risk is that a federation might issue more community tokens than its members' bitcoin can back, unbalancing the community’s inside economy. This is possible due to the shortcomings of the eCash protocol Fedimint is using – it was invented by the legendary cryptographer David Chaum in 1982 and first deployed in his Digicash system in 1989.  Users cannot see how many tokens are circulating inside the federation, and no external auditor can do that either, leaving the control over the federation’s balance sheet exclusively up to the guardians’ discretion.  The only motivation for the guardians not to go rogue and blow up their own communities is their good faith and willingness to maintain their good reputations among people they know and live with.  Fedimint critics say this principle effectively undermines the core value proposition of bitcoin: You don’t need to trust anyone but yourself to know your money is safe.  Bitcoin Ekasi’s Vivier told CoinDesk the community hasn’t “really considered using the other features” of the Fedimint protocol besides joint custody, but it might think of them once the federation is up and running.  What the experts say  Nick Neuman, CEO of a bitcoin custody provider Casa, believes Fedi has a good chance of success in furthering bitcoin adoption in Africa and Latin America: “Fedi is explicitly trying to target communities in the Global South. And those kinds of cultures, from what I hear, are much more familiar with community-based models of using and protecting wealth, and they can adapt this technology more readily than we in Europe or the U.S., where the approach is more individualistic,” Neuman said.  Casa is providing a custody system in which clients set up multisignature wallets using several devices they own along with Casa, as a third-party custodian, holding one more key, so that if a client loses several devices and don’t have enough keys to access the multisig, Casa would help with the one it holds.  Neuman believes that in the future, when the Fedimint technology gains some traction, Casa might offer its service to federations as a professional guardian.  Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation and a bitcoin educator, believes that Fedi is not a replacement for self-custody, but complements it.  “Unlike current arrangements, you trust a quorum of people, who are unlikely to rug you. They will be best used or thought of as spending wallets or checking accounts. For savings, self-custody will of course be recommended,” Gladstein told CoinDesk, adding:  “I’d never recommend someone use a Fedimint [federation] operated by people whom they do not know.”  Read also: Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right)  CORRECTION (April 18, 2023 18:30 UTC): A graphic image with facts about Fedi included in a previous version of this story listed Fedi's primary headquarters incorrectly.

42393892,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgFp,1681733551,"In the Ukraine War, Stellar Aid Assist Is Using Crypto to Give Mass Aid","The problem:  The first and most essential response to famine, war, natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, or other crises is food, clothing and shelter. These are the essentials to staying alive. But once disaster victims are made stable and have the clothes and food they need, giving them more can actually become a burden.  In recent years, aid organizations have recognized that cash donations, which are easier and quicker to distribute than physical goods, are necessary to help disaster victims rebuild their lives. This temporary receipt of cash aid preserves the agency of choice for recipients, who can decide when and how to spend the money to help them to restart their lives.  But cash aid has its own issues. Moving physical cash around is difficult and dangerous in many disaster and post-disaster situations. The cash can depreciate in value and, in many cases, can be pilfered by corrupt middlemen. That’s why a number of aid organizations have turned to digital cash transfers to help reduce that risk.  With digital cash transfers, humanitarian organizations have to act quickly to figure out delivery systems that work wherever the crisis is located. They need to take cash from millions of well-meaning donors in multiple currencies, exchange the value into a currency that the recipients can use and also be transparent so they can report to donors how the funds were spent. On top of all of this, the aid organizations need to provide this cash efficiently and cost-effectively, because the most basic tenet of humanitarian aid is that the recipient does not pay for the assistance received.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Stellar Aid Assist  If cash is king in times of crisis, but moving around physical cash is difficult and digital bank transfers can’t reach recipients without access to a bank account, is crypto the solution?  The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) – the nonprofit that supports the growth and development of the open-source, decentralized Stellar Network – certainly thinks so. Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia last February, SDF got to work developing a disbursement platform designed to help relief organizations distribute cash aid more efficiently.  With input from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the U.N.’s refugee agency, SDF developed and launched Stellar Aid Assist in less than 10 months.  Stellar Aid Assist allows humanitarian organizations to send bulk stablecoin payments – in the form of Circle’s dollar-pegged USD coin (USDC) – to recipients in need. Unlike traditional cash transfers, payments through Stellar Aid Assist can be made safely, nearly instantaneously and with complete transparency on where and when the funds arrived – all without the interference of potentially sticky fingered middlemen. It’s also basically free to use.  An aid organization would have to do approximately 100,000 transactions before seeing a dime in gas fees, said Tori Samples, a senior product manager at SDF who oversees Stellar Aid Assist. The wallet used by Stellar Aid Assist – the Vibrant wallet – is also free, though Samples said that could change in the future.  “One of the principles of humanitarian aid is that recipients never pay to receive any money,” Samples said. If Vibrant becomes a paid wallet some day, “that would be a negotiation between the off-ramp and the aid organizations sending funds to make sure that the recipients don’t receive any fees. If anything, those will be charged upstream to the organization.”  Stellar Aid Assist’s platform doesn’t just make things easier for the humanitarian aid organizations. It also benefits the end users, who get cash quickly and securely without needing a bank account.  As Samples pointed out, unlike donations of local currencies, USDC can serve as a hedge against inflation or local currency devaluation, and it’s protected digitally until the recipients need it. When they’re ready to cash out, the aid recipients can go to any MoneyGram location in the world and exchange their USDC for the equivalent amount of local currency, either in a physical or digital form.  Battle-tested  Though Stellar Aid Assist can be used to give humanitarian aid in any crisis around the world, Samples said it was designed with Ukraine in mind.  The development of Stellar Aid Assist “was a response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of last year,” Samples said. “People have been doing cross-border payments on Stellar since 2014, but [the war was] when the need for this mass payout system became very clear.”  There are currently two public pilots using Stellar Aid Assist to give cash to refugees in Ukraine, one through the UNHCR and the other through the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a New York-based international humanitarian aid organization founded at the request of Albert Einstein.  These pilots appear to be quite small. A recent story in Wired about Stellar Aid Assist puts the number of test users in Ukraine who have received donations at less than 100. Samples declined confirm the size of the pilots.  Though that number is miniscule compared to the estimated 5 million Ukrainians who received cash assistance last year, it serves as a proof of concept that stablecoin-denominated cash payments could seriously improve the way humanitarian aid is done.  Since launching the first version of Stellar Aid Assist in December 2022, Samples said the SDF has been focused on expanding the platform to ensure that it can be more customizable for future crises, where recipients may not be as financially and digitally literate or connected as Ukrainians.  SDF has had “conversations with a lot of humanitarian organizations,” Samples told CoinDesk, but only the two currently known pilots in Ukraine have been made public.  Prioritizing ease of use  In order for donations made through Stellar Aid Assist to be helpful to their intended recipients, it has to be easy to use for everyone, from the administrators at the aid organizations all the way down to the recipients, including people with zero crypto experience.  Making a user-friendly interface was top of mind when developing Stellar Aid Assist, said Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director Denelle Dixon.  “We built Vibrant with the notion of having the noncrypto user leverage it, so the [user experience] design is much different and much simpler,” Dixon said. “It’s much more in line with what a user might expect if they’re using a type of payment wallet or Venmo or whatever the equivalent might be.”  Dixon stressed that ease and efficiency is the project’s priority, not converting people into crypto users.  “The point of the aid is to get the aid to them so they can use it, hold it, do what they need to do with it and not to get them hooked on anything else,” Dixon said.  The importance of off-ramps  Stellar Aid Assist’s simplicity for end-users could not be achieved without its long-standing partnership with MoneyGram, the Dallas, Texas-based cross-border payments and money-transfer company.  Dixon told CoinDesk the partnership was nearly four years in the making when Stellar Aid Assist launched in December.  “We’ve always been very much about the on- and off-ramps, recognizing that if crypto and blockchain are really solving the problem for the unbanked and the underbanked, then you really shouldn’t need a credit card or a bank account to be able to join the solution,” Dixon said.  “Focusing on that cash on- and off-ramp was a really important piece of our work, holistically, and MoneyGram was the perfect partner for that because they have 400,000 agents all over the world,” Dixon added.  Dixon described the platform’s relationship with MoneyGram as “transformational” but said the project – which launched in the immediate aftermath of the FTX crypto exchange’s spectacular collapse in November – hasn’t gotten a lot of attention from either the media or lawmakers.  Ultimately, Dixon said, it didn’t really matter whether anyone was paying attention – only that the platform was helping get aid into the right hands.  “It just doesn’t matter, because we’re going to do this and we’re doing what’s right, and we’re using this technology in a way that’s fit for purpose,” Dixon said. “It will get the right amount of attention from regulators, policymakers and humans when they’re ready to absorb it.”  Dixon said that while Stellar Aid Assist might be a good demonstration of the value of blockchain technology, it’s more importantly a rail that aid organizations can use to help more people.  “Giving [relief organizations] a tool that helps them to put more dignity and humanity into the hands of those who might not feel any of that in the moment … it’s such a beautiful way to show the value of payments and really get to the humans on both sides” of aid distribution, Dixon said.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | XLM | USDC,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/stellar-aid-assist-uses-stablecoins-for-humanitarian-relief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf36f9b79eaa7e7599bb49f2307d329ed094c9d5-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393891,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgAh,1681733530,"Jack Mallers' Strike Service, Send Globally, Tackles Bitcoin-Fiat Remittances","The problem  Dismissals of the real-world utility of cryptocurrency are often based on the assumption that money works the same way around the globe as it does in the United States.  Critics – including powerful U.S. legislators – often cite the convenience of services like PayPal or even credit cards as proof that cryptocurrency has no utility. But that ignores the very real differences between nations’ financial infrastructures – and how many places PayPal or other services simply don’t reach.  Those barriers are much more obvious to people who do a lot of small-dollar international transactions, such as immigrants sending money back home. Using traditional financial infrastructure for these so-called “remittances” often relies on complex and high-trust relationships among banks. That complexity has made it easier for conventional remittance services to charge sometimes extremely high fees.  For example, according to the World Bank, the cost of remittances to Nigeria has averaged close to 8% over the past decade. That adds up dramatically: In 2020 and 2021, nearly $3 billion was spent on remittance fees to Nigeria alone. Given Nigeria’s roughly $440 billion GDP, that’s enough missing money to amount to a drag on the national economy.  And while Nigeria is a major recipient of remittances, it’s just a tiny slice of the pie: Global remittances in 2022 added up to $626 billion. Cutting just 1% from the fees on those remittances would mean an additional $60 billion in the pockets of people who need it.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Send Globally  As crypto winter set in over the course of 2022, the crypto industry talked a lot about the “pivot to BUIDLing” that often follows when the most degenerate forces in the industry get blown up and quiet down for a bit. Strike’s new Send Globally service, launched in December 2022, embodies some of the greatest promises of that bear-market urge.  Send Globally solves a real problem in the world using cryptocurrency. It leverages the Bitcoin blockchain and the Lightning Network to offer international cash transfers that are faster, more flexible and often less expensive than what’s offered by traditional financial services. It’s designed to be easy to use and understand for people who know nothing about crypto.  Most important for the direction of the crypto industry, Send Globally has an honest-to-god business model: a sustainable approach to generating revenue in exchange for real services, instead of through selling speculative tokens or lunatic financial engineering. Given the ongoing regulatory crackdown and post-bubble skepticism facing crypto, it’s more important than ever for projects to focus on real, paying end users.  “You send money that you see as dollars from the United States, and it’s received on the other side. They receive it in their local currency, either in a bank or in a mobile account,” explains Manuela Rios, Strike’s vice president of product. Rios, who joined Strike from Robinhood Markets in December 2021, knows the challenge of remittances intimately. Her grandmother lives in Colombia, and Rios describes having to jump through expensive or complex hoops every year to send her abuela a simple gift of birthday cash.  Bitcoin in and of itself is already a meaningful solution to that problem, given transaction fees of around $2 to send any amount of BTC. But it still presents challenges to trust and usability for many.  “If I’m going to send money to my Grandma,” as Rios puts it, “I’m going to have a hard time convincing her to use bitcoin.”  Send Globally is designed to split the difference, giving people who know nothing about crypto access to some of its benefits in speed, cost and flexibility. Strike has partnered with a series of local businesses that connect Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to local banking services, including Pouch in the Philippines and GetBit in Vietnam.  By plugging directly into local financial services, Send Globally makes its Bitcoin transactions feel, to the end user, largely identical to a conventional wire transfer. In particular, it vastly reduces the volatility risk of bitcoin because the BTC is held for a very short amount of time on both ends.  Send Globally began operating in December with service to Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria. In a great example of its seamless local integration, Send Globally in those regions can direct funds not only to conventional bank accounts but to “mobile money” services, particularly M-Pesa. Started in 2007, M-Pesa lets users access money through even simple flip phones, and has become a huge part of financial life across large swathes of Africa.  Strike has since added service to the Philippines and, most recently, Vietnam. In total, Rios says, roughly 500 million people outside the U.S. have access to Send Globally. For now, the service is one-way – you can send dollars from the U.S. to receiving countries, but not in the other direction.  Using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network as the payment rail dramatically cuts the already-low cost of a Bitcoin transaction: Sending over Lightning costs pennies or less. But the added convenience of local bank connections and automatic bitcoin-to-fiat conversion does add some costs of its own. So Strike is careful not to claim that Send Globally is cheaper than existing options in all cases, particularly citing temporary “teaser rates” for conventional remittance services as sometimes cheaper. Strike’s revenue from Send Globally comes in the form of an exchange-rate spread.  Rios says Send Globally’s basic design was influenced by Strike’s involvement in El Salvador’s bitcoin push since 2021. That year, Strike released its Lightning-based payments app in El Salvador in conjunction with the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender there. (Strike’s app is distinct from the troubled “Chivo” app released by the Salvadoran government.)  “The way that Send Globally differs,” says Rios, “is that in El Salvador, [funds are sent] to a Strike app. Send Globally goes to their bank account, so it’s a much different experience. What we’ve found is that it’s a much lower barrier to entry.”  There are other advantages to Send Globally that make it distinct from standard remittance services. Perhaps most compelling, because it runs on Lightning and uses a spread-based revenue model Send Globally can be used for very small transactions. That’s simply not possible with services like Western Union that often charge flat fees for remittances, making smaller sends economically impractical.  “You can send as little as a dollar,” says Rios. “That makes it so easy to try out, and it opens up a lot of new use cases.”  Rios describes casually pitching Send Globally to a U.S.-based Nigerian influencer. “He tried it, and in, like, two minutes he messaged back in disbelief. He was mind-blown about how simple it was.” For now, Strike says it’s relying more on word of mouth than on paid marketing to promote the service.  That “two minutes” might not be an exaggeration, thanks to Send Globally’s other major advantage over conventional remittances: speed. “It gets to the recipient instantly,” says Rios, meaning between a few seconds and a few minutes. In most jurisdictions that includes fiat settlement even outside of normal banking hours and on weekends.  Rios says Send Globally is poised for rapid expansion, in part because of the plethora of companies around the world already working with the Lightning Network.  “We thought that there weren’t that many. As soon as we launched in those three African countries we started getting messages – ‘We’re a lightning company in Colombia, in Mexico, in Ukraine.’ They’re everywhere. Because Lightning is open source. We almost can’t build fast enough.”  While Strike CEO Jack Mallers has generated headlines as a fervent bitcoiner, Rios says Strike isn’t interested in explicitly leveraging Send Globally to create new bitcoin converts.  “Overall our mission is better money,” she says. “Inside the app we make the differences between the cash and bitcoin balances clear,” and the interface doesn’t try to nudge people to cross that gap.  Long term, of course, that aligns with a crypto future that even many diehards support: a world where crypto and its benefits are widespread, but many users have no idea they’re using crypto at all.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

42393887,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbfqB,1681733510,Thank Elon for Making the Use Case for Twitter Competitor Nostr,"The problem  Censorship or the lack thereof has long been a pain point for social media users and providers. Just recall the controversial cancellations and reversals on Twitter, crypto’s and President Donald Trump’s once-favorite social media site. In January 2021, while Twitter was a public company run by Jack Dorsey, Trump was permanently banned for tweets he sent prior to the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Then in November 2022, when Twitter was a private company run and owned by Elon Musk, the Trump ban was reversed.  You don’t have to look far to see polarized reactions to each of these decisions.  But aside from personal opinions about Trump, many took the inconsistent behavior regarding his account status as further proof a censorship-resistant alternative needed to be built. Compounding that desire even further was Twitter’s decision in December to “remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames for the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribal, Nostr and Post.”  That decision led to individuals being temporarily banned from Twitter simply because they posted a link to another social media site. Twitter walked back the policy, but the damage was done. Social media users wanted a next-generation Twitter where they couldn’t be canceled, and they needed it immediately.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Nostr  Nostr is the decentralized, open-source relay network that makes decentralized social media projects a possibility.  The pseudonymous developer fiatjaf has been working on Nostr since November 2020. Its name is an acronym for Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. The following December he released branle, his first attempt at a Nostr-powered Twitter. In his announcement tweet he made clear that branle was just one client to the Nostr protocol and that it was a work in progress – it was the first client for Nostr.  A client is a software front end that allows access to underlying technology. Think about how you can send emails using Gmail: Gmail is the client that lets you access the protocol of email (there are three protocols, but you don’t even have to know that to use email). Similarly, branle was the first client that let you access and use the Nostr protocol. Taking the email analogy further, you could use another email service like Outlook to send emails just as you could use another Nostr client to use Nostr.  Fiatjaf was the creator but not the only developer who contributed to Nostr clients. Embracing equality and the true spirit of collaboration, fiatjaf declined a request to be interviewed for Projects to Watch, saying that he “could not be Nostr’s leader.” That is OK because, in early 2022, developer Will Casarin found a markdown document from fiatjaf that described Nostr and advertised it as a censorship-resistant alternative to Twitter. As he saw more evidence of deplatforming on Twitter, he started working on the iOS client for Nostr in his spare time as other open-source developers worked on their own clients or tended to the Nostr protocol.  He named the client Damus.  Casarin now works on Damus and Nostr full time after securing enough funding from Jack Dorsey to work on his client and the protocol for a year. When asked who is calling the shots at Nostr, Casarin said, “The running joke in the Nostr community is that either [me] or fiatjaf is the CEO.”  Obviously, the project has no CEO because it’s simply a protocol. Who is the CEO of email, anyway?  True to the ethos of Bitcoin – there is significant overlap between the Bitcoin and Nostr communities – Casarin seemed more excited to talk about Nostr than spend any more time on the thing he created.  What about Mastodon? Or Urbit?  Before asking “Why Nostr?,” ask “Why Not Mastodon?”  Mastodon is an early decentralized social media that boomed in user growth after Musk bought Twitter. But the boom didn’t last. What was missing from Mastodon or other decentralized social media attempts in order for Nostr to have gained so much traction?  Mastodon uses a federated model where your data is controlled by whoever owns the particular “instance” of Mastodon you’re using. An instance is started by someone with servers who will store data for you. Users connect to that instance to use Mastodon. What that means is the administrator who owns that instance can ban a user – arbitrarily, in fact – and that user basically has to start over because their data is owned by the instance.  Casarin was banned from a Mastodon instance for posting about Bitcoin. He and many bitcoiners eventually found the Bitcoin Hackers instance (which was recently wound down) where he could post about Bitcoin, but there was a big problem: The Bitcoin Hackers instance was banned from the rest of Mastodon.  But an even bigger problem?  “Running your own Mastodon instance is heavyweight. Even for someone like me,” Casarin said. It requires technological expertise, time and even money to keep the servers running. When Mastodon exploded in user onboarding after Musk bought Twitter, people running instances began GoFundMe campaigns to keep their communities running.  Nostr, by comparison, is far simpler: “It’s just JSON and WebSockets.”  And it is simpler still than yet another attempt at decentralized social media, Urbit.  “Urbit is crazy, a very eccentric model for decentralization,” said Casarin. “It’s not for normal people. It’s very bizarre and the complexity is very high.”  Fair enough.  The point is Nostr is trying to solve censorship by making Nostr as easy to adopt as email or texting. Casarin suggested that running and using Nostr was much easier than running and using a Bitcoin node (which this reporter can tell you is definitely true).  Which raises an obvious question: What does this have to do with crypto? Nostr doesn’t have a token. It doesn’t use a blockchain. But its inclusion here as a crypto Project to Watch has nothing to do with tokens or blockchains. Yes, users are using Nostr to send bitcoin to each other over the Lightning Network, but Nostr’s connection to crypto is simpler. Bitcoin spawned the crypto landscape under the auspices of decentralization, censorship-resistance and disintermediating the need for third parties.  These principles pulse through the veins of Nostr.  Growing pains  Nostr is brutally simple. A user plugs into the network, connects to relays and those relays transmit data across the Nostr network.  However, Nostr has had growing pains. For example, the protocol uses public-key cryptography. A Nostr user has a private key (which is unknown to anyone but that user) and a public key that other users can use to follow other accounts and check out their notes (and other stuff). If a user accidentally shares their private key instead of their public key with others, all of a sudden “their” Nostr account becomes “our” Nostr account.  It’s still early days for Nostr, so these types of hiccups are expected and should be ironed out as the protocol grows and matures.  Besides user error, there are two top-of-mind concerns with Nostr at the moment: scaling and spam.  Scaling is a concern because there will be a need to run more relays than there are now to onboard billions to Nostr. By way of example, Twitter has more than 350 million monthly active users at the moment. While it feels as if you’re connected to just one Twitter server when you use Twitter, there are actually many servers behind the scenes, and an immense amount of engineering work that allows the user experience to feel that way.  Casarin shared that Nostr got hammered with spam shortly after users from China started downloading the app from the Apple App Store (more on that below). The relatively simple solution was to filter out “non-paid relays,” which are free for clients to connect to, while paid relays have some sort of fee (usually payable in bitcoin). This filter worked decently, but it now requires ordinary users to pay to mostly avoid spam.  Nostr is an exciting idea if it continues to grow beyond social media use cases. Nostr applications could eventually generate data and start broadcasting it to the network, and other clients can start using that data. In some sense that makes Nostr more powerful than the internet. Most websites are isolated and don’t talk to each other. Imagine if those websites could talk to each other.  The future is decentralized  What about becoming, say, decentralized GitHub? Sure.  To be clear, Casarin hedged and said the internet is more decentralized than Nostr because Nostr has something of a hub-and-spoke construction – like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network – where most of the data flows through a few distinct hubs. Maybe that is the right approach for Nostr and maybe it’s not.  As for the “other stuff,” consider Lightning Zaps. Lightning Zaps allows bitcoin to be sent over Nostr as a new note type using the Lightning Network. That way users can directly pay other Nostr users over the protocol if they post a funny note or if they just feel like it.  It’s all still a work in progress.  As for Casarin’s Damus client, it hit the Apple App Store on Jan. 31 after multiple failed attempts. By Feb. 2 it was banned in China. The proof that Nostr is onto something is staring us in the face. Nostr must be doing something right if in less than three days a client that connects to a censorship-resistant social network was banned by the long arm of the Chinese government.  Yes, that was fast, Damus.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/nostr-decentralized-social-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc2996ce66946b204961135df06a5ca8000b12a9-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393898,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgpj,1681733485,Lamina1 Is Building for the Open Metaverse,"The problem  What is the metaverse? The word conjures up the idea of a single space in which users can log onto and experience its robust virtual worlds. In practice, so far at least, it is multiple spaces, centralized or decentralized, where users can access multiple different metaverse experiences, each siloed away from the other without interoperability.  The metaverse industry may be large but it’s certainly not open. As figures such as Animoca Brands founder and CEO Yat Siu or pseudonymous non-fungible token (NFT) collector Punk6529 tout, Web3 should aim to build the “Open Metaverse,” an interoperable space across all, or at least most, platforms.  A Web3 ethos points towards breaking down “walled gardens,” or data silos, allowing users to take full ownership of their digital experiences that they can carry from metaverse to metaverse. While most are built atop Ethereum, other platforms are seeking alternative strategies to leverage blockchain technology to power their visions. The problem is how to create a cross-dimensional user experience that makes the metaverse a singular noun.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Lamina1  Lamina1 is a layer one blockchain ecosystem that’s set on providing the infrastructure for Web3 developers to build the “Open Metaverse.” With its user-friendly tooling, onboarding strategies and environmentally friendly approach, Lamina1 aims to help the metaverse hold true to a Web3 ethos.  The project was founded in June 2022 by Neal Stephenson, author of the famed science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” for which he coined the word “metaverse,” and Peter Vessenes, an early cryptocurrency adopter and experienced Web3 venture capitalist. The two metaverse architects wrote a white paper that sets out to solve the interoperability issue of the decentralized virtual world.  “For the trillion-dollar economy of the metaverse to materialize, we must first focus on fundamental infrastructure, enablement and usability,” reads the Lamina1 white paper. “Lamina1 will host and power the economic and social transactions of the Open Metaverse, solving technical hurdles to accelerate adoption and unlock capability.”  However, for Stephenson and Vessenes, the Open Metaverse is not just about interoperability, it’s about propelling the Web3 ethos of digital ownership, fairly compensating artists and creators, and making the metaverse an accessible space – traits which many popular projects have yet to prioritize.  “In brief, I think of it as the base layer for the Open Metaverse, a place to build something a bit closer to Neal’s vision – one that privileges creators, technical and artistic, one that provides support, spatial-computing tech and a community to support those who are building out the Metaverse,” Vessenes said in a blog post announcing Lamina1.  Lamina1 has raised an undisclosed amount of capital from prominent investors including ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and other blockchain angels. It has garnered attention from many builders for its vision to build an interoperable metaverse, starting with the infrastructure.  Imagining the Open Metaverse  In January, Lamina1 named Rebecca Barkin its CEO. Barkin spent much of her career in entertainment and technology and was an early adopter of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). She spent five years at technology company Magic Leap, four of them leading Magic Leap Studios and one focused on the design of the operating system for Magic Leap 2, an award-winning artificial reality device. After Magic Leap, Barkin stepped into the role as vice president of partnerships and creative strategy at software company MSG Sphere, helping to build out the company’s immersive content strategy.  Barkin met Stephenson at Magic Leap, where she shared his vision of powering a future where creators and consumers were fueled by the war chest of technologies surrounding them, rather than diminished. These sentiments prompted her to join Lamina1 in August 2022.  Barkin spoke with CoinDesk about her vision to build out Lamina1 to be the base layer for the next iteration of the metaverse.  “It’s a ‘batteries included’ approach to enable people to make high quality experiences and deliver them in the Open Metaverse,” said Barkin. “In short, we want to create a thriving economy similar to what we experienced in the early days of Web2.”  Barkin defines the Open Metaverse as a framework for the internet in which users can facilitate direct transactions, carry their personal data across platforms, and fairly monetize their intellectual property.  “There's interoperability between those experiences – think of it kind of like having a passport that belongs to you, where you can easily and fluidly travel between experiences in a way where you don't have to give all of your data to some third party that exploits it or siphons it for their own gain,” said Barkin. “We believe in a version of the Internet where you don't have to do that.”  Barkin noted that although this may be a goal, there are difficulties in achieving this reality. As Web3 has begun to mature, priorities are shifting away from consumers and back to the producers. The result is decentralized projects sacrificing the tenets of their strategies they set out to achieve in the beginning.  “It’s gonna take a real movement because, essentially, the centralized players in this system that exists today are not incentivized to change anything,” said Barkin. “They will only come around if there is a cultural movement that demands it, … and you cannot inspire a cultural movement if you do not have authenticity.”  The first steps to building  Lamina1 is targeting early industries that have been quick to adopt the metaverse in their strategies, such as gaming, which has become the largest market in the metaverse. Barkin wants to bring Web2 game design and usability to Web3 gaming.  “There are some shorter, more casual Web3 game experiences, and there's us trying to bring along really talented Web2 game designers and storytellers, so we'll go at it from both sides,” said Barkin, “because we need that drumbeat of diverse experiences and regular cadence of high quality content to make a point.”  Barkin told CoinDesk Lamina1 is also targeting industries such as fashion, music and entertainment that may not be as metaverse ready in their own target markets, but are gearing up to embrace blockchain technologies through various projects and initiatives.  Across all these target markets, Barkin emphasizes, Lamina1 is putting creators first.  “Our real focus is on how we can better serve a specific community that we know really well, both from an IP standpoint, a creator standpoint and a technology development side of things to mature the solution for them and protect the quality of their creative brand,” said Barkin.  In order to help onboard more projects to its early ecosystem, Lamina1 rolled out the Lamina1 Ecosystem Fund in December, a rolling grants program to empower early Web3 projects to access metaverse resources and tap into the Lamina1 ecosystem.  While projects can apply for grants, Barkin specified that Lamina1 intends to remain hands off, simply providing the capital necessary for projects to deepen their roots in the metaverse.  “The point is not for us to become a moderator, that is a very slippery slope and we're not gonna try to do that,” said Barkin. “The Lamina1 Ecosystem Fund was a chance for us to really act on our values and our beliefs and what the diversity we wanted to see in the ecosystem, the types of projects we wanted to see.”  Lamina1 will soon reveal the first investments it has made in its ecosystem fund. The company recently announced its Early Access Program – a cohort of projects chosen to help shape the future of the ecosystem. Among these projects are gaming studio Dubit, music platform Patch XR, and Web3 intellectual property (IP) studio 0.xyz.  Since the chain launched its testnet in January it has completed over 300,000 transactions and amassed 37,000 wallet addresses. Projects are flocking to the ecosystem because in order to build the Open Metaverse, it's necessary to focus on blockchain technology.  In doing so, Barkin said Lamina1 aims to foster strong communities along the way who can help each other tap into Web3.  “When you're early-on as an entrepreneur and you're trying to get into Web3, it's so helpful to have the connection to people who have launched projects,"" said Barkin. ""That's a big part of the value, so we hope to build that community out.""

42393896,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgaL,1681733447,Gridless Is Extending Power to Rural Africa,"The problem  770 million people in the world don’t have access to electricity. Many of them are on the African continent.  In rural Africa there are at least two reasons for this: lack of disposable income and lack of infrastructure. Of the former, Africans might have access to electricity but may choose instead to ration funds for other things, like once-weekly mobile data on their smartphones. Of the latter, electrical grids in urban areas fail to reach the rural populace.  This effectively strands rural areas on a proverbial island from the main grid. Africans have adapted so-called microgrids to provide electricity instead. A microgrid is an electrical grid that contains both the generation and storage of energy and distributes it to the immediate surrounding area. As the name implies, the reach of these microgrids is small.  Microgrids to power rural Africa have been in use for years, but there are issues. One of the issues stems from funding. Microgrids are funded through concessionary funds from government agencies such as USAID to get off the ground. Once launched, microgrids struggle to remain financially sustainable. Further microgrids are inefficient and can let off a meaningful amount of generated electricity as waste heat that no one captures or uses.  What rural Africa – and other rural areas in the world – need is the expansion of the main electrical grid, not innumerable microgrids that create waste and inefficiencies.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Gridless  Erik Hersman grew up in Kenya and South Sudan. He is hyper-focused on bringing valuable businesses to Africa. During an interview with CoinDesk he gave a nod to the community-oriented attitude most Africans exhibit because, in his experience, people tend to do things together rather than alone. One of his more interesting viewpoints is rooted in entrepreneurship.  “If you want to make your dent in the world, it is really about wealth generation and building businesses that change people’s lives … because being treated as an equal is a hell of a lot better than being treated as a recipient with your begging bowl out,” Hersman said.  Hersman’s parents were missionary linguists who moved to Africa before Hersman was born. Hersman grew up watching development and aid in Africa bring hope followed by disappointment, the cycle repeating over and over again. So when he returned to the continent after college in the United States, he avoided going into development, as so many college graduates do.  The entrepreneurial bent shows up in Hersman’s career path. First, grant-funded community mobilization application Ushahidi, then a Nairobi-based technology innovation hub iHub, then a telecommunications business called BRCK.  And then, in March 2022, he started Gridless with his two co-founders.  Gridless wasn’t born with a focus on bringing bitcoin mining to rural Africans. The company’s main aim was to offer affordable energy through microgrids. Bitcoin just uniquely enabled that capability. Bitcoin mining, the process in which bitcoin transactions are added to its ledger and how new bitcoins are minted, is immensely useful to Gridless because it is geography agnostic – unlike say precious metals mining where operations need to be set up where the precious metal exists.  To mine bitcoin, all you need is access to energy and the internet. And rural Africa has both.  The trick is that capturing potential energy, through something like a hydroelectric dam on a river, takes initial capital investment to set up and needs consistent energy demand from the community to remain financially viable. The bridge to financial viability is provided by Gridless. Gridless partners with an energy producer to co-locate a bitcoin mining operation with the production point of a microgrid near a rural community. Whatever electricity isn’t purchased by the community is used for mining bitcoin. The mined bitcoin represents the microgrid’s path to profitability.  That community now has access to electricity and the energy producer can turn a profit thanks to bitcoin mining.  But with Bitcoin as part of its business plan, Gridless has two goals: help push the value of electrification in Africa further to the rural edges and provide more decentralization to the Bitcoin network. To achieve these goals Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa. These areas tend to have immense amounts of potential and stranded energy.  Gridless was thrust into the Bitcoin Twitter limelight after Luxor CEO Nick Hansen shared a video in October of one of Gridless’ micro-hydroelectric plants in rural Kenya.  This hydroelectric plant will be able to provide affordable electricity to the neighboring village and is unobtrusive to the surrounding ecology. Gridless is able to do this because whatever electricity the village doesn’t use will be used for mining bitcoin. The cost of the energy paid to mine the bitcoin will more than offset any losses associated with providing the electricity to the village since instead of being wasted, it will actually be used.  So while a mainline criticism of bitcoin is that it requires too much electricity to work, here’s a tangible example of a rural community enjoying access to electricity because of bitcoin mining. These Kenyans now have access to electricity because of bitcoin, not in spite of bitcoin. Gridless is cutting into that 770 million without electrical power one bitcoin-enabled microgrid at a time.  As for the environmental concern associated with bitcoin mining’s dependence on energy that’s often repeated, providing access to electricity where it wasn’t possible before should surely outweigh whatever moral weighing a critic has for green energy production. Besides, hydroelectric power is renewable.  And there’s more to come. Gridless is focused on building out facilities in Kenya and Malawi, especially now that Gridless has fresh capital to work with. Hersman shared that Gridless had purchased “bucketloads of mining machines” with $3 million of seed funds raised from Jack Dorsey-founded Block and bitcoin venture capital firm Stillmark in December.  Environment risks, just not the ones you think  Gridless has immense promise and lofty goals, but they have been brought down to Earth recently. While political risk and site security risk is casually viewed as threats to the business, Hersman said that “environmental risk is more pertinent than any other risk.”  And he doesn’t mean the type of environmental risk that is most often discussed. It’s not the “Bitcoin is bad for the environment” risk but rather “rains are at 40-year lows in Kenya so hydroelectric generation isn’t as fruitful as anticipated” risk.  As for competitors, as ridiculous as it sounds, Gridless doesn’t really have any pure competitors at the moment. Sure, there are microgrid providers in Africa and, yes, there are companies and individuals mining bitcoin in Africa, but as for someone doing both? Gridless stands somewhat alone at the moment.  Competitors that do the same thing could crop up, of course, and they very well might if Gridless is successful. While increased competition would create a tougher environment for Gridless to thrive, there are at least two concessions.  First, Africa is a continent (one of the largest), so there is plenty of room for other entrepreneurs to thrive and push the benefits of electrification to more and more Africans. Second, more bitcoin mining companies should mean more bitcoin mining decentralization.  Both of these concessions align perfectly with Gridless’ goals.

42393900,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgzz,1681733427,Nansen Makes Sense of On-Chain Activity,"The problem  Blockchain technology has been billed as the great transparency provider. It is the foundation for an open transmission system where every transaction is recorded for anyone to see. But the reality is that with so many transactions occurring, the crypto space is filled with distracting noise that makes it hard for users, developers, traders and organizations to make informed decisions based on the data.  Even when users drill down to analyze a single transaction, the transparency is typically limited to the blockchain, date, time, amount traded and the addresses of the two parties, which are the equivalent to account identification numbers.  Projects have made strides in gleaning useful information from this data. Etherscan, a block explorer, allows users to search and browse an address’s transaction history. Chainalysis, a platform focused on anti-money laundering, lets people use their investigation software to monitor transactions in real time, for example.  And yet, understanding transactions is a challenge when the two parties are unknown and addresses are not identified. Two identical trades can be perceived differently if the parties in one are individuals and the parties in the other are exchanges or banks, for instance. The latter could even be criminal.  Without identifying or doxxing the owner, could the public learn more about the address?  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Nansen  The inspiration for Nansen came from Crypto Twitter, said Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik.  Svanevik is a data scientist. He saw viral tweets from people who noticed, say, that $200 million of USDT moved from one address to another and wondered who were the owners of those addresses. The blockchain was transparent insofar as people could see capital moving and how much but couldn’t develop an understanding of why, without knowing anything about the addresses.  “We saw two needs both in the investor and builder camp where people could understand their own ecosystem and build better products,” Svanevik said.  Named after Norwegian polymath and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Fridtjof Nansen, Svanevik and two fellow data scientists, Lars Bakke Krogvig and Evgeny Medvedev, launched blockchain analytics platform Nansen in April 2020. Krogvig and Medvedev led engineering efforts exclusively focused on building, while Svanevik led business strategy and fundraising.  Their goal from the beginning was attributing, characterizing or labeling addresses, which is a difficult challenge simply from the volume of data. They had to figure out how to sort data from multiple different blockchains as well as various layer 2s, and put the data into a form consumable for analytics.  What’s in a label?  Nansen’s homepage states the company has labeled more than 250 million addresses across 10 different blockchains.  Based on a specific wallet’s behavior and activity, Nansen will use algorithms to infer the type of user and tag wallets with a descriptor such as a fund, heavy decentralized exchange trader or private investor. Moreover, Nansen adds an emoji to let users know whether a wallet is a smart contract or an exchange.  Nansen has over a hundred names in its toolbox and each wallet can be tagged multiple times. It uses labels, however, and typically doesn't doxx people or reveal private identities, a Nansen blog post states, in keeping with the crypto ethos of privacy and a respect for anonymity.  Nonetheless, many wallets are publicly known, such as those belonging to well-known figures including Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin, and companies such as Wintermute and Jump Trading.  Nansen allows users to have a deeper insight into what is happening on the blockchain in real time. By naming wallets, users can see crypto market maker Wintermute withdrawing millions of wBTC from Coinbase, when Justin Sun trades on a decentralized exchange or when a legendary non-fungible token (NFT) collector purchased several PFPs from the Milady Maker.  Instruments and controls  Building on its labeling abilities, Nansen provides dashboards with sophisticated tools to analyze the data. One particularly useful dashboard is called Token God Mode, which allows users to do a deep dive into a specific token by showing the token’s distribution and activity on different exchanges, among other things.  Exchange Flows is another dashboard that shows users what wallets are interacting with exchanges, what tokens are flowing to and from exchanges as well as each exchange’s netflow of total tokens.  Nansen even has a dashboard called NFT Paradise that shows users recent sweeps (defined as the purchase of at least three NFTs in a single transaction), most profitable collections from flipping (defined as buys and sells within a selected time period) and the most popular NFT contracts in the past seven days.  Token God Mode, Exchange Flows and NFT Paradise are just three of several dashboards on Nansen that cut through the noise to allow users to focus on insights within certain parameters. “Instead of having 40 different tabs to look at analytics on a specific chain, you get all of the information in one place on the whole information stack,” Svanevik said.  Future of finance  Nansen is headquartered in Singapore and has roughly 150 employees across 38 countries. Svanevik said he sees Nansen as an important player in the future of finance. Several investment firms showed they agree. Accel, GIC (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund), Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tiger Global and SCB 10X, have invested a combined $88 million, according to Svanevik.  He said he hopes by 2035 the crypto community will have “built a new financial fabric for the world so traditional finance will be replaced with blockchains.” And Svanevik is willing to do his part to make that happen. “That future doesn’t happen by itself,” he said.  Transparency is the key to building, Svanevik said.  The first step is to make sure pioneers who enter the crypto space – builders, investors, traders – succeed. “If we can help them get the best information so that they can see success, they will reinvest into the industry. And if they reinvest into the industry, then the whole industry blossoms. … You get new companies and projects that are being realized to build this future that we all want,” Svanevik added.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ZRX,Sage D.

42393895,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgVD,1681733402,Machankura Lets Africans Use Bitcoin With Basic Mobile Phones,"The problem  Africa’s internet penetration rate – the number of internet users divided by the continent’s total population – is hovering around 43%. That means roughly 741 million people don’t have Internet access in Africa. The global Internet penetration rate is roughly 60%.  Given the lack of Internet connectivity and lack of affluence, it shouldn’t be surprising that most folks on the continent aren’t lining up to buy the latest Apple iPhone. Instead, most Africans use old school phones with limited functionality known as feature phones.  With no internet, no smartphones and an unbanked population sitting at approximately 45% of all inhabitants, solving the conundrum of banking Africa’s unbanked – providing basic financial services like payments, savings and credit – requires some imagination.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Machankura  Kgothatso Ngako, CEO and founder of Machankura, grew up in Mamelodi, a township just northeast of Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital. In the streets of South Africa’s townships, “machankura” is slang for money.  His own name, Kgothatso, means comfort in Sotho, Ngako’s mother tongue. The 29-year-old computer science researcher and developer hopes to live up to his name by providing fellow Africans easy access to payments. He has developed a non-custodial digital wallet that allows people to send and receive bitcoin (BTC) without a smartphone or Internet connection.  “I started Machankura to make bitcoin more accessible in communities where not everyone has an Internet-connected device,” Ngako told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anyone who's interested in using bitcoin and living on bitcoin should be able to do so easily.”  The concept itself isn't new. In 2007, two mobile network providers in Kenya – Vodafone and Safaricom – created M-Pesa, a service that uses digital wallets on basic feature phones to provide payments, credit and savings in local currency with no bank account or Internet connection.  M-Pesa and services like it are known as “mobile money,” and about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa now have a mobile money account. Safaricom generated $765 million in revenue from M-Pesa in 2021.  Mobile money uses mobile phone signals instead of the Internet – specifically, a communications protocol called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is similar to the more widely known Short Message Service (SMS) texting protocol.  But mobile money doesn’t have global interoperability, and that’s where bitcoin comes in.  “A lot of African bitcoiners were asking the question, ‘How do we get people on feature phones the ability to send and receive bitcoin?’” Ngako explained. “This was a recurring conversation. I was running a Bitcoin node and a Lightning node and I was also asking myself, ‘OK, what do I do with it?’”  Ngako’s University of Pretoria computer science degree gave him the technical chops to not only build nodes, but also to understand the significance of Bitcoin. He also worked as a software developer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) for one and a half years.  At that point, Ngako was already intimately familiar with both USSD – from his experience with mobile technology firms including South Africa’s Pattern Matched Technologies – and bitcoin.  “I learned about Pattern Matched 10 years ago,” Ngako said. “I knew you could deploy your own USSD thing.” And that’s exactly what he did in May 2022 when he unveiled Machankura.  How Machankura works  Machankura combines USSD technology with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network – a layer 2 scaling system that enables cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions.  To send bitcoin, Machankura users simply dial a special code for their resident country. A registration menu is brought up and the user is asked to create a five-digit PIN. Sending bitcoin incurs a 1% transaction fee, which is Machankura’s revenue source.  After successfully registering, users are presented with a subsequent menu that allows them to send, receive and redeem bitcoin by pressing the number on their feature phone corresponding to the desired menu option.  One particularly convenient feature is Machankura’s integration with personalized Lightning addresses.  Standard Lightning invoice addresses can be over 200 alphanumeric characters long, which exceeds the 182 USSD character limit. Personalized Lightning addresses are the length of a typical email handle (e.g., johndoe@8333.mobi), making them much easier to type out on feature phones with multi-press text entry where each digit represents multiple letters.  “If you have a feature phone, you can't type out 60 characters without making a mistake,” Ngako explained. “And even if you do make a mistake, you can’t see that you made a mistake to correct it. Using a Lightning address is great.”  So far, Machankura has debuted in eight African countries – Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia, – where more than a third of the African population currently lives. Ngako wants it in all 54, but he understands how ambitious a goal that is. The service has only managed to attract 3,000 users but Ngako expects an inflection point is around the corner.  One of the biggest obstacles he’s facing today is getting people without Internet access to acquire and use bitcoin.  “There's really not too many bitcoin on-ramps that work for people without an Internet connected device,” Ngako said. “The only one that I can say works for people without internet connected devices is Azteco. So far, Azteco only has a big vendor network in South Africa where you can go to pretty much any store in the country and buy a voucher that you can then redeem for bitcoin. But that is not the case in other African countries.”  Another challenge Ngako faces is working with mobile service providers in each country to deploy Machankura on their infrastructure. Many of these service providers already have their own mobile money implementations and see Machankura as a direct threat to their existing products. Ngako hopes to leverage antitrust laws in such situations, failing that he'll be forced to “orange pill” the African continent, converting users into bitcoiners one at a time.  In Kenya, Machankura not only competes with monopolistic telecom giants pushing different flavors of mobile money, but other startups with USSD-based crypto solutions like Kotani Pay have also entered the scene.  Kotani Pay is similar to Machankura, but it uses Stellar, whose token is XLM, instead of Bitcoin. Ngako says a Stellar-based system is deeply flawed.  “Ultimately, Bitcoin has the biggest network effects,” Ngako said. “If you are running a solution on Stellar, then you're firstly promoting Stellar and then promoting the solution. People have heard about bitcoin even in the most remote places in Africa. Also, I don't think there's been this overall optimization for payments in the other cryptocurrencies. Everything is an on-chain transaction. Very few have a second layer implementation that is as widely adopted as the Lightning Network.”  Why Bitcoin?  If Ngako sounds a bit like a bitcoin maximalist – someone who believes bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency worth its salt – it’s because he is (the non-toxic kind).  Ngako’s perspective on the nature of money changed in 2017 when he dove down the crypto rabbit hole in pursuit of quick profits.  “I was trying to find the next bitcoin and took my money and put it in all these s**tcoins,” Ngako explained. “Then 2018 – a bear market. That was a good thing for me because my s**tcoining days were very limited.”  That negative bear market experience motivated the young developer to abandon the plethora of speculative tokens and instead focus solely on Bitcoin and the mechanics and philosophy behind it. He pored through books like Saifedean Ammous’ 2018 book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” and Ludwig von Mises' 1940 classic, “Human Action.” He came out of that phase a newly converted bitcoin maximalist.  After that conversion, Ngako also realized the literature that had affected him so deeply wasn’t available in any African language, so he launched Exonumia Africa, a nonprofit focused on translating Bitcoin literature into African languages.  “Translating ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ into Swahili is a work in progress that got sidelined by Machankura,” Ngako said. “We still want to do it.”  It’s not clear when Ngako will resume his translation work. Right now, his sole focus is growing Machankura by raising capital and hiring his first three employees.  “I'm still bootstrapping,” Ngako said “I’ll have a team of at least three people in April that I'll be working with full time, but for now, I'm still the only person working on this.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/machankura-bitcoin-wallet-without-smartphones-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/346aa4663543a957bbe2ff66809b77668217814f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393893,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgQ5,1681733364,"StarkNet Aims to Enhance Scalability, Privacy and Security on Ethereum","The problem:  One of the problems with having custody of your own crypto is how difficult it is for everyday users to navigate the technology. A simple mistake can mean there is no way to recover your digital assets. For example, if you lose the “keys” (a series of alphanumeric characters) to your crypto account, you could lose access to your crypto forever. Traditional crypto wallets don’t have set mechanisms in place that could let you recover your account if you do lose access to it, unlike what happens with bank accounts in traditional banking.  Humans are bound to make mistakes, and blockchain developers recognize that simple mishaps are inevitable. In order to make crypto more user-friendly, crypto needs fail-safe mechanisms for owning crypto.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: StarkNet  StarkWare, an Israel-based software company that wants to enhance scalability, privacy and security issues on the Ethereum blockchain, is one of the first projects to embrace account abstraction (AA).  Account abstraction aims to combine user accounts and smart contracts into a single type of account, allowing for security mechanisms such as social recovery and multisignatures. With AA, users won’t need to use their private keys to sign off on every transaction.  StarkNet is a layer 2, or companion blockchain, to Ethereum created by StarkWare. It is one of the first projects to go full steam ahead with AA, and one of the first blockchains to natively integrate it.  Its founders, Eli Ben-Sasson and Uri Kolodny, more casually known as the Ernie and Bert of blockchain (it’s still up for debate who is who), have known each other since they were both 18 years old. Ben-Sasson, a computer science professor at Technion, has been involved longer in the blockchain space as co-founder of Zcash, the privacy crypto on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Ben-Sasson and Kolodny decided to tackle the challenges of scaling and privacy on the Ethereum blockchain together, founding StarkWare in 2018.  One of StarkWare’s projects is its blockchain, StarkNet, which is a validity rollup that scales Ethereum. Rollups execute transactions off-chain and then send the transaction data back on-chain to verify them.  StarkNet is unusual because AA is natively integrated into the protocol. Unlike Ethereum, where AA, also known as ERC-4337, is an additional layer on top of Ethereum, users of StarkNet can natively use AA without having to reprogram their wallets into smart contracts.  But in order to understand what AA does, it is important to understand the different types of accounts on Ethereum and how they solve problems.  There are two types of accounts on Ethereum: external owned accounts (EOA) and contract accounts (CA), and they differ in terms of how they perform transactions over Ethereum.  EOAs are the most popular type of account on Ethereum (like a MetaMask wallet), where users are given a pair of keys: a public and a private key. Users send funds to an EOA using their public keys. But only the account’s owner (the user that has the private key’s information) can actually initiate transactions from that account.  CAs, better known as “smart contracts,” are accounts that are controlled by code – not private keys. Therefore, they cannot initiate transactions themselves. An EOA needs to send a transaction (which acts like a coded instruction) to a CA in order for it to execute transactions.  If you lose a private key to an EOA account, you’re out of luck, because there is no way to regain access to your account (there’s no help desk or “password reset” button). Therefore, you lose access to your funds.  Account abstraction addresses the shortcomings of EOAs by merging the two types, therefore allowing users to have built-in fail-safe mechanisms and other special features for verifying transactions.  Under AA, user accounts can program social recovery systems into their wallets where several people – each with a key of their own – have the ability to access that account should the owner lose their private key. Then there’s also the option of creating “multisig wallets,” which requires multiple people to sign off on transactions as an extra layer of security.  So what’s the difference between account abstraction on Ethereum versus StarkNet? On StarkNet, AA is natively integrated in wallets and applications on the blockchain. On Ethereum, there’s still extra work that needs to be taken by providers and wallets in order for AA to be integrated with wallets.  “The legacy that exists on Ethereum is a very limiting factor in this regard, meaning even if you do introduce AA, anyone developing an application has to take into account a very significant installed base of EOA accounts,” said Kolodny. “On StarkNet, we start from a clean slate, all you have are these smart wallets. That's the only sort of interaction that users have with the network.”  Use cases  So what can be done with account abstraction on StarkNet?  Security checks for authorizing transactions that already exist in the Web2 sphere, such as facial ID or fingerprint login, are already available on StarkNet. “This is literally already working on applications on StarkNet,” said Ben-Sasson. “This immediacy of having the security and the [user experience] of whichever security means you're using on a day-to-day basis, you get it at the core protocol level already today on StarkNet.”  Another use case that is natively available on StarkNet is what Ben-Sasson calls the “deadman switch.” Thanks to AAn on StarkNet, users can have features and coded logic built in that can transfer financial assets to others (that are pre-approved) in the event something happens. “If I just get run by a bus, then I can have the funds transferred automatically to some other address,” said Ben-Sasson. In a real world example, this would mimic that of a will and the transferring of traditional assets – which would be costly because lawyers and procedures are involved. This “switch” skips the middleman and transfers digital assets in the event that something major happens, which can be programmed through code.  Lastly, multisig features, where multiple users can sign off on transactions as an extra layer of security are already available on StarkNet.  What’s to come?  The biggest hurdle with account abstraction is it’s not widespread yet. Ben-Sasson and Kolodny agreed there needs to be some education for users on how this feature works in order for it to take off and for crypto to become more mainstream. Until then, several projects have started to signal their interest in AA and using StarkNet for those use cases.  Kolodny shared that gaming applications have turned to StarkNet to build their apps with AA because other chains' high gas costs have made it hard for any developer to build what they need on-chain. “People for the first time actually are able to build the games that they wanted to build,” Kolodny said.  Payment processor Visa told CoinDesk of a system in development using StarkNet, describing it in a thought-leadership proposal published in December. Visa detailed a “novel solution” for how StarkNet could be used to automate crypto transactions payments for bills. “With StarkNet’s account model, we were able to implement our delegable accounts solution thus enabling auto payments for self-custodial wallets,” the Visa researchers wrote.  But for now, getting developers to build on StarkNet and “warming them up to these concepts [such as account abstraction] and getting them to creatively think about what this can do, is going to take a bit of time and effort and education,” Kolodny said.

42393902,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbhAF,1681733339,Shamba Network Sows the Future of Sustainable Agriculture in Africa,"The problem  Financial inclusion and access to global finance has always been lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. Although gains have been made, as of 2021 only 55% of the population had a bank account, according to the World Bank. The problem is more acute in rural areas, where banks are few and far between. Mobile banking solutions that allow users to transfer money and access microfinance, including lending and insurance, through their cell phones have existed since 2007, but their effectiveness in supporting economic development is contested.  More than that, these services are not geared towards addressing climate change, which disproportionately affects sub-Saharan Africa. While financial tools to address and mitigate the effects of climate change exist, they remain out of reach to some of the poorest populations in the world, which are the hardest hit.  Climate risk insurance, which offers compensation in case of, for example, crop failure due to drought, is often too expensive. The carbon credit market, an increasingly popular solution for combating climate change, in which certificates of carbon-alleviating projects are exchanged, depends on middlemen, such that often local communities see little to no benefit from the trades. Even if the middlemen problem was solved, carbon credits often involve hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, which is far from what the vast majority of sub-Saharan farmers have available.  In short, lack of protection from climate change is creating financial risk to a population already lacking in financial services. The problem before us is how do we combat climate change and mitigate the financial impact of climate change on sub-Saharan Africa?  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Shamba Network  Millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa are smallholder farmers, many of whom practice subsistence farming. They are growing enough food for themselves and their families but not enough to trade on the market for money or to barter for needed goods.  “Agriculture is the backbone of how most households [in rural Kenya] are able to support themselves,” said Kennedy Ng’ang’a, founder and CEO of Shamba Network. He studied geospatial engineering in Nairobi and later worked at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. He also has several family members who are smallholder farmers and has a wide-angle perspective on how essential working the land is for his homeland.  “I've seen for myself how important agriculture is both for people as well as for our economy at a national level, and I think there's still a lot of things that can be done to improve it.”  Ng’ang’a believes by giving farmers the right knowledge and tools to practice sustainable agriculture, “there is a lot of potential for them to be able to take control of their own destiny.” That means learning how to farm in a way that doesn’t deplete their land and ensures its productivity for decades without the need for industrially produced fertilizers.  “Most of the agricultural land in Africa is being degraded, especially because of the synthetic fertilizers,” he said. That is “being driven mainly by big multinationals that are controlling input supply,” including seeds.  Ng’ang’a started Shamba Network last year to assist farmers with sophisticated data and insights to improve their farming outcomes.  Shamba’s first priority is to promote sustainable agriculture that will not deplete farmers’ land – and therefore, their livelihoods. Second, Shamba is using blockchain to give farmers access to emerging financial paradigms like climate insurance and carbon markets.  Shamba is a multifaceted project, tackling both socioeconomic issues such as financial inclusion and development equity, as well as environmental problems, from encouraging local communities towards more sustainable practices, to ultimately tackling greenhouse gas emissions through carbon credits.  How it works  Based out of Nairobi, Kenya, Shamba Network uses blockchain, remote sensing technology and statistical sampling to solve specific problems the region and its people face. The explicit goal is to lower the costs of climate insurance by improving the tools for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). That’s a term often used in carbon marketplaces, meaning software and hardware used to measure and verify data points such as carbon dioxide emission. Along the way, Shamba is promoting regenerative practices that will, by implication, also combat climate change. Eventually Shamba aims to allow groups of smallholder farmers to make money by issuing carbon credits.  Ng’ang’a became acquainted with Web3 a few years ago, and with his agricultural expertise became particularly interested in regenerative finance (ReFi), a brand of crypto that aims to build systems that support and promote sustainability. As he investigated further he noticed that lack of data created roadblocks for innovation. “People had a lot of ideas around what they wanted to do, but they didn't necessarily have the data to back it up,” he said.  Shamba’s goal is to build ecological data oracles and smart contracts. Ecological data is information that describes the natural attributes of an ecosystem. Oracle technology is what brings this MRV information on the blockchain, the connective tissue between on- and off-chain data.  The Shamba Network tracks ecological data from over 30 free satellite databases from various universities and organizations around the world that capture air quality, precipitation, temperature, vegetation, etc., along with on-the-ground data taken from statistical sampling.  If, for example, there is a drought on a farmer’s land, satellite data will show a lack of precipitation. The oracle will feed this information to the blockchain, triggering a smart contract so that climate insurance can be automatically paid out to them. This can lower the cost of climate insurance by as much as 40%, Ng’ang’a said.  Automating manual work  Shamba has worked with microfinance company Fortune Credit and Diva Protocol to insure 150 cattle herders in northern Kenya. For example, if the vegetation level in the region falls below the certain threshold at which the livestock might face starvation, a payment will be made to the herders. The financial partner in the project works with thousands of herders and farmers, which gives ample space for Shamba to scale its impact.  These processes used to be done manually. An insurance provider would be out in the field to check the initial and final condition of the land, which added a lot of costs to the insurance. Shamba fully automates the process, such that “nobody needs to go process a payment” and the entire process is conducted through smart contracts.  “So once a farmer signs up for a product, they ensure that for one, it is going to be executed in a timely fashion. But also most importantly, nobody can step in and block their payment,” said Ng’ang’a.  Shamba’s data collection and analysis features could improve carbon credit measurements as well. The decentralized MRV tools could help ascertain the ecological impact of a group of farmers implementing sustainable or regenerative practices. This verification is crucial for creating high quality carbon offsets. A group of smallholder farmers could claim carbon impact from implementing sustainable farming practices, and the decentralized MRV tools could be used to verify this impact and create carbon credits.  Shamba’s success, to a large extent, relies on a wider ecosystem of Web 3 climate solutions. The project is part of a host of such projects: Web 3 climate data aggregator dClimate, nature credits marketplace Regen Network and forestation protection Open Forest Protocol. Together they are building the ecosystem in which projects like Ng’ang’a’s can flourish.  How Shamba helps farmers on the ground  In Gatanga, an area down roads twisting through steep, vegetation-covered hills a couple hours north of Nairobi, Shamba is laying the groundwork for smallholder farming communities to eventually issue their own carbon credits, along with local NGO Youth Action for Rural Development (YARD). The credits will represent organically grown fruit trees that will then be sold to international markets.  The trees clean the air, prevent soil erosion and produce healthy food. “Obviously, we know how trees work, they clean the air. So by planting the trees, we will be breathing fresher air,” and will be healthier, said Terry, who like the other farmers, only gave her first name. YARD has been teaching local farmers about sustainable farming techniques and healthy habits since 2002.  These farmers’ groups self-organize to pool and manage their resources. Some of them essentially run their own bank; they pool money and loan it to members when it is needed. Because the farmers are already managing money collectively, they have a process already in place for distributing any funds carbon credits, the YARD’s founder, Sebastian Wambugu Maina, said.  The funds could be crucial. To buy the equipment needed to grow 3,000 avocado trees, Terry’s group spent about KSH 5,000 ($37.30), but now they have no money to continue the project. “We need financial resources,” she said. “Obviously the income is not going to come tomorrow, or in two months’ time,” but they are trying to build a sustainable business that will continue indefinitely.  Shamba’s funding challenge  Shamba generates revenue through commissions from the insurance fees and eventually will also benefit from carbon credits sold.  But in order to grow the project, Ng’ang’a says the startup also needs funding. Much like with other projects in the regenerative finance space, funding can be difficult. The market for these products is either small or in some cases non-existent, so typical investors might find it a hard sell. There are however, ESG-oriented investors including Mercy Corps Ventures or Cerulean Ventures that have shown interest in such startups.  Ng’ang’a has so far sustained the project through Gitcoin grants, as well as some funding from a Filecoin accelerator. For about a year, seven people around the world have been building this full time with only $200,000 in funding. The founder has been trying to boost growth with traditional equity funding, but it has been an uphill battle.  “Most of the venture capital funding doesn't necessarily come from Africa. It's people who can stomach a lot of risk, who actually bet on African entrepreneurs,” Ng’ang’a said. “So we are always trying to find other ways to survive, even as we try this [equity-based funding].""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/shamba-network-ecological-data-oracle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c2517fdb626a484d9e7bb7e058d01e0bed2e0a0-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393899,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbgur,1681733318,Regen Network Calculates the Real Price of Our Actions,"The problem  Fiat currency derives its value from the laws of supply and demand, assigning economic value to goods and services. (Most) cryptocurrencies largely follow the same logic. What these models are not particularly good at doing is encompassing other types of value; social, environmental and ethical. Perhaps that’s why the unintended consequences of transactions are known as “externalities,” as if the effects on air and water quality, for instance, of a company’s work has zero impact on the company’s costs down the line or the people running the operation.  “Everything that you buy has a certain financial price, but none of the planetary, none of the ecological impact is calculated into that,” said Christian Shearer, co-founder and chief investment officer of Regen Network.  On top of that, the complexity of modern economies makes it very difficult to assess the impact of any transaction. How can any individual track the environmental or social implications of a good with components from 43 countries in six continents, made out of materials sourced from several other places? (That’s your iPhone, by the way.)  For natural assets this complexity is often solved by centralized entities. Carbon credits, which try to create market incentives for positive steps in the capture or avoidance of greenhouse gasses depend on intermediaries, are traded on what is known as voluntary carbon marketplaces, which in turn become referees for evaluation and verification. This often means a lack of transparency, which has led to serious criticism of their efficacy, and rebuttals from the marketplaces.  Underlying the pursuit of this transparency is the belief a measurable impact can eventually be mitigated. So the question is, how do we measure the true cost of our economic activity?  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Regen Network  Back in 2017, Gregory Landua, Christian Shearer and Brecht Deriemaeker were sustainability consultants who saw crypto as a possible solution to the lack of transparency in transactions that hampered environmental accountability.  The three men worked together at Terra Genesis International, which Landua founded and then led. The consultancy continues today to work with companies looking to improve the sustainability of their supply chains or products but also works in broader regenerative agriculture projects. Previous work includes sourcing rubber for Timberland, Vans, and the North Face.  In this consulting work, the three men felt “that there was a real lack of digital infrastructure to be able to account for ecological health,” Landua said. A lot of the time, the regenerative projects they were working on would be composed of stakeholders “who all broadly agreed that they wanted something to happen,” such as carbon neutrality, soil health or biodiversity, he said.  The process used to generate trust about such ecological impacts was “archaic,” “opaque” and “rife with perverse incentives,” he said. This meant that “even when you have all of these stakeholders who have really good intentions, our observation was the majority of the time projects and outcomes failed to be met,” Landua said.  Amid the initial coin offering craze of 2017, new ideas around money and its role in societal systems were becoming mainstream, said Landua. The blockchain ledger, with its key attributes of transparency and immutability, seemed like the right technology to try to tackle some of the foundational issues around ecological assets. It could dissolve some of the opacity of carbon markets and be used to build consensus around ecological outcomes. Landua, Shearer and Deriemaeker decided to start Regen Network to bring the power of the blockchain to environmental accountability.  How it works  The technology the three founders and their team have built is essentially a tailor-made blockchain to mint ecological assets. What is more, the methodologies of capturing data and distributing value related to these assets are also stored on the blockchain for everyone to see. Once digitized and on the blockchain, buyers of ecological assets will be able to choose the ones that fit their needs, as well as audit the methodology behind their claims and therefore their efficacy.  Regen Network is a layer 1 blockchain, meaning it is the underlying technology that makes up the network. It defines the consensus mechanism used to record transactions on the ledger, who can participate in it as well as other fundamental components.  The blockchain is developed on the Tendermint consensus architecture, which also underlies the Cosmos blockchain. This architecture describes a public blockchain, meaning that it is open to participation, using proof-of-stake consensus. It is agnostic to the programming language used.  One of Cosmos’ key advantages is that it can be used to build application-specific blockchains, just like Regen Network. By contrast, on the Ethereum network, specific applications are built as layer 2 applications, while the processing of transactions and consensus happens in layer 1.  Regen’s digital ledger is built to house three types of protocols crucial to ecological accounting, according to its white paper.  Ecological State Protocols, which “define the algorithms and conditions necessary to verify a certain state or change of state on a piece of land”  Ecological Contracts, which “fund and reward desired change in ecological state”  Supply Protocols, “which tie ecological state into supply chains in trusted ways”  Initially, Regen will “steward” the creation of these protocols, bringing together developers and scientists.” First, they are working on carbon sequestration. The Regen Marketplace, where ecological assets are traded, launched in October, and so far has only included carbon credit projects. More types of protocols are proposed in the white paper, involving grassland health, regenerative agriculture and blue carbon, such that more climate-positive behavior is incentivized.  The different types of protocols will also take into account methodologies for measuring environmental attributes and outcomes, such that buyers of the assets can discern exactly what they are getting themselves into.  Governance  The governance of a blockchain ecosystem is vital to its mission. Without proper governance it is likely to fall into the same pitfalls of the intermediaries it is working against – centralization, opacity and ineffectiveness.  Regen Network is, like other projects, initially governed by a centralized entity, chosen by the founders. A for-profit entity manages the token issuance and sale of its native crypto, REGEN. The founders have set up a nonprofit organization, the Regen Foundation, to be an independent guardian of the network. The Regen Consortium manages the foundation, which is open even to non-token holders.  The Regen Foundation is based in the U.S. The point of the foundation is not to raise money, but to “give power to network participants, like indigenous people, rights-of-nature organizations, scientists and activist groups, who actually need to be part of generating the trust system,” said Landua.  The foundation’s members were initially appointed and now rotate, with the consortium’s vote.  Currently, the consortium members, who are mostly in regenerative agriculture, are looking for more crypto-native organizations to join, said Szal. The consortium governs 5 million of Regen’s token, which “enables us to maintain at least 35% voting power in locked governance DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations]” to “optimize for community engagement in the governance of the blockchain,” according to the white paper.  Having non-token holders participate in the governance process is an unusual call for crypto. It “is clear that the distinct communities of users who may be unable to purchase tokens” should also have a seat at the table, said the white paper.  The governance system may not be perfect, but the team did its best to “create appropriate decentralization and checks and balances among a set of actors, and not just have it be like, ‘Oh, these VCs [venture capitalists] own all of this’,” said Landua.  The crypto conundrum  Realizing this vision is something of a Catch-22. The whole idea is to build a novel system of value, beyond economic incentives. In order to do that, Regen Network needs to work within the current system – which, by definition, doesn't align with its goals.  VCs usually look upon the size of the market, the speed of the return on their investment and the possible risks. A project that is literally trying to redefine economic value away from money likely doesn’t score well in most of these categories.  “We're not selling an easy hype story, we're selling a story around creating public open infrastructure, that should by its nature, not [be] extracting as much value from participants as possible,” said Landua.  For investors whose “primary goal is just to extract as much money out of a system as possible, Regen Network is decidedly not the right thing [...], because the whole premise is that that is not the way to build these public goods markets,” he said.  Shearer explained why it’s “frustrating” to bring investors on board: Especially in the blockchain space, often people are asking, “Why are you building this green thing? It just seems like some sort of charity effort. That doesn't sound like it's gonna make me much money. [...] Maybe I'll give it a donation sometime.”  But to him, “ecological assets have to become an incredibly important asset class in this century. Because if they don't, we're all doomed,” he says. “Carbon is already stepping up and showing that it's becoming an important asset class. Biodiversity is gonna be right on its heels – water quality, these types of things.”  If Regen’s bet pays off, which will likely require a good amount of government policy, natural capital and ecological assets will be “a multi-trillion dollar industry that's being born before our eyes,” says Landua. So even “a small responsible percentage of that is “a crazy amount of capital.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/regen-network-layer1-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9945326f375b804a4b2e0a33a2ad4285d165a11-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Privacy on the blockchain is dependent on the ability to hide behind long, wonky addresses – pseudonymity is the natural state of a blockchain. Tens of billions of dollars move through Ethereum’s virtual pipes every day relatively unnoticed, just because people don’t know where the money came from or where it is going.  Oftentimes, that is very problematic. Blockchain’s mix of pseudonymity with an immutable record of transactions enables peers to trustlessly transact online, but it also empowers bad actors to cheat, steal and exploit.  If stakeholders knew where to look, they could, for example, find data that shows client and exchange funds are being co-mingled.  Or, that Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research, once an industry giant, had a material part of its balance sheet backed by FTT, the FTX exchange token.  Regulators are doing what they can to make sure that on-ramps into the crypto economy, like crypto exchanges, identify users as they come aboard. But know-your-customer (KYC) rules can only do so much when fresh addresses are easy to spin up and crypto mixers allow people to shield their transaction history.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Arkham Intelligence  Critics of cryptocurrency often accuse the sector of being skewed toward early adopters. Having a first-mover advantage, the quicker you are to a crypto project the more likely you can amass a small fortune in tokens while the price is low. Sometimes project insiders are able to benefit the most by surreptitiously collecting tokens. Other times seemingly unconnected addresses appear to collude to sway governance decisions.  Without putting a name to an address, it’s difficult to understand what’s being sent around. While some say that privacy is a fundamental part of crypto, there’s also another school of thought that says market fairness and equality is only found in markets that are transparent. There are legitimate needs for privacy, say the founders of blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, but the market as a whole is better off if the public knows who is making the largest trades in the ecosystem.  Arkham Intelligence hosts a relatively new platform that enables users to scrutinize blockchain addresses, inspect both sides of a transaction, track fund movements and investigate counterparty connections. Its user interface sorts data by entity and tracks the flow of funds that way as opposed to sorting things by token, which is how most of its competitors organize data.  The company has closed $12 million in funding, and plans to exit beta and launch publicly by the end of 2023. With its current runway, the firm plans to expand its feature set, including support for more chains, and build more tools that will be familiar to traditional finance (TradFi) users.  “It's very difficult to actually figure out, despite its transparency, who the people behind those transactions are, what they're doing with their money,” said Miguel Morel, a founder of Arkham.  Arkham users can see the relationship between entities in real time and track relationships between the two.  Say, for instance, a large fund makes a move on a token, either adding to its position or liquidating it. Users will be able to see what occurs and where the funds are flowing.  “As a cryptocurrency user, you must manage your exposure at all times,” Morel says. “And you have to understand what it is that you're investing in, what it is that you're trading and what it is you're speculating in.”  Arkham’s dashboards allow for granular filtering and tracking of the relationships between addresses, so users can see where coins are going.  For instance, via Arkham, it’s possible to see how the entity that exploited the Euler Finance protocol is moving around the funds, including deposits into wallets controlled by North Korea’s Lazarus Group.  Sure, it’s possible to do this with a regular block explorer that’s free, but it would be a much more difficult task.  “The good thing about blockchains is that it's not a black box. You don't need a subpoena. You don't need to wait for a judge to release information,” Morel said. “You don't need to wait for the company to release information about what's going on internally. You can just look at the books.”  Arkham Intelligence is currently in private beta. Already it has media (including CoinDesk), crypto exchanges, hedge funds and other financial institutions as users. It gained a significant amount of buzz around the time of the FTX collapse, shortly before/after it launched, because of the company’s Twitter threads outlining and helping to explain the odd flow of funds at the defunct exchange.  Transparency versus anonymity  Morel said he was motivated to build Arkham to remove pseudonymity from blockchains.  While some believe this forced unveiling is antithetical to crypto, Morel disagrees.  Morel says that even before he started Arkham he saw that there were two narratives within the crypto industry: one that highlights the transparency and decentralization of blockchain, and another that emphasizes its privacy and pseudonymity.  ""And they're both true, or at least they were both true. Mostly because while the blockchains are completely transparent, auditable and public with their information, it's incredibly difficult to actually use that data,” he said. “With Arkham, that's actually what I wanted to… I wanted to marry that as an idea.”  All the necessary data to tell who's who on-chain is public and transparent, but unless you know the entity behind an address this trove of data is useless for the average user.  “People are publicly broadcasting to everyone their activity on a minute-by-minute basis, every single time they make a transaction,” he said. “We're basically just making software that matches that information to the relevant person and then shows that to the end user.”  After all, why should the right of a large investor’s anonymity trump that of a retail user wanting to know what they are investing in?  Morel points out that traditional finance also has a similar problem with opaqueness, but there are remedies for this, such as the 13F form the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires people or funds to file when they manage over $100 million in assets and take positions in listed companies.  “What we’re building is 10 times, 100 times, 100 times more granular than that,” Morel said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ZRX | ARKM,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/arkham-intelligence-cryptocurrency-blockchain-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4da7958efef305441dbae69d14a1461ee97a75dd-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411034,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4Hd,1681733292,Immutable Passport Opens Borders for Web3 Games,"The problem  If you’ve been around Web3 at all, there’s been a long-standing theory that gaming will be the way to onboard the “next billion” users to crypto, or the metaverse or non-fungible tokens (NFT). Yet, despite hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into Web3 gaming and NFTs, there still hasn’t been a breakthrough moment. With the overall gaming industry hauling in over $184 billion in revenue in 2022 with 3.2 billion players, there’s a high incentive to tap into the huge revenue and audience around gaming.  There are a few roadblocks preventing the mainstream adoption of Web3 games to date: One is the high cost of entry for some games, which require NFTs to play. For example, play-to-earn game Axie Infinity required three “Axies” to begin, which at one point cost around $300. That’s a lot more than the $60 price tag for a hit AAA game like “The Last of Us.” And after Axie suffered a $625 million hack, people inside and outside crypto were rightly concerned about security in Web3 gaming.  Beyond the cost barrier, one of the most pressing obstacles Web3 gaming faces to onboarding those billion players is that it’s really hard to get started – and gaming is supposed to be fun.  There’s a high level of friction for Web3 gaming newbies. At the bare minimum, people currently need to set up a crypto wallet, but most likely also need to add funds in a specific cryptocurrency and/or buy non-fungible tokens (NFT) to play a Web3 game. And this process might need to be repeated for each and every Web3 game at the moment.  Realistically, as soon as someone sees they need to write down a 24-word seed phrase and keep it in a locked safe to proceed, the fun is gone and most likely, so are they. It’s game over. How can the metaverse make gaming onboarding less of a turnoff?  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The solution: Immutable Passport  Enter a passport project from Immutable Labs, a crypto unicorn from Sydney, Australia founded by James Ferguson, Robbie Ferguson and Alex Connolly in 2018.  The Immutable Passport is aimed at solving Web3's roadblocks for adoption by offering easy onboarding and interoperability. The developers describe the idea as similar to a single-sign-on (SSO) system like Google where you can use one account to sign in everywhere, seamlessly.  ""Passport is a self-custodial wallet, where users can sign in with just an email and one-time password – it will be a game changer for players and radically reduce user acquisition costs."" Immutable’s President and co-founder Robbie Ferguson said in a press release announcing the product.  Smartly, the Immutable team is aiming Passport not only at users but at game developers so that projects are working within an interoperable gaming universe from the early stages of development and won’t need to retrofit the Passport into the code. Ultimately end users will benefit from the seamless integration.  But while the end goal is a smooth, invisible, multi-game product, there were some bumps in the road and some valuable lessons learned along the way.  Ownership of in-game objects for all  Alex Connolly, co-founder and chief technology officer of Immutable, told CoinDesk the company’s origins started during the early days of NFTs as the founders traded on black markets for character skins, which are digital wearables for in-game characters and items sometimes referred to as “cosmetics,” for games such as CounterStrike and RuneScape.  “We immediately saw that at the moment, these [Web3] games are really shallow, but it should be possible to build better games. And if you had better games, and the items were tradable as NFTs, that would be a way better experience than one that we were used to when we were playing those games.” Connolly said.  Connolly said the founders were trading those items on the internet with other players of popular games on non-official sites. Almost no major games allow players to easily exchange or sell these in-game items.  “We had that realization: People should own items in games,” he said. That set the trio off on a journey that eventually led to a billion-dollar business, he continued. “We built games and where we ran into problems, we built technology to solve the problems that those games had run into. And I think those problems have changed over time. And that's been the journey of Immutable overall.”  One of the first games they built taught them the expensive lesson that gameplay should live off-chain, after realizing the first game they built fully on the Ethereum blockchain cost about $100 a play.  “It definitely wasn't fun enough to justify $100 fees,” Connolly said.  They focused on fun, scalability and highlighting the “why” of NFTs with their highly successful game Gods Unchained, which is a card game similar to Magic the Gathering, where the mechanics of owning and trading cards to build a deck is part of the DNA of the gameplay. The ownership of the items is key and easily understandable to the community.  “We think that one amazing thing that gaming can do for crypto adoption generally, is actually giving people an incentive to use the technology. Like people who don't even understand anything about crypto can usually understand, ‘I want to trade in-game items,’” Connolly said. But the founders also noted some things builders have gotten wrong. One that stood out was an ecosystem that was forcing users to get a new wallet for specific apps and games.  “In general, that's deeply confusing.” Connelly said, comparing the friction to “the idea of spinning up a bank account every time you go to a different restaurant. It would be clearly absurd. And I think Passport is our latest offering on that front. which is that it is incredibly important for games that we can give users a smooth and seamless onboarding.”  The missing piece: The breakthrough Web3 game  One challenge the project faces is a resistance from some bigger players to allowing true interoperability, with big publishers such as Activision Blizzard, Riot Games and Epic Games resistant to letting their intellectual property (IP) exit their AAA game universes and operate in another, which may not maintain their standards of graphics or gaming. There has also been pushback from the gaming community itself, with a 2022 survey finding that most gamers had negative feelings towards crypto and NFTs.  There have been some positive signs from the big brands, with Sony recently filing a patent to allow for gaming NFTs to be transferred between games, hardware and even non-PlayStation consoles like the Xbox.  But Immutable isn’t waiting for the gaming industry to change. Rather than target the existing games, Immutable is focused on fostering the next generation of builders with a $500 million fund for game developers. In the end, for mainstream Web3 gaming to really take off, there has to be a game that everyone wants to play and that breakthrough hit just doesn’t exist yet.  “Some games are massive successes, some games won’t. Our goal is to make sure that all those games have access to the tools to give themselves the best possible chance of success,” Connolly said.  Immutable is fostering this next generation of games by not only supporting the ease of onboarding that Immutable Passport provides to users, but also making sure that developers feel supported through their builds, launches and beyond, stressing that Immutable is “making a commitment to a several year development cycle and then a several year maintenance cycle.”  By funding a rich pipeline of games and enabling developers to create scalable and seamless experiences, the Immutable Passport will not only help get people playing but allow them to continue to grow in Web3 experiences.  “I think sometimes people forget that the user’s experience doesn't stop with onboarding,” Connolly noted.  In other words, it’s great to have an easy onboarding experience to one game with Immutable Passport, but the whole idea is that to be a real success, it has to be about more than one game and one experience. To create a successful Web3 gaming ecosystem that attracts millions and then billions of users, it can’t be a one-and-done but a vibrant and variety-filled world that has rich possibilities and growth.  Connolly and the Immutable team hope they can solve the issues that currently plague new players, where they put some money into one marketplace or cryptocurrency and then don’t understand where those funds of NFTs are in another wallet or game. The disjointed nature for a user is “absolutely crazy” right now.  The company’s recent partnership with Polygon is another step showing their commitment to building “an Ethereum-centric gaming ecosystem that is poised to take Web3 mainstream and bring digital ownership to millions of people around the world,” said Robbie Ferguson in a statement.  Connolly added that the partnership would allow “game developers to be comfortable that they're building in the right place.”  CORRECTION (April 18, 2023 18:24 UTC): The name of investor King River Capital was misspelled on a the image listing company facts in a previous version of the story.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/immutable-passport-interoperable-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f263692e40eb4d20ff3017da3f74d5c839a5420-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411055,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4RY,1681733269,Bitcoin Beach’s Pioneering Circular Economy Is Making a Global Impact,"The problem  Roughly 70% of Salvadorans don’t have a bank account. The average Salvadoran earns about $400 per month, so the cost of onboarding and maintaining accounts far outstrips whatever meager revenue they could ever generate for banks.  This means the majority of Salvadorans are unable to save, invest or access credit. Local businesses – including those that cater to tourists – are unable to qualify for merchant accounts, making credit card payments impossible.  Remittances comprise over 26% of El Salvador’s gross domestic product (GDP), but the cost of sending money to the country consumes up to 50% of the transfer value. Recipients then incur additional costs of time and money as they travel long distances before waiting in line to collect physical cash.  Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto  The idea: Bitcoin Beach  Mike Peterson runs a successful food service business in California that sells desserts and barbeque. One of the company’s bestsellers is chocolate-covered bacon.  “It actually tastes quite good,” Peterson said. “The key is, you’ve got to fry the bacon really, really crispy, so it's kind of like a chocolate-covered peanut – salty and sweet together.”  Twenty years ago he bought a house in the small town of El Zonte on El Salvador’s Pacific coast; a “world surfing mecca,” according to some. El Zonte has a sparse population of around 3,000. Many of the residents are either poor or on the brink of poverty – national per capita GDP sits at just over $4,500 (U.S. per capita GDP is about $70,000). But the beaches are great, attracting recreational surfers like Peterson who became involved with 30 to 40 faith-based charity projects in El Zonte over a decade ago.  In 2019, the charitable work Peterson and others were doing caught the eye of an anonymous donor who had accumulated a large sum of bitcoin (BTC). The donor wanted to fund the efforts of Peterson, who had joined forces with El Zonte locals including Roman Martinez and Jorge Valenzuela. There was only one catch – the donation would be in bitcoin and the donor didn’t want the bitcoin converted to cash.  “I was already a bitcoiner, so I was like, ‘Wow, this sounds amazing!’” Peterson recalled. “I mean, who else would entertain some crazy idea like this? And so we came back to them with a proposal and said, ‘Hey, we'll inject this into our ongoing programs that we have, and we will try to create this bitcoin circular economy.’”  The home of that circular economy – an economy where BTC becomes a standard medium of exchange – is now known as Bitcoin Beach.  A day on the beach  Peterson splits his time between El Zonte and California nowadays. The Bitcoin Beach team has grown to 15 contributors and over a dozen more volunteers. They have nailed down bitcoin adoption to a three-part process.  The first phase involves injecting bitcoin into the local community. This is done by encouraging local businesses to accept payment in BTC and establishing social programs that also pay participants in bitcoin.  In order for that to happen, locals must download a wallet, get some BTC and execute their first transaction. Peterson says it’s the toughest part of the entire process.  “The biggest hurdle is just getting people to make their first bitcoin transaction and help them get to that lightbulb moment of ‘Wow, this is so much better, it's so much cheaper, it's so much easier!’ Peterson explained. “It requires a lot of hand holding and going out and spending time with the people to get them to make their first transaction.”  The second phase addresses the meat of the matter – promoting consistent bitcoin usage. This is where a circular economy is actually created.  Given how remittances are central to the lives of so many Salvadorans, one way of creating consistent bitcoin usage is transitioning families from a traditional to a bitcoin- centered remittance infrastructure.  Enter Strike, an app that runs on the Lightning Network, a layer 2, or companion, scaling system that enables cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions. Funds sent from abroad via Strike can be received as local currency in the recipient’s bank – for free. Compare that to traditional remittance providers such as Western Union that take a hefty chunk of the transfer value, make you wait in line and require an hour-long bus ride that costs $2.  But it doesn’t stop there, El Zonte residents are now using bitcoin to pay their electricity bills and buy lunch for their kids.  Peterson estimates that more than 70% of families in El Salvador have at least one smartphone with internet in the household. Data from the World Bank shows only 55% of Salvadorans have internet access.  “With bitcoin on their phone, they can zap it back and forth,” Peterson explained. “If their kid is at school and wants to go buy something for lunch, they can text their mom and say, ‘Hey, can you send me 20,000 [satoshis] so I can buy lunch?’”  The third and final phase of the adoption process – the point of it all – is when bitcoin facilitates the creation of jobs, tourism and tech startups.  “Bitcoin is a tool. The end goal is not just to get a bunch of people using bitcoin,” Peterson said. “For us the end goal is really to empower the youth and see transformation of opportunity happen in El Salvador. Obviously we believe that bitcoin is a critical part of that, but really for us, it's the social change that's the most important thing.”  The domino effect  Bitcoin Beach has now garnered over 3,000 bitcoin users across more than 500 families and 120 businesses. The project has expanded 3 hours east to Punta Mango, another popular surfing destination.  Similar initiatives have popped up all over the globe – Bitcoin Lake, Bitcoin Island, Bitcoin Ekasi, Bitcoin Beach Brazil (Praia Bitcoin Brasil), Bitcoin Jungle and Bitcoin Beach Vietnam to name a few.  Galoy, a bitcoin fintech firm, created the Bitcoin Beach Wallet in 2020 to help spur on the project’s goal of establishing a bitcoin economy.  But perhaps the project’s most impressive accolade was planting the idea of making bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador – something that was eventually achieved on Sept. 7, 2021.  Peterson and crew had been training young locals to become lifeguards as a way out of the dark underworld of Salvadoran gangs. The youth were internationally certified, then paid in BTC for their services.  “El Salvador had never had professional lifeguards as part of their civil protection service,” Peterson said. “Every year there would be 200 to 300 people that would drown on the beaches.”  The Bitcoin Beach lifeguard program successfully certified 80 youths, and El Salvador’s Minister of Tourism took notice. The government adopted the lifeguard program and rolled it out nationally. It was a resounding success and Bitcoin Beach became somewhat of a media darling.  All along, Peterson and his team had been quietly advocating for the government to make bitcoin legal tender – after all, El Salvador had already abandoned its traditional currency, the colón, in favor of the U.S. dollar in 2001.  Although it’s not clear how much influence Bitcoin Beach bore on El Salvador’s decision to become the first country in history to make bitcoin legal tender, it’s hard to deny the project played a key role in the decision.  “I don't know how much that impacted things – obviously, it helped,” Peterson said. “But the government, they're the ones that had the courage to decide to do what's best for El Salvador and make that jump.”  It’s not a stretch to say Peterson and his team at Bitcoin Beach made a small dent in the universe.

The digital asset saw a good run last week following the Shapella upgrade given that withdrawals from the Ethereum Beacon contract were not as high as expected. However, the ETH withdrawals have increased over the weekend and the cryptocurrency is experiencing buy pressure that is keeping it below $2,100. Ethereum Withdrawals Cross $2 Billion Last week, the pending Ethereum withdrawals were around $1.6 billion, which worked out to around 3% of the total locked supply. However, the tide has now turned as more withdrawal requests came over the weekend. This quickly brought the amount above $2 billion and the price suffered for it. Related Reading: FTX Token (FTT) Price Doubles In 24 Hours, Here’s Why According to Token Unlocks, pending ETH withdrawals are now worth approximately $1.9 billion, working out to over 905,000 ETH waiting to be withdrawn. The net staking balance also took a nosedive and is now down to 350,980 ETH worth $735 million at the time of writing. Withdrawals have also surpassed newly staked coins as well with 1.04 million ETH withdrawn since the Shapella upgrade and only 380,420 ETH staked in the same time period. Estimated daily withdrawals now sit at $68 million per day with $33 million expected to be withdrawn in the next 10 hours. ETH withdrawals cross $2 billion | Source: Token Unlocks One of the things that have seen a positive upside is the APR for stakers which has risen to 4.99%. The total number of validators on the network also rose drastically over the last week. It went from 286,000 validators to more than 472,000 validators in four days. ETH Still Battling The Bears Despite the increased withdrawals leading to more selling pressure for Ethereum, the digital asset is not giving up easily. It has lost its footing at $2,100 but has seen significant support mounted just above $2,000. This meant that ETH was able to minimize losses through the low liquidity period of the weekend and has come out into the new week still trending above $2,000. ETH trending above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The majority of the resistance for the digital asset is now sitting just above $2,200. However, if ETH were to experience the kind of momentum it saw last week, it would easily be beating this resistance level before the week is over. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slowdown At $30,000 Only Temporary, Here’s Why Its major bull case lies in the fact that ETH is still trading well above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. And as long as ETH continues to maintain this level, forecasts remain incredibly bullish once withdrawals taper off. At the time of writing, ETH is seeing meager gains of 0.04% on the 24-hour chart. It is trading at $2,087, while its trading volume rose 32% in the last day to sit at $9.3 billion.

The token now has a market capitalization of $240 million, placing it among the top 200 cryptocurrencies by that measure. The tokens, which can be used on the Web3 domain management platform as a governance token, saw over $340 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours on exchanges such as Binance and Gate.io.  The price action in Space ID, which allows users to exchange, register and manage crypto-based domain names, reinforces Binance Launchpad's position as a lucrative platform for traders looking to get allocations of tokens in new projects. Binance announced its support for Space ID last month, giving holders of BNB tokens a chance to purchase the ID tokens.

RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the strength of an asset’s price movement. An RSI reading of 70 or higher is generally considered overbought, while an RSI reading of 30 or lower is considered oversold. Therefore, an RSI reading of 63 suggests there is still room for the cryptocurrency to grow further. AVAX total market cap now at $6.7 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retreats To $29,000 Level – Further Drop Imminent? This RSI reading aligns with the recent crossing of the Moving Average curve, suggesting an upward trend for AVAX/USD. Could AVAX muster enough strength and hit its $21 target this week? Investors who are looking for an asset with favorable market sentiment and potential for growth may consider AVAX/USD. However, as with any investment, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions. -Featured image from Journal Du Coin",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/avalanche-rumbles-with-18-gain/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42412264,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yDc,1681725328,Ether’s Strong Price Action May Continue Until End of Month: Coinbase,"The price of ether (ETH) has been resilient following the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade (aka Shappela) last week, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Friday.  The successful upgrade supported better-than-expected ether price action, which Coinbase says could continue through the end of April. The upgrade allows validators to withdraw staked ether that have been locked up and to claim rewards.  Within the first 24 hours of withdrawals being enabled, ether's supply has been limited for a few reasons, the report said.  First, the “majority of addresses receiving partial withdrawals have not spent their received rewards with around 70% of addresses now having properly set their withdrawal credential prefixes to 0x01,” analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  Second, full withdrawals are being processed, but their impact on the market has been partly offset by a “healthy number of new entrants in the validator entry queue,” the note said.  Another reason is ether's relative underperformance compared with bitcoin (BTC) year to date, which has left a lot of room for catchup after the Shanghai upgrade, the note added.  Coinbase says because of this relative underperformance, it has seen some rotation from bitcoin into ether.  The macro environment also remains conducive to risk taking for the time being, which also may support ether’s price, the report added.

Gamma is a semiautomated liquidity manager that allows users to provide liquidity at the most lucrative pools across six different blockchains.  The protocol also features staking of its native token, GAMMA, which is producing a variable yield of 7.04%, according to the Gamma website.

Market depth is a measure used to evaluate liquidity. It demonstrates how much capital is required to move an asset by a certain percentage based on the order book.  The Gamma protocol offers one product that is targeted at individuals and institutions as it offers a passive yield. Another is aimed at Web3 companies and decentralized autonomous organizations, offering consultation and back-tested strategies for treasuries.  While interest in Gamma has been muted since its 2021 introduction, Defillama data shows that it is one of the fastest-growing yield products this year with total value locked, market cap and fully diluted valuation all surging as the DeFi sector bounces back from a lackluster 2022.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value has soared 80% this year, beating traditional risky assets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, by a wide margin. The rally comes after a 12-month decline, when prices fell 76% and bottomed out last November.  The drop and subsequent recovery are analogous to the pattern seen in the 2018-19 bear market in terms of length and trajectory, according to Lunde.  ""Bottoms in both cycles lasted for approximately 370 days. And the peak-to-trough return after 510 days of both cycles reached 60%,"" Lunde said in a note sent to clients last week. ""In 2018, the bear market rally topped 556 days after the 2017 peak, on June 29, 2019, with a 34% drawdown from the peak.  ""While history is far from likely to repeat in a similar fashion if the fractal were to continue – BTC would peak around May 20 at $45,000,"" Lunde said.  Bitcoin fell 84% in 2018, with prices bottoming near $3,100 in December. The trend changed in the following months, with prices climbing to $3,700 by the start of 2019 and rising as high as $13,800 by the end of June.  Bitcoin's year-to-date rise has been widely referred to as a ""hated bullish move"" among crypto observers on Twitter, considering several prominent traders were positioned for a continued sell-off in the first quarter.  A ""hated"" bull market typically begins during peak pessimism. It reaches a fever pitch once investors who reduced risk in anticipation of an extended slide, begin to feel underexposed and join the bullish bandwagon.  ""The hated rally of 2019 ended with a significant blow-off top before BTC resumed trading at a 40-60% drawdown from its 2017 ATH,"" Lunde noted, using the acronym for all-time high. ""The early 2023 rally has all the hallmarks of a hated rally.""

11850379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527100,1681720854,Shiba Inu Price On The Verge Of A Massive 38% Breakout,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is flashing heavy signs that the price is on the verge of a massive breakout from a consolidation phase that has been ongoing since early February. As NewsBTC reported last week, SHIB has been forming an ascending triangle on the 1-day chart since March 10. The ascending triangle is one of the continuation patterns and signals that the previous trend direction is resumed after a consolidation. The uptrend is the price rally that Shiba Inu initiated on January 1 at $0.00000808, which propelled the price up to $0.00001589 on February 4 (+97%). After SHIB reached this local high, the meme coin price fell to as low as $0.00000958 on March 10. Since then, however, the Shiba Inu price has been writing higher highs. At the same time, as is characteristic for an ascending triangle formation, the Shiba Inu price showed a flat resistance level at the upper end. This price level sits at $0.00001151 for SHIB. The bulls haven’t been able to overcome this heavy resistance in eight attempts since early March..However, at the time of writing, SHIB made a new attempt and was trading at $0.00001161 after yesterday’s daily close just above the resistance line. If SHIB can close above the $0.00001151 resistance today and turn it into support, it could mean that the local high from early February is the next likely price target. A price increase of at least 38% (up to $0.00001591) could thus be on the cards. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: How The Meme Coin Weathered Whale Dumping And Emerged Stronger In other words, Shiba Inu could resume its uptrend that started in early January. After a two-month consolidation, the bulls could target the August 14, 2022 high of $0.00001787 in the medium term. This would allow for a price gain of over 55% compared to the current price. However, it is important to note that a breakout from the ascending triangle requires a high trading volume. If the breakout takes place under low volume, it may be a false signal, as some of the recent attempts have shown. This needs to be observed for the moment. What’s Driving Today’s Shiba Inu Price Breakout? One reason for the recent rise in Shiba Inu’s price could be the newfound interest from whales. Data from Etherscan.io shows that a newborn whale just made its first SHIB purchase, buying an impressive 3.484 trillion SHIB worth about $39.93 million. With this, the unknown investor has abruptly become the 29th largest holder of SHIB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set For Breakout From Bull Pattern In April Already on Thursday, April 13, the 19th largest Shiba Inu whale had invested $1.88 million to add 171.68 billion SHIB to its portfolio. New hype for Shiba Inu may also have been generated by an announcement from lead developer Shytoshi Kusama. In a recent Telegram chat, he revealed that the launch of ShibaSwap 2.0 could be imminent in the coming weeks and months. “Ignore anything that says otherwise,” stated Kusama, who did not reveal an exact launch date.

While this may seem like bad news for those invested in Bitcoin, it’s important to remember that volatility is nothing new in the world of cryptocurrencies. However, with recent regulatory crackdowns and market uncertainty, it’s hard to predict what the future holds for this digital asset. Are we on the brink of another major dip, or is this just a temporary hiccup? Related Reading: OKB Gains Nearly 50% In The Daily And Weekly Charts Bitcoin Price Stumbles In Short Term, But Continues Positive Trend Bitcoin’s latest market data reveals a momentary slip in the value of the alpha coin. According to Coingecko, Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $29,981.28, marking a 1.2% drop within the last 24 hours. However, despite this setback, the cryptocurrency is still experiencing an upward trend, as evidenced by its 6.1% rise over the past seven days. This fluctuation in Bitcoin’s value is not uncommon, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Investors must remain vigilant and track the latest market data to make informed decisions. While a short-term slump may be concerning, it’s important to look at the bigger picture and focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC’s $30,000 Level Breach To understand the current state of Bitcoin’s value, it’s essential to look at the factors that drove it up to the $30,000 level in the first place. One of the primary reasons for the rise in Bitcoin’s value was the increase in demand for this digital currency. Institutional investors and large corporations started taking an interest in Bitcoin as a store of value, which led to a surge in its price. On the other hand, the supply of Bitcoin is finite, with only 21 million coins to be mined, making it a scarce asset. This scarcity combined with rising demand created a perfect storm that drove Bitcoin’s value to previously unprecedented levels. However, the current situation is different. Several factors have caused investors to become cautious, leading to a decline in demand for Bitcoin. One of the significant reasons is the regulatory crackdown by various governments and financial institutions worldwide. BTC moves down back to the $29K level on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Injective Posts 46% Rally In Last 7 Days – Will INJ Keep Rising Next Week? Further Bitcoin Price Drop Incoming? The decline in Bitcoin’s value has led to speculation about whether it will continue to drop further. Some analysts believe that Bitcoin could be in for a further drop. The regulatory crackdown by various governments and financial institutions worldwide is likely to continue, which could lead to a decrease in demand for Bitcoin. Additionally, the increasing popularity of altcoins is a significant threat to Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin’s retreat to the $29,000 level is a reminder of the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. As such, it’s important to stay informed and make wise investment decisions based on research, rather than speculation or hype. -Featured image from Shebell & Shebell, LLC",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-price-retreats-to-29000/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/11850143.jpeg

The tokens were withdrawn from nearly 477,805 transactions that are happening every few seconds, data from the Beacon Chain tracker shows.  Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that occured simultaneously on April 12 – now allows investors to withdraw their ether staked on the Ethereum blockchain at will. Users were previously unable to withdraw staked ether.  Some analysts previously opined the event could be bearish for ether prices. A small faction of the crypto market said it could be a “sell the news” event and the likes of JP Morgan foresaw selling from staked ether balances belonging to “troubled entities.” Elsewhere, Bank of America said fundamental issues for the broader Ethereum network lingered on, evening out bullish impetus from Shapella.  Selling, however, has remained tepid so far, with users restaking the ether withdrawn or sending the same to exchanges to capture other market opportunities instead of liquidating the same for U.S. dollars or stablecoins.  Data from on-chain tool Lookonchain shows that over 19,000 ether from just three wallets were withdrawn and quickly restaked back on Ethereum – likely as a move from holders simply testing if the feature worked smoothly.  Another batch of wallets withdrew and restaked over 34,000 ether, valued over $72 million at current prices.  Some addresses, such as ""0x08De,” withdrew over 50,000 ether and deposited over 5,000 ether on crypto exchange Hubby's Ethereum staking tool. The remaining 45,000 ether was deposited on spot wallets, but data did not immediately suggest if 0x08De intended to sell the holdings.

""Plaintiffs in the billion $ FTX class action case just served @SHAQ outside his house,"" the Moskowitz law firm tweeted. ""His home video cameras recorded our service and we made it very clear that he is not to destroy or erase any of these security tapes because they must be preserved for our lawsuit."" The video recording has not yet been released.  Adam Moskowitz, co-counsel on the FTX lawsuits, confirmed the story following the publication of this article. Shaq getting served the lawsuit outside his Atlanta home ends a dramatic, almost outlandish chase during which the superstar was “hiding and driving away from our process servers for the past three months,” Mostowitz told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  Attorneys Moskowitz and David Boies are handling the case, filed by an Oklahoma FTX customer called Edwin Garrison in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  The lawyers have said previously they'd tried to reach O'Neal by leaving comments on his social media platforms including Twitter and Instagram. Earlier this month, a judge had denied a motion to allow O'Neal to be served electronically.  “We just served personally Shaquille O’Neal outside his house with a copy of our complaint at 4 p.m.,” Moskowitz said in an email to The Block. “We took Judge Moore’s instructions very seriously and are glad to finally end this silly sideshow.”  Dubbed ""Shaqtoshi"" in an FTX commercial, O'Neal is one of several celebrities – including centi-millionaire financier Kevin O'Leary, football star Tom Brady and basketball star Steph Curry – who are facing a class-action lawsuit for promoting a “fraudulent scheme.”  ""Mr. O’Neal will now be required to appear in federal court and explain to his millions of followers his “FTX: I Am All In” false advertising campaign, created by FTX advertising agency “Dentsu McGarrybowen” and FTX Global Partnership Agency “Wasserman,” Moskowitz told CoinDesk.  After FTX collapsed in November O'Neal said: “I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial.”  CoinDesk has been unable to reach O’Neal for comment.

42412266,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yCg,1681690065,First Mover Asia: Ether Price Hits Fresh 11-Month High,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Ether continued its ascent following last week's Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain, reaching an 11-month high.  Insights: Sufficiently decentralized ownership and control would prevent any single party from dictating AI development, CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey writes.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,324 +5.9 ▲ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $30,325 +0.0 ▲ 0.0% Ethereum (ETH) $2,120 +27.8 ▲ 1.3% S&P 500  4,137.64 −8.6 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $2,015 +13.0 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225  28,493.47 +336.5 ▲ 1.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,324 +5.9 ▲ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $30,325 +0.0 ▲ 0.0% Ethereum (ETH) $2,120 +27.8 ▲ 1.3% S&P 500 4,137.64 −8.6 ▼ 0.2% Gold $2,015 +13.0 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225 28,493.47 +336.5 ▲ 1.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  For months traders speculated whether the ether (ETH) price would crash following the Ethereum blockchain's milestone Shanghai upgrade, or if it would rally.  Now we know: Ether's price took off after last week's first-ever enabling of crypto withdrawals from the blockchain's staking mechanism, blowing past $2,000 on fresh enthusiasm that the success of the upgrade could lead to a surge in growth and investor interest.  And it's kept rising, gaining on four of the past five days, and hitting a fresh 11-month high on Sunday around $2,141.  The ETH price is now up 77% year to date, still trailing the bitcoin (BTC) price gain of 83% in 2023 but catching up fast.  ""The market's pessimism regarding Ethereum staking withdrawals proved excessive,"" as Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, put it last week.  Insights  Web2’s Lesson for AI: Decentralize to Protect Humanity  This is going to sound presumptuous coming from a guy who doesn’t write code, let alone have any direct experience in machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) research.  But I gotta say it: The recent alarmist demand for a six-month pause or even a militarily enforced shutdown in AI research – from people with experience, money and influence in the artificial intelligence industry – is founded on some fundamentally flawed thinking that will encourage the same destructive outcome for humanity that we seek to avoid. That the U.S. government is simultaneously orchestrating a crackdown on the crypto industry, a field of open-source innovation that develops the kind of cryptography and network coordination technologies needed to manage AI threats, makes this an especially dangerous moment for all of us.  These doomsayers are computer scientists, not students of economic history. The issue is not, in and of itself, that an out-of-control AI could evolve to kill us all. (We all know that for decades Hollywood has taught us that it is so.) No, the task is to ensure that the economics of AI don’t intrinsically encourage that horrific result. We must prevent concentrated control of the inputs and outputs of AI machines from hindering our capacity to act together in the common interest. We need collective, collaborative software development that creates a computational antidote to these dystopian nightmares.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The answer does not lie in shutting down AI innovation and locking ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the industry leader that has taken the field to its current level of development, into pole position. On the contrary, that’s the best way to ensure the nightmare comes true.
