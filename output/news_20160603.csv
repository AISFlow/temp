42399060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCLb,1464992140,Ping An is a Gateway to China for R3's Blockchain Consortium,"When Chinese financial giant Ping An joined the blockchain consortium led by R3CEV last week, the group added more than just a new member – it effectively integrated with a gateway to the world's second-largest economy.  With a $90b market cap, the company has 27 subsidiaries across a wide range of industries, including life insurance, banking and securities.  But when it came to working with blockchain tech, the company, which has assets of more than $765b according to the company’s own numbers, didn’t want to do it alone.  So, earlier this year, Ping An’s chief innovation officer, Daniel Tu, called up R3CEV's global managing director, Clive Cooke, to express his interest in joining the organization. To date, more than forty financial institutions worldwide have become part of the R3 consortium.  Tu said in a new interview that he’d been updating the company's leadership on bitcoin and its underlying blockchain since 2013, and had received a “mandate” from his boss to test which aspects of distributed ledgers could be applied to Ping An’s subsidiaries.  Tu told CoinDesk:  ""What I thought was important was that all of these business lines at some point or another could be potential applications. Given that R3 is all about collaboration, and you can’t do it by yourself, the idea was to work with other institutions and compare notes.""  Founded by current CEO Ming Ma in 1988, the company employs 1.3m people and is the 20th largest company in the world, according to a recent Forbes ranking.  Coming together  Though Cooke says he had not heard of Ping An at the time, he said it quickly became apparent that the financial institution could play a crucial role in the consortium’s plans to help integrate aspects of the technology into a wide range of services.  Cooke told CoinDesk:  ""Ping An is not just a financial institution that wants to know how to incorporate new technology into its business. Ping An is an ecosystem in its own right. Within China they have a network of their own as R3 has a network of its own.”  In interviews, both Tu and Cooke described an early meeting between the two sides, which came shortly after Cooke joined R3 following seven years as CEO of City Index Ltd.  Tu called on Cooke, who coincidentally was already set to travel to Korea, to express his company's interest in joining. Two weeks later, Cooke said, he was being ""whisked away"" in a Mercedes to meet with Ping An’s founder in person.  Cooke described entering Ping An's ""cathedral-like"" building and meeting with the executive in his personal office. Cooke and Ma were each handed a pair of earbud headphones and translators sitting in the corners of the room helped the two men have a conversation “in real time,” speaking in English and Chinese respectively.  While Cooke says R3 had been approached by other Chinese financial institutions prior to this meeting, those firms were largely interested in consultations about how distributed ledgers function.  But in the case of the Ping An meeting, Cooke suggested that shortly after the meeting began, the two sides had taken to carving out ideas on a nearby whiteboard.  He explained:  ""It’s almost as if [Ma] has a white board follow him around. Sure enough, 25 minutes into our conversation out came the pens and out came his plans for how distributed ledgers are going to change the way things are done.""  The blockchain project  Since the formal launch of the partnership on 24th May, Tu and the co-leader of Ping An’s blockchain initiative, Jessica Tang, have assembled a team of about 15 people from Ping An's technology and finance divisions, as well as several chief technology officers from the conglomerate's subsidiaries.  While Tu didn't go into specifics about the kinds of projects being undertaken by Ping An's internal blockchain team – he indicated that the company has at least two proofs-of-concept under development – he did suggest that staffers are moving aggressively to learn about the technology.  ""We just want to make sure we shorten the learning curve for our people,"" said Tu. ""We’re very mindful of where blockchain can take us but we’re also very practical.""  According to Tu, the People’s Bank of China, the country's central bank, and government regulators are all “following blockchain very closely with ""think tanks"" and “quasi-government blockchain-related firms” monitoring both domestic and international developments.  The remarks are notable given recent developments in the country. Shanghai-based Wanxiang Blockchain Labs has launched a new initiative, dubbed ChinaLedger, to build a blockchain protocol with 11 regional exchanges. This comes as the Chinese central bank weighs several approaches to developing its own form of digital currency.  Tu added:  ""It is a highly regulated industry. We have to be nimble we have to be quick, but we also have to be compliant.""

42399070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCYO,1464986321,Did China Drive Bitcoin's Price to 2016 Highs?,"The price of bitcoin surged nearly 20% during the week ending 3rd June, rising to its highest point in 20 months. But what was the cause of the increase?  Mainstream media sources  have largely attributed this sharp increase to demand from the Chinese market, prompted by yuan devaluation. But not everyone agreed with this explanation, as some market experts asserted that the rally was tied to other developments both within and outside of the digital currency ecosystem.  Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, painted a different picture. Though Xu represents one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by volume, accounting for 41.91% of this week’s trades, he saw the movement as part of a broader series of stresses on the Chinese financial markets.  Xu told CoinDesk:  ""The devaluation of RMB has some influence [on bitcoin’s recent rally]. [But] the domestic stock market has been weak since last September. A convenient alternative investment like bitcoin is easy to be accepted by the traders.""  Still, other market observers were quick to stress that this was the predominant factor.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, voiced support for the idea that concerns about yuan devaluation helped drive bitcoin prices higher, as panicking Chinese market participants bought into bitcoin to avoid losses.  ""The fears of a sharp yuan devaluation are rising. It was set off by the People's Bank of China weakening the yuan to the lowest levels since March 2011,"" Hayes told CoinDesk.  Crying foul  However, the developments in the Chinese markets seem to have once again opened a continued subject of debate in the bitcoin trading community, the perception that Asia-based exchanges are using unfair or illegal tactics to drive market activity.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk that in his view, this correlation with the yuan is being used to sell headlines, and that it may not paint a portrait of what is happening on the ground.  ""The theory that the Chinese are buying bitcoin due to yuan devaluation is a nice story to tell, but is in our view incomplete,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “Bitcoin is a speculative asset and Chinese residents who are looking to preserve the value of their holdings can turn to USD or EUR, which are much more stable currencies.""  Zivkovski said that he believes the bigger story is not negativity to the yuan, but rather improved market sentiment toward bitcoin. Data provided by Whaleclub suggests 94% of volume – as measured by position size – was long.  In other words, Zivkovski said that members of the largest trading community in bitcoin are increasingly optimistic bitcoin’s price will rise. Adding evidence to this claim is that the digital currency’s price broke through the psychologically important $500 level on 29th May, reaching its highest since August 2014.  These gains took place as Whaleclub data suggested long-short ratios surged to record levels of 15:1, which indicates market sentiment is bullish.  Ether attraction  Still, there were other theories, including one that finds traders once again looking analytically at the relationship between bitcoin and ether, an alternative digital currency that has fast gained favor with traders due to the strength of its technology.  Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, for example, said that he doesn’t believe China is more active in the bitcoin markets, and that ""interest in ether"" caused most of bitcoin’s weekly price increase.  Lee emphasized the relationship developing between the two assets, stating that ""bitcoin is now seen as a safe hedge and cash out mechanism for Ethereum investors."" He also described bitcoin as ""the main on-ramp to owning Ethereum and the most liquid trading pair into the new currency.""  Daniel Masters, chief investment officer at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund Plc., was more skeptical of this explanation, noting that those who buy bitcoin to purchase ether still need to offload the asset, which then depresses its value.  As far as the data goes, ether transaction activity fluctuated significantly during the week, as 24-hour volume reached a high of $292.7m, nearly four times as much as the closing value of $76.7m, CoinMarketCap data reveals. In addition, this volume dropped more than 30% week-over-week.  Path ahead  As for the path ahead, there were observers who voiced a belief that bitcoin could enjoy further price increases in the short term amid bullish sentiment.  However, the recent price increases could simply reflect a period of heightened volatility and could therefore fail to hold up.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, emphasized that he expects traders to perhaps begin looking for opportunities to short the market, or that pessimism may creep back into the minds of traders.  ""Going forward, I would expect bitcoin to test $500 on the downside before we get real stability,” he concluded.  Charles L.

42399073,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCZN,1464974683,Bitcoin Price Passes $570 for First Time Since August 2014,"The price of bitcoin is up more than 6% today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin USD Price Index (BPI), reaching a level not seen in nearly two years.  Today’s market movements, which have pushed the price to a press time high of $574.43, follow a period of elevated bitcoin trading activity.  This is the first time the average price of bitcoin has risen to these heights since August 2014. On 11th August of that year, USD markets saw a high of $589.87, according to BPI data. A day later, prices peaked at $573.94.  Bitcoin prices have surged significantly in the past week, in markets that trade against both the USD as well as the Chinese yuan.  CNY-denominated markets are up more than 4% today, reaching a high of ¥3,775.83 at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin CNY Price Index.  May closed with a bitcoin price breakout that exceeded the $500 barrier, a move that followed a then-six-month high seen just two days prior.

42399071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCXP,1464972405,Why This Ethereum Co-Founder Isn’t Launching a DAO,"Anthony Di Iorio was a founding member of the team that built Ethereum, a network similar to bitcoin but with a Turing-complete coding language that has jumpstarted a still-nascent ecosystem of decentralized applications.  In those early days, the founders already had aspirations to someday convert the Ethereum Foundation that helps oversee the codebase into the ultimate decentralized group, better known nowadays as a distributed autonomous organization, or DAO.  But now that DAOs are real – and one has raised more than $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether – Di Iorio says he has no plans to convert his own company, Decentral, into this kind of organization.  Di Iorio told CoinDesk:  ""I think that this structure is very bold and it’s not something I would be doing with my company. I believe actually in leadership. I believe you need to make quick decisions.""  Governance questions  Instead of a single leader, decentralized autonomous organizations are essentially bundles of smart contracts capable of automatically executing whatever digital commands are encoded into their makeup.  Anyone can become a voting member of the DAO by buying tokens in exchange for ether that gives them a say in the decision a DAO makes, ranging from allocating resources to splitting off into a new organization. The largest of these, called simply The DAO, has raised funds and distributed tokens to 23,000 different voting addresses.  Di Iorio believes that a system of widely dispersed voting rights granted based on whoever is willing to spend the most on tokens — 50 addresses own 41% of the tokens, according to public data — isn’t the most efficient way to run a company.  He's not alone. Last month, prediction market startup Gnosis proposed rebuilding The DAO’s governance model to give experts the ability to vote based on their confidence in an outcome inspired by a model called Futarchy.  Shortly thereafter, another governance-focused startup, Backfeed, also submitted its own reimagined DAO voting structure, which it dubbed a “social operating system” designed to help large groups collaborate more effectively.  This concern appears to extend to vote-holders of The DAO itself. At the top of the recently released DAO.report data website, which showcases funding proposals in order of popularity, is an ongoing vote for a moratorium on further proposals until the governance model is “upgraded”.  Hybrid model  But Di Iorio’s objections to the DAO model go beyond the technical components of the governance model.  In addition to legal and regulatory concerns he has about the model, Di Iorio, who earlier this year started a new position as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange, believes companies should work together in-person.  Di Iorio told CoinDesk:  ""I think working in one room is very important. Working all at the same time is very important, we’re extremely efficient and we’ve shown that we can create products.""  Di Iorio says he's moving to put these thoughts into practice. He expects Decentral will begin work on a project to merge the DAO model with a more traditional leadership-based model following a string of product launches expected to culminate on Wednesday.  Still in its early planning phases, the Collaborative Leadership Intensive Organization (CLIO) is expected to be a hybrid organization designed to provide a “gradual” transition to distributed governance models where stakeholders have more control over decisions. At the same time, final decisions will still fall to a single chief executive.  In spite of his skepticism about launching a DAO himself, Di Iorio calls the idea “fantastic” and is moving to integrate aspects of the project through Jaxx, the cryptocurrency wallet software his company produces.  Later today, the wallet is expected to integrate support for the vote tokens tied to The DAO, in addition to bitcoin and ethers. Next week, developers plan to offer greater functionality that lets Jaxx users view DAO proposals and vote on those proposals from within the app itself.

42399062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCPX,1464963676,Digital Currency 'Still on the Agenda' at Russian Central Bank,"The head of a recently created unit at the Central Bank of Russia devoted to exploring financial technologies sees a wide-reaching role for blockchain use in finance, according to a recent interview.  Translated statements from an interview between Russian-language publication Bankir.ru and Vadim Kalukhov, director of the Russian central bank’s Financial Technology, Projects and Process Management Department, paint a portrait of cautious enthusiasm for the technology, a stance consistent with past statements from the institution.  The Central Bank of Russia, which earlier this year made public its plans to study blockchain applications in finance and elsewhere, sees a possible role for the technology in payments, document certification and more.  Of note from the interview was an effective pushback against suggestions that the Russian central bank was weighing the issuance of its own digital currency.  If it did, the central bank wouldn’t be alone in its potential pursuit. The Bank of England, the UK’s central bank, has thus far emerged as a strong voice of support blockchain technology, as well as a potential issuer of a national digital currency. As reported last month by Business Insider, BoE governor Mark Carney is set to deliver a speech later this month that is expected to focus on applications of the technology.  Kalukhov indicated that the Bank of Russia is, at least for now, keeping its head down on the issue, saying that the matter is under active discussion by central bank officials.  He explained in the interview:  ""We have to admit that digital currency issue is still on the agenda. We see that community’s interest has shifted from private digital currencies to national ones,” he said. “So far regulators worldwide, including us, are only saying that the matter is being studied, and don’t give any comments as for either the terms of creating, or ways of operation or coverage.""  This comes as companies within the Russian private sector, most notably payments processor QIWI, pushes ahead with plans to upgrade its payments database structure with a blockchain.  In the interview, Kalukhov offered his take on recent developments within the country as they relate to blockchain tech, indicating that the central bank wants to see domestic startups experiment and collaborate on possible applications and that it ""is so important to create communication sites, technology garages, [and] finance technology hubs” to foster this kind of environment.  Regulators ‘support’ adoption  According to Kalukhov, who joined the central bank as deputy chief information officer in February 2015, there is support for blockchain tech among the world’s regulatory bodies, but that engagement varies from country to country.  ""Regulators support its adoption to a variable extent: some countries just don’t have enough technology companies, desire to do this or interest to the technology,"" he said.  Kalukhov went on to say that the Russian central bank, among others, sees the benefits in the reduction of transaction costs. He further indicated that the Bank of Russia is keeping a close eye on technology developments, calling it a ""key interest as the regulator"".  He said in the interview:  ""As most financial market participants, we share the hope that blockchain will allow to reduce overall transaction costs. If the technology allows to save cash spent on overall transaction costs, then we, as the regulator, are interested in it, since this will ease the overall burden for the population.""  ""We are especially interested and keeping an eye on any prototypes designed to reduce specific overheads for end users,"" he added.  Kalukhov was also firm that there is no existing ban on the technology.  This statement comes amid a push within Russia to institute a ban on so-called money surrogates which would include bitcoin and other digital currencies, and effort that began in 2014.  Kalukhov suggested that the central bank is currently taking a wait-and-see approach to its own rulemaking process, suggesting that, for now, the technology doesn’t pose any immediate risks that warrant attention.  ""The blockchain technology is allowed to be used in the territory of the Russian Federation. So far, deployment of prototype Russian companies launch doesn’t cause any difficulties. If we see that some regulations are needed to enable the technology development, we will think over how to do this,"" he said.  Support for group efforts  During the interview, Kalukhov indicated that the Russian central bank views group efforts by both technology and non-technology companies to test and develop new systems as positive developments, saying that such initiatives work to the advantage of both sides.  He noted that these efforts are already happening in Russia. ""Such partnerships are established, and we are glad they are,"" he said.  In the last year and a half, a range of consortium efforts have emerged globally.  These include the 40-plus banking consortium led by startup R3CEV, the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group spearheaded by a number European financial institutions and securities exchanges, and recent private-public collaborations established in Japan. The Hyperledger Project, overseen by the Linux Foundation, has also brought together a range of technology and financial firms.  Kalukhov said that for technology firms, it’s a practical matter of either pitching in on a group effort or take the risk of offering a competing product of its own. For financial companies, he said, there’s little need for the technology if participants aren’t coming together.  ""As I have already mentioned, no one needs blockchain only for itself, because the matter of creating field of confidence within one company does not arise,"" he said. ""So, if you want to work with blockchain, you have to find somebody, and it’s better [for there to] be more than one party.""  Varied applications  Kalukhov highlighted a number of applications throughout the interview, notably suggesting its use for verifying that individuals have genuine power of attorney when trying to access funds. With the right legal document, someone could claim that they have the ability to executive transaction.  The issue: those documents might not be legitimate. But having a mechanism by which greater confidence in the veracity of legal documentation could give banks more confidence when weighing whether to greenlight those kinds of transactions.  ""Every time someone offers access to your account with a letter of attorney, a bank should make sure that the letter of attorney is genuine,"" he explained. ""It’s not always easy to do: a bank has no right to refuse the transaction, unless there are suspicions that the letter of attorney is not genuine. All this may change, if a single reliable database will be created.""  However, he went on to say that he believes creating shared document databases might not be as practical at a larger scale.  ""Even the best idea, if needed to be spread over more than several thousand users, often turns in a very long story that lasts years and years,"" he said.  Kalukhov would again invoke the idea of building confidence between entities through shared ledgers, saying it could be applied to any kind of financial messaging or payment.  ""Blockchain may offer an advantage to companies, when there are multiple participants, and they are separate legal entities that have to resolve a matter of confidence,"" he said. ""And the parties to the transaction are in two different credit institutions or any other two organizations that are financial market participants, these need not necessarily be banks.""  Another notable application, he said, was the use of of the technology for real estate registers, which he said don’t trigger the same kinds of privacy concerns raised by financial firms.  ""...I see promising perspectives in migrating registers to the blockchain technology, such as cadastral register, real estate register, because they are initially open. And it means, all confidentiality and data security issues are eliminated, as well as the need of redundant encryption,"" he said.  Kalukhov also offered his take on distributed ledger applications for securities trading, saying that there would need to be established legal accords governing activity before any benefits could be reaped.  He said in the interview:  ""To make securities transactions blockchain work, registrars should come to an agreement. They will have to agree upon migration to the distributed register, single storage standards and on how they will exchange data and enter records. This is the only way for them to obtain any added value from the blockchain.""  Barriers remain  From Kalukhov’s perspective, there are a number of barriers hindering adoption within the Russian finance sector.  The first, he said, had to do with the speed of transactions and how different parties to a hypothetical blockchain would operate in an environment where transactions are being sent at high speeds.  ""If network nodes are physically too remote from each other, it can take quite a long time to synchronize the database,"" he said. ""And until databases have been synchronized and agreed, there is a risk of the so-called double spending. The point is, how fast the system can start the second transaction after committing and confirming the first one.""  He highlighted data privacy as another area in which the Russian central bank sees as a pain point.  ""If you store the register, there are two options. You see everything the register includes or register data are encrypted, and you see only your data, and don’t see anybody else’s,"" Kalukhov explained. ""And here the problem arises: if you have the entire register, then encryption stability is measured with the time needed to overcome the protection.""  He went on to say that additional encryption layers would alleviate these concerns, but that questions of cost, access and the speed at which transactions would occur remain.  Perhaps most vitally, Kalukhov said that the combination of these operational factors itself is an issue.  ""The third barrier is existence of such combination of factors, under which system operation will be considerably impaired or will become impossible for some time,"" he said. ""This is the issue many parties are trying to resolve now. It is equally burning for both open and closed systems.""  He went on to offer a critique of private blockchains, saying that they “do not resolve the issue of confidence”.  ""The risks are mitigated, but still exist,"" said Kalukhov. ""Confidence must be enough, so that even in the closed network the data volume distributed between the participants would not put their commercial interests at risk.""  He later returned to the question of privacy, explaining:  ""The key risk is data confidentiality loss. Next, it is the system stability risk, the risk of compromising the system. Confidentiality is the blockchain bottleneck, and this is what cryptographers work at.""  Ultimately, Kalukhov seemed to frame how the technology finds adoption through the lens of which technology uses emerge, both from what exists today and what other solutions are developed within Russia and abroad.  Criticizing services that aren’t forthright about the extent to which they use distributed systems – ""I object against such double-talk"", he said – Kalukhov struck a supportive note for the development taking place today.  He said:  ""It’s very important for prototypes to prove their right to life, and after this, technical implementations of more or less commercial scale might be developed.""
