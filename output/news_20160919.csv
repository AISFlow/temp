42399325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw39,1474327169,Federal Judge Rules Bitcoin is Money in US Trial,"A federal judge in New York has ruled that bitcoin constitutes a form of money.  The ruling comes from the ongoing case involving the now-defunct Florida bitcoin exchange Coin.mx and one of its former operators, Anthony Murgio.  Murgio, who was indicted on alleged money laundering charges in July of last year, had sought to dismiss two of the charges against him in part by arguing that bitcoins don't count as ""funds"" in the context of US law.  According to Reuters, Judge Alison Nathan of the Southern District Court of New York rejected that bid, writing that bitcoin is money by virtue of how it is used.  Nathan wrote in her ruling:  ""Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term. Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.""  The ruling comes on the heels of a court decision in Florida in which a Miami judge ruled that, according to state statutes, bitcoin doesn’t qualify as a form of money. That decision sparked debate amongst observers and has sparked renewed effort in the state legislature to develop regulations around the digital currency.  The Coin.mx case is connected to a broader investigation by the US government into an alleged cybercrime ring tied to a series of hacks on major companies and financial institutions, including Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase. According to prosecutors, Coin.mx was used as a conduit for laundering proceeds from the purported operation.  Attorney Brian Klein, who represents Murgio in the case, told CoinDesk that his client plans to continue fighting the charges.  ""The defense obviously disagrees with the Court’s denial of the motion to dismiss,"" said Klein. ""Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial.""

42399337,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwFw,1474308899,Bank of England Considers Blockchain Compatibility for Settlement Service,"The UK’s central bank said last week that it wants its next-generation settlement system to be blockchain-compatible.  A consultation paper published last week outlined the major characteristics of what the Bank of England’s planned real-time settlement system, known as the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service, should constitute.  According to the Bank of England, the RTGS system essentially forms the foundation of what it does as a central bank. The bank began the process of looking at how the system could be augmented, upgraded or outright replaced earlier this year. Among the elements being considered: compatibility with private sector blockchains “if/when they achieve critical mass”.  The paper’s authors said that the deployment of new kinds of financial technologies mean that any real-time payment system created by the central bank will need to be able to handle some kind of integration.  The Bank of England has been exploring fintech applications are part of a new project accelerator, focusing in part on the prospect of a central bank-issued digital currency.  The Bank of England said it sees a role for the real-time payment system in providing those fintech applications with a reliable and fast-moving source of information.  The paper states:  ""To operate at their most efficient levels, these technologies require rich data feeds, high availability and seamless messaging. The concept of the distributed ledger, though still in its infancy, is a potentially much more radical innovation, creating new ways for firms to exchange value without relying on central infrastructure.""  Promises aside, the paper’s authors go on to note that the technology most likely won’t form the backbone of any new kind of payment system deployed by the Bank of England.  ""The resilience characteristics of the distributed ledger in particular are potentially highly attractive from a financial stability perspective,"" they note. ""It is however unlikely that this technology will prove sufficiently mature to form the core of the next generation of RTGS itself.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/19/bank-of-england-considers-blockchain-compatibility-for-settlement-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43211d99f6dc5761c4d6ccca476d4c6de377045b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwLq,1474305678,Bitcoin Price Still Bruised After Bitfinex Hack,"For better (and more often) worse, the price of bitcoin was all but inseparable from one of its major exchanges in August.  Bitcoin prices fell close to 20% to start the month, a steep decline that coincided with the hack of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the most heavily traded on the network globally.  As it would come to light, the security breach resulted in the loss of roughly 120,000 BTC ($72m). The event would have a wide-ranging impact on the market, depressing bitcoin prices as Bitfinex shut down for more than a week and concerns were raised about basic practices used to secure the digital currency.  Prices were quick to rebound, however, on news of improvements at the exchange.  After reopening, Bitfinex was able to attract significant USD/BTC trading volume, capturing 20% of this market during the week activity resumed. While the exchange's trading activity started out at a modest pace, reaching 31,000 and 33,000 BTC on 1st and 2nd August, this activity was far lower following the hack.  For the remainder of the month, daily volume failed to reach 10,000 BTC during all but one session. As a result, Bitfinex trading volume averaged only 5,666 BTC per day in August, more than 75% lower than the 24,199 BTC daily volume the exchange averaged during the six months prior, Bitcoinity data reveals.  As analysts described Bitfinex as ""the most liquid USD exchange pre-hack"", the event served to make the market even more illiquid, making it vulnerable even to the actions of single trades or traders.  While market sentiment remained bullish in August, it took a hit compared to recent months. Data provided by bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub revealed that during August, 71% of positions were long, compared to 82% in June and 85% in July.  However, it is worth noting that while August's sentiment fell below that of June and July, it was roughly on par with that of April and May, when the market was 71% and 72% long, respectively, additional Whaleclub figures show.  The hack continued to generate substantial visibility for the month, as analysts voiced concerns about whether Bitfinex would be able to survive. Many drew comparisons to Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014.  So far, Bitfinex has been able to avoid a shut down, however, it continues to rebuild its reputation and attempt to reimburse investors.  Those efforts began on 7th August when it decided to generalize the losses associated with the hack across all user accounts, giving investors one Bitfinex token for every $1 lost.  These tokens carried the label BFX and could either be redeemed by Bitfinex or exchanged for equity in iFinex Inc, Bitfinex's parent company. Market participants also had the option of trading these tokens in a secondary market.  It wouldn't be until 1st September that the exchange reimbursed accountholders by purchasing more than 1% of outstanding tokens, a move that many analysts viewed as a positive for the market. Bitfinex bought these digital assets for $1 apiece, which was approximately twice their market value at the time.  Markets react  One month later, analysts provided a mixed reaction to Bitfinex's approach to the hack, with some supplying criticism and others offering praise.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, voiced the concerns of those unhappy with the exchange’s decision to generalize the loss. Overall, he said, it remains a difficult subject.  ""The community is not pleased that the largest USD exchange was hacked and a 36% haircut was imposed,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The two biggest issues are the lack of transparency on how the haircut was calculated, and the fact that Bitfinex still doesn't know the attack vector.""  Huobi co-founder Du Jun described the haircut as ""very arbitrary and unreasonable"", and others agreed.  Whaleclub's Petar Zivkovkski portrayed this decision similarly, explaining it as a means by which Bitfinex could transfer risk to its customers by issuing ""previously valueless tokens"" that could potentially be manipulated by the exchange.  One analyst who offered some praise for Bitfinex's response to the hack was Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund.  In contrast to others, Gao said that he believes the approach helped the exchange avoid a potential lawsuit and continued shut down.  ""We think Bitfinex has made all the right moves to recover from their loss,"" he said.  Gao indicated that some Chinese exchange users were exploring a lawsuit against the exchange in Hong Kong prior to its decision to socialize the loss.  New opportunities  Gao also emphasized that while many have cast the generalized loss in a negative light, Bitfinex's decision to issue tokens has given its customers the opportunity to be stakeholders in the exchange by retaining these digital assets.  Market participants who did not receive these tokens directly from Bitfinex can also become stakeholders by purchasing them on the secondary market, he said.  The comments showcase the belief that by issuing these tokens, Bitfinex might help create greater regulatory certainty by motivating global lawmakers to take a stance on crypto assets with both debt and equity features, a view put forth by Hayes.  The BFX token could also enjoy upside going forward, noted Gao. He emphasized that the token has reached $0.50, and predicted the digital asset could reach between $0.70 and $0.80 ""in the short run"".  In spite of this optimistic assessment (and the perception of many that Bitfinex did a good job of handling the hack), the bitcoin community may find overcoming the stigma of the Bitfinex hack to be a struggle.  The digital currency still faces uncertainty surrounding its block capacity challenges, a matter that has been looming for some time.  The ""stalemate"" between ""core developers and miners has left many with a sour taste,"" said Zivkovkski.  Bitcoin remains resilient  In spite of these difficulties, market participants should keep in mind that bitcoin has survived many challenges before.  Bitcoin has enjoyed rising adoption over time, as a growing number of companies have expressed they will accept the digital currency as payment. While developers have yet to create long-term solutions to the block capacity dilemma, they have made progress on more short-term solutions.  Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, emphasized that the bitcoin's blockchain retained its security and functionality in spite of the Bitfinex hack.  ""A good analogy is that bitcoin and its blockchain are like a computer’s operating system, while Bitfinex is like a web browser. Just because the web browser gets hacked and taken down doesn’t mean the underlying operating system had associated security vulnerabilities,"" he explained.  It is important for the public to understand the difference, Burniske noted, as the security breach could otherwise create a darker cloud that could hamper further adoption of bitcoin.

42399341,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwHu,1474290652,Hyperledger Director Draws Dividing Line With 'Umbrella' Statement,"Brian Behlendorf has made a living out of helping others play well together — and his work with blockchain group Hyperledger builds on this expertise.  But before that can happen with this latest open-source project, the founder of the Apache Software Foundation set out to make sure that the more than 80 existing members of Hyperledger know what they've signed up for.  In a blog post he published last week entitled ""Meet Hyperledger: An 'Umbrella,' for Open Source Blockchain & Smart Contract Technologies,"" Behlendorf laid out in explicit terms Hyperledger's mission and the services it intends to provide.  In conversation, Behlendorf explained that he intended the post to be more than just a recruiting tool for new members, but a line in the sand to clearly delineate where Hyperledger is going.  Behlendorf told CoinDesk:  ""It becomes a Litmus test for those who can see that they like the vision, or those who want to peel away.""  First announced in December 2015, Hyperledger is a consortium-style working group committed to building better blockchain solutions for businesses.  A collection of industry veterans like the DTCC and startups like Digital Asset Holdings, Hyperledger is a pact that finds them laying down their differences to help build an ecosystem with the potential to streamline services and save money for members and customers.  In the post, Behlendorf described how Hyperledger might ""forge common ground"" and accelerate adoption by reducing ""needlessly duplicated"" processes.  But he added:  ""Perhaps most importantly, we can directly address what many have observed as a major challenge with the existing open source blockchain efforts – tremendous levels of tribalism amongst developers.""  Under my umbrella  What Behlendorf set out to do was create a new way for Hyperledger to envision itself. Instead of an interwoven fabric of codebases and companies, he foresees an overarching, but separate group of collaborators.  In preparation for the ""Umbrella"" article, Behledorf said he interviewed developers and other employees of member companies that might otherwise form tribal connections.  What he learned was that even with companies that were heavily committed to the IBM-led fabric project within Hyperledger or the Intel-led Sawtooth Lake, the participants were eager to onboard new partners.  ""Once I started asking questions I found there was much convergence,"" he said.  To help codify that convergence, Hyperledger last month elected a new technical steering committee that will oversee member contributions, and manage the group's trajectory. One of the group's first lines of business was to agree on three defining characteristics of Hyperledger.  According to Behlendorf’s post, the technical steering committee now defines Hyperledger as a group of developers who are responsible for a set of ""artifacts"" (including one or more Git repositories); a bug tracking database and a wiki; and a dedicated space within Hyperledger to describe how each individual project within the organization relates to the community at large.  Staying dry  When Behlendorf was hired in May, he set out to bring clarity to who would contribute to the underlying codebase and make it easier to onboard new members. Since then, the membership has more than doubled, and now he's focused on applying lessons he's learned managing ostensible competitors at the Apache Foundation.  With more than 300 ""top-level"" software projects, the foundation's members balance having a distinct charter, developer community, roadmap and development processes, with using the same collaboration tools, the intellectual property framework and process for reporting to the board of directors.  In August, Hyperledger added 17 new members to its consortium, including Samsung SDS, Quickbooks developer Intuit and heavy machinery manufacturer Sany, bringing the total to 81 members. Plans for Hyperledger's first block explorer were also revealed last month, an effort co-created by the DTCC, IBM and Intel.  Going forward, Behlendorf made clear the path to collaboration between Hyperledger members:  ""They either merge together or they find a way to usefully differentiate. Sometimes that's a hard message to get across when they see it as a horse race.""

42378834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7dD,1474285933,Ethereum's Creator Proves Blockchain Scaling Vision is No Joke,"""Okay, ethereum's done, let's go back to ethereum classic.""  The jokes were frequent during ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's keynote at the project's Shanghai developer conference, Devcon2, on Monday. There, despite the complexity of the technical changes the project will face in the years ahead (and the controversies in recent past), Buterin conveyed a confidence and personality onstage that was unique among the day's presenters, even as he outlined some of the more nuanced proposals.  That scaling was the subject of his talk, entitled ""The Mauve Revolution"", is not a surprise given the increased relevancy of the issue across all blockchain networks. As more banks and enterprise firms seek to use blockchain systems, the scaling question calls to light the inefficiency of the nascent technology.  But the idea that ethereum may be performing below the expectations of this new audience was the frequent butt of Buterin's barbs, with slides featuring titles like ""What sucks about ethereum?"" and an analogy comparing the network to a ""smartphone from 1999"".  To begin, Buterin rifled through a number of issues he sees with the blockchain-based decentralized application platform today, including how few transactions it can process.  Still, he told the audience:  ""We have solutions for most of these problems.""  In the remainder of his presentation, Buterin discussed ways ethereum will be seeking to solve for scalability in the coming months and years. While he did not discuss any specification timeline or plan of execution, the talk felt charged with an overall sense of direction that seemed to resonate.  ""[Buterin] has a very special ability in that he's able to come up with the theoretical solution to a situation that is very much pressing today. He can play devil's advocate to himself,"" Kesem Frank, COO of Toronto-based enterprise blockchain firm Nuco, told CoinDesk.  Lower on the agenda for the talk was discussion of ethereum's proposed effort to implement sharding, a concept that would find it splitting in such a way where multiple blockchains would, almost like miners, form their own consensus on a larger state.  Here, Buterin deferred attendees to the latest version of his ""mauve paper"" outlining his current thesis on the state of the network, the third edition of which was announced prior to the conference.  'Virtual mining'  Key to ethereum’s vision for expanding its network of users is transitioning from the transaction validation algorithm popularized by bitcoin (proof-of-work) to an alternative (proof-of-stake) that does not require the purchasing of hardware.  Buterin explained the transition as one that will seek to replicate bitcoin's mining process virtually without ""wasting electricity"".  Essentially, Buterin sees his fix as one that will find consumers purchasing ethers (the unit of account on the protocol) in exchange for virtual miners, which would then be governed in such a way as to replicate a competitive verification process.  ""Virtual miners are kept track of in the state of the protocol itself,"" Buterin explained.  However, Buterin's version of the idea offers a number of fixes to what he called the “supposed fundamental flaws” of this long-attempted validation mechanism.  First, he outlined that it is possible to make such a system more difficult to game if those who buy virtual miners have to wait to join the validation pool, thus gaining eligibility to the rewards produced by the protocol.  Buterin also envisions restrictions on both withdrawals and the transactions that these addresses can as execute as other ways to ensure that those who are validating are doing so in ways that will not be harmful to the computing network.  ""If you're done mining, you can call this function called start withdrawal. Then after another, something like a few months, you can withdraw and take your ether out,"" he said.  'Nothing at stake'  Perhaps Buterin's most powerful critique, however, was to the ""nothing at stake"" problem whereby proof-of-stake algorithms have historically struggled to align virtual miners.  Key to solving this, he predicts, will be constructing proof-of-stake in a way that incentivizes participants to continue backing the “winning” version of the transaction history. A feature he proposed as a solution is the inclusion of so-called ""dark uncles"" or ""dunkles"" in the protocol.  ""The fact that you made a block on another chain means you get penalized and it hurts you,"" he explained  A tongue-in-cheek play on the term ""uncles"" (which refers to blocks that are mined but not added to a winning blockchain), he foresees dunkles incurring steep penalties, to the point where losses would even be 1,000% larger than rewards.  Buterin sees the proof-of-stake protocol aiming to encourage the production of a network where the winning blockchain would be the one with the most ""value at stake"". In this way, he said, validators could bet on the blockchain they think will be the winner by continuing to back it with value.  ""Bets start off being conservative, but then over time expand. As validators see that everyone is betting 10-1 on a particular block, 20-1, 40-1, the value lost on a particular block will expand exponentially,"" he said.  Despite the heavy emphasis on theory, however, Buterin was keen to state the goals of the effort in simplistic terms.  He concluded:  ""The dream is to achieve onchain scaling [while] running on nothing other than consumer laptops.""

42378836,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7eT,1474276509,Ethereum's 'Holy Trinity' Takes Shape As Swarm Testnet Arrives,"A big piece of ethereum's decentralized ""world computer"" will be launching its first public testnet in the coming weeks.  With the launch of the Swarm testnet, the network will be open for any developer to test the new file storage system and identify and fix potential issues. Developers can also use any ethereum client (whether geth, parity or the python client) for their work.  According to developers involved, the move that takes the project one (small) step closer to making its full vision a reality.  On the Internet today, centralized servers owned by for-profit companies hold most of the world's data. But Swarm wants to shake this up by building on an old idea – file sharing.  You might be familiar with BitTorrent, a similar way of file sharing over a peer-to-peer network. The problem with the network, according to the Swarm team, is that it relies on the generosity of its users, that and it's too slow to use as the base for a new web.  Swarm lead developer Viktor Trón told CoinDesk:  ""[BitTorrent] never really caught on to the point where they can serve real-time interactive web applications.""  The updates were part of a talk at the ethereum developer conference Devcon2 today, entitled ""Swap, Swear and Swindle. Swarm Incentivization"", given by its team leads, Trón and Aron Fischer.  Decentralized versions of photo albums, file managers, corporate storage platforms and GitHub are a few ambitious examples for how Swarm could come to be used.  ""The result would be a much more decentralized Internet, both in terms of service provision and in terms of wealth distribution,"" Trón said. ""It's just as much a social objective as it is a technical project.""  'Holy Trinity'  So, how exactly does this fit into ethereum's ""world computer"" idea?  The big picture vision is to use ethereum's ""holy trinity,"" as Trón called ethereum, Swarm and a messaging system called Whisper, to build the low-level groundwork for this new World Wide Web.  Ethereum already puts the computational part into place, but it provides limited space. Swarm adds a storage layer to the system. Essentially, it remains too costly to store everything on a blockchain. In this way, Swarm allows data to be referenced on a blockchain, but stored elsewhere.  Yet, in the talk, the developers indicated that incentivizing a file sharing network remains a work in progress. As noted in the presentation, Swarm enables content to be retrieved, but there is no guarantee it will be available.  Trón outlined how Swarm is seeking to create a system based on what he called ""proof of custody"", one whereby users would commit a payment to store data, which could be paid incrementally to the person storing it.  ""The proof of custody construct makes it so actually you could have a very good level of security that your content is being stored by the storer,"" he said.  Swarm then uses a ""judge contract"", a smart contract that would ensure that the data won't be paid if what they have agreed to watch goes missing.  Swear and swindle  However, Swarm also needs a system to ensure that the users storing its data are penalized if they break a promise.  This is where a ""Swear contract"" comes in, as the smart contract allows nodes to register by posting a security deposit. Registered nodes, the developers explain, can sell promissory notes guaranteeing long-term data availability, which would be exchanged for receipts.  If the data that is overseen by the contract is lost, a feature called a ""Swindle"" contract comes in. Should a user with a receipt find that their data is no longer available, they are allowed to start a process Fischer likened to litigation.  Here, Tron used the analogy of a babysitter to set the scene for the stakes involved in the high-tech dispute.  ""Once it gets to this stage, the only way a peer can defend themselves against a challenge is to say, 'Your baby is here, it's OK',"" Tron explained.  Toward a Web 3.0  But if it all goes according to plan, users will have a similarly easy experience using Swarm.  Of note is that Web 3.0 isn’t a term that ethereum owns, rather it’s a concept that its developers are rallying around. Trón argues that the blockchain was the ""missing puzzle piece"" to making this reality and that there are ""no more excuses"" for big intermediaries (think Facebook or Google) to be the only companies able to provide Internet services.  The second Swarm code proof-of-concept was released in May, and if all goes well, they say they will migrate the testnet to the official ethereum testnet, Morden.  Trón said they already have plans for a third and fourth code proof-of-concepts, which will include more comprehensive internode communications, data streaming and decentralized database services.  When asked whether he thinks the file program will work in the end, Trón responded that he doesn’t know, but that ""we came up with something that we think is pretty good.""
