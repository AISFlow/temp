42427387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Jh,1487375079,"Altcoin Uptick Ends as Bitcoin Prices Pass $1,050","While so-called altcoins enjoyed a notable rally early this week, this run appears to be over.  The market for alternative cryptocurrencies, a collection of digital tokens with different blockchain networks and value propositions than the bitcoin protocol, received significant tailwinds earlier this week as bitcoin traders sat on the sidelines waiting to hear the latest news from China.  As bitcoin trading volumes fell at many exchanges, many of the top cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap (ranked by market capitalization) enjoyed notable price gains, forming what could be referred to as a smaller altcoin rally.  Today, however, we saw a sharp reversal of this trend.  The ether markets provided a perfect example.  Ether, the digital currency that powers the smart contract-based blockchain platform ethereum, surged nearly 20% to $13.33 on CoinMarketCap on 14th February, reaching their highest value so far this year.  Analysts pointed to robust trading volume, a highly leveraged market and signs of rising adoption as helping fuel this price rise.  However, the digital currency has fallen back, dropping to $12.64 today. At the time of report, ether was trading at $12.71.  Privacy coins taper off  Monero, a privacy-oriented digital currency that leverages ring signatures to conceal user identities, also provided strong evidence that the rally enjoyed by altcoins earlier this week is now over.  The privacy oriented digital currency rose roughly 12% from $12.20 on 14th February to $13.74 on 15th February, its highest price in more than a month, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  However, monero lost much of its recent gains when it dropped to $13.26 later in the 15th February session, and failed to mount any notable recoveries since that time.  Instead, the digital currency has moved largely within a reasonably tight range between $13.30 and $13.60.  Elsewhere, dash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, rose 8.6% to $19.66 on 15th February, but fell back to $18.75 later that session, CoinMarketCap figures show.  Bitcoin back in focus?  As for what caused the altcoin rally to end, one simple explanation is that cryptocurrency traders have once again become interested in bitcoin.  Far and away the market's largest asset, bitcoin has seen its price climb more than 5% since falling to $1,001 early in the 15th February session, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows.  At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,056.92, 2.2% higher for the data, BPI figures reveal.  This recent uptick in price has coincided with a notable increase in volume, as market participants traded 16,000 bitcoins worth of transactions through Bitfinex in the 24 hours through 21:30 UTC.  This compares to an average of 9,700 bitcoins per session over the last seven days, Bitcoinity data shows.  Tim Enneking, chairman of the digital asset hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, explained in this way:  ""Since bitcoin jumped up again, the alts have cooled off.""

42427381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB57h,1487354406,NH Lawmakers Advance Proposed Bitcoin MSB Exemption,"Legislators in New Hampshire have advanced a bill aimed at carving out regulatory exceptions for certain bitcoin businesses, public records show.  As reported by CoinDesk last month, New Hampshire's HB 436 seeks to create a regulatory exception for persons ""using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" who may otherwise be considered money transmitters under current laws.  Sponsored by state rep Barbara Biggie – with Representative Keith Ammon as a co-sponsor – the bill was passed along to the NH House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee. On 16th February, according to LegiScan, an 11-9 majority of the committee approved the bill to advance to the House floor for a vote, the date of which is not immediately apparent.  The bill also seeks to update the state's definitions for virtual currency with a revised version that would read:  ""'Virtual currency' means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the US government.""  Despite the movement, however, there's no guarantee that the bill will pass.  Legislators in the state have expressed a degree of aversion to the tech in the past, killing a bill proposed last year that, if passed, would have allowed state citizens to pay their taxes in bitcoin.

42427380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB51h,1487350426,Bank of Canada: Digital Currencies Need Regulation to Succeed,"Researchers from Canada's central bank argue that private digital currencies like bitcoin won't succeed in the long-term without some kind of government involvement.  A paper published this week by researchers at the Bank of Canada examines the viability of digital currency, looking to past examples of Canadian currency – public ""Dominion"" notes and private bank notes from the 19th-to-20th centuries – as a guide.  The report's release follows work within the Canadian central bank on a prototype system for issuing a central bank-backed digital currency. Dubbed Project Jasper, the initiative saw the Bank of Canada explore building a payments system using the tech, but signs indicate that further work is needed before it might one day reach commercial scale.  While unrelated directly to the Project Jasper work, the research paper offers a window into the thinking among the central bank's researchers on the topic of digital currencies. Among the bank's assertions: bitcoin and other private digital currencies may flourish, yet they will need government support to keep consumers safe.  The report's authors stated:  ""We conclude that well designed and managed private digital currencies could circulate widely but only with appropriate government regulation to ensure their safety, soundness, and uniformity.""  Bank of Canada has previously voiced their concerns about digital currency, saying in November 2015 that the popularity of digital currency could lessen the effectiveness of monetary policy.  The Bank of Canada concludes that lessons learned from monetary history should be applied when determining the effect that competing public and private currencies will have. Notably, the paper also suggests that central bank-backed digital currencies aren't guaranteed to crowd out private options like bitcoin.  ""A central bank can always get its digital currency into circulation, but its digital currency will not necessarily drive out existing private digital currencies,"" the authors wrote.

42427379,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB53h,1487341806,3 Big Blockchain Ideas MIT is Working on Right Now,"When one of the world's most prestigious universities announces it will explore a controversial and often misunderstood subject best known for piquing the interests of thieves and speculators, people tend to take notice.  That's what happened in July 2015, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed it would embark on its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) – led by a former White House advisor, no less.  Work on the multifaceted world of blockchain tech now sits easily alongside transparent robots that eat real-world fish, solar nebula research, and other imaginative, futuristic projects in progress at the university.  Part of MIT's Media Lab, DCI now has a team of 22 people and at least seven ongoing research projects, and it nurtures three startups that use cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology in a variety of ways.  To date, the initiative has funded the work of bitcoin protocol developers, and has supported a range of research, going beyond bitcoin to develop enterprise data projects.  DCI research director Neha Narula, who helps drive the initiative, told CoinDesk:  ""We're doing a lot of things — too many things, arguably.""  In this feature, CoinDesk looks at several notable DCI projects, spanning from how bitcoin's underlying technology can (or can't) shape the internet, to whether it can be augmented to offer more confidential yet auditable transactions.  1. Shattering online 'echo chambers'  Among the grand ambitions of blockchain developers, there's perhaps no use case bigger than the idea the tech could one day reinvent the World Wide Web on which its payments now ride.  It's no surprise then, that here, MIT is exploring how the technology might be applied to problems in online publishing, in particular, Narula said, where there has been a consolidation in who distributes content.  She noted that one estimate says that 85% of traffic to news websites comes from either Google or Facebook.  ""In this election, we saw what happens when people get most of their news from just a couple of sources, and those sources have a strange algorithm showing people certain things. We're kind of living in echo chambers,” Narula said.  She and other MIT researchers have been looking into the potential impact of peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol IPFS and Blockstack – an attempt to create an internet built on the bitcoin blockchain. Both have a goal of putting control of information in the hands of users via the use of a blockchain.  Narula noted that DCI will release a paper detailing their findings on the subject ""soon"".  While these blockchain-related projects could potentially ease some of these problems, she expects that they won't be a panacea.  ""The underlying problems are around the economics of the web and the way people get paid for content. It’s advertising. It’s clicks. It’s views. In order to do that well, it seems as though these mega-platforms are incentivized to get bigger and bigger, and collect more and more users’ data and not let it out,"" she said, adding:  ""Until we have new ways of monetizing our content, we’re going to be in trouble.""  2. Improving blockchain privacy  Yet another big topic that's been the subject of R&D at MIT is privacy and confidentiality – long one of the weaker areas of the bitcoin protocol despite claims to the contrary.  This is because public blockchains reveal information that anyone can trace – this is great from an auditability standpoint. Anyone can verify that a transaction actually occurred, for example. On the other hand, it stokes 'Big Brother' worries that the same tech used by bitcoin to evade governments could become a tool for surveillance.  One DCI project, called 'Auditable Ledger', explores how to construct a ledger that bridges the best of both worlds in a banking context.  Narula compared it to a system like confidential assets or confidential transactions, where user privacy is preserved, but auditors can still see enough information to verify details about the system as a whole – for example, that no one is adding to the money supply, which is supposed to be fixed.  She added that the team is ""expanding the concept"" to cover banks using a ledger to issue their trades.  ""We can ask questions about the system as a whole. If the housing market tanked 20%, we can figure out which banks would be underwater, which banks would be OK, that kind of thing,” Narula said.  3. Building central bank currencies  Another ""big"" project, in Narula’s words, is for a central bank-backed cryptocurrency, though it was here that she expanded the least.  DCI research scientist Robleh Ali, who formerly worked for the Bank of England, is now reportedly building a prototype for the project to see whether cryptocurrency could play a role in this arena.  Narula noted that she hopes that this will be a way to explore further how privacy and auditability might slot together.

42399639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsqM,1487339409,Sberbank CEO: Commercial Blockchains Just Two Years Away,"The CEO of Russia's largest bank is increasingly bullish about enterprise blockchain.  In new statements today, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref said that the use of distributed ledger technology by banks and other incumbents could be just two to two-and-a-half years away.  According to a report by Russia-based business news platform Prime, Sberbank is developing its own applications of the technology within a special working group headed by members of the domestic government.  Gref went on to describe this as a huge step forward for the technology, adding:  ""Maybe they are a bit optimistic, but two to two-and-a-half years is the horizon within which we can speak about the application of blockchain commercial operation.""  The statements follow notable action from Sberbank, which joined a Russia-based fintech consortium in August guided by the direction of the nation's central bank.  However, Gref's personal sentiment about the technology is nothing new.  As far back as December 2013, Gref has spoken out about bitcoin and public blockchains, going so far as to suggest that the technology not only had potential, but that it shouldn't be prohibited by regulators.

42399630,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblshV,1487332872,Bitcoin Investor Roger Ver to Push for OKCoin Liquidation in Court,"Roger Ver’s fight against Chinese bitcoin exchange OKCoin is intensifying as the noted bitcoin investor attempts to have the business liquidated in a Hong Kong court.  The move comes after months of legal wranglings that have already seen the exchange lose one court case. OKCoin's alleged lack of response to the judgement has now prompted Ver to take further action that could ultimately see the company closed.  Ver first sued OKCoin in September, seeking $570,000 plus unspecified damages in a breach-of-contract suit tied to a dispute over the Bitcoin.com domain.  That conflict deepened amid accusations of forgery, as well as impropriety on the part of OKCoin – allegations that exchange representatives swiftly denied.  In the end, Ver went to court, suing OKCoin's Hong Kong entity. At the same time, Ver and attorney Daniel Kelman prepared a suit against the exchange, as well as its chief executive, Star Xu, over the alleged forgery of Ver’s signature. That suit is pending trial.  According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, OKCoin never responded in court to the breach-of-contract suit. On 17th November, the court handed down a final and interlocutory judgment awarding the $570,000 to Ver.  Yet, according to Ver and Kelman, OKCoin has yet to respond to both the court's decision, as well as further entreaties.  As such, the two say they intend to go ahead with a request for the Hong Kong court to liquidate OKCoin's local entity in a bid to obtain the funds. According to Kelman, a liquidation petition is currently being drawn up.  He went on to explain:  ""OKCoin just stopped responding. It became a one-sided discussion, which basically means sue us. Sue us and stop talking, so they didn’t really give us much of a choice.”  Documents provided to CoinDesk indicate that, after the November judgment, OKCoin’s legal representation in Hong Kong responded by letter on 23rd December, asking that they set aside the original court decision. According to Kelman, they sent a response in turn, requesting an offer – which they never received.  A statutory demand letter was later served to OKCoin’s Hong Kong office on 24th January, reiterating the $570,000 judgment handed down by the court along with $13,867 in accrued interest.  According to Ver, the exchange never responded to that letter, which was also sent to its legal representatives in Hong Kong.  The delivery of that letter triggered a 21-day notice period, which ended this week on 13th February.  When reached for comment, OKCoin said in a statement:  ""This case is still under legal proceedings. There is no result in the matter to discuss.""  Next steps  The development marks the latest chapter in a dispute that, after exploding across social media last year, has largely faded from public view.  Disclosed emails at the time portrayed an increasingly contentious back-and-forth between Ver and OKCoin representatives – a situation that worsened following the allegation of contract signature forgery, which Ver has since stressed is fact.  Former OKCoin exec Changpeng Zhao later backed up Ver, going on to allege that the exchange inflated its trade volumes with bots and had manipulated the outcome of an audit conducted in August 2014.  At the time, Xu provided several refutations of Zhao's claims.  Amidst that environment, Ver pledged that he would take his case to court, formally filing suit in September. Things went quiet, while Ver turned Bitcoin.com into a bitcoin-focused content platform and mining pool and OKCoin continued with its exchange business.  However, the latest developments could lever the situation into the public eye once again, depending on the court’s decision.  If the request is successful, the court in Hong Kong will push the exchange into liquidation – and from there, the situation could become potentially messy.  “[Then] their company in Hong Kong, that all their customers have an agreement [with], that all the customers trust with their money – regardless of who holds that money – the court is going to put them into liquidation and order all that money back and make everyone a creditor unless OKCoin actually shows up in court to settle this thing,” Kelman told CoinDesk.  As for what will happen after that, the path is less certain.  OKCoin owns business entities in China and Singapore, which could be impacted by the outcome in Hong Kong should the judge approve the liquidation. OKCoin may request that the suit be moved to China, where it keeps its headquarters.  The timing of these latest developments arguably couldn't be worse for the firm. OKCoin has recently come under pressure – along with the rest of China’s cryptocurrency exchange sector – from regulators in the country, including the People’s Bank of China.  Since then, OKCoin has ceased margin trading, added exchange fees and halted withdrawals pending upgrades to its internal systems.

42399631,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsiU,1487329215,The Big Mistakes Enterprises Are Making on Blockchain,"Arno Laeven is a strategy and innovation consultant at Laeven Consult, and the former blockchain lead for global healthcare giant Philips.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Laeven takes aim at the way incumbents and large corporates have so far sought to implement blockchain, arguing that they need to think bigger to maximize the benefits of the technology.  Let's just get it out there: using blockchain in an enterprise environment is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.  It's no surprise then, that enterprise blockchain experiments have often resulted in strange and disappointing results. All of this is part of the growing pains of a new technology, one in which the first projects are run by enthusiasts and aren't part of the discussion at a boardroom or even industry level.  And the latter is important as blockchain technology is a foundational technology that can solve some complex issues. Like my good friend Bart Suichies once said: ""Blockchain is not the thing, it is the thing that enables the thing"".  What does this mean? Well, for most enterprise applications, blockchain is only a small part of a full stack. That's where many projects go wrong.  They start with the question: ""What business problem does blockchain technology solve?"" In most cases, the answer will be ""none"", for the simple reason that current problems exist specifically because of the current design and architecture of legacy systems.  Trying to solve that with a blockchain solution will lead nowhere or at best to suboptimal results.  To determine the potential value of blockchain technology, you need to rethink what a decentralized approach means in your business, in your industry, how it affects a value chain and what it enables that was formerly not possible.  Top-down rethink  Let's apply this to a specific example.  Most people rightfully say that blockchain could enable portability of data across the healthcare system and pave the way for a new approach to electronic health records (EHR).  It's a nice idea, but blockchain is never going to become the new underlying technology of EHRs within the current setup of healthcare IT. This is because the system was built around the healthcare organization and its processes, and was never designed for connecting with other healthcare entities – let alone data from your Fitbit or Philips watch.  The only way a blockchain integration will truly will happen is when we redesign healthcare IT with the patient at the heart of solutions, as that is the central point of the required data. This is what blockchain can enable as a very small but important part of a much larger architecture.  The challenge here is that the discussion needs to be led at a strategic and industry level, rather than in an architecture meeting. It requires a fundamental change in the design of, not only an IT solution, but a complete different view on processes, patients and organizations.  This different view means shifting from a process-centric view to a patient-centric view. It also needs a rethink about the role and value of a particular healthcare provider in the overall healthcare system, alongside a remake of incentive systems.  Complex challenge  As such, the most difficult question in an established healthcare system will be where to start. I do believe that some initiatives taken by, for example, Gem in cooperation with Capital One to redefine claims management can lead not only to immediate results, but also the start of a systemic shift.  Then there is a shining example of a healthcare system that has tackled the issues of data portability in Estoniahttps://e-estonia.com/component/electronic-health-record/.  But you have to understand that Estonia was able to start with a blank slate – a 'luxury' that well established markets in Western Europe and the US don't have. This blank sheet requires the absence of a legacy system and the willingness of a government to enforce a new approach, forming the most fertile ground to build blockchain solutions.  I predict that fundamental innovations using blockchain technology will come first from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.  In the rest of the world, we can wait for that to happen and be taken by surprise, or we can start having a grown-up discussion about blockchain and strategy at the right level in the organization and with others in our industry and politics.  Seems difficult? It is. But even though these days some think otherwise, complex challenges cannot be solved by simple solutions.

42399632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblskS,1487325606,Financial Giant Fidelity Seeks Patent for Blockchain Voting System,"Fidelity Investments, the world's fourth largest mutual fund and financial services group, is looking to patent a method by which a blockchain could be used for authenticating voters and processing fair elections.  On 16th February, the US Patent and Trademark Office released an application for ""Crypto Voting and Social Aggregating, Fractionally Efficient Transfer Guidance, Conditional Triggered Transaction, Datastructures, Apparatuses, Methods and Systems"" (SOCOACT), originally submitted by Fidelity on 14th July, 2016.  The filing is attributed to Fidelity employees Timothy Lohe, Hadley Rupert Stern, Raghav Chawla and Christopher Scott Parsons, located in Massachusetts, and Thomas Charles McGuire, based in Ireland.  The application outlines the structure of Fidelity’s 'crypto-voting apparatus', the components of which include voter authentication, vote processing, a crypto user interface (UI), a blockchain oracle and a smart contract to direct all computational actions.  The application explains:  “The SOCOACT system could also be used for voting in places where there may not be well developed voting tabulation systems and where voting tallies are suspect. For example, it can be used to build a voting system in a developing country. By using a blockchain technology, an immutable ledger is created that records the votes of each citizen. The record would allow for unique identification of each voting individual and allow for tabulation of votes.”  In developed economies, SOCOACT could be used by corporations to hold proxy votes for events such as Board of Director elections and shareholder proposals.  Investment in the blockchain voting space has been growing. In November 2016, Overstock.com announced the acquisition of blockchain voting startup SettleMint. Governments are interested too. Earlier in the year, government officials in Moscow released plans to investigate how blockchain tech could mitigate voter fraud in the country.  Tracking use cases  Use cases for the SOCOACT system extend beyond voting. The patent application outlines a geotracking feature that could potentially be used to locate missing persons.  It states:  “Imagine there is a migration of peoples out of one country, say, in response to war or natural disaster. A non-governmental organization (NGO) could use SOCOACT to create a blockchain ledger of all displaced persons and that ledger could be used to track them through resettlement. The ledger could be referenced by individuals who could compare their credentials with those that are encrypted and stored through the ledger at a specific time and date in a bitcoin-like format.”  In addition, SOCOACT could be implemented to better track resource consumption and create a bitcoin-backed market where resources and liabilities can be traded among different parties.  “Water meters, electric & gas meters, as well as environmental monitoring devices such as C02 emitter meters can be used to inform enable a bitcoin-style transaction involving resource usage or pollution emission,"" the application says.  Then, by using devices to track these resources or pollutants, a ""bitcoin-enabled marketplace between individuals, corporations and government entities can be created,” it goes on.  Fidelity has displayed a generally progressive attitude toward bitcoin and blockchain tech. Earlier this month, the firm announced that its charitable arm has raised $7m in bitcoin donations for charity.  The company also hosted a European hackathon last October in which it awarded prizes to participants for their blockchain-based applications.

42399644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAblsuI,1487303111,ASX CEO Expresses New Confidence in Blockchain Post-Trade Tests,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) revealed today that it expects to increase the amount it will invest in distributed ledger technology as part of its broader plans to become the first exchange in the world to upgrade to post-trade services built using the technology.  After having already invested AUS$20.3m to develop the technology and more, the exchange's CEO, Dominic Stevens, now says that number will rise to AUS$50m ($38.5m) by the end of this year.  The money is intended to build on DLT being developed by blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, of which it is a financial backer, along with other infrastructure investments.  Speaking today during a presentation of the exchange's financial performance, the leader of ASX's DLT project, Peter Hiom, further said that a series of tests has given the company new confidence its investments will lead to a faster and more scalable solution than its existing Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) platform.  Hiom said:  ""We have also made good progress with our technology partner, Digital Asset Holdings, to build base-level functionality to facilitate cash market settlement.""  During the talk, ASX reported a total group revenue increase of 2.8% to AUS $386.6 million, with a profit after tax of $219.4m.  Demonstration details  As part of ASX’s plans to further cut costs, it participated in a $60m investment round in distributed ledger startup Digital Asset Holdings, and later increased its stake as part of an effort to replace CHESS last year.  The exchange joined with Digital Asset to build a ""demonstration suite"" that it uses ""to bring to life the possibilities"" of DLT, Hiom explained.  As detailed today, ASX has used the suite to better understand and prioritize the business requirements of its customers.  In total, the DLT demonstration suite gathered data from 350 people based on 50 presentations and 40 workshops, according to documents presented to CoinDesk.  A summary of those results — which are likely to be mixed — are scheduled to be released by the end of this quarter, with addition research related to Swift standard ISO 20022 coming throughout the year.  Stevens expects it will take ASX between three months and six months to parse through the data to determine what might be feasibly implemented in an early live version, if anything.  Hiom and Stevens both agreed a final decision on whether to upgrade CHESS using DLT would be ready by the end of this year.  ""There is a whole range of diverse people to try to bring together to try to come to what is the weighted average best decision to move forward,"" Hiom said.  Blockchain competition  After years of having a government-granted monopoly on clearing, ASX last year learned it may not stay that way for much longer.  Following the news, that the Australian government might open up the market to competition, the Sydney Stock Exchange began its own blockchain experiments.  However, in response to a question from the audience about potential competition, Stevens deflected saying he had no ""imminent"" concerns.  Coupled with the time-consuming effort of building a product that suits so many stakeholders, Stevens minced no words about the amount of work ahead as the exchange seeks to become a trailblazer on new technology.
