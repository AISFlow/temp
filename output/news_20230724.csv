15258476,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544128,1690239658,"Aave May Rally 20% Supported by Historical Levels, But Crucial Resistance Remains","Aave’s price surged to $88 just two weeks ago, but currently, the altcoin is experiencing a correction. Over the past 24 hours, Aave has dropped over 4%, and on the weekly chart, it has depreciated more than 7%. The technical outlook for Aave appears bearish, with both demand and accumulation declining on the one-day chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Presently, Aave is hovering near a critical support level, and upcoming trading sessions will be decisive in determining the coin’s direction. Although the price is currently above the crucial support zone, it faces two important resistance levels that it must overcome. Failure to surpass the immediate resistance could lead to a resurgence of bearish sentiment, potentially pushing the price below the local support level. Additionally, Aave’s market capitalization has declined, indicating a gradual loss of buyer momentum on the daily chart. Aave Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of press time, the altcoin’s value stands at $70, following a correction from its previous $88 peak. The coin encounters resistance levels at $72 and $75. It is important to note that if the price drops from its current level, sellers could become active. This is due to the presence of a bearish order block, signifying high sell volume. Failing to maintain a price above $68 may result in Aave trading near $66 and $64. However, historically, the $68 price mark has proven to be a crucial rallying point, as evidenced by the previous rally to $88, which was initiated from the same level. However, if the coin can maintain its price above the $68 level in the upcoming trading sessions, it may have the potential for a 27% rally opportunity. Technical Outlook Following the rejection at the $75 level, Aave’s buyers have been encountering difficulties in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also signalled this weakening buying strength as it dipped below the half-line. Additionally, the price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating a shift away from buyer-driven momentum. To revive buyer interest, Aave would need to break above the $72 mark, potentially drawing them back into the market. The altcoin showed sell signals in line with declining demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was negative, displaying red histograms, which are associated with sell signals on the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Could Restart Rally To $300 If It Breaks This Resistance Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator of capital inflows and outflows, was below the half-line, indicating that at the time of writing, capital outflows exceeded inflows. These technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment in the market and potentially lower demand for the altcoin.

42392967,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHUb,1690237171,Chainalysis Testimony Raises the Question: Do We Know How Well Any Such Software Works?,"Editor-in-chief’s note: An earlier form of this pseudonymously written opinion piece was retracted due to its containing a perceived personal attack on a Chainalysis employee. We did this because it violated our policy, which is based on the principle that people have the right to know the identity of their critics, of not publishing personalized attacks under pseudonymous bylines. It was not our intent to besmirch the reputation of the writer, who has for some time used the same pseudonym and built a reputation around it. To resolve this, in collaboration with the writer, we are republishing a further edited version of the piece, removing language that unreasonably targeted the individual in question and making clear that its sole intent is to question the accuracy of blockchain demystification software, and not attack any particular individual.  Elizabeth Bisbee, head of investigations at Chainalysis Government Solutions, testified she was “unaware” of scientific evidence for the accuracy of Chainalysis’ Reactor software on June 23, 2023, an unreleased transcript of the hearing shared with CoinDesk shows.  The fact that Chainalysis’ blockchain demystification tools have become so widespread is a serious threat to the crypto ecosystem. Although industry insiders have raged against Chainalysis since it was founded, often accusing it of violating people’s financial privacy, there may be a better argument to make against the company and analysis firms like it: it’s within the realm of possibility that these “probabilistic” machines don’t work as well as advertised. This could lead to unjustified account restrictions when blockchain surveillance tools are used for compliance, and in the worst case land unsuspecting individuals on the radar of law enforcement agencies without probable cause.  That’s precisely the argument that renowned lawyer Tor Ekeland is making in his latest defense of an accused early bitcoin adopter, and why he was quizzing a Chainalysis executive on the stand.  Bisbee was testifying in a case between the U.S. government and Roman Sterlingov, the alleged creator of the once popular Bitcoin Fog cryptocurrency mixer used to anonymize bitcoin transactions. Chainalysis’ Reactor software was used to track cryptocurrency payments in Sterlingov’s criminal investigation, and is now being challenged by Sterlingov’s defense.  Sterlingov is represented by Ekeland, who has made a career out of defending hackers and technology providers. Ekeland said Chainalysis’ Reactor is “a black box algorithm” that “relies on junk science.”  In a hearing aimed to establish the admissibility of expert testimony, Bisbee was pressed for details on the accuracy of the Reactor software Chainalysis sells to governments for law enforcement purposes, including what evidence the company has that suggests it works.  Bisbee said she was unable to provide the court with statistical error rates for Chainalysis’ Reactor software. She said she unaware of any scientific peer-reviewed papers or “anything published anywhere” attesting to the accuracy of Chainalysis Reactor.  Instead, Chainalysis reportedly judges its software’s accuracy using customer feedback, she said.  See also: Crypto Criminals Stealing Much Less Money in 2023  None of this is to cast aspersions on Bisbee's personal understanding of the software. For example, Bisbee’s statements are in line with a blog post published by Chainalysis competitor Coinbase, which describes blockchain analytics as “more of an art than a science.” Coinbase offers blockchain analytics services to law enforcement via its Tracer software.  A statement issued by Chainalysis on July 18th confirms that Bisbee is not only unaware of margins of error rates for Chainalysis’ Reactor software, but that Chainalysis has failed to gather and record false positive and negative rates for its software overall.  Unfortunately for Chainalysis, we still live in a democracy in which criminal convictions prerequisite the existence of scientific evidence.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,L0la L33tz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/24/chainalysis-testimony-raises-the-question-do-we-know-how-well-any-such-software-works,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd46f4e3692b49f15c5ebbab052645d0d37fcd46-1558x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Supply In Profit Has Declined To 70.4% After Today’s Price Plunge According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 1.11 million BTC has gone underwater with the latest asset value drop. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which tells us about the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply currently carrying some profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Could Restart Rally To $300 If It Breaks This Resistance This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was previously moved at on the network. If this last transfer price for any coin were less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin would be holding an unrealized gain currently. The percent supply in profit adds up all such coins and calculates what part of the total supply they make up for. A counterpart indicator called the “percent supply in loss” keeps track of the opposite type of tokens, and its value can be simply found by subtracting the supply in profit from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin percent supply in profit over the past day or so: The value of the indicator seems to have taken a hit in recent hours | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit had been floating around 76.3% when the cryptocurrency price was above $30,200 yesterday. With the plunge to $29,200 over the past day, though, the metric has also taken a sharp hit, as only 70.4% of the total circulating supply is holding some unrealized profit now. Historically, whenever the profit in supply has crossed the 75% mark, declines in the price have become more probable. This is because investors become more likely to sell the more profits they hold. The latest tumble in the asset may have come because of this, as the investors who had been sitting on profits may have buckled and sold their coins to harvest their gains. As the metric has cooled down well below the 75% mark now, it’s possible that this may be it for the correction. Before the plunge to $29,200, Bitcoin had been consolidating above $30,000 since many weeks ago. As buying and selling took place in this sideways trend, many investors slowly gained their cost basis at or above this level.

42392979,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEIP1,1690233872,"The Single Most Important Truth About Bitcoin Mining, Energy and the Environment","Last week, Greenpeace USA splashed laser-eyed animations of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Manhattan skyscrapers, along with shocking statistics about bitcoin mining’s energy use and emissions.  Bitcoin, according to its bombastic ad copy, uses more energy than many countries, emits more carbon than millions of automobiles and its pollution “WILL ONLY GET WORSE WORSE WORSE WORSE!” Four building-width WORSES were stacked vertically, just in case you weren’t persuaded by the first three.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Troy Cross is a professor of philosophy and humanities at Reed College, a co-founder of The Nakamoto Project and a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. You can follow him on Twitter at @thetrocro.  As an environmentalist who has been studying bitcoin mining’s energy footprint since 2011, I have a radically divergent perspective. I think bitcoin holds tremendous promise as a tool for decarbonizing the grid, cleaning up waste methane and accelerating the electrification of heating. I see bitcoin mining’s emissions not as increasing, but steadily trending lower in the future. And I predict it will actually make energy cheaper, not more expensive.  How have Greenpeace USA and I come to such polar opposite views?  Bitcoin’s critics have yet to appreciate the most important fact about Bitcoin’s impact on energy systems: bitcoin mining trends towards using only the cheapest electricity in the world, whenever and wherever that is. At present, most miners already pay well below $0.08 per kilowatt hour (kWh) for their electricity, with some reporting rates as low as $0.02/kWh.  But those numbers will continue to drop in the coming months and years, until it is only profitable to mine bitcoin on free or nearly-free power.  In what follows, I will first support this claim, and then show that the effects of bitcoin buying up nearly-free energy are a net positive for energy systems and the environment.  Why bitcoin miners will only use the world’s cheapest electricity  Here are some undisputed yet underappreciated facts about bitcoin.  Miners earn bitcoin from two sources: the block subsidy and transaction fees. Transaction fees currently are a negligible percentage of miner revenue, so we will set them aside. The block subsidy is how new bitcoin enters circulation: 900 fresh bitcoins are awarded to miners worldwide every day, roughly in proportion to their computing power.  This issuance rate drops by half every four years, in an event known as the halving. In April 2024, that supply of new bitcoin will drop to 450 BTC per day and stay there until 2028 when it drops to 225 BTC per day.  Bitcoin is a fungible good produced from the same input – electricity – at roughly the same rate by the same specialized mining machines (application-specific integrated circuit, or ASICs) wherever they operate around the world. Once mined, bitcoin is sold in a global marketplace and instantly “shipped” to its buyer simply by updating the shared ledger of bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin miners are interruptible and attenuable; they can turn off and back on quickly, and can fine tune their consumption of electricity, with minimal loss of profit.  The largest expense of mining – upwards of 70% – is energy.  How do these facts show that mining is headed for nearly-free energy use?  First, the uniformity and availability of the means of bitcoin production – ASICs – and the fungibility of the product means there’s an extremely low barrier to entering this market. The bitcoins you produce will be as good as anyone else’s and you’ll use the same machines to produce them. So if it is possible to mine one bitcoin for less than one bitcoin then someone, somewhere in the world will do it, because people like money.  Second, once the mining market is saturated, those miners with the highest expenses will sit right on the edge of profitability – just enough profit to make it worthwhile to continue – and no one else will be tempted to enter the market unless they can improve on the expenses of that marginal miner. If some new miner does make an entrance during saturation, and they’re profitable, then the existing marginally-profitable miner will go out of business.  Third, miners with access to cheaper energy enjoy a tremendous advantage. If energy is 70% of your cost and you can find a 50% savings on energy, you’ve just cut expenses by 35% making for a dramatic increase in margins. Other business advantages matter too – firmware, cooling, taxes, personnel, access to capital, uptime, etc. – but the 800-pound gorilla is your electricity bill. If you have a significant disadvantage on a cost that accounts for 70% of your expenses, then no matter your other advantages, your business is on the chopping block; cheaper energy reserves will be tapped somewhere in the world until you hoist the white flag and auction off your assets.  Fourth, the halving of bitcoin issuance, which will next happen in April 2024, violently shakes out less-efficient miners every four years. When the total amount of money bitcoin miners are expected to spend worldwide on energy decreasing by nearly 50% in nine months – which it will, absent a doubling in bitcoin’s price or a dramatic spike in the fee market – any miner with thin, or even moderate, margins will be forced to find cheaper energy or perish.  Impacts of an energy cheapskate  So, we can conclude that bitcoin will trend towards the cheapest energy in the world. What follows from that? One immediate implication is that bitcoin is not going to push up utility rates for anyone very much for very long. It simply can’t. If the entry of bitcoin miners into an electricity market raises most users’ prices significantly, those prices will subsequently be higher than other regions of the world and it will be more profitable to mine somewhere else. The miners in the region with newly-expensive power will then be on the chopping block.  Furthermore, miners, since they are interruptible, will never use power at times when power is most expensive – when it costs more than a bitcoin just for the electricity to mine a bitcoin – so will never contribute to the peaks of demand within a grid. Those demand peaks bear much of the responsibility for infrastructure needs and high power costs. While miners may raise price floors – not too significantly or they’ll be outcompeted! – they will most definitely not raise price ceilings.  Another conclusion on the environmental front is far more dramatic: the cheapest energy in the world is energy that no one, at present, wants. This means energy that is stranded in space or produced at the wrong time. Such nearly-free, excess electricity is mostly the result of generation that cannot readily adjust to changes in load (nuclear, hydro, wind or solar).  For a gas plant, if demand drops, one simply throttles back the gas. But when demand drops during some part of the day, or as heavy industry leaves a region, these non-fossil sources of power cannot drop their production as well, and consequently, prices fall. With ambitious plans for deploying renewable generation, such over-abundant pockets of electrical power will only expand in the coming decades.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Is Good for the Environment and Better for the Energy Grid | Opinion  Bitcoin buying up unwanted power produced by intermittent renewables at the wrong time, or by nuclear or hydro facilities in local power markets with insufficient demand, improves the economics of those forms of electricity generation.  An analogy may help here. Suppose a bakery customer agreed ahead of time to buy a certain amount of pastries each day, unless it was a busy day, in which case, they'd cancel their daily order. Suppose the customer also agreed to buy up any unsold pastries at the end of each day. That's bitcoin mining.  Just as the ideal bakery customer would be regular, but also deferential to other buyers, miners agree to buy a certain amount of power in advance, in a predictable way, for a low price, but they turn off their machines to make way for other buyers with higher bids during demand spikes. And just as the bakery buyer lies in wait for wasted baked goods at the days’ end, so too do bitcoin miners with older, less efficient machines wait for the only energy on which they are profitable: the free stuff.  In both cases, the seller – of pastries or power – is able to meet their customer’s demands, but also count on steady revenue as a result of this very special and flexible buyer.  Another consequence of bitcoin’s stingy energy shopping is that it is well-suited to clean up energy that is also waste. Flared methane is not earning any money at all, but can be used to generate electricity and mine bitcoin. It follows that bitcoin miners will seek out flared gas, whether on landfills, at wastewater treatment facilities, farms or oil fields, and take advantage, mitigating what the United Nations calls “the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years.”  Finally, all of the energy entering an ASIC as electricity leaves as heat. Miners who find a way to sell this heat will have a competitive advantage over those who do not. This is already happening in a variety of settings – spas, distilleries, district heating – where it makes sense. And we can infer it will continue if it is profitable.  In sum, bitcoin mining is a nearly perfect market with margins trending to zero, whose most significant input is energy. Given that mining is location-agnostic, scalable and flexible, it will inevitably happen where and when power is cheapest. That means non-rival consumption of wasted energy, which in our current energy landscape is the unavoidable by-product of non-dispatchable generation.  The consumption of what would otherwise be wasted energy promises to be good, not bad, for energy economics, and for the emissions of our energy systems as a whole, given that it improves the economics of non-dispatchable power generation, incentivizes the cleanup of waste methane and incentivizes the electrification of heating.  Real-world complications and the difficult questions that remain  The inferences I’ve drawn above all have caveats and exceptions. Debt can allow miners to operate at a loss, so it might be that in the short term miners thrive who have access to capital rather than cheap energy. Jurisdictional risk can outweigh electrical price advantage – who wants a mining operation that can be seized at any moment by a corrupt government?  In bull runs, ASICs, or other power infrastructure, can be in short supply, so that mining margins remain fat, allowing miners the luxury of consuming expensive energy until ASIC and other infrastructure availability catches up.  Further, the halving event can trigger a bull run of sufficient magnitude that it fails to shake out inefficient players. New electrical generation projects are difficult to finance against promises of bitcoin mining, because the volatility of bitcoin makes lenders uncertain. And cheap electricity from intermittent renewables comes with significant downtime, while ASICs depreciate at a steady rate, posing a challenge for mining purely on renewables’ excess.  Finally, states subsidize energy and regulate energy markets in ways that make my Econ 101 analysis locally fail – e.g., when coal-fired power plants are subsidized, they're suddenly economical ways to mine bitcoin. Any electrical market may be rigged such that bitcoin miners lock in low prices while other buyers are forced to pay more as a result of the increased demand.  All of these qualifications are true, and partially explain the events triggering a barrage of negative bitcoin mining press over the past two years. When China banned bitcoin mining during a historical bull run in price, electrical rates mattered little, and easy money flooded the bitcoin mining industry, leading to a mad scramble for electricity at any price, straining some local grids and keeping open some fossil fuel plants that were scheduled to close.  But the qualifiers above are exceptions that prove the rule. Each represents some kind of temporary aberration or failure of markets, which, in the long run, must give way to the relentless march towards nearly-free energy. Nothing can long keep the most portable, scalable, flexible and price-sensitive energy consumer in history from abundant, nearly-free, unwanted energy. It’s destiny.  See also: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive  Of course, Greenpeace will continue to argue that bitcoin is world-ending while demanding changes to its code. They have shown, in a decades-long campaign against nuclear energy, a willingness to attack a climate-saving, but new and scary technology on the most meager evidence.  But serious conversations among policy makers and industry leaders about bitcoin mining’s impacts on energy systems and the environment must do better. They must investigate this new technology from the ground up, branching out into disagreement about how bitcoin mining happens in the messy real world only after reaching a point of convergence on its essential nature.  That point of convergence, the foundation of rational discourse, is bitcoin mining’s relentless drive towards cheaper energy.

President Vladimir Putin has endorsed the digital ruble bill, signing it into law on July 24. As a result of this approval, the digital ruble law is officially set to take effect starting from August 1, 2023. Related Reading: XRP Position In The Crypto Top 4 Ranking: Can It Endure? The digital ruble will serve as an additional form of the Russian national currency. It will run alongside the existing cash and non-cash forms. This development means that the Russian ruble will exist in three different forms. This includes physical cash, non-cash transactions (such as electronic transfers and online payments), and the newly introduced digital version. The digital ruble will primarily function as a medium for payments and transfers. However, opening a bank account using digital rubles or obtaining a loan denominated in digital rubles will not be possible. The recently passed legislation now grants the Russian central bank the authority to conduct the first CBDC pilot involving real consumers. Earlier, the government had planned to initiate trials in April. It was to collaborate with multiple local banks, including major institutions like Sberbank. Russia’s Central Bank To Be The Principal Operator Of Digital Ruble According to the newly enacted law, Russia’s central bank will assume the role of the principal operator for the digital ruble infrastructure. It will be responsible for safeguarding the stored assets. Additionally, individuals or entities not operators or participants in the digital ruble platform, are prohibited from using the phrase “digital ruble platform” for their benefit. This also includes banning any related words and expressions in their advertising. Elvira Nabiullina, the Bank of Russia governor, has stated that Russian citizens will not be obligated to use the CBDC. The usage of the digital ruble will be entirely voluntary. The decision to adopt the CBDC will rest with the individuals. Nabiullina stated: No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble But we really hope that it will be more convenient and cheaper for both people and businesses, and they will start using it. This is a new opportunity. Provisions For The Inheritance Of Digital Rubles The document outlines provisions for the inheritance of digital rubles. It allows individuals to pass on their rights to these digital assets through testamentary dispositions or wills. The Russian government will establish the process and rules for issuing such orders in collaboration with the Bank of Russia. This ensures that digital rubles can be transferred or inherited according to the legal framework set by the authorities. It allows for adequately managing and distributing these digital assets during a person’s passing.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dipped 3.2% to $29.1K at 3:48 p.m. ET, after oscillating in the narrow $29.7K-$31.4K range over the past month. It retreated to as low as $28.8K during the 11 a.m. hour. The top digital coin wasn't alone in suffering losses, with ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the largest altcoin by market value, off 2.1% to $1.84K. All in, the global crypto market cap slid 2.9% to $1.17T, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Twitter, one of the biggest social media companies now under the leadership of Musk, recently changed its logo from the infamous ‘blue bird’ to a seemingly discrete X symbol. However, this was not the end of the changes as Musk also changed his Twitter bio to display the Dogecoin symbol. Elon Musk Highlights Dogecoin In Recent Changes On Monday, Elon Musk changed his Twitter location to “XÐ”, X for the new Twitter logo, and Ð for Dogecoin’s logo, sparking speculations about a possible integration of Dogecoin into the Twitter platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Address Dormant For More Than 11 Years Moves $31 Million In BTC This isn’t the first time Musk has promoted DOGE and caused a stir in the crypto community, as he has tweeted about the meme coin several times in the past. With almost 150 million followers on the social media platform, Musk’s tweets garner a huge amount of attention. So when he mentions specific companies or cryptocurrencies, it often leads to big price swings. Musk changes profile to include DOGE symbol | Source: Twitter His tweets in the past have triggered double-digit percentage increases in the price of Dogecoin in particular. This time, Musk’s support seems to have had more of a subtle price reaction. Following the implementation of the new bio, the price of Dogecoin shot up more than 5%. Trading volume on exchanges also increased drastically as investors rushed to buy the altcoin. According to Coinmarketcap, Dogecoin has seen a total increase of 309.19% in trading volume in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin was created as a “meme currency,” but has since developed its own very passionate community and following, including Elon Musk, who is one of the world’s richest men. Will The New Twitter X Support DOGE? There’s a good chance that Twitter (now X) may incorporate Dogecoin payments into its platform, especially given Musk’s continuous support. As Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk could push for the social media company to incorporate the meme coin into its ecosystem. This will enable users to seamlessly make payments on the site using Dogecoin, which may attract more crypto investors to the platform and boost user engagement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap However, there are a few roadblocks in the way. More stable cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum are starting to be accepted as payment methods in various aspects of the world. However, altcoins like Dogecoin are still very volatile with little utility and there are questions about its stability before Twitter (X) seriously considers it as an official payment method.

42392981,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEIU9,1690225992,Web3 Could Revolutionize Climate Finance,"As extreme weather events continue to increase in frequency as a result of rising temperatures, Web3 stands ready to address one of the biggest issues impacting the global fight against climate change: the climate funding gap.  In 2009, delegates at the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 15) pledged to reach a target of $100 billion in annual climate financing for developing countries by 2020. Nearly a decade and a half later, the amount of actual funding is estimated to be between $21 billion and $83.3 billion – a fraction of the now-estimated $1 trillion needed annually.  Elizabeth Tan is the founder of Intent Capital Group, a financial services firm focused on impact investing, development financing and green funds. She is also the founder and managing partner of Intent Fund, and a Web3 investor and strategy adviser.  Of the financing that is provided, the vast majority comes from governments and institutions in developed countries, some of which use climate financing as a means to greenwash their thinly veiled support for resource exploitation. The result is financing terms dictated by the donor countries and few financing alternatives for developing countries.  The good news is that Web3 can help close the funding gap – and may even allow citizen activists to wrest control of climate finance away from governments and institutions. It can get trillions in retail capital into the space, incentivize a new generation of climate projects and give developing countries alternative funding options.  Onboarding retail capital  A major part of the problem is that climate finance has long been the domain of governments and institutional investors. Retail investors are simply not allowed to participate, despite their $8.2 trillion in untouched “investable retail wealth.”  Evidence suggests that most retail investors would take a lower return in exchange for significant environmental impact. It’s a clear signal that they want to be part of the fight against climate change and invest their money into projects they believe will have a big environmental impact.  Web3 can make that happen. In regulated jurisdictions, it can enable the creation of new financial instruments specifically designed for retail investors. This includes the tokenization of existing climate assets, fractionalization of big-ticket instruments like green bonds and creation of special-purpose decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Web3 also provides a method of low-cost and accessible value transfer through fiat-backed stablecoins.  See also: ReFi Will Take Crypto and Climate Change Mainstream | Opinion  Retail investors can also participate in transparent crowdfunding campaigns through licensed Web3 launchpads and launch pools. While this was theoretically possible before through platforms such as Kickstarter, Web3 platforms have the crucial advantage of being part of an interconnected system in which most components are put on a blockchain – from project evaluation and escrow to carbon credit issuance and stablecoin disbursements to investors.  Onboarding retail investors into Web3 so that they can leverage these tools remains a challenge, however. And while it will take time and effort for Web3-powered climate investments to become mainstream, there are tens of millions of retail investors already in Web3 and working towards creating a better world. This segment has more than enough capital to invest in new projects and climate assets.  A new generation of grassroots climate projects  Demand for carbon and renewable energy credits is steadily growing. McKinsey suggests that it could increase by a factor of 100 by 2050. Supply, in contrast, has struggled to keep pace. The reason: non-tech climate projects, like reforestation and preservation, struggle to raise the upfront investment needed to get started and then scale.  In Asia, institutional investors have demonstrated their preference for scalability, opting for consumer startups like fast-coffee chains and fintech startups. Climate tech has fared well in the venture funding space, but these are seen as high-risk long-term bets that may never pan out. Non-tech climate projects, in contrast, just don’t offer the returns that VCs have become accustomed to.  Web3 has proven its worth as a fundraising platform. Launchpads, special-purpose DAOs and other mechanisms such as quadratic funding have helped raise billions of dollars to get Web3 projects off the ground.  The same can be used for climate and other regenerative projects. Not only would this open up access to retail investors, but institutional investors may find returns that are more in line with their expectations. With these kinds of opportunities in place, there will be a much greater financial incentive to start climate projects.  Giving at-risk countries alternative climate financing options  Debt distress and climate change are mutually existential. When developed countries loan money to developing countries to fight a problem that they themselves caused, it perpetuates a vicious cycle in which the debtors need to continuously borrow to both service crippling debt obligations and deal with the impact of climate change. This isn’t a sustainable path forward.  Web3 funding solutions offer hope. Developing countries tend to be rich in climate assets. Resources such as forests, mangroves, coral reefs and sunlight have significant untapped value. Through their environment and natural resource ministries or agencies, governments can leverage Web3 fundraising platforms such as green bond protocols to help finance projects that generate on-chain carbon and renewable energy credits that can then be sold to governments, companies and individuals with net-zero aspirations. Consider it a form of sustainable wealth transfer in which both sides benefit.  See also: Unleashing the Green Economy  These are the kinds of solutions we need if we’re going to reach $1 trillion in annual climate financing, let alone $100 billion. Grand gestures by governments and institutions, while good for headlines, make very little difference on the ground. Web3 stands poised to be the catalyst that unlocks access to retail capital, spawns and scales a new generation of grassroots climate projects, and finally gives at-risk countries a chance to leverage their climate assets.  The bottom line is that we – investors, governments, companies and individuals – need to look seriously at how Web3 can change climate finance for the better. If we don’t, we will continue in our role as the perpetrators of our own demise.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Elizabeth Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/24/web3-could-revolutionize-climate-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06294cb879b7d38e4ad0edd8716fec87e5458911-7932x4462.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This listing has garnered immense attention from the global crypto community, with investors eager to participate in this new venture. The listing, announced today at 12:00 will include trading pairs such as WLD/BTC, WLD/USDT, and WLD/USDC. Worldcoin (WLD) aims to empower humanity in the Age of AI Worldcoin and revolutionize the digital identity landscape in the era of artificial intelligence. As the project’s service token, the WLD token carries essential governance features. This ambitious endeavor introduces the World ID system, Orb with iris scanner, and World App wallets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap Despite privacy and security concerns expressed by experts, Altman is confident that Worldcoin’s open-source AI technology with iris scanning capabilities will alleviate these concerns over time. Crypto Exchanges Line Up To List Worldcoin’s Newly Launched WLD Token Binance is not the only cryptocurrency exchange to participate in the listing of Worldcoin’s newly launched WLD token. Several other major exchanges, including OKX, Huobi, Bybit, and Gate.io, have also jumped on board to offer trading services for WLD. These listings have given a bullish birth to the newbie token (WLD). The token’s early trading on ByBit saw a remarkable surge, reaching highs of $2.79 within minutes of its debut. With a total token supply of 10 billion tokens, the WLD token’s fully diluted value currently stands at an alarming $25.6 billion. WLD falls from $2.99 to $2.199 | Source: WLDUSDT on TradingView.com Worldcoin’s Ambitious Vision And Support Sam Altman’s mission to provide universal access to cryptocurrency has struck a chord with investors and communities worldwide. The World ID system, authenticated through iris scanning technology called “The Orb,” aims to establish a trustable and reliable global identification system for all individuals. With financial backing of $115 million from its Series C funding round, the project is expected to make significant strides toward achieving its goals. The World ID’s potential to distinguish between real humans and AI-generated entities has caught the attention of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who is confident in its bright future.

Garlinghouse Speaks Out Against SEC Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC has been celebrated by most of the industry but has seen some backlash from the naysayers.

At the time of the ruling, Garlinghouse commented that institutional sale represents “the smallest piece” of the suit and believes if the SEC decides to appeal the decision regarding retail sales, it would only “solidify” Torres’ decision. Garlinghouse further labelled the SEC a “bully” for targeting “weak players” in the industry without the necessary resources to build a strong defence.

42392971,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHer,1690220509,Judge in FTX Case Mulls Gag Order on Contact with Media,"A federal judge is considering forbidding “parties and witnesses” in the FTX case from speaking to the media, days after the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaked private documents from one of his co-conspirators to the press, according to court filings.  The proposed order, filed Monday, comes as the DOJ claims Bankman-Fried shared former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison’s private diary to obstruct a “fair trial.” Ellison and Bankman-Fried had also been in a relationship at the time of the alleged crimes.  “The parties in this case, their attorneys, and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating or discussing with any public communications media anything about the case which could interfere with a fair trial,” the proposed order said.  It added, “[That includes] statements about the identity, testimony, or credibility of prospective witnesses, information that has not been deemed admissible at trial, and statements intended to influence public opinion regarding the merits of this case.”  Bankman-Fried allegedly slipped diary entries from Ellison to the New York Times last week in an attempt to derail her testimony against him at his upcoming trial this October, the DOJ said in a letter Friday. Ellison faced a potential jail term for her role in allegedly defrauding FTX’s investors of billions of dollars before accepting a plea deal from federal prosecutors that would enable her to avoid prison entirely and be released immediately on a $250,000 bail.  But, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers denied those accusations in a letter to the judge on Sunday.  “The Government has taken a set of circumstances where nothing improper or impermissible occurred and has unfairly recast the events as a nefarious attempt by Mr. Bankman-Fried to ‘discredit’ Caroline Ellison and ‘taint’ the jury pool. But Mr. BankmanFried did nothing wrong,” his lawyers wrote.  The judge’s order could threaten the conditions of the former crypto king’s bail, which up until now have been relatively loose. Bankman-Fried is living at his parent’s house in Palo Alto, California in the run-up to his trial. The court has restricted his use of technology, but has granted exceptions permitting him to access certain websites, including CoinDesk.  This isn’t the first time Bankman-Fried has allegedly skirted his bail conditions. In February, the former executive allegedly used a VPN to intimidate former FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller, a potential witness in the case against him, on Signal. Bankman-Fried maintained he used the VPN to watch the Superbowl, a claim of which Judge Kaplan had been skeptical.  Judge Kaplan has previously remarked on the relaxed nature of Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions and threatened revocation proceedings against him if he continues to violate his bail conditions.  “It could get there,” Kaplan warned at a February hearing. “I want [the bail conditions] to be tight.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/24/judge-in-ftx-case-orders-gag-on-contact-with-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f901c2d2e024a35f30f4bb5e879fb7d2dc42fca1-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Amid the struggle to recover, there have been massive inflows of ETH into centralized exchanges, which could spell further struggles for the digital asset going forward. Ethereum Whales Move Millions To Centralized Exchanges Multiple reports from the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert have shown that Ethereum whales could be exiting their positions in large volumes. The reports started on Saturday, July 22, when the first transaction was first picked up on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate Massive Amounts Of ARB In the first transaction, Whale Alert shows that the whale had moved 15,000 ETH to Gate.io. And at the time, the transaction was worth around $28.28 million. However, this was only the first of many as the whale tracker would go on to report even larger movements to centralized exchanges. The next was a transaction carrying 19,328 ETH worth $36.5 million at the time to Coinbase. Moving forward, the tracker also reported another transaction of 15,000 ETH ($28.1 million) being moved to the Gate.io crypto exchange once more. The fourth transaction was one carrying 19,328 ETH valued at $36.12 million, transferred from another unknown wallet to Coinbase. And last but not least, a large ETH transaction carrying 12,000 ETH ($22.5 million) popped up in the early hours of Monday. ETH price falls following large whale inflows to exchanges | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com What Do These Transactions Mean For ETH? These movements by Ethereum whales could have negative implications for the price of ETH going forward. This is because when crypto investors send coins to exchanges, it is usually because they are looking to sell their coins and take advantage of the deep liquidity that centralized exchanges provide. If this is the case and these whales begin to sell such large amounts of ETH in one go, then it could significantly impact the price of ETH. This could see the altcoin which is already struggling in the market fall even further as the selling pressure climbs. Already, ETH is seeing a decline in its prices, falling toward $1,830 in the early hours of Monday before making a brisk recovery. Such sharp declines could have been triggered by the whales selling, and if there is not enough demand in the market to soak up this new supply, then ETH’s price could return to the low $1,800s once more.

42392969,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHPT,1690219812,Putin Signs Digital Ruble Law Making a CBDC Possible in Russia,"Russia's president Vladimir Putin signed the digital ruble bill into law today, allowing the country's central bank to issue its own digital currency.  The digital ruble, which the Bank of Russia has long been mulling over, will be used for payments along with other methods, according to the new amendments to Russia's Civil Code. The digital ruble accounts will be managed by the central bank, the law says. The bill passed its third, final hearing on July 11 and had been waiting for the president to be signed.  Digital ruble is a CBDC project the Bank of Russia has been working on since 2020, when the Bank of Russia published its first analytical report on the topic. Later, the regulator updated the report including the feedback from Russian banks and other financial market participants. The regulator announced it stared piloting the system with a number of Russian banks in February 2022, shortly before the country started a war in Ukraine.  Now, as Russia is heavily sanctioned by the U.S. and Europe, the digital ruble might become one of the ways to circumnavigate the massive financial restrictions imposed on the country by the West. The project initially was viewed by the Bank of Russia both as a tool against sanctions and a way to control how the government is spending money allocated for social projects.  According to the head of the parliament's committee on financial markets Anatoly Aksakov, the digital ruble will also allow controlling and limiting the ways private citizen can spend them.

42392974,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHuF,1690219184,Ghost From the Well: Is Crypto Mining With Associated Gas Better for the Environment?,"Back in 2018, when another bear market depressed crypto prices, Sergii Gerasymovych was looking for cheaper sources of power. The CEO and co-founder of EZ Blockchain started learning about associated gas, a byproduct of oil drilling and a promising source of energy for miners, he told CoinDesk.  Gerasymovych, a Forbes 30 Under 30 winner in 2021, did some research and found out that flaring gas from oil wells creates much more CO2 emissions than cars, he said. And all that gas, which oil producers traditionally burn off, is actually a vast source of energy that can be used.  “One oil well has enough natural gas to power 1.5 megawatt of electricity continuously,” Gerasymovych said. “And there are thousands of them.”  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  However, using this source of energy, for bitcoin mining or any other purpose, is technologically challenging and not as cheap as it can seem. First of all, the gas coming out of oil wells is not pure methane but a mix of various gasses, like butane, propane and others.  That makes producing power expensive. Generators producing 1 megawatt of power from such sources can cost up to $700,000. And for a 10-megawatt farm, it would be $5 million, plus $1 million for installation works, Gerasymovych said. “And then, the oil and gas company says, well, sorry, the gas is not stable,” he added.  But Gerasymovych persisted because he liked the idea of using energy that would otherwise be wasted, as well as potentially assisting the environment, by using gas that causes climate change.  Flammable material  Associated gas, consisting of methane and some other hydrocarbon gasses, is a pollutant that plays a big role in the global warming – methane alone is 25 times more conducive to the greenhouse effect than CO2 (though it stays less time in the atmosphere). Agriculture is another industry producing a lot of methane, with livestock (think: belching cows) responsible for 14.5% of all global greenhouse gasses.  When a fresh oil well is drilled, the gas comes out together with the oil, and a drilling company needs to prevent methane from going into the atmosphere. Oil producers can do it several ways. They can flare (burn) the gas, so that instead of methane, CO2 is emitted. They can sell the gas via a pipeline or in the liquified form. They can generate electricity or synthesize materials like polyethylene from it. Or they can put it back underground. Gerasymovych thought to direct this byproduct to a power generator, make some electricity out of it and mine some bitcoin.  Proponents of crypto mining using associated gas argue that it helps avoid pollution from flaring and puts the gas to work instead of wasting it. But does it help the environment? The question is heavily contested.  Read more: George Kaloudis - Through It All, the Bitcoin Mining Industry Looks Set for Growth  Opponents say that bitcoin mining makes oil drilling more profitable and keeps it relevant longer than it should be, therefore delaying a switch away from fossil fuels. To environmentalists, using fossil fuels to mine bitcoin is a heinous luxury at a time of increasing weather weirdness.  So what’s the truth? CoinDesk looked into some numbers and facts.  Down with flaring  Although there are different ways to deal with the associated gas, in reality, building infrastructure to deeply process it or deliver to buyers is expensive. Often, oil companies just flare it, even though they have to pay penalties. Those penalties, experts say, are often negligible compared to the oil and gas companies’ revenue.  The International Energy Agency characterizes gas flaring as an “extraordinary waste of money in addition to its negative impacts on climate change and human health.” The World Bank set the goal to cut flare gas emissions to zero by 2030, and some leading global oil and gas companies joined the initiative, including BP, Eni, TOTAL and Statoil.  In 2022, oil companies worldwide emitted over 357 million tons of carbon dioxide while flaring associated gas, the World Bank says. If all that gas was used to generate electricity instead, it would be enough to power the entire Sub-Saharan Africa, the organization said in a report.  However, if the oil field is in a remote location with no people living around it, there are simply no consumers to use this power and it’s hard to deliver it to the nearest village or city.  In some regions, regulators have been showing a more aggressive approach towards eliminating the flaring, forcing the companies to explore alternatives. For example, in Colorado, the state authorities prohibited flaring entirely, and in 2022, “half a dozen” oil producers were mining crypto on their sites, the Colorado Sun reported last August.  Using the associated gas to mine crypto might even be a more profitable way to deal with it than selling the gas as fuel. Last February, consulting firm Vygon Consulting estimated that using the associated gas available in Russia could bring miners up $1,4 billion a year in revenue, while selling the associated gas is only earning $77 million for the oil and gas companies.  However, using associated gas for mining is not without problems and miners don’t use it that often.  “More cons than pros”  Five years ago, as Gerasymovych was doing his research, using associated gas for mining was new and bitcoiners were given the opportunity to use it for free, said Troy Cross, professor of philosophy and humanities at the Reed College. But once enough miners started moving to that source of energy the oil and gas companies started charging for it, Cross told CoinDesk.  So now, the price might not be the biggest advantage of associated gas-fueled energy, and there are some significant disadvantages. For one, it’s not coming in a consistent stream big enough to power the mining farm, which needs to be on 24/7.  Read more: Anthony Power - How Miners Are Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving  When the oil well is first drilled, for the first few months, there is usually a lot of gas, but later, the stream becomes less consistent, with outputs fluctuating during the day, causing interruptions for the mining.  “Now you have enough gas for 1 megawatt, another time you only have enough for 600 kilowatts,” Gerasymovych said. “If you think of it as an entire process, it has more cons than pros for a miner.”  That convinced him that other than trying to mine on the oil fields, EZ Blockchain should rather provide equipment and technological services to the oil and gas companies that are willing to mine themselves. But he hasn’t seen a ton of interest from the fossil fuels industry so far. The incentives are just not there.  “Oil and gas companies are motivated to reduce emissions, but the regulations are not as scary as many people think they would be,” Gerasymovych said.  During the pandemic, when oil companies saw their revenues decline and they looked for sources of extra money, bitcoin mining became a more popular idea. Now, with prices for oil and gas higher, there is less motivation, Gerasymovych said.  Saving fossil fuels?  Some researchers suggest extra revenue from bitcoin mining might incentivize oil and gas companies to drill new gas wells solely to power the mining farms.  “The heavy reliance on flare gas by Bitcoin miners is troubling and only perpetuates the use of fossil fuels that are the main drivers of the climate crisis,” said Alex Formuzis, a spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group, told CoinDesk in a written statement. “It’s imperative these mining operations and the broader cryptocurrency community follow the lead of Ethereum and others by changing the way they conduct business that is far less electricity intensive,” he added.  Gerasymovych disagrees. First of all, there is no widespread enthusiasm among the oil producers to start mining on associated gas, he said. In the U.S., only a dozen of oil companies bought EZ Blockchain’s mining containers, and usually it’s not big but mid-size companies.  With the current price of bitcoin and the regulatory uncertainty, bitcoin offers a minimal bonus to the oil and gas profits, Gerasymovych said. An operation that can power a one-megawatt farm would produce about 420 barrels of oil a day. With the oil prices around $75 for a barrel and the bitcoin price of today, the company would make $1,200 from mining and $18,000 from oil production, Gerasymovych said.  Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA bitcoin campaign lead, believes this argument is only good until the bitcoin price rises. When the price gets more attractive, so will mining on the oil fiends, further encouraging the oil drilling, which simply should stop, he told CoinDesk.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Crypto Miners Are Pivoting to AI (Like Everyone Else)  “A continued growth of the bitcoin value will continue to worsen this problem,” Archer said of the continued usage of fossil fuels. The fact that the bitcoin network keeps swallowing more and more energy as it grows also is concerning, he said.  Greenpeace is advocating for bitcoin to switch away from the energy-consuming proof-of-stake mechanism altogether – a non-starter for bitcoiners who believe that proof-of-work is exactly what makes bitcoin uniquely decentralized and censorship-resistant.  Finding the consensus?  On the other hand, from an emissions point of view, turning associated gas into electricity is better than flaring, a point environmental groups like WWF also agree with. Flaring can convert up to 98% of methane and other gasses coming out of an oil well into carbon dioxide and water, depending on the efficiency of the equipment. However, in reality, this efficiency is not that high, and often only 91.1% of methane gets destroyed.  “I think of bitcoin mining as a cheaper and more efficient flare stack,” Troy Cross said.  “If someone at MIT or CalTech stated they designed a flare stack that is 99% efficient under any conditions – I think you wouldn’t have an outcry from environmental groups that it’s increasing the profitability of oil companies, therefore it’s a bad technology,” he added.  But Greenpeace’s Archer believes that mining is a “false solution” to the fossil fuels pollution problem.  “Bitcoin is growing all the time, it’s becoming computationally more difficult, consuming more electricity and producing more emission. Talking about methane mining is a distraction from the conversation about the real need to drastically reduce emissions,” Archer said.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - How Texas Became a Global Mecca for Bitcoin Mining  Gerasymovych believes bitcoin mining on associated gas deserves support, not blackballing from environmentalists. Oil and gas drilling is not going anywhere soon, and miners help address the issue that is not about to disappear tomorrow.  “Bitcoin miners are on their own. We don’t have special finances, government subsidies [like wind or solar energy producers do]. We succeed on our own and we fail on our own. But if it’s an environmental issue, we should work on this together,” he said.  Cross believes another plus of the flare gas mining is that miners normally use the sites where they are not competing for that associated gas and that electricity:  “We suddenly have a solution that requires nothing of us and gives us a benefit and we make no additional demand on the energy system. Any time you can use a waste product for an economic good that’s a win,” Cross said.  But it seems like environmentalists like Greanpeace can’t be convinced with this argument. The very fact that bitcoin miners are willing to work with the fossil fuels industry and provide it a “lifeline” – no matter big or small, is too damning.  “We’re still drilling [for oil] and we need to put a stop to that. Days of the oil and gas industry are numbered. We have an entire movement of people who are working tirelessly to avert the climate crisis and keep the oil underground,” Archer said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/ghost-from-the-well-is-crypto-mining-with-associated-gas-better-for-the-environment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bdf27ee0a338365d811355679f2272f532eddd0-2119x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

New laws known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) mean any stablecoins deemed to be overly connected to the financial system face extra capital requirements and centralized supervision by the European Union (EU).  “Financial distress at one ART [asset-referenced token] or EMT [e-money token] issuer can materially increase the likelihood of distress at other issuers of crypto-assets or at other financial institutions given the network of contractual obligations in which issuers operate,” said the document, seen by CoinDesk, referring to the two categories of stablecoin set out in MiCA whose value is tied to fiat currency or other assets.  “In order to address increased risks from significant ARTs or EMTs, the issuers of those tokens must comply with additional obligations and their supervision is partly or fully assigned to the EBA,” added the draft, on which industry views are being sought over the coming weeks.  In December, the European Commission asked the bank agency for advice on how to decide that a stablecoin is linked to other parts of the financial world or is internationally significant, with a deadline of Sept. 30.  The EBA has now set out a range of tentative indicators such as the share of assets held in the reserve issued by other regulated financial institutions other than deposits, and the market share of cross border payments, alongside already legislated metrics such as the number of users and market capitalization.  Under MiCA, stablecoins deemed significant will be supervised by the EBA rather than national regulators, must carry out extra stress tests, and must have their own funds equal to 3% of their reserve rather than the usual 2%.  MiCA lets crypto wallet providers and exchanges operate across the bloc with a single license, and its stablecoin provisions take effect in June 2024. Rules designed to tackle the risks posed by largescale projects like the now-abandoned Libra/Diem project include a controversial cap on the use of digital payments that become so widely used as to supplant the euro.

42392986,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEIjX,1690217674,"I Had My Iris Scanned by the Worldcoin Orb, and It Wasn't as Scary as I Expected","Paris, FRANCE – There’s nothing quite like having a futuristic orb pointed at your face to start off the day.  But that’s how a brunch went down last Friday in central Paris, organized by Worldcoin, a crypto and identity startup co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI/ChatGPT fame, and Global Coin Research, a venture capital collective backing the project.  The company has set up a new way for humans to prove that they’re human and unique (goodbye captcha!), and made it available today to developers so that they can build a myriad of applications that will perhaps one day form the basis of a new digital economy. The ambition is to one day even use Worldcoin to distribute universal basic income.  Read more: Inside the Orb: The Untold Story of Worldcoin’s Launch  Part of the controversy around it is the use of biometric data, specifically iris scans, to do so. As someone who doesn’t even use FaceID on an iPhone and takes the time to reject all cookies on every single website, the idea of getting my iris scanned by a sci-fi looking shiny sphere was daunting to say the least.  The company has open-sourced the hardware and most of the software, including the protocol, to increase transparency, and says that none of the iris data is stored on their devices. The iris scan is only put to work to create a unique digital identifier for the user. They explained to me and other reporters that they are not collecting a giant databank of irises and are in fact quite thoughtful about preserving user privacy.  With that in mind, I did my best to put my worries-of-dystopia aside, and headed down to get scanned in Paris, part of the Orbs’ world tour. I waited for a couple of people before me to get scanned, and then sat down on a leather sofa.  The process  Alas, for all that artificial intelligence and zero-knowledge proof technology, basic internet connectivity was still a sticking point. The Orb and administrator still have to be connected to the internet, and the establishment’s WiFi and the administrator’s hotspot had a hard time doing so.  After a couple of tries, however, we got it to work.  I clicked on the World App the option to download a grant, an airdrop of the beta token which is closer to an IOU, which then prompted me to get verified by an Orb. After ascertaining the app that I was with an Orb and I wouldn’t have to go look for one, I pointed a QR code from my World App into the Orb’s two eyes. Worldcoin staff also had to scan a QR code (much like how you have to scan a card when you're buying alcohol at the self-checkout cashier at the supermarket).  Read more: Worldcoin's Newly Launched WLD Token Spikes Over 20% on Major Crypto Exchanges  Then it was time. The administrator raised the melon-sized shiny silver Orb to my face, and its two cameras and light pierced through my eyes and into my uniquely identifying irises. A large set of infrared lights shone under the cameras, and another white light started forming a circle around the cameras.  The first time the scan didn’t actually work, probably because I put my phone in between me and the Orb to try to take a video. We tried another time, however, and it was successful.  When the circle was completed, the scan was done. At that point, the app on my phone started processing my data to finish the process. After a few minutes (and one app restart), it was done! From that moment on, I could forever prove that I am unique and human. Relief.  I then claimed my airdrop of 1 WLD and headed to the airport.  The takeaway  Admittedly, the process had some glitches, but, despite my worst fears, it was smoother and less intimidating than I expected.  I couldn’t really help but think about a million scenarios in which my iris data is used in many ways I do not condone, but the scanning process itself was not scary. Perhaps that says something about the overall design of the system, and/or our willingness to participate in what only months ago would have felt like an avant garde technodream.  The hardware and software have done a good job developing the comfortable consumer-facing user experience that we are all accustomed to, which helps.  On Monday, I awoke to some news. The Worldcoin network was launched, and since I had my iris scanned, I could claim 25 WLD.  Now, it's up to the community of developers to build applications that will bring me back to the ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | WLD | AIRDROP,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/24/i-had-my-iris-scanned-by-the-worldcoin-orb-and-it-wasnt-as-scary-as-i-expected,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2ecccb8a211a2b5feecc1d8ce4e3c8327847520-5129x3419.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Worldcoin’s Mission to Help Distinguish Humans from AI Bots Online The CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman together with Alex Blania founded Worldcoin over three years ago. The main idea behind the project is to present a solution which can effectively verify human identity online without violating users’ privacy. With AI technology developing extremely rapidly in the latest months, many believe that soon it’s going to take over lots of human jobs leaving thousands unemployed. It might also get to the point where it will become very difficult to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. Worldcoin offers a digital proof of personhood called World ID. In order to get a World ID, one needs to use an Orb, a sophisticated biometric verification device which scans users’ irises to verify that they’re human. Worldcoin also confirmed that it plans to create an AI-funded Universal Basic Income (UBI) service, thus helping to combat income inequality. Users in the countries “where laws allow” should be able to receive the Worldcoin digital currency (WLD) for simply being human. Worldcoin Starts the Rollout of Its Services On July 24, Worldcoin published a letter from cofounders on its website announcing the official launch of the product. One can access the Worldcoin services via World App, the company’s owned crypto wallet which is already available on iOS and Android. However, to get verified for World ID, it’s also required to visit an Orb, the eyeball-scanning device which is not globally distributed yet. Over 2 million people already signed up for World ID during the project’s Beta phase. Numerous crypto exchange platforms such as Binance, OKX, and Huobi have already confirmed the listing of the Worldcoin’s token. Vitalik Buterin Describes Potential Risks of the Worldcoin’s Identity Verification System On the same day of Worldcoin’s launch, the Ethereum network cofounder Vitalik Buterin published an extensive blog post about biometric proof of personhood in general and World ID in particular. According to Buterin, proof of personhood solutions are crucial as they help solve “a lot of anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems” as well as increase privacy and reduce dependence on centralized authorities. Many apps today use government-backed identity systems such as state IDs or credit cards, which inevitably intrude on users’ privacy. However, digital identity verification solutions have their issues as well. Buterin identifies at least four major risks with Worldcoin’s construction: privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security. Vitalik Buterin then compares World ID to other types of identity verification and concludes that there is no ideal form of proof of personhood: “I definitely do not envy the people attempting the task, and it will likely take years to find a formula that works. The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too…” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bittrex said in its statement: We are disappointed with the SEC’s decision to bring an enforcement action against Bittrex as part of Chairman Gensler’s larger crusade to drive cryptocurrency out of the United States. The impact of the SEC’s approach of regulation by enforcement will have a chilling effect on not just cryptocurrency in the United States, but on blockchain technology and innovation in general. The impact of this regulatory action was significant for the exchange and on May 8, 2023, Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This came following the SEC’s clampdown on the trading platform. Its filings also suggested that the firm was in deep financial woes as it stated that it had more than 100,000 creditors. Bittrex’s Approach Is Commendable Unlike what was seen with FTX and other crypto platforms that experienced ‘free fall’ bankruptcy, Bittrex’s case is quite different. From all indications, the company was fully prepared for the moments leading up to its bankruptcy filing. According to Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, Bittrex had taken “extensive action pre-petition to ensure full customer recovery, and plan to swiftly bring these chapter 11 cases to a responsible conclusion.” These actions include the ‘winding up’ announcement on March 31, which was going to become effective on April 30, halting deposits (without halting withdrawals), and giving customers enough time to withdraw their funds.

This customer-first approach by Bittrex is commendable, considering how customers of different crypto platforms remain in limbo as to when (or if ever) they will regain their funds. It is also worth mentioning that Bittrex went as far as obtaining a $7 million loan in Bitcoin (BTC) from its parent company, Aquila Holdings, to pay back its customers, according to a Reuters report on May 10.

42392983,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEIeP,1690216153,The Untold Story of Worldcoin’s Launch: Inside the Orb,"I’ve traveled to Berlin to stare into the future. Or, more accurately, I’ve traveled to Berlin to stare – literally stare – into a device that some see as our best hope for taming, and perhaps harnessing, the future powers of artificial intelligence (AI). Others see that same device as a ""Black Mirror"" episode sprung to life, designed to track and control us.  I’m staring into “the Orb.”  The Orb is about the size of a bowling ball. It’s chrome and shiny and smooth. I’m instructed to move closer and stare into a black circle, like how you peer into a machine at the optometrist’s. The Orb then uses a system of infrared cameras, sensors and AI-powered neural networks to scan my iris and verify that yes, in fact, I am a human being.  And I’m hardly the first to do this. There are now over two million humans who have stared into the Orb, the flagship device from Worldcoin, the crypto-meets-AI project co-founded by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Alex Blania, who is now the CEO of parent company Tools for Humanity.  Worldcoin has an audacious premise: AI will continue to improve and eventually evolve into AGI (advanced general intelligence), meaning it’s smarter than humans. That will spur leaps in productivity. This will create wealth. And instead of that wealth being snatched by elites, it should be fairly distributed to all of humanity – literally everyone – as a form of UBI, or universal basic income, which will empower billions. That UBI will come in the form of a cryptocurrency. That crypto is Worldcoin (WLD).  The merits of UBI have resonated with Altman for years. “UBI is interesting to me even without talking about AI,” Altman says in a recent Zoom interview. “It’s an idea that appeals to a lot of people. If we have a society rich enough to end poverty, then we have a moral obligation to find out how to do that.”  So maybe the magic of AI can succeed where the mud of politics has failed? “In a world of AI, [universal basic income] is even more important, for the obvious reasons,” Altman says, who added he still expects there to be jobs in a post-AI world. “But, A, I do think we’re going to need some sort of cushion through the transition, and, B, part of the whole reason of being excited about AI is it’s a more materially abundant world.”  Worldcoin, following this logic, could be the key to unlocking that abundance. But there’s a catch. If the goal is to freely give out tokens to everyone, in this AI-enabled future, how can we be sure we’re handing out the loot to a human, and not an AI-powered fake? (It’s only a matter of time before AI can laugh at CAPTCHA.) Or what if bad actors use AI to create multiple wallets and game the system?  The team thought about the problem. They thought about all the ways humans could prove they’re actually human. And after considering all the options, they came to a wrenching conclusion. They didn’t like it. “We really did not want to do this,” Blania says. “We know it’s going to be painful. It’s going to be expensive. People think it’s weird.”  They decided they had no choice. It was unsettling and controversial and the optics are literally the stuff of nightmares, but they thought it had to be done: They needed to verify humanity with biometric data. Blania is talking, of course, about the Orb. “For a number of reasons, we didn’t want to go down that path,” he says. “But it really was the only solution.”  This is the untold story of that solution, and a journey to discover if it’s a solution or a problem.  The Orb  The Orb is sleek and minimalist, with no visible controls or knobs. It looks like something you’d buy in an Apple Store. That’s not a coincidence, as the Orb’s lead designer is Thomas Meyerhoffer, who was Jony Ive’s first hire at Apple. (Ive is the legendary designer of the iMac, iPod and iPhone.) The Orb was meant to evoke simplicity. “It must be simple enough to speak to all of us. Everyone, all around the world,” Meyerhoffer once said.  In the Berlin office, Blania shows me older models of the Orb and tells me stories of the company’s early days, when they first tinkered with the hardware. The idea was originally conceived as “the bitcoin project,” with the goal of freely distributing bitcoin to people once they proved their humanity. Blania holds up an older version and chuckles. It has a slot that spits out physical coins, almost like a reverse piggybank. It has two eyeballs and a mouth.  The early Orbs even talked to you. “This thing screams at you in a robot voice,” Blania remembers now, amused by the nostalgia. He explains that each of the early Orbs could hold 15 physical coins (which contained the keys to actual bitcoin), and the idea was that people would take the cryptocurrency more seriously if they held something in their hand. (The team soon scuttled this idea for obvious reasons.) “We just tried so many things,” says Blania, such as making the Orb vibrate when it told you something. Every week they cranked out a new version of the Orb, using 3D printers to quickly iterate.  Read more: Worldcoin's Newly Launched WLD Token Spikes Over 20% on Major Crypto Exchanges  Blania is a tall, athletic, baby-faced 29-year-old wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He’s an unlikely CEO. He leads one of the most ambitious projects on the planet, but this happens to be his very first job. Altman tapped him to be CEO and co-founder after his stint at CalTech, where he researched neural networks and theoretical physics. Blania admits that in the beginning, “other than technical depth, I think I was a bad CEO.”  So Altman gave him help. “Sam basically gave me a couple of people that I met with every week,” he says. “They basically told me, every week, the ways in which I was doing a bad job.” One of these CEO coaches was Matt Mochary, who had previously coached both Altman and Brian Armstrong. They tutored him on the managerial basics like how to conduct one-on-ones, how to run staff meetings and how to handle public speaking.  Blania has no hobbies, unless you count weight-lifting and meditating. He splits his time between San Francisco and Berlin (Tools for Humanity’s two main offices), and when in Berlin he starts his day at 9 A.M., leaves the office at 10 P.M., and then he hits the gym. “I try to work every waking hour.”  The work includes leading 50 full-time employees, and some were tasked with creating a new crypto wallet from scratch. “The crypto user experience is very rough,” says Tiago Sada, head of product and engineering, who I also meet in the Berlin office. Sada is yet another genius (there’s a lot of those in AI circles). He grew up in Mexico and built robots with his friends when he was 14 years old, then launched a “Venmo for Mexico” startup and later met Altman at the Y Combinator incubator.  Sada was initially skeptical of crypto because, in his view, it was hard to get non-technical people to easily sign up. When he asked people to do things like download a MetaMask extension, they were lost. Sure, crypto wallets were effective for the crypto-curious, but they were a non-starter for many of the planet’s eight billion people. And a core idea of Worldcoin is to get cryptocurrency to everyone, easily, regardless of their tech savvy. Something they could do without complications. Something they could do, literally, in the blink of an eye. So they built WorldApp, which syncs to the Orb and allows for near-instant onboarding.  I tried it out myself. In the Berlin office I downloaded the World App from the App Store. The app synched to the Orb, which sat on a conference room table. (I had imagined the Orb would be sitting on some pedestal in a throne room. Alas.) Seconds after, I stared into the shiny globe, my account was verified and I was now the proud owner of 1 worldcoin*. (*This would not have been possible had I tried in the U.S., where they are not rolling out tokens – at least not yet – for regulatory reasons.)  The onboarding process, at least for me, was buttery smooth. It was easily the most frictionless crypto onboarding I’ve experienced in my five-plus years covering the space, if you’re willing to overlook the whole scanning-the-eyeball thing. (More on that in a bit.)  One reason the tech works so smoothly is an embrace of AI. And the paradox of AI is everywhere. The potential consequences of AI – both wondrous (productivity gains) and malicious (deep fakes) – fuel the company’s mission, but on a more day-to-day basis, the recent gains in AI have made the engineers more efficient. “Worldcoin would not be possible without AI,” says Sada. Multiple machine learning models help power the guts of the Orb, and Sada says that the AIs have (in effect) begun to train other AIs, further supercharging their productivity.  And how do AIs train AIs?  “People think that we need a lot of data to train the algorithms,” says Sada. “Actually, what a lot of these models allow us to do [is] generate synthetic data.” Just as you can use AI image generator Dall-E to create an image of Luke Skywalker dunking a basketball in the style of Caravaggio – and it comes back in seconds – the engineers can use AI to create data simulations. “That allows us to use significantly less data,” says Sada. “That’s why we’re able, by default, to delete everyone’s [biometric and iris] data.”  I get the appeal of framing the story as ‘creating the problem here, solving the problem there.’ That’s not how I think about it  That brings us to the uncomfortable question that has dogged Worldcoin since its inception: Just what, exactly, is Worldcoin doing with these eyeball scans? As soon as Altman unveiled The Orb via Twitter in October of 2021, critics and skeptics pounced. “Don't catalogue eyeballs,” admonished Edward Snowden in a tweet thread. “Don't use biometrics for anti-fraud. In fact, don't use biometrics for anything.”  Snowden acknowledged that the project used zero knowledge proofs (ZKs) to preserve privacy, but insisted “Great, clever. Still bad. The human body is not a ticket-punch.” As my CoinDesk colleague David Z. Morris wrote, it’s “spectacularly and inherently risky for a private company to gather this kind of biometric data about everyone on Earth,” and that, by the way, calling the device the “Orb” – with heavy overtones of the eye of Sauron – is “creepy as hell.”  Blania, Sada and others from Worldcoin conveyed to me many, many times that the Orb is not collecting biometric data from the eyeballs, or at least not unless the user explicitly allows it. “Privacy is a fundamental human right. Every part of the Worldcoin system has been carefully designed to defend it, without compromise. We don’t want to know who you are, just that you are unique,” reads the company’s privacy statement. (That said, some data is captured if the user allows it. The default setting is to not capture data; users can change this and allow it to be stored, which Worldcoin says is used for the narrow purpose of improving its algorithm. Why users would go out of their way to enable this is beyond me.)  “The really cool thing, and the really hard thing,” says Sada, is that the Orb handles all of its calculations and verifications locally to vet that you are a unique human, and then it generates a unique “iris code.” Think of your World ID as a passport, says Sada, and all the Orb does is stamp your passport to say it’s valid. He stresses again that no map of the eyeball is captured. It’s just a code that says you are a unique human – not your age or race or gender or eye color.  (On the day of Worldcoin’s public launch, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin wrote a detailed blog post that interrogated its claims of privacy. He flagged concerns but gave it decent marks. “On the whole, despite the ‘dystopian vibez’ of staring into an Orb and letting it scan deeply into your eyeballs, it does seem like specialized hardware systems can do quite a decent job of protecting privacy,” he concluded. “However, the flip side of this is that specialized hardware systems introduce much greater centralization concerns. Hence, we cypherpunks seem to be stuck in a bind: we have to trade off one deeply-held cypherpunk value against another.”)  Once users have their WorldID – which Worldcoin insists is privacy-preserving – it can be used, in the future, as a sort of skeleton key to access other apps and websites, such as Twitter or ChatGPT. They’re already dabbling with this functionality. WorldID recently announced integration with Okta, a German identity and access management provider, and more partnerships are in the works.  WorldID is a form of self-sovereign identity (I did a deep-dive on SSID a while back), which is itself a holy grail for many in the Web3 space. In the rosy and best case scenario, the Orb could enable the scaling of SSID and UBI to billions of people – wresting online “identity” from the centralized corporate titans – and help give poorer, marginalized communities greater access to financial empowerment. That’s the vision.  Read more: Ethereum’s Buterin Expresses Concerns Over Sam Altman’s Worldcoin  But who pays for this? The way the system is currently configured, once you’ve signed up for the Orb, every week you can claim 1 worldcoin. That’s the early kernel of UBI. Who’s footing the bill for this token that will suddenly appear in the wallets (or eyeballs) of everyone on the planet? On the one hand, sure, there’s precedent for cryptocurrency that enters the world as if by magic, and then eventually accrues value. Exhibit A: Bitcoin. Then again, part of bitcoin’s value proposition is that it’s scarce, with a capped supply of 21 million.  The tokenomics  The tokenomics of Worldcoin are fuzzier.  Jesse Walden, an early investor in the project and general partner at Variant, acknowledges that “who pays” is a good question to ask, but says “I don’t know that there’s a single definitive answer right now, or that there needs to be.” The way he sees it, “Most startups don’t have a business model figured out at the beginning,” and they typically focus on growth, and the growth of the network eventually begets use cases and value.  Altman has a more pragmatic answer. In the short term, Altman says, “The hope is that as people want to buy this token, because they believe this is the future, there will be inflows into this economy. New token-buyers is how it gets paid for, effectively.” (If you’re feeling less charitable, you could view that as just another flavor of “Number Go Up” crypto speculation.)  The long-term and grander vision, of course, is that the fruits of AGI will confer financial rewards that can be bestowed upon humanity. (Hence the name of Worldcoin’s parent company – Tools for Humanity.) How that happens is anyone’s guess. “Eventually, you can imagine all sorts of things in the post-AGI world,” Altman says, “but we have no specific plans for that. That’s not what this is about, at this phase.”  The world is going to get driven forward. As the world gets driven forward, the playing field shifts  There are few people on the planet who are better equipped to envision a post-AGI world than Altman, who sits at a curious intersection between these two AI projects. He’s arguably the most central player in the development of AI, and he’s now the co-founder of a project intended, at least in part, to serve as a check on the demons of AI. Although he doesn’t see it like that. “I get the appeal of framing the story as ‘creating the problem here, solving the problem there.’ That’s not how I think about it,” he says.  Here’s the way he frames it. “The world is going to get driven forward. As the world gets driven forward, the playing field shifts,” Altman says. “And there are a whole bunch of things that should happen, but it’s not like problem-solution. It’s more like a co-evolving ecosystem. I don’t think of one as a response to the other.” (I’ll be the first to admit that Altman can run circles around me intellectually, and he strikes me as earnest and well-intentioned, but I do find this answer befuddling. It does, in fact, seem like one project is a clear response to the other.)  I ask Altman the same question I posed to Blania in our first conversation: What does the world look like if Worldcoin fully succeeds, and everything breaks right? Let’s say billions of users have been onboarded and the financial gains from AGI are fairly distributed to all. What’s that future like? This is another way of asking, in a sense, what’s the point of all of this?  “I think we all just get to be the best version of whatever we hope for,” Altman says. “More individual autonomy, and agency. More time. More resources to do things.” He speaks quickly and without hesitation; these are ideas he’s been mulling for years. “Like with any technological revolution, people figure out amazing new things to do for each other…But it’s a very different, and much more exciting world.”  And the biggest risks and challenges to fulfilling that vision? Altman thinks it’s “premature to talk about the big challenges,” but acknowledges that OpenAI and Worldcoin “are a very long way from working,” and that “we have a mountain of work in front of us.”  That mountain of work includes rolling out the Orb in the field. And this is where things get dicey.  The field  The goal of scanning eight billion sets of eyeballs is almost hilariously ambitious. For perspective, it would be a daunting logistical challenge to give everyone on the planet a free handful of candy, even without any biometric strings attached. How do you reach remote areas? How do you safely transport the precious Orbs? How do you explain this complicated relationship between the looming powers of AGI and the need for UBI and the merits of cryptocurrency?  The pitch is essentially, ""Hey, get some free crypto!""  That message has been refined and massaged and nuanced over time, but that’s the basic hook: You can sign up for some free crypto, and this Orb is how we prove you haven’t signed up anywhere before.  Consider Blania’s very first field-test, which sounds like something out of a Judd Apatow comedy. At a park in Germany, Blania took the Orb and looked for people to approach. He spotted two young women. Should he talk to them? The Worldcoin team watched from a distance. (In the Berlin office, on his phone, Blania finds a photo someone took of the scene and shows it to me; it has the vibe of a guy at a bar, nervous, mustering the courage to flirt.)  Back in the German park, they were still in the early “bitcoin project” days. So Blania approached one of the women, he showed her the Orb, and he says that this can help give her free bitcoin. “The only thing this device does,” he told her, “is make sure you only get it once, but you get bitcoin and you should be excited about that.”  Read more: Jeff Wilser - An Orb, a Token and Money for Everyone: Worldcoin’s CEO on Crypto’s Most Daring Project  The woman had simple response. “Are you crazy?”  She opted not to get her iris scanned, but all was not lost, as her friend volunteered.  Blania says with a half-smile, “I think she just found me cute, actually.”  That’s not so surprising; Blania is a handsome guy. He’s also charming and intelligent and can speak clearly and convincingly about the benefits, nuance and raison d'être of Worldcoin (who wouldn’t be impressed?). But how do you scale Alex Blania? Perhaps if Blania could be cloned, he could personally onboard all eight billion people. (I humbly suggest “cloning” as another Sam Altman startup.)  But in our non-cloning reality, in the beginning, Blania and a small team just lugged the Orb around the streets of Berlin, showing it to people and trying to explain it on the fly. “This was literally the early playbook,” Blania says. “People would approach us, because it’s this shiny chrome ball and people would be like, ‘What the hell is that?’”  These were the early Orbs that spoke to the user in a strange robotic voice, instructing them to move closer or farther away or maybe to the left. (Since then, the team has made a flurry of inventions to automate the process.) The robot-voice baffled and amused onlookers, and sometimes they’d laugh and take Orb selfies.  Neo-colonialism issues  Less amusing were the early attempts to recruit users in Nairobi, Sudan and Indonesia. In April of 2022, MIT Technology Report published a 7,000-word feature titled “Deception, exploited workers, and cash handouts: How Worldcoin recruited its first half a million test users.” The writers argued that despite the project’s lofty ambitions, “so far all it's done is build a biometric database from the bodies of the poor.”  The blistering report chronicles a shoddy operation rife with misinformation, data lapses and malfunctioning orbs. “Our investigation revealed wide gaps between Worldcoin’s public messaging, which focused on protecting privacy, and what users experienced,” write Eileen Guo and Adi Renaldi. “We found that the company’s representatives used deceptive marketing practices, collected more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent.”  I ask both Blania and Altman about the damning reports. “The first big thing to understand is that this article came out before the company came out of Series A,” says Blania. He admits that’s no excuse, but emphasizes that the project was in its infancy and that since then, “literally everything has changed,” with tighter operations and protocols in place. “I cannot think of a single thing that was the same,” he says. The counter to this counter, of course, is that it’s the very possibility of mistakes like this – however well-intended the team – that make people queasy about sharing their biometric data.  Blania also bristles that the piece was framed as (in his words) “a colonialist approach of trying to just sign up poor people all over the world.” He says this is misleading, as over 50% of the signups, at the time, came from wealthier spots like Norway and Finland and European countries. Their goal was to test sign-ups in both developed and developing regions, in hot and cold climates, city and rural, to better understand what works and what doesn’t.  Altman sees the missteps as natural growing pains for any large-scale operation. “For any new system, you will face some initial fraud,” Altman says. “That’s part of the reason we’ve been doing this for a long time now [in this] slow beta period. To understand how the system can face abuse, and how we’re going to mitigate against that. I don’t know of any system at this scale, and at this level of ambition, that has no fraud issue at all. We want to be thoughtful about that.”  One of these mitigating actions was to change the way that Orb operators are compensated. There are currently between 200 and 250 active Orbs in the field, and roughly two dozen Orb operators who each hire their own sub-teams of on-the-ground helpers. In the beginning, Worldcoin paid operators simply for raw number of sign-ups, which led to some sloppy and shoddy practices.  Blania says that operators are now incentivized not just by the quantity but also the quality of the signups, and how well users understand what is happening; weeks after the Orb scan, the operators will be paid more if users are actually using the Worldapp. (The main way you “use” the Worldapp right now is claiming your one weekly worldcoin.) I spoke with two operators in Spain, Gonzalo Recio and Juan Chacon, who largely corroborated that new protocol. But whether this process is being tightly followed around the globe remains an open question.  I don’t know of any system at this scale, and at this level of ambition, that has no fraud issue at all  How can people trust that Worldcoin has really addressed the problems? Altman hears the questions, and he knows he’s unlikely to win over the skeptics. He doubts he has any answers that will satisfy, and he seems okay with that. He believes the more persuasive answers will come not from him or Blania or the company, but from the early users of Worldcoin. “You can go try to answer a bunch of questions and do all these things, but that’s not really how it works,” says Altman.  “What really works,” he says, “is the first million people, the early adopters, the people leaning forward – convince the next 10 million. Then that next 10 million is closer to the normies. And they convince the next 100 million. And those are really the normies that convince the other few billion.”  The policy and the future  In our very first conversation, Blania told me that if WorldID and the UBI of Worldcoin is fully adopted at scale, this would be “probably one of the most profound technological shifts that has ever happened.” If this is indeed the case, wouldn’t that create a new complicated set of legal, policy and even existential questions that governments need to reckon with?  As I finish up my session in the Berlin office, one final question keeps gnawing at me. It almost feels like the project is so ambitious, so wild, so transformative – at least in theory – that the Powers That Be haven’t fully considered the consequences. If humanity is compensated not by the sweat of its labor, but instead by the largesse from AGI, wouldn’t that represent a fundamental shift in the way the world is structured? And wouldn’t governments insist on regulating this? Assuming the answer is yes, how is Worldcoin tackling that question?  Blania leans back in his chair, stretches out his long legs and thinks for a moment. “This is obviously a major discussion point,” he says. “I’ll start with what’s top of mind right now. And what is top mind is actually way less sophisticated than all the things you just mentioned.” What they’re focused on, says Blania, is simply the basic meat-and-potatoes of regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Worldcoin is “very likely to be the largest onboarding into crypto the world has ever seen,” says Blania. “So if you don’t like crypto…”  Altman pushes back on the idea that policy-makers are clueless or have their heads in the sand. “I went to like 22 countries and met with many world leaders, and much more than I thought, people get this and are taking it super seriously,” he says. (It’s unclear if by “this” he’s referring to the particular ambitions of Worldcoin, or the broader challenges posed by AI.) “I’m now spending an increasing amount of my time not on technical stuff,” he says, “but on policy challenges.” Ultimately, Altman says that “For the world to get to a good place through all of this, it has got to be a two-part solution, of tech and policy together. And the policy part, in some sense, may turn out to be more difficult.”  Roadblocks from policy is one risk to Worldcoin. Not scaling quickly enough is a risk to Worldcoin. More missteps in the field, like the ones highlighted in the MIT Technology Report, pose another risk. Or a potential breach of iris data. Or a failure of the tokenomics. Or an erosion of trust that kneecaps future signups. Or logistical challenges for bringing the Orb into trickier corners of the world. Or tech and manufacturing glitches. Or revelations that the Orbs have somehow been compromised. (As Buterin noted, “the Orb is a hardware device, and we have no way to verify that it was constructed correctly and does not have backdoors.”)  Or, maybe Worldcoin is never worth more than a few pennies, so no one cares. There are many, many risks on the impossibly long road to Worldcoin’s widespread adoption, and the project remains a moonshot.  But the biggest risk, as the company’s braintrust sees it, is not a risk about Worldcoin itself. The most chilling risk, to them, is that something like a biometric WorldID will be developed, only not in a way that’s open or privacy-preserving.  Altman’s original logic, which he articulated well before ChatGPT went mainstream, remains compelling: Eventually AI will get so good that it can easily pretend to be human, so we’ll need a way to prove our humanity. Perhaps biometric proof is inevitable. Who should be the stewards of that solution? “Something like WorldID will need to happen,” says Blania. “You will need to verify yourself online. Something like that will happen. And the default path is that it’s not online by nature, it’s not privacy-preserving and it’s fragmented by government and countries.”  That non-privacy version of biometric vetting, to Blania, is the real Black Mirror episode. “That’s the default path,” he says. “I think Worldcoin is the only other path there is.”",POSITIVE,WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | WLD,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/the-untold-story-of-worldcoins-launch-inside-the-orb,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e316d6db764a3f78a903827bc35e73111f90afd-1509x1135.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392977,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEI9d,1690214060,"Crypto Investors Sour on Bitcoin Funds After Massive Inflows, Turn Instead to Ether and XRP","Bitcoin (BTC) investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, bucking the trend of consecutive weeks of massive inflows as investors instead favored funds focusing on smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) and Ripple’s XRP, crypto asset manager CoinShares reported Monday.  Digital asset funds overall witnessed weekly outflows of $6.5 million after gaining $742 million of inflows through the previous four weeks.  The trend reversal came as BTC investors have seemingly run out of positive news to bid on after some major catalysts in recent weeks. Global asset management giant BlackRock filed for a long-coveted spot BTC exchange traded fund on June 15, followed by a swarm of competitors renewing their applications. The BlackRock news spurred investors to pile money into BTC-focused investment funds over the next month at the fastest pace since October 2021.  XRP’s partial court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month sent BTC’s price to a fresh yearly high, before its price quickly reverted below $30,000. The ruling, however, improved investor confidence in altcoins – alternative crypto assets to BTC – which was underscored by positive fund flows through last week.  ETH-focused investment products enjoyed the largest inflows among all cryptocurrencies, totaling $6.6 million. The growth suggests that “sentiment, which has been poor this year, is beginning to turn around” for the second largest crypto asset, noted James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.  XRP funds experienced $2.6 million of inflows, totaling $6.8 million, or 8% of all assets under management inflows, over the last 11 weeks. “This implies investors are increasingly confident in the outlook for XRP,” Butterfill said.  Funds holding smaller altcoins such as Solana’s SOL, UniSwap’s UNI and Polygon’s MATIC witnessed positive flows of $1.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/24/crypto-investors-sour-on-bitcoin-funds-after-massive-inflows-turn-instead-to-ether-and-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66405894ef0055465769f7ff0b925ea25b159001-2130x1200.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But the story is different with the new project Uwerx, which has traders buying in bulk even though it has yet to launch. Uwerx is having a successful presale, to the amazement of its developers and the benefit of early investors. Having smashed through its first four stages in less than two months, analysts believe Uwerx will make a better investment than Open Campus (EDU) and Conflux (CFX). Open Campus (EDU) Sees An Downward Trend Open Campus (EDU) has reached a wider audience since it partnered with Animoca Brands to launch the Web3 Global Educators Fund. This has translated to an increase in the number of members joining the Open Campus (EDU) community. Additionally, the project's Publisher NFTs have become a favorite among educators and content creators as it gives them the means to earn revenue for their work. Despite the increase in Open Campus (EDU) adoption, the project has not risen in price in the last seven days. Open Campus trades at $1.00, representing a -13.84% decrease in the last seven days. Analysts predict it to trade at $2.07 by the first quarter of 2024 Conflux (CFX) Rises In The Last 24hrs The past 24hrs have been good to Conflux (CFX). The project trades at $0.24, representing a 9.37% increase within 24 hours. Although this current price represents a -23.55% decrease in the last seven days, Conflux (CFX) holders believe this could be the start of the project's bull run. Conflux (CFX) announced on June 2 via Twitter that it has partnered with Code4arena. This collaboration will provide enhanced security for both ecosystems. Following the partnership, the Conflux (CFX) team announced on June 6 that they were aware of the recent cross-chain irregularity in their ecosystem. They assured users they had taken preventive action by removing Multichain's co-mint rights. This will ensure the security of user assets. The project also stated that they had not detected any loss, and the ecosystem was functioning as usual. With more partnerships and improvements, analysts believe the CFX token could increase to $0.31 by the end of this year. Join The Future Of Decentralized Freelancing With Uwerx (WERX) According to a 2022 statistic from Velocity Global, at least 36% of the American workforce freelances. This suggests a need to bring new ideas and innovations to the freelance industry. Uwerx is entering the cryptocurrency market as a much-needed innovation that will revolutionalize the gig economy. It will offer unique benefits to freelancers, such as a minimal 1% transaction fee, fast payments, intellectual property rights protection, and more. Still on presale, Uwerx is already making significant strides and attracting investors' attention. Uwerx is currently valued at $0.05245 in its ongoing fifth presale stage. However, analysts see the project growing exponentially in the coming months. They predict the WERX token to rise above $2.6 by Q4 2024. Uwerx takes the security of investors' funds seriously. The project has received audits from InterFi Network and SolidProof, ensuring top-tier protection. It also implemented a 25-year lock on developers' liquidity tokens on June 7, 2023. Additionally, Uwerx released the Alpha version of its platform on May 19, 2023. This version features a Landing page, Sign-up page, Login page, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation process pages. All these features will lead to the rollout of the platform's Beta version, enabling users to test and experience the platform. User feedback is expected and can be sent to the email: feedback@uwerx.network. The Uwerx Vault is another fantastic feature of Uwerx. Launched in April 2023, this feature allows users to store their WERX tokens for various lengths of time. Users will also earn rewards for using the Vault. Uwerx's presale will end on July 31, 2023, so investors are advised to take advantage of the current low price to join the community before Uwerx launches into the coin market. The Uwerx team pays attention to the community's needs and makes adjustments to solve those needs. The developers recently asked the community to vote on a test airdrop. 98.2% of respondents voted in favor of the test airdrop, which the team believes will enable users to verify their receiving wallet addresses. They will also relinquish smart contract ownership of the project, which will take effect once it lists on centralized exchanges. These moves have increased investors' confidence in the project and have made them believe that Uwerx could be a prominent project in the coin market by the end of this year.

15247872,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544058,1690212638,Chainlink (LINK) Holds Above 14% Gains As Crypto Market Slumps Heavily,"Following a correction in the crypto market, several coins, including the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, have surrendered their weekly-accumulated gains. However, amid the massive depression, Chainlink (LINK) held more than 14% in the weekly chart. Does the off-chain data aggregator’s remarkable resilience despite the bearish outlook depict a market decoupling, or is something sustaining it? Chainlink Price Stronger As More Ecosystem Developments Unfold Last week, Chainlink launched the much anticipated cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon mainnets. According to the official announcement, leading DeFi protocols in lending and derivatives, including Synthetix, have adopted the CCIP. Related Reading: Here’s Why Shiba Inu Burns Do Not Impact SHIB Price Synthetix is now live in the CCIP mainnet, while BGD Labs (Aave) have integrated it into their protocols. Chainlink’s CCIP seeks to address the complexity associated with cross-chain solutions and offers enhanced security to mitigate risks of exploits. The CCIP has several use cases: cross-chain tokenized assets, cross-chain collateral, cross-chain liquid staking, cross-chain NFT minting, cross-chain gaming, and account abstraction. It also allows for cross-chain data storage and computation. This development is a major milestone for the Chainlink network and increases LINK token utility. As such, LINK’s recent bullish price moves are not farfetched. Chainlink Bullish Price Movement Suggests Potential Rallies Underway Chainlink added notable gains in the last seven days as its price increased over 27% from its value seven days ago (July 19) before the latest downtrend. LINK traded at $6.5286 on July 19 with its price increase nearly neutral, with stiff resistance at the $6 price level. However, LINK witnessed a sharp surge on July 20 following the news that Aave (BGD Labs) and Synthetix launched Chainlink’s cross-chain governance, CCIP. LINK’s price spiked from $6.8559 to approximately $8.04 during this time, a 17% increase. The rally continued, with LINK hitting a week-high of $8.3358 on July 21. Although it met a few pullbacks between July 22 and 23, LINK remained above $8 until today’s market-wide correction. The token’s price has declined over 4.94% in the last 24 hours, with a bearish momentum that snatched some gains garnered over the week. However, LINK remains bullish as its current price is over 14% higher than its value seven days ago. Nonetheless, Chainlink maintains a bullish trading activity, with a 27 % increase in 24-hour trading volume. It suggests today’s bearish outlook has not waned Chainlink’s network activity. Moreover, LINK’s relative strength index is 60, below the overbought region (70), suggesting potential rallies are underway as more buyers join the market. Related Reading: Litecoin Halving: An Opportunity For Growth Or A Setup For A Sell-Off? The daily chart shows LINK met stiff resistance at $7.628. However, the ongoing buying activity may succeed in spinning LINK off the $7.628 resistance price level, facilitating a push above $8.408 in the coming days.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), of course, took the spotlight, with funds tracking the token posting $13M of outflows. Still, short-bitcoin products experienced outflows for the 13th straight week totaling $5.5M. It appears investors are starting to favor ethereum ( ETH-USD ) over bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), seeing $6.6M of inflows, CoinShares said in a Monday report. The turnaround in ETH sentiment could be driven by a U.S. judge's ruling earlier this month that Ripple Labs' crypto asset XRP ( XRP-USD ) can be considered a commodity in some cases. Over the last 11 weeks, XRP ( XRP-USD ) saw inflows of $6.8M, implying ""investors are increasingly confident in the outlook for XRP,"" the report said . Looking at price action, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ticked down 0.3% this past week, while ether ( ETH-USD ) slipped 1.7% as seen in this chart . The tokens have been trading in narrow price ranges since the end of June, as investors await the next big catalyst: the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday. ""Despite a cautious attitude of investors in the short term, especially due to the rate hike expectations at the forthcoming FOMC meeting, the analysed metrics concerning BTC and ETH suggest a period of accumulation, with investors that are buying digital assets and holding for a long period looking for a price increase in the long run,"" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.

42392966,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEHFD,1690209819,Ethereum’s Buterin Expresses Concerns Over Sam Altman’s Worldcoin,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released a new blog post on Monday detailing his concerns over OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s new crypto project, Worldcoin, which launched its mainnet this week.  In the post, Buterin highlights four major concerns with Worldcoin’s user authentication system, called “Proof-of-Personhood” (PoP).  Worldcoin claims it can authenticate its users without storing personal data or relying on a central authority. To obtain a “World ID,” users must scan their iris with a device known as an “Orb.” Compatible apps, like Worldcoin’s own wallet application, can leverage Worldcoin’s network of authenticated users to tailor their services and root out bots.  In his blog post, Buterin argues that this system has potential issues with privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security.  Read more: Worldcoin Releases Tokenomics, Report Geofenced for Some Countries  Buterin argues first that scanning one's iris could potentially release more information than intended. For instance, if someone else scans a World ID holder's iris, they can run it against the Worldcoin database to determine – at the very least – whether that person is in the system. In addition, Buterin says World IDs won’t be readily accessible to everyone, since getting ahold of an “Orb” device can be difficult.  Furthermore, the “Orb” is a hardware device, and Buterin alleges that “we have no way to verify that it was constructed correctly and does not have backdoors.” He adds that “the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.”  Finally, Buterin expresses security concerns with Worldcoin given that users' phones could be hacked, and they could be coerced into giving out their iris scans.  Buterin acknowledges that there is no perfect solution to overcoming these issues. “There is no ideal form of proof of personhood,” Buterin writes. “Instead, we have at least three different paradigms of approaches that all have their own unique strengths and weaknesses.” Those three approaches are known as social-graph-based, general-hardware biometric, and specialized-hardware-biometric solutions (like Worldcoin).  Buterin also adds that Worldcoin has taken certain steps with its hardware that make it superior to more traditional identification schemes – particularly when it comes to user privacy.

15246499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543955,1690209015,"Bitcoin Sharks Continue Accumulation, But Whales Stagnate","On-chain data shows the number of Bitcoin sharks has continued to increase recently, but the whale count on the network has hit stagnation. Bitcoin Sharks Have Continued To Go Up In Number Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the number of whales on the Bitcoin blockchain has observed a slight decline during the last couple of months. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures the total number of addresses that belong to each of the wallet groups on the network. The addresses are divided into these “wallet groups” on the basis of the total amount of BTC that they are carrying in their balances right now. In the context of the current discussion, there are four such cohorts that are of interest: 0-0.01 coins, 0.01-1 coins, 1-100 coins, and 100+ coins. Naturally, an address belonging to any of these groups would have its balance inside the range of the group in question. So if the Supply Distribution is applied to these cohorts, it would tell us (among other things) the total number of addresses on the chain that satisfy the respective conditions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for each of these four cohorts since the start of the year: Looks like only one of these metrics has continued to constantly grow in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter The first of these groups, the 0-0.01 coins range, signifies the small retail holders of the market. From the above graph, it’s visible that these investors haven’t changed in number much lately as their Supply Distribution curve has been moving sideways over the past seven weeks. This would suggest that adoption among small investors isn’t rising for the cryptocurrency at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Reach $175,000 If Prices Break Above This Rising Channel, Trader Claims The second group of relevance (0.01-1 BTC) has also been moving flat recently, showing that retail investors as a whole have hit a state of stagnation on the network. Unlike these cohorts, though, the indicator’s value for the 1-100 coins group, which is sometimes popularly referred to as the “sharks,” has only continued to climb higher in the past few months. This would imply that these decently-sized holders are still interested in buying the cryptocurrency, which could be a positive sign for the asset’s rally. While the sharks may hold some influence in the market due to the size of their holdings, they don’t hold nearly as much power as the largest cohort in the market: the whales. These humongous investors with 100+ BTC can move around a large amount of coins on the network, and thus, can cause noticeable ripples in the market. Due to this reason, these holders’ behavior may be considered the most important to watch. As displayed in the graph, the number of whales on the network has observed a decline during the last couple of months, although the degree of the downtrend hasn’t been too much. Nonetheless, one fact remains: they haven’t been accumulating recently.

42392976,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEI4V,1690207271,"Bitcoin Drops to $29K Amid Binance Story, China Woes; XRP, SOL Lead Altcoin Slump","Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below $29,000 Monday for the first time in more than a month after the Wall Street Journal said Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao suggested in a private conversation that the crypto exchange's affiliates had conducted wash trading several years ago, and China's policymakers warned of a tortuous economic recovery while falling short of announcing large-scale stimulus.  The top cryptocurrency by market value fell more than 2.5% to around $29,000 between 9:30 UTC and 10:00 UTC shortly after the Wall Street Journal published its report, and dipped to as low as $28,872 later during the day, CoinDesk data show. Then, BTC recovered and changed hands at around $29,100.  Major alternative cryptocurrencies — altcoins — also dropped through the day, with Ripple's XRP and Solana's SOL leading the fall. SOL plummeted 6.8% over the last 24 hours, while XRP declined 6.2%.  Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization, fell 2.1% over the same period and traded at around $1,840.  Popular dog-themed memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) defied the struggles of the broader cryptocurrency market, jumping as much as 5% before paring some of the gains, CoinDesk reported. Elon Musk-owned social media platform Twitter started to rebrand Monday to X, part of Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) firm X.AI, while Musk added DOGE to his bio, prompting speculation about the token's role in the platform's future.  Worldcoin, the crypto project of Sam Altman, founder of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI, went live Monday with its mainnet launch. Its native token WLD gained some 38% until press time as major exchanges enabled trading with the asset. The CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the performance of a basket of digital assets, was down near 3% in a day.  Cryptos' stodgy performance veered from major U.S. equity indexes, which rose on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, edging up 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to continue its longest winning streak in six years. Digital assets and stocks have increasingly decoupled this year after largely correlating previously.  Report on Binance.US issues  The WSJ published a report Monday saying Zhao said in an internal message that the exchange's affiliates may have been responsible for trading $70,000 worth of bitcoin on Binance.US' debut in 2019.  ""That was ourself, I think,"" Zhao said in an internal message, according to the Journal. Wash trading refers the process of artificially inflating transaction volumes by trading with yourself or an affiliated entity.  Early last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a wide-ranging lawsuit against Binance for violating securities law and alleging that it used Sigma Chain, a company headed by CZ, to manipulate the volume. The U.S. banned wash trading in traditional markets in 1936.  A spokeswoman for Binance, which was founded by Zhao, told the newspaper that neither the company nor Zhao has engaged in or tolerated wash trading. Binance dismissed wash trading allegations in an email to CoinDesk.  “Binance does not engage in or tolerate wash trading, which is a violation of our terms of use, nor has it ever done so. Binance has a dedicated Market Surveillance team that is responsible for reviewing surveillance related to potential abusive and/or manipulative behavior including wash trades and trade price manipulation. The Market Surveillance team utilizes surveillance models and a team of experienced surveillance professionals to detect and prevent market abuse,"" Binance's spokesperson said.  The WSJ's report also said Binance's representative dismissed the SEC's charge as unfounded. Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Thus, regulatory uncertainty surrounding Binance tends to weigh on crypto prices.  China's economic woes  Around the same time, China's ruling Communist Party's 24-member Politburo — its top decision-making body, led by President Xi Jinping – said the country's economy is facing new difficulties and the economic recovery will be challenging. Early this year, analysts widely cited China's reopening of its economy as a major bullish tailwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Importantly, Politburo's readout published by the official Xinhua News Agency did not include large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus announcements.  China faces several issues ranging from weak consumer spending after an early boost following the reversal of covid lockdown measures, deepening deflation in factory-gate prices, and housing and real estate problems. As such, markets have been expecting a strong monetary or fiscal response from Beijing.  Bitcoin, often considered a pure play on fiat liquidity and the riskiest of the risk assets, likely fell on the back of China's growth concerns and the absence of major stimulus hints.  BTC eyes $27,000  The lack of positive catalysts in the short-term and usually muted summertime trading activity could result in a BTC price decline, analysts told CoinDesk.  “If bearish pressure intensifies, the next significant support level would be $27,000, the lower boundary of the rising channel from the November lows and the 200-week moving average,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, noted in an email.  “Bitcoin is beating a slow retreat at the moment as the price continues to trend down from recent highs,"" said Simon Peters, markets analyst at digital brokerage platform eToro. ""Although market dynamic in summer months can tend toward volatility with lower trading flows, the recent period has been remarkably calm for top crypto assets in the market.”  UPDATE (Jul. 24, 14:31 UTC): Adds Binance's response.

It’s the financial infrastructure of blockchains, especially Bitcoin. Global networks of distributed “trust machines” ensure decentralization and lay the plumbing for an open internet.  So here’s the good news.  Crypto mining is mostly profoundly healthy.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  A quick look at the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, a measure of the amount of computing power committed to running the network, shows a bountiful capacity with which to run crypto’s premier network. As of July 21, Bitcoin’s hashrate was 400 exahash per second, up five-fold from June 2021.  That said, in about nine months time, the entire economics of the mining industry will undergo a profound change, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. In April 2024, we will see the fourth Bitcoin halving.  Right now, every time a bitcoin block is mined the owner of the machine that mines the block is able to claim the coinbase transaction. The coinbase transaction consists of up to 6.25 bitcoin. These new bitcoins are how bitcoins are minted. After the halving in April, that 6.25 bitcoin reward will become 3.125 bitcoin.  Miners earn money through network transaction fees and through the block subsidy (i.e. the coinbase) – with most earnings coming from the block subsidy. And so the halving means that, all else equal, miners will lose out on 3.125 bitcoin worth (~$90,000) of earnings per mined block.  But the halving is hardly unexpected and it’s something predictable that miners can prepare for, based on their experience from three similar events. Although a big change, it’s a painfully simple one. And, we’ve known it was coming for years. Bitcoin was programmed with these halvings built in at inception and that will never change.  A cyclical business  While the mining industry is healthy now, it has been tough sledding over the last year or so. First off, Ethereum changed its protocol (from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake) earlier this year and so anyone that was mining Ethereum before lost a revenue source.  And then Bitcoin decided it was time for a bear market, which is plain bad for business (especially if your business is mining bitcoin). In March 2022, bitcoin’s price was $48,000. By November 2022, it was less than $16,000.  In 2022, publicly traded mining companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Bitfarms (BITF), Iris Energy (IREN), and CleanSpark (CLSK) traded down 99%, 85%, 91%, 92% and 79%, respectively.  Core Scientific even declared bankruptcy. CORZ is expected to come out of restructuring by September and is coming into an environment that should be more conducive to profitable operations.  But now miners are back to reporting healthy margins, especially those that have access to cheap energy like TeraWulf (WULF) and CipherMining (CIPHER), whose gross margins in Q1 2023 exceeded 60% (see below).  Anthony Power, a bitcoin mining analyst who writes for Compass Mining, thinks mining companies are going to be just fine. When asked in an interview if miners will survive the halving, he told CoinDesk “they survived the drawdown to [$16,000], so sure they can.”  “You also have to think about the spot Bitcoin ETF applications. If those get approved, just think about how much money will come into Bitcoin.” Power is referring to applications to the SEC from major institutions like BlackRock to start exchange-traded funds for bitcoin; ETFs have long been seen as crucial for getting more retail investors into the crypto space.  Power’s latter point is that miners won’t lose out on revenue if the block subsidy halves and the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin keeps going up.  The public companies have recovered nicely so far in 2023, effectively acting as high beta bets on the price of bitcoin. While bitcoin is up 75% so far in 2023, CORZ, RIOT, BITF, IREN, and CLSK are up 1,042%, 445%, 307%, 468% and 219%, respectively.  Environmental headwinds  Bitcoin mining uses energy and, given Bitcoin’s growth in the last few years, we now operate in a world where energy markets and bitcoin mining are intimately tied. The inputs to a mining operation are deathly simple: hardware and energy. That’s it. If you can get mining machines and energy at a good price, then you can run a profitable mining business.  Many have argued that mining is a way to improve energy grids, especially in states like Texas, since Bitcoin is supposed to operate as a “buyer of last resort” for energy and so provides utilities with some level of a predictable revenue source. Bitcoin miners participate in demand response programs (as do other types of businesses like supermarkets and hospitals), agreeing to help grid operators reduce stress on generators and transmission and distribution lines in exchange for lower electrical rates. This is in exchange for curtailing their energy use when demand for energy peaks.  Bitcoin miners are especially well fit for this because they can turn off their energy pull instantaneously. It seems like a win-win and bitcoin mining companies tend to point to this as a merit for encouraging Bitcoin mining. Take GRIID, a bitcoin mining company, which during Winter Storm Elliot last December used demand response to help keep power on for households in East Tennessee during rolling blackouts. The company reduced total energy grid demand by 32 megawatts.  “The 2022 and 2023 story is that demand response is working at scale. Miners have touted this benefit for a long time and now we have the track record to point to,” GRIID’s Chief Strategy Officer Harry Sudock told CoinDesk. “Operations across the board continue to scale capacity – just look at the hashrate – but the benefit to electric systems is undeniable.”  However, environmentalists argue that miners are using more energy than would otherwise be the case, and unnecessarily, and perhaps there’s merit to that argument, but predictable demand for energy should be preferred to outright wasting it.  Miners respond by saying that they use up energy that’s normally wasted. Take how miners are working with oil & gas producers to take off their “associated gas” (which is normally flared, or burned, on-site). Bitcoin miners set up in oil fields where natural gas is typically vented into the atmosphere because it is cost-prohibitive to transport it. Some bitcoin miners have set up operations at the oil fields and used that natural gas to mine bitcoin, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  A very mobile industry  This type of stuff is actually important because it illustrates something fundamentally great about Bitcoin mining: It can be done anywhere.  Like in, say, rural Kenya, which is what microgrid developer Gridless is doing. Gridless, a startup backed by ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has brought electricity to people in Kenya and Malawi who are otherwise excluded from the grid. They have set up hydropower microgrids and are mining bitcoin with the energy the people don’t use.  The regulatory aspect  Greenpeace is an environmental nonprofit and they’re not big fans of Bitcoin mining. And to bring awareness to how much they hated Bitcoin mining they commissioned an art piece of a huge skull urging people to come together to protest for a code change to Bitcoin so that it doesn’t require energy to work anymore. It didn’t exactly work as planned, since the Skull of Satoshi became an unintentional mascot and, ultimately, the code change would never go through. Bitcoin will always be a proof-of-work blockchain network.  The attention Greenpeace is giving Bitcoin is also coming from regulators and governments for basically the same reasons. China banned crypto mining in 2021 due to its environmental impact, although that lasted all but two seconds, and the White House came out swinging earlier this year proposing a punitive tax on crypto mining operations for “the harms they impose on society.”  And then there’s Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) who routinely critiques crypto mining for its energy use and even created her own “anti-crypto army.” She also has come out against the fraud and crime crypto enables, zooming in specifically on suppliers of fentanyl precursors.  Political grandstanding aside, most of the national rules targeted at miners don’t really exist. Where they do exist is at the state level, albeit not to a fatal extent.  “Arkansas is a good example,” Luxor’s Head of Content Colin Harper told CoinDesk. “Miners are regulated as much as they are subject to the same constraints as other power consumers. Of course there’s the moratorium on fossil fuel-based miners in New York, but really the over-regulation that some states have tried to push through have ultimately fallen through for now.”  Harper was alluding to Texas whose state Senate passed a bill which would have limited bitcoin miners’ ability to participate in demand response programs only for it to be shot down in the state House.  As for the U.S. losing its foothold on bitcoin mining with all the regulatory crosshairs aimed at crypto, CleanSpark’s VP of Mining Technology Taylor Monnig thinks the opposite.  ""I think the U.S. will actually increase its foothold in the mining space, even with regulatory uncertainty we continue to see companies scaling in the US at larger and larger scales. It will take time for the U.S. to fully understand the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, once that happens we will see even more expansion,"" he said.  The unpredictable aspect  The mining industry has many inputs which are more or less predictable (or at least, logical). That said, there are many potential unpredictable factors which could crop up and turn it all on its head. We’ve already touched on the price of bitcoin. That’s unpredictable – who knows what the mining world would like if bitcoin hit $1.48k or $148k or $1.48 million. But there are many other potentially unpredictable things.  Just take Ordinals, Bitcoin’s answer to NFTs, which have mostly been created on Ethereum. Ordinals were incredibly popular earlier this year and they ushered in a huge spike to miner fees for a few months. While the Ordinals spike in miners fees has mostly fallen away, there’s always potential for innovators to create new ways to use the Bitcoin network, creating new demand for the services that miners provide.  Mining is still a young industry, and it's ripe for change.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/through-it-all-the-bitcoin-mining-industry-looks-set-for-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/002164e01e6e945a581b5dc5cff32d94a664a135-4859x2733.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392990,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEVin,1690206605,How Miners Are Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving,"As Bitcoin’s halving date approaches, miners are already carrying extensive research and planning. They are studying previous halvings' effects on the Bitcoin network and analyzing how the cryptocurrency market reacted during those times, helping them understand potential challenges and opportunities.  The fourth Bitcoin halving is currently due to occur on April 16, 2024, where block rewards will reduce from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin, per block.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Anthony Power is a mining analyst at Compass Mining.  As a result, miners face double the energy costs to mine a single bitcoin, though they can mitigate these shortfalls by installing more efficient machines, managing their energy use optimally, putting aside cash reserves and hedging the risk on the financial markets.  Let’s consider how miners are preparing on these different fronts.  Efficient mining fleet  Bitcoin miners are looking to upgrade their hardware and software, with a number of North American Bitcoin miners making significant purchases of the most efficient miners available on the market to prepare themselves for the forthcoming halving.  Marathon Digital (MARA) purchased 78,000 units of Antminer S19 XP mining machines, the most efficient machine on the market today, providing close to 11 EH/s in hash rate. The majority of these machines were delivered in 2022 and have been installed and energized this year and will take their operational hash rate in North America to 23 EH/s by mid 2023.  In April 2023, CleanSpark (CLSK) announced a purchase of 45,000 Antminer S19 XP mining machines, once deployed, in Q3 2022, they will provide 6.3 EH/s of additional hash rate taking their total hash rate growth to 16 EH/s by year end.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) announced in June 2023 it had purchased 33,280 next-generation Bitcoin miners from MicroBT, providing an additional 7.6 EH/s miners to increase self-mining capacity to 20.1 EH/s upon full deployment in 2024.  Having control of your sites where the Bitcoin mining machines are installed is really important, as you really need to have control of when machines need to be switched on/off.  Cheap sustainable renewable energy  Energy represents the largest cost incurred in bitcoin mining is the cost of energy used to mine the Bitcoin and as it will continuously double every halving, it’s essential that miners are able to utilize the cheapest sustainable and renewable energy cost available. If they are not able to access fixed price energy contracts, they must have the flexibility in curtailing their energy use as the price rises and therefore becomes unprofitable to mine Bitcoin.  CleanSpark (CLSK) are already developing automation that allows for the maximization of uptime and firmware that provides them the ability to underclock and overclock as the situation presents itself, along with managing their power strategy in Georgia (GA), thereby placing them in a great position come the halving.  We have witnessed in recent months, a number of Texas based miners have been using energy strategies to increase their revenues. Riot Platforms has taken advantage of being active in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, supplying power when needed and switching off their systems to help balance the grid. It has a long-term power purchase agreement in place, enabling tit to keep the cost of mining bitcoin low. Through participation in these programs, during the month of June 2023 the company generated $8.4 million in power sales and $1.6 million in demand response revenue.  Build cash reserves  The previous halving cycles have shown that after the halving occurs and there’s more scarcity of Bitcoin, the price does not immediately increase, as one would expect. During the last halving in 2020, it took close to five months for the price of Bitcoin to gain an upward traction. It is therefore necessary for miners to build cash reserves and have a sufficient cash runway in readiness for the halving to cover the immediate loss in revenues.  Diversification  A number of Bitcoin miners have been recently diversifying their businesses and incorporating additional revenue streams. Hut 8 (HUT) announced in January 2022 that it had acquired the cloud and colocation data center business from TeraGo Inc, a data center business. Once complete, the acquisition will establish Hut 8 as a leading high-performance computing platform, providing unique positioning for the company within the digital asset ecosystem.  In June 2023, the company also announced a five year partnership with Interior Health Authority, British Columbia to support their operations by delivering safe, secure, and reliable colocation services from the company’s flagship Kelowna data center.  Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE) and Iris Energy (IREN) are also diversifying into high performance computing, cloud and artificial intelligence services.  Hedging techniques  There are now companies that offer their service to help mining companies hedge their risk, in terms of electricity cost and hash rate. This may provide an opportunity for miners to consider in the run up to the halving.  Summary  The points above are not exhaustive, but hopefully provide a clear understanding of the issues faced as these bitcoin miners prepare for the next halving.  In the event the bitcoin price increases significantly before the halving, readers can more or less ignore the first three points (because a rising price makes everything better for miners).

42392984,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEVJ9,1690206435,How Texas Became a Global Mecca for Bitcoin Mining,"To understand why bitcoin miners have flocked to Texas, it’s useful to think about ducks.  Or, more accurately, something called the “duck curve,” which is a way of graphing the balance of energy demand and supply throughout the day.  Imagine a graph with 24 hours on the X-axis -- from midnight to midnight -- and society’s net energy demands on the Y-axis. “The shape of that line graph over time, it looks like a duck,” says Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Chamber.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  The graph starts out kinda flat (like a duck’s tail), then lowers later in the morning (the duck’s belly), then rises again in the evening (the duck’s head). The point is that this balance of energy supply and demand changes throughout the day. We use more electricity at 5pm than we do at 2am. More solar power is available at 9am than at midnight. “One kilowatt hour of electricity generated overnight is not the same as one kilowatt hour generated in the morning,” says Bratcher.  Texas recognizes this imbalance. And, unlike most states, Texas has a power grid that lets the price of energy “float” throughout the day and across the state, reflecting the realities of that duck curve. Energy in the plains of West Texas, which have plenty of wind and solar power but not many homes or office buildings, costs less than in Houston. This sounds obvious and common-sensical, but the power grids in most of the nation keep the price heavily regulated and (relatively speaking) more or less constant.  Texas has an abundance of cheap renewable energy and the duck curve presents an opportunity for bitcoin miners. They can reduce their energy demand when supply on the grid is short, or they can sell excess power that they don’t need. The Texas power grid, called “ERCOT,” for “Electric Reliability Council of Texas,” offers credits to the companies that offers additional revenue on top what they can make in rewards from verifying bitcoin transactions.  “Bitcoin miners are unique in that they’re geographically agnostic,” says Bratcher. “They’re flexible on when they run. Flexible on where they consume power.” Miners are incentivized to set up shop where the power is cheap, which just happens to be where land and space is abundant. They can mine at night and chill in the afternoon. “Wasted power is cheap power,” says Bratcher. “Sometimes wasted power is free power.”  This is why ERCOT has lured bitcoin mining companies like Core Scientific, Genesis Digital Assets, Riot, and Marathon Digital into the state. The gold rush began when China banned mining in 2021, and while the pace has slowed the growth remains steady. “Mining in Texas definitely continues to grow. There’s continued investment every single day in the state of Texas,” says Adam Sullivan, the President of Core Scientific, which now has 70 full-time employees in the state, including its corporate headquarters.  Power, purpose and people  Texas brings other benefits. Sullivan says that when the company evaluated which states to invest in, they asked three core questions: 1. Are they welcoming to business? 2. Is it a stable power grid? 3. Is there a pool of labor? “Texas checked off all three boxes,” says Sullivan.  Genesis Digital Assets, a bitcoin mining company with five data centers in Texas, used a similar framework for choosing the state. Ankit Joshi, Head of North America at Genesis Digital Assets, calls it the “3 Ps” of Power, Purpose, and People. Texas has cheap power. As for purpose? “Bitcoin is all about freedom,” says Joshi. “And in my dealings with the utilities and the regulators, Texas is all about freedom. Texas is all about hard work,” he says, which is why the “whole Texas story” resonated with the company.  For an example of how the state can be friendly to business, miners can point to a recent piece of proposed legislation, SB 1751, which initially passed the state senate in April. The bill would have reduced miners’ incentives from the power grid, as well as end mining tax abatements. (This would have cost Riot alone nearly $30 million, according to one estimate.) After the bill passed the Senate, the mining industry met with politicians and made their case. “The regulators in Texas have been very open to working with bitcoin miners,” says Sullivan. “They recognize the benefits that we bring to the grid.” A month after the bill passed in the Senate, it died in the House and the miners rejoiced.  These “benefits to the grid” can be confusing and often misunderstood. “How voracious Bitcoin mining is messing with Texans,” reports The Week. From Bloomberg: “The notoriously energy-intensive industry's Texas operations can consume more than 2 gigawatts at their peak, enough to power about 400,000 homes.”  It’s true that bitcoin mining gobbles up an enormous amount of Texas energy -- about as much as the city of Austin. Texas miners would respond that these facts are not incorrect, but are missing the point.  Bratcher tries to put it in perspective. In the heat of the summertime, he says, Texas (in total) has a peak demand of around 80,000 megawatts. Bitcoin mining consumes around 2,200 megawatts, or about 3% of the entire state. This is a lot.  “Now that would be concerning,” says Bratcher, “Except for the fact that bitcoin miners are on whenever we want them to be, and off when the prices go high.” This goes back to the duck curve. In periods of peak demand -- like the head of the duck -- bitcoin miners can “give back” supply to the system. (This is not done out of charity or generosity; they receive power credits.) Thanks to this flexible system, says Bratcher, “It’s almost like the state of Texas has 2,000 megawatts of battery storage.”  Here’s how the battery concept works. If you have a normal battery, you can inject new supply into the system at your leisure, and by “leisure” we mean awful periods of peak demand, like when air-conditioners are blasting in a heat wave. But supply is just one side of the coin. If you have miners who switch off their ASICSs during that heat wave, you reduce the demand and accomplish the same goal.  A sharp observer might ask, “Okay, but wait. You’re saying that if they turn off their rigs, the bitcoin miners are giving back supply. But wouldn’t the grid be better off if the miners weren’t there in the first place?” Or to be more cheeky: The “battery” concept is like saying that if an arson leaves the neighborhood, they improved its fire-safety but probably shouldn’t be given a medal.  Bratcher is ready for this pushback. “That’s not accurate,” he says. “If that demand isn’t there in times of low demand, the generation won’t be there.” In other words, bitcoin miners are giving a reason for wind and solar power companies to operate in the empty plains of West Texas, at 2am, at the bottom of the duck curve. So bitcoin miners (by this logic) are solid customers for renewable energy when no one else needs the power, and then they “give it back” (for credits) when the system is stressed.  All of that said, the ERCOT grid does not have an infinite capacity to let miners flex-up and flex-down, and the state took steps to modulate the growth. In 2022, Texas began a policy with the impenetrable name “Interim Large Load Interconnection Process,” meaning, essentially, that future bitcoin miners would need to apply for the ability to flex-up and flex-down. That application process -- with tightened standards -- slowed the growth of new mining. Bratcher estimates that the state is still growing mining by 150 megawatts per quarter, “so we’re still growing, but not as much as in 2021 or early 2022.”  Bratcher estimates that 2,000 W2 jobs and 20,000 contractors have been created by Texas bitcoin mining. “The price and the market incentives are still there,” he says. “This is still a great place for doing business.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/how-texas-became-a-global-mecca-for-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fc9f359630b6c93f9b25c3520d8ab3d602f1a5f-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15245165,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543991,1690205444,Here’s Why Shiba Inu Burns Do Not Impact SHIB Price,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the second largest meme coin and has a special feature compared to Dogecoin: token burns. Hardly any other topic is discussed more frequently in the SHIB community (besides Shibarium) and causes confusion in the process. Everywhere you can read: “Billions of SHIB burned, this is what happens to the price”. But hardly anyone emphasizes that SHIB Burns basically have no significant impact on the price, at least not with the current volumes. Also, because the total circulating supply of SHIB of 589,346,914,631,298.1 SHIB is gigantic, large numbers can quickly create a mirage. The SHIB burn tracker, the most popular service for monitoring SHIB burns, has stepped forward to address the misconceptions and shed light on the factors driving SHIB’s price movements. SHIB Burns X Shiba Inu Price The expert emphasizes the essential role of demand and uniform investments in shaping SHIB’s price, rather than relying solely on token burns. Burning a substantial number of tokens, while seemingly impactful, cannot significantly influence the price without continuous and substantial token purchases to match the current buying rate. As the analyst puts it, “Burning 10 billion tokens in a week will not impact the price when there are far larger transfers being purchased daily and prices have just sustained.” Related Reading: How Did Shiba Inu Price React To 3 Trillion SHIB Investor Accumulation? The crux of SHIB’s price dynamics lies in the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand. Token burning can contribute to scarcity and reduced supply, but it is demand that imparts value to the token. As the burn tracker aptly notes, “A token can burn 90% of their supply, but if there’s no demand for that token, then it holds no value.” In other words, burning alone cannot enhance SHIB’s value; rather, it is the surge in demand coupled with decreased supply that can positively influence its price. The role of major holders, mainly centralized exchanges, also holds significance in the SHIB ecosystem. The tracker points out that “the top 100 accounts (excluding the burn address) for $SHIB hold near 400T of the token’s supply.” These major holders impact liquidity and accessibility for traders, influencing the token’s overall market behavior. While acknowledging the potential impact of token burning, the tracker urges caution against overemphasizing it as the sole driver of SHIB’s price success. Success should be evaluated holistically, and arbitrary price targets should not dictate a token’s journey. As the SHIB tracker suggests, “A token’s success doesn’t always mean reaching a specific price, like ‘$0.01.’ Many have their own price goals.” Instead, long-term growth and adoption, as well as continuous community interest and participation, should be considered as vital indicators of success. Related Reading: 2.4 Trillion SHIB Moved To Unknown Wallet: Bullish Wave Ahead For Shiba Inu? Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that SHIB is still in its early stages, while with Shibarium launch there is a huge driver coming for higher SHIB burns. As the burn tracker points out, “Crypto is still growing, and we’ve seen significant progress in terms of the number of crypto holders worldwide.” At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00000779, continuing the upward trend of the last few weeks (black line), even though the price has recorded a small loss of 0.8% in the last 24 hours.

42392997,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWIh,1690205083,Crypto Miners Are Pivoting to AI (Like Everyone Else),"Let’s start with a few basic facts. Fact one: Despite a recent rally, the price of bitcoin is still far below the bullish heyday of 2021, when many bitcoin miners bought their hardware.  Fact two: Much of the hype (and capital) in the startup space has shifted from Web3 to AI.  Fact three: Both cryptocurrency mining and AI development -- such as the training of large language models -- require high-end computer chips.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  Fact four: There’s a global shortage of these chips.  All of this poses a natural question. Are crypto miners pivoting to AI?  The short answer is that while most bitcoin-only miners are not, larger shops are exploring their options. “I haven’t thought about that or really heard of anyone doing this,” says an influential home bitcoin miner who goes by the alias Econoalchemist.  The reason is simple. Most bitcoin miners use specialized ASICs chips, such as the Antminer S19 Pro, that are designed for SHA-256 hashing (Secure Hash Algorithm). They are excellent at mining bitcoin but lousy for doing anything else. They can’t be repurposed. (Every bitcoin miner I reached out to said the same thing.)  The math is different for larger operations. While the actual ASICs can’t be converted from bitcoin to AI, the infrastructure that the companies have already built -- cooling systems, security, access to cheap energy -- can be used for an expansion into AI.  So they’re starting to expand. Applied Digital, a Texas-based crypto miner, recently announced a $460 million deal to host AI cloud computing in its data center. (Wall Street approved; shares immediately jumped 17%.) Iris Energy, another Texas-based mining company, announced an expansion and revitalization of its high-performance computing (HPC) data center strategy, which was generally viewed to mean a push towards AI. (Again Wall Street approved; shares surged by 21%.)  Skeptics might see this as a ploy to capitalize on a fashionable trend – like how in 2017, Long Island Iced Tea made the natural pivot to “Long Blockchain Corp.” But the companies view it as a way to reduce systemic risk. Mining profits correlate with bitcoin prices. So adding other services -- like hosting AI computing -- lessens the reliance on bitcoin.  “The business is looking for a diversified revenue stream. If bitcoin goes to $10k or $20k, we’re in a less stressed position, and can still act strategically compared to our peers,” says Josh Rayner, VP of High Performance Computing at Hut 8, which until recently had been exclusively a cryptocurrency mining company.  Hut 8 began its pivot early. In January of 2022, well before the hype of ChatGPT, Hut8 invested in five data centers and two cloud regions that could be devoted to HPC. Unlike the laser focus of bitcoin-mining ASICs, these data centers are packed with Nvidia GPUs that could perform a wider range of workloads -- gaming, virtual reality, AI, machine learning. And they still continue to operate bitcoin rigs. “Our core thesis is that we picture a world where mining and data centers and HPC workloads [used for AI] come together,” says Rayner, “and we’re starting to see that more and more.”  Back in early 2022, it occurred to Hut 8 that they’ve already done some of the heavy-lifting to service AI customers. “We have the staff. We have the compliance. We have the expertise to operate traditional data centers,” says Rayner. “Mining really goes hand in hand with that. You have a lot of the same synergies.”  Then there’s the pivot from Ethereum mining to AI.  When Ethereum switched from Proof of Work (which requires mining) to Proof of Stake (which does not), suddenly the ETH-mining equipment had nothing to do. And while the bitcoin mining ASICs can do nothing but mine bitcoin, the chips they used to mine Ethereum -- Nvidia A40s -- are more versatile. “They’re very capable of VFX rendering, of gaming, and they can do AI/ML [machine learning] workloads,” says Rayner. So the chips that once mined Ethereum have now been redeployed.  (Rayner clarifies that the old ETH chips are “limited in scope in what they can do,” and that they “come with low memory and low storage capacity.” But better to put them to use than to let them sit idle.)  So how exactly do the chips of Hut 8 power the development of AI? Here’s a real-world example. XYZ AI, a startup, wants to let people convert plain text to 3D imagery. They need to train their models using a massive data set, and that requires chips for extensive processing. If you’re a startup like XYZ, you can either purchase the chips yourself -- and chips are hard to come by -- or outsource the computing to a cloud provider like Hut 8. (It’s a similar model to parking data on the cloud with Amazon Web Services.) So XYZ is essentially renting out computing from Hut8.  In the future, this will allow XYZ’s users to type in something like “show me a sword that is dripping with melted strawberry ice cream,” and then magically see the image. Generative AI is just one of the AI categories that require processing horsepower. “There are a zillion of these specific types of applications that these chips are being used for,” says Rayner. “That’s why demand is absolutely exploding.” He cites medical technology, gaming, biology, and CAD drawing as other potential customers for Hut 8. Each of them “start with a big-data set, and that’s where model training comes into play.”  Mintgreen, a Canadian company that recovers heat from bitcoin mining and then uses it to harness power, is in the early “conceptual” stages of exploring an expansion into AI. “We’ve had questions from our investors about the possibility of a pivot,” says Colin Sullivan, Mintgreen’s CEO. Sullivan clarifies that this is still just theoretical and says “I need to investigate the economics deeper,” but he acknowledges that “down the road, it’d be wise to diversify into other computer-intensive electronics.”  That’s the key word here: diversify. For mining-focused companies like Hut 8, Applied Digital, Iris Energy, and potentially Mintgreen, the idea is not a complete pivot from bitcoin to AI, but rather creating a broader portfolio that’s more durable in a bear market. “We need to have multiple revenue streams,” says Rayner, “so that we’re the most efficient miner and can stay nimble and strategic if margins compress.” And “margins compress,” of course, is a euphemism for another crash in bitcoin prices. That could wipe out some bitcoin-only miners; for others, AI could mean survival.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/crypto-miners-are-pivoting-to-ai-like-everyone-else,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfea78edd09840fea6d4e50d429e4feaed3126b7-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What’s more, they’re fully portable and reusable, allowing users to slowly build up a strong reputation without ever revealing their true identity. Cheqd explains that there are many challenges around the issue of Web3 security, with crypto scams wiping out millions of dollars in user’s funds, creating massive distrust in online communities. According to cheqd, the best way to combat Web3 scams is to increase the trust and reputation of users, which is exactly what it’s aiming to do with Creds. It provides a way for individuals to confirm their personhood and ownership of assets such as wallets and user handles across multiple platforms. So a moderator on a Discord server could prove their status and role, without revealing their identity. A scammer would not be able to prove this. In this way, not only will Creds help to prevent scams, but they can also prevent impersonation-based attacks and the spread of fake news by malicious individuals. Cheqd’s idea with Creds is that users can build a verifiable reputation across multiple platforms and communities, with full control over which credentials they decide to share with which groups. Of course, a decentralized identity does more than simply improve security and prevent fraud. One of the most promising aspects of Creds is its ability to enable new kinds of gamified engagement for communities. By creating a reputation layer, projects can explore new gamification mechanics such as incentivized quests or “learn-to-earn” courses, where users are rewarded for learning and participating in forums and community activities. Cheqd’s Head of Marketing & Community Eduardo Hotta said Web3 organizations are very interested in becoming more community-focused. “As an example, it's preferable to have a smaller number of real active community members, or superfans, than to have a group with thousands of bots,” he said. With Creds, projects can prove they have viable, active and engaged communities and encourage people to build reputations within them. Cheqd notes that similar decentralized identity projects in the past have made use of NFTs and SoulBound Tokens with varying levels of success. Creds differ from previous initiatives because these tokens are completely private, revocable and portable, able to be used with multiple platforms and ecosystems. With Creds, all personally identifiable information is stored off-chain, privately and securely. This data is verified by decentralized identifiers on-chain and cryptographically signed to ensure trust. Creds are set to become a key aspect of cheqd’s mission to build a trusted data economy based on lending markets, preference data markets and others that put users at the center. Cheqd supports these markets with a cutting-edge payment network that prioritizes individual’s privacy. ""Creds offers a privacy-preserving alternative to the surveillance enabling tech of SBTs and NFTs where you have little control over your privacy, as activities and other information are written on the ledger making it public and immutable,” said cheqd co-founder and Chief Executive Fraser Edwards. “Creds are collectable, portable, secure and verifiable; it has all the best things that the NFT and SBT have with the addition of everything else they are missing.""

Slated for early August, the halving has attracted considerable attention from the cryptocurrency community. However, predictions surrounding the event are veering off the usual path of price appreciation to include a potential coordinated sell-off. Particularly, Renowned on-chain analyst, Ali Charts, has introduced a novel perspective to the halving discourse, with his theory that the much-anticipated event could turn out to be a “Sell the News” event. #Litecoin | Each time the number of new $LTC addresses surpassed 350,000 in the last five years, a significant price correction followed. More than 690,000 #LTC addresses were recently created, suggesting the upcoming #halving could be a “sell the news” event. pic.twitter.com/FBsokPgaYA — Ali (@ali_charts) July 23, 2023 Unusual Network Activity Sparks Sell-Off Theories According to Ali, the idea of a “Sell the News” event stems from an observed increase in new Litecoin addresses created on the network. In recent times, over 690,000 new LTC addresses have emerged. This surge is significant because historically, a price correction tends to occur whenever the count of new Litecoin addresses crosses the 350,000 mark, as noted by Ali Charts. This pattern suggests that the current build-up of addresses may precipitate a price drop following the halving, possibly due to a coordinated sell-off. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Purchase $59 Million Worth of LTC As Halving Event Approaches However, it’s essential to note that the crypto market, much like any other financial market, is driven by a variety of factors, making it nearly impossible to predict events with absolute certainty. A number of other potential outcomes, spurred by different market dynamics, could equally play out. Potential For Litecoin Price Growth Amid Deflation On the flip side, Litecoin’s forthcoming halving also presents the possibility of substantial price growth. This belief stems from the deflationary effect that halving will bring about, reducing the rate at which new Litecoins are created. Coupled with increasing demand for the coin, this could create an ideal scenario for price growth in the mid to long term. The nature of the halving’s potential impact has set the stage for an interesting dichotomy: a probable sell-off or massive accumulation. As users and investors gauge the possible impacts of the halving, it’s likely they will adjust their strategies accordingly, which could sway the outcome in either direction. Furthermore, the aftermath of the Litecoin halving event should provide valuable insights for the cryptocurrency community, particularly as investors prepare for the subsequent Bitcoin halving, slated for April next year.

42393004,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWsb,1690200115,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Starts Week in the Red,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is down to start the week, dropping to around $29,300, a decrease of 1.92% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the performance of the broader digital asset market, is also in the red, down 2.38% at 1,266.87. BTC’s trading range is still relatively narrow, reflecting the cautious stance of investors. “Although market dynamics in summer months can tend toward volatility with lower trading flows, the recent period has been remarkably calm for top crypto assets in the market,” Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro said. “The softening of the price we’re watching currently suggests investors are looking for positivity to cling to, but with little forthcoming for now it is very much wait and see.”  Elon Musk is rebranding Twitter to X, prompting surges in scores of X tokens as traders jumped on the potential opportunity to eke out some small profits. One token, related to a project that shut in May, jumped as much as 1,200% while the new “AI-X” token opportunistically issued over the weekend following Musk’s announcement jumped 10-fold. “Meme coins are huge parts of the crypto trading landscape, whether we like it or not,” James Wo, founder at crypto fund DFG, told CoinDesk at the heights of one such meme obsession. “While the biggest currencies like bitcoin and ether have very low volatility, it's only natural that traders will look for opportunities elsewhere.”  Worldcoin, the crypto project of ChatGPT founder Sam Altman, has gone live with its token WLD surging 62% to $2.60, according to data from CoinGecko. Crypto exchanges Binance, Huobi, Bybit and OKX have listed WLD, with spot trading of WLD/USDT, WLD/USDC and WLD/BTC available. The aim of the project, which raised $115 million in May, is to establish a decentralized digital identity system in order to preserve personal privacy. More than 2 million people were onboarded while the project was still in beta. WLD is not currently available in the U.S. owing to regulatory uncertainty.  Chart of the Day  The chart by Marex shows U.S. investors can express their bullish view on bitcoin either through long positions in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Shares or via long BTC positions in the spot and futures markets.  The long position in GBTC is often paired with a short position in BTC spot/futures markets when traders bet on narrowing the GBTC discount relative to the trust's net asset value. The so-called spread trade has recently become popular thanks to spot bitcoin-ETF optimism.  The short position of the spread trade puts downward pressure on BTC's price, according to Marex. If and when the discount evaporates, the spread will be squared off, putting upward pressure on bitcoin's price.

CoinDesk staff using multiple devices in Greece, India, Italy and the U.K. saw a message saying the content, part of the project's whitepaper, was geofenced, when trying to access the link. The company is looking into the issue, representatives said.  Further, the World App is ""at capacity"" and is ""experiencing high loads"" such that users might face disruption, a notice on the app said around 13.30 UTC on Monday.  The highly anticipated project had been airdropping beta tokens to users verified with its iris-scanning Orb for the past month or so. Beta tokens are closer to I Owe You's prior to the network launch, as opposed to on-chain tokens.  After updating the app, verified users can receive a 25 WLD ""genesis grant"" to their wallets. The grants only happen in countries where regulations allow for them, which doesn't include the U.S.  The token has seen major price surges in top exchanges, which rushed to list it.  One CoinDesk reporter was able to access the tokenomics site, and gathered some details. The site has since been unavailable on that device, but a Worldcoin representative confirmed these details.  WLD supply will be capped at 10 billion tokens for 15 years, at which point the governance of the network can decide to implement an inflation rate of up to 1.5%, as well as how to allocate the minted tokens.  At launch, the maximum circulating supply of WLD is 143 million, 43 million of which will be allocated to users verified during pre-launch and 100 million will be given in loans that will expire in three months to non-U.S. market makers, the firm said.  75% of the tokens have been earmarked for the community, 13.5% to investors of Tools for Humanity, 9.8% to the initial development team and 1.7% in reserve. The allocation to insiders has increased to 25% from 20% stated earlier because the process of developing and launching the network was more ""complex and costly"" that initially thought, as well as the challenging market environment. Investor and team tokens will be locked up at launch and slowly released after the first year and for the next two years.  All 7.5 billion WLD, which will go to the community was minted before the launch, and the foundation aims to allocate 6 billion of those to users, but they will be unlocked over 15 years, said a Worldcoin representative.

Fundamentally, the company has been a cash burner that raises capital through dilution. RIOT shares have worked well in the past as a Bitcoin proxy. But breakeven prices are eye-popping. In the world of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners there are three that stand above the rest in terms of exahash capacity; Riot Platforms (RIOT), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Core Scientific (CORZQ). Core is going through bankruptcy while Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms have seemingly weathered the storm of ""Crypto Winter."" Data by YCharts When it comes to 12 month performance, RIOT has done better than Marathon digital though they are roughly in line with each other year to date. What's important to consider is the difference in mining models. MARA has an asset-light model that utilizes third party hosting providers for infrastructure while RIOT is a vertically integrated business. In the latest Crypto Roundtable article published on Seeking Alpha in early July, I noted RIOT was my largest bitcoin miner position and provided some bird's eye rationale for why: I think Riot has the right mix of large Bitcoin stack, low debt load, and the high EH/s capacity. But to be clear, I'm not really sold any of these companies are great long-term investments unless transaction fees permanently become a meaningful portion of the block reward. In this article, I'm going to go a bit deeper into how I view Riot and how I'm personally playing my allocation to the company's shares. June Production In the company's June update, there was a noticeable decline in month over month BTC production. One of the major catalysts for the decline that was shared by the entire industry was reduction in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. Miner Rewards (IntoTheBlock) In May, transaction fees spiked due to the surge in Ordinals inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens. By June, transaction fees had returned to previous levels. Compared to other miners, RIOT's month over month decline in production by percentage was the worst in the industry: May 2023 June 2023 Change RIOT 676 460 -32.0% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 493 360 -27.0% CORZ 1,314 1,030 -21.6% MARA 1,245 979 -21.4% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 609 491 -19.4% Sources: Company filings, sorted by change In the table above, I'm showing the bottom five moves from a larger sample of 12 publicly listed miners. The average decline for those 12 miners was -15.8%. What's interesting though is the company generated $10 million in power sales and demand response revenue. June Operations (Riot Platforms) The reason behind this was record temperatures in Texas that resulted in a surge in energy demand. Riot Platforms was essentially getting paid to turn off machines to help stabilize the grid. This is interesting for a couple of reasons: It shows the company can be strategic with its resources when the environment demands it But it also shows the potential problem with the company's business model In the update, Riot noted the revenue from selling power back resulted in the equivalent of mining 361 BTC. Given Riot's $10.6 million in proceeds from 400 BTC sold, selling energy back to ERCOT was actually a more profitable business than mining and selling BTC at the market rate. BTC Equivalent Revenue Rev per BTC BTC Sales 400 $10,600,000 $26,500 Power/Demand Response 361 $10,000,000 $27,701 Source: Riot Platforms, Analyst calculation There are two ways to look at this. On one hand, it's savvy by the company to get the best return on assets that it can even when Bitcoin's price is struggling. On the other hand, if Bitcoin's price is struggling and there isn't high demand for power sales back to the grid, one could argue it makes more sense to just turn the machines off. Longing RIOT is A Levered BTC Bet Data by YCharts Riot simply doesn't make money at today's BTC prices. But not only does Riot not make money at today's BTC price, Riot doesn't make money at the all-time high of $69k BTC either. Cost of Revenue $211,200,000 Total Opex $348,200,000 Subtotal $559,400,000 BTC Mined 6,241 Breakeven price $89,633 Source: Seeking Alpha, Analyst's calculation Given the trailing twelve month operational expense and cost of revenue figures, Riot's breakeven price over the last 4 quarters was just under $90k per coin by my calculations. There are some who would say there is no way BTC ever gets to that level. I actually believe it's a possibility longer term. If the price ever does actually get to that level, it would also revalue the 7,250 BTC Riot is holding on the balance sheet closer to $650 million - which would be another source of revenue if the company decides to sell BTC holdings from the treasury. Data by YCharts At $3.2 billion, the company is quickly approaching three year market cap highs. It's also trading at 11x sales. Which makes it one of the more overvalued BTC miners by that metric. If we assume $90k BTC can eventually become a reality, RIOT is still trading at 5 times future sales at an approximate average of 650 BTC per month. Of course, this doesn't take into consideration capacity expansion plans or the potential for declines in monthly production in spite of exahash capacity growth as global hash rate grows. All this said, RIOT still theoretically works as a leveraged bet on Bitcoin because of the FOMO that comes with buying bitcoin proxy equities. These bitcoin proxies have a history of multiple expansion in bull markets and I suspect that would continue if/when BTC makes a new high post-halving. But the larger point is, if you're buying Riot Platforms as a long term investment, there's a long way to go before the company is a profitable business given the spending required to purchase and maintain mining machines. And until transaction fees become a permanent source of miner revenue to a meaningful degree, the booms/busts from halving cycles will continue to play a role in how these stocks perform. Risks Dilution. Since Riot Platforms doesn't go the debt route, it raises capital through shareholder dilution. This is common in the public Bitcoin mining space but there aren't many offenders that are as bad as Riot over the last 5 years: Data by YCharts Since 2019, the number of RIOT shares outstanding has increased by over 1,100%. This level of dilution is far worse than competing firms like HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT). Summary Is Riot Platforms a great long term investment? I can't say that. However, as a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, I think it works well so long as shareholders manage their allocations well and refrain from getting overexposed to the idea. To reiterate, the reason why I like RIOT over the other miners is because of the company's large BTC stack, low debt, and high production capacity compared to peers. But Riot Platforms still loses a lot of money and the tradeoff for the low debt load is shareholder dilution. Longing Riot Platforms is a levered bet on BTC. If one takes the view that BTC is going far higher than $30k in the years ahead, as I do, then it might make some sense to buy the shares in small increments over time to hedge against quarterly dilution. But the argument can quite justifiably be made that if you believe BTC is going much higher, then it just makes sense to buy and hold BTC directly or through an ETF/Trust instrument instead. Everyone's risk tolerance is different. And I think that tolerance needs to be high to play in the miner space. While I'm still long RIOT, I have not been buying this rip.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4619136-riot-platforms-my-levered-btc-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15241928.jpeg

42392993,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEVyB,1690194950,"Dogecoin Rises After Twitter Rebranding, Bitcoin Slides to $29K","Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped as much as 5% on the back of Twitter's rebranding on Monday. The memecoin bucked the broader market slide as bitcoin (BTC) slipped to under $29,100, during European morning hours.  Elon Musk-owned Twitter is in the process of rebranding to X, a part of his artificial intelligence-focused group of companies called X.AI. Musk added dogecoin’s ticker logo to his bio early on Monday, spurring speculation of dogecoin playing a bigger role in the rebranded company.  Meanwhile, some $30 million worth of longs – over 96% of all levered futures positions – were liquidated in a single hour on bitcoin-tracked futures, which may have contributed to the sudden decline.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin's drop led to a fall in several major tokens, with Tron’s TRX and Polygon’s MATIC losing 3.4%, while Solana's SOL fell nearly 5%.  Meanwhile, analysts said the lack of bullish news and a generally quiet summer may further weigh into bitcoin prices, with some targeting the $27,000 level.  “If bearish pressure intensifies, the next significant support level would be $27,000, the lower boundary of the rising channel from the November lows and the 200-week moving average,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in an email to CoinDesk.  The sentiment was mirrored by Simons Peters, markets analyst at eToro. “Bitcoin is beating a slow retreat at the moment as the price continues to trend down from recent highs. Although market dynamic in summer months can tend toward volatility with lower trading flows, the recent period has been remarkably calm for top cryptoassets in the market,” Peters told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  “The softening of the price we’re watching currently suggests investors are looking for positivity to cling to, but with little forthcoming for now it is very much wait and see,” Peters added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | MATIC,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/24/dogecoin-rises-after-twitter-rebranding-bitcoin-slides-to-29k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7b16d782400d9baeaa55b2631d90dfa5791c034-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15240698,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543952,1690193448,XRP Price Analysis: Bull Flag Flashes As Whales Hit New High,"Since the summary judgment in the Ripple vs SEC case, XRP has captured the spotlight in the crypto market. Now the fourth-largest crypto by market capitalization, XRP, is currently experiencing a consolidation trend. However, this could just be the calm before the storm as both the activity of large investors aka whales and a developing bull flag pattern suggest. XRP Whale Wallets Reach New Heights According to an on-chain data analysis by Santiment, a leading market intelligence platform, the number of whale wallets holding a substantial 100 million or more XRP has witnessed a significant increase recently, now standing at an impressive 199. These whales, each commanding a minimum value of $74 million, have been closely observed over the past year, exhibiting strategic buying and selling patterns that impact XRP’s price movements. Related Reading: SEC Potential Appeal To Yield Little Effect On XRP, Crypto Lawyer Says This recent surge in the number of whales is a noteworthy milestone, matching the highest figure recorded since May 13. The Santiment chart below shows in detail the distribution patterns of these whales over the past year. As of July 2022, when XRP was trading below $0.40, 200 whales were in accumulation mode. However, they sold when XRP exceeded $0.50 within three months. Similarly, whales resumed accumulation between December and March 2023 when XRP was trading at $0.41. In April, a larger number of the whales sold their XRP again, bringing the number back below 200. Currently, the beginning of a new accumulation phase could be imminent, as Santiment shows. Bull Flag Heralds New Rally The recent meteoric rise in XRP’s price following the Ripple vs. SEC summary judgment has led to the formation of a bullish chart pattern known as the bull flag. This pattern consists of two rallies separated by a brief period of consolidating retracement. The initial rally comes to a pause through profit-taking, leading to a tight trading range as buyers and sellers find equilibrium. Related Reading: XRP Sluggish: Unraveling The Factors Behind Its Gradual Weakening XRP investors have to keep a close eye on the crucial price levels of the bull flag that could determine the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency. To the downside, the $0.685 mark is critical, representing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Holding above this level is crucial for maintaining the consolidation trend. If the lower end of the range is broken, a deeper correction could be imminent, with potential targets at $0.64 and $0.59. To the upside, XRP faces resistance at $0.845. Breaking above this level could trigger another sharp rally, though it might require a catalyst, either from the ongoing Ripple case or the broader crypto market, to achieve such a breakout. The closest target would then be the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.93) where the impulsive rally following the Ripple ruling ended. Besides the psychologically important $1 level, the next bullish price targets would then be $1.13, 1.33 and $1.61.

The new high means holders own 75% of the circulating supply of 19.437 million BTC.  Circulating supply refers to the total number of coins that are actively available for trade in the market.  ""This suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors,"" Glassnode tweeted.  The rate of flow into wallets controlled by illiquid entities, or network participants with little-to-no spending history, also remains strong, suggesting continued accumulation and weakening of sell-side pressures in the market. The number of coins held by these illiquid entities has surged by over 90,000 BTC this month.

15239232,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/tfs-token-launches-a-new-liquidity-staking-feature,1690189419,TFS Token Launches a New Liquidity Staking Feature,"Willemstad, Curacao, July 24th, 2023, Chainwire Last year, the Fairspin platform launched two associated loyalty programs: Play To Earn and Hold To Earn. Within the first one, it is possible to receive TFS tokens as a rakeback; using the second one, it is possible to increase them thanks to the holding without any risks. Both programs have already shown outstanding results. Since its launch, $726,234 and $1,759 091,86 were paid to players in frames of the Play To Earn and Hold To Earn respectively. TFS Token team is pleased to announce another beneficial way to get additional income for TFS holders - the liquidity staking program. What is liquidity staking? Tokens and money, staked in such a program, will be used to increase liquidity on the PancakeSwap in the TFS-USDT pool. This will help improve the liquidity of the TFS token, thus strengthening its position on the market. The Liquidity Staking option is available on the Staking Programs page on the Fairspin website. Unlike the already existing staking programs, liquidity staking is permanent, which means if a user chooses this option, staking will continue until the option is not stopped by the user. At the same time, the reward from the liquidity staking can be withdrawn at any time upon the user's request. There is no obligatory minimum staking time to withdraw the reward as well as there are no limits on the number of withdrawing requests. How the reward is calculated The amount of reward depends on the GGR of Fairspin casino and the number of tokens in the staking pool and the user's multiplier. The user's multiplier depends on the length of your stake in days. Calculation formula: from 0 to 1 day multiplier *0.3 from 7 to 30 days multiplier *0.6 30 to ∞ days multiplier *1 The reward, in the end, will be equal to % of the GGR of the Fairspin casino multiplied by the user's share in the pool and multiplied by the time multiplier. If a user stakes tokens for 1 month and more, he will have the maximum benefit - a share of 0.5% of GGR. The request to stop liquidity staking can be made at any time. A user can request to withdraw the full sum or a part of it. The tokens will be sent to a user’s account immediately. In case a user makes a request to withdraw a part of tokens from the Liquidity Staking, the reward multiplier for the rest of the tokens in Liquidity Staking will go back to the initial level. About TFS Token The TFS token is the driving force behind Fairspin, one of the leading global blockchain casinos, that ushers in a new era of trust and transparency in online gambling. Built upon ERC-20/BEP-20 technology, the TFS token ensures immutable betting data, empowering players with complete access to their gaming history and rewards. With a limited supply and a focus on user rewards, the token introduces groundbreaking Play to Earn and Hold to Earn features, rewarding players for their engagement.

42392988,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEVOH,1690189362,Implications of Ripple-SEC Court Ruling for Wider Crypto Industry Are Unclear: Bank of America,"A comprehensive regulatory framework is crucial for mainstream adoption of digital assets and institutional engagement, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Friday.  However, a U.S. court’s recent ruling against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit against Ripple Labs does little to clarify the situation, the bank said. While the digital asset industry welcomed the decision, “Ripple’s XRP offerings were unique” and “implications of the rulings are difficult to determine.”  Ripple scored a partial victory in the case earlier this month when the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the sale of its XRP token on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts. However, the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws, the court said.  “The judge ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not constitute an unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts, but primarily because an initial unregistered offering and sale to institutional investors had already occurred that created a market,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Bank of America says it continues to differentiate between the trading of blockchain-native crypto tokens, for which regulations are still being established, and the trading of tokenized traditional assets including exchange-traded-funds (ETFs), repos and gold, for which the “rules are already established and trading volumes have already reached trillions of dollars.”  Rival broker Needham said the court’s ruling was positive for crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), as it should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.

X-Token Surges Following Musk’s Twitter Rebrand,"An obscure altcoin called the X token has surged by over 1000% following Elon Musk’s announcement that Twitter is rebranding itself to X.com. However, the token in question has absolutely no association with the rebranded Twitter or X.com, as it is now known. An Unprecedented Surge The X token is linked to an NFT marketplace that announced its closure back in May and registered a staggering increase following Elon Musk’s announcement to rebrand Twitter to X.com. The token, which was trading at $0.00002, jumped to $0.00025. According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s value has jumped by over 1000% over the past 12 hours. Most of the token’s trading volume is on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX). However, despite the massive surge, the token’s trading volume remains low, amounting to just $51,000. Is There An Association With Twitter? The surge occurred after Elon Musk announced an upcoming logo change for the social media platform. Following the announcement, users likely thought the token was related to the rebranded platform. However, the token was part of a project started by X, a decentralized NFT marketplace operating across several chains, and has no association with the rebranded Twitter. The X DAO is in charge of the platform’s governance, and users who have staked their X tokens can exercise their voting rights after obtaining the veX governance tokens. Twitter’s Rebranding Elon Musk had announced his plans to rebrand Twitter on Sunday, stating that he intended to retire the iconic blue bird logo that had been part of Twitter’s global identity since its inception. In a tweet, he stated that if a good enough X logo is posted, it could go live within 24 hours. Following the tweet, X.com began redirecting to Twitter.com, with Musk tweeting about the company’s rebrand to X. “Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds. If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make it go live worldwide tomorrow.” Musk had also sent an email to Twitter employees telling them about the change to X. He added that this would be the last time he would be using an email address associated with Twitter. While some users, specifically Musk fans, applauded the changes, long-time users of Twitter are miffed with the changes. Marques Brownlee, one of the most well-known names in tech, tweeted that he was still going to call the platform Twitter. Musk responded to the tweet, stating, “Not for long.” The platform’s rebrand is the clearest indication yet that Twitter is no longer the same social media platform purchased by Musk. Recently appointed chief executive officer of X Corp, which owns Twitter, stated, “Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square. X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, and payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.” Markets In Recovery? Apart from the X token surge, crypto markets remained dormant, with no major movements. The total market capitalization still stands at $1.23 trillion and has remained at that level for the past few days. Bitcoin prices had jumped over the $30,000 mark but have since fallen back, with BTC currently trading at $29,787. Most cryptocurrencies are firmly rooted in the red, with only a few exceptions.

The obscure altcoin is linked to Project X—a decentralized NFT marketplace that operates across various blockchain networks. To ensure community-driven governance, the X DAO plays a crucial role, empowering users who have staked their X tokens to obtain the coveted veX governance token, granting them voting privileges within the platform.

Twitter Rebrand Plan Boosts X Coin Price Over the weekend, Musk took to Twitter to reveal his ambitious intentions, announcing the retirement of the distinct blue bird symbol that has long served as Twitter’s iconic logo. The eccentric billionaire aimed to give the micro-blogging platform a fresh identity by changing its name to X.com. Little did he know that this seemingly unrelated move would significantly impact an obscure cryptocurrency.

Musk first tweeted about the forthcoming change over the weekend. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino confirmed the rebranding on Sunday.  “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities,” Yaccarino said. “Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”  In April 2023, when Musk merged Twitter into X Corp., he also registered X.AI Corp. as an artificial intelligence startup. The Twitter chief then established xAI, his own AI company to ""understand the universe.”  Scores of X tokens have now appeared on multiple blockchain networks. These included new tokens claiming to have a proper roadmap for the coming months as well as tokens that are seemingly pump-and-dump schemes. One of them jumped as much as 1,200% over the 24 hours even though its project shuttered in May, suggesting low-cap traders were buying just about anything branded X in an effort to eke out a tiny profit.  Newer tokens were issued by opportunistic developers over the weekend following Musk’s tweets. One – called “AI-X” and with a logo identical to Musk’s space technology company SpaceX – jumped 10-fold. Another, named ""Deus X” after a Musk tweet, spiked 2,600%.  Professional traders told CoinDesk that such euphoria exists because major tokens such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are enduring periods of low volatility, forcing some market participants to punt on meme coins and low caps.  “Meme coins are huge parts of the crypto trading landscape, whether we like it or not,” James Wo, founder at crypto fund DFG, told CoinDesk at the heights of one such meme obsession. “While the biggest currencies like bitcoin and ether have very low volatility, it's only natural that traders will look for opportunities elsewhere.”  “Meme trading is a risky way to try to seek excessive return, but when it pans out, the upside can be very huge.

Any responses or objections to the settlements must be submitted in court by the 3rd of August. A Resolution In Sight Celsius Network filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2022, and customers have been waiting in anticipation of the outcome of its bankruptcy proceedings. While the settlements that will allow the bankrupt crypto lender to return customer assets have been reached, they still have to be analyzed by Judge Martin Glenn at a hearing scheduled for the 10th of August. If agreed, the settlements will allow Celsius to conclude bankruptcy proceedings and see the long-awaited return of customer assets. Additionally, there is also a confirmation hearing on Celsius’ reorganization plan that has been scheduled for October. This means customers could begin to see the disbursements of their crypto and assets before the end of the year. Lawyers representing Celsius Network have argued that customers are owed no more than the initially deposited amount. However, users have filed several claims seeking additional damages for alleged misconduct by the firm’s former management. Unpacking The Settlements The first settlement addresses several claims related to fraud and misrepresentation allegedly committed by the previous Celsius management. Under the agreement, Celsius has committed to increase customer recoveries by 5%. Those account holders who do not want to participate in the settlement can opt-out and pursue individual claims against Celsius. Those who wish to remain part of the settlement will be eligible to receive a claim amount equivalent to 105% of their scheduled claim. This would also override any Proof of Claims filed earlier. “Any eligible Account Holder who does not opt out of the settlement will receive a claim in the amount of 105% of their scheduled claim, which will supersede and extinguish any related Proofs of Claim filed by such Account Holder. “ The second settlement addresses claims by customers that had funds locked in Celsius’ interest-bearing Earn program. Under this agreement, Celsius customers that borrowed crypto can receive a portion of their funds in the form of crypto assets. Furthermore, customers of the Earn program will also be compensated with shares of the new company that would be created once the bankruptcy proceedings have concluded. With these resolutions, it is hoped that impacted customers of the bankrupt crypto lender can have some restitution, along with a stake in the company’s future operations. Court documents state, “[...] creditors have agreed to support an amended Plan that will provide Holders of Retail Borrower Deposit Claims with (a) the option to repay their principal balance of their loan [...] in exchange for an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency (which could lead to tax benefits for such Holders as compared to the Setoff Treatment) and (b) priority in electing a preference to exchange the NewCo Equity for Liquid Cryptocurrency at a 30% discount [...].” What Comes After The Settlements Celsius is hoping to return user assets by the end of the year. The reorganization plan involves a partial return of crypto assets deposited on the platform. As compensation for the assets not returned, customers will receive shares of the new entity, which will be managed by a group of investors led by the founder of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington. The new firm will oversee the bankrupt crypto lender’s mining business and illiquid assets. SEC Action Against Celsius Despite the developments, Celsius is not out of the woods yet, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a lawsuit against the company and its CEO, Alex Mahshinsky, earlier this month. The SEC accused Mahshinsky and other Celsius executives of raising billions of dollars through fraudulent and unregistered offers and selling crypto asset securities. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also announced action against Mashinsky, issuing a fine of over $4.5 billion for squandering user assets and duping users. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022 after halting all withdrawals following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the resulting market carnage. Mashinsky, the former CEO, was arrested under criminal and civil charges and under charges of intending to manipulate the markets. However, he has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

15237165,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543930,1690183817,History Repeating? Dogecoin Monthly Chart Signals Massive Rally,"Dogecoin, the popular meme coin, is making waves once again. A recent tweet by renowned analyst Ali Martinez has made waves in the crypto community, hinting at the potential for a significant rally for DOGE. In a Twitter post that quickly gained traction, Martinez highlighted an intriguing pattern on the monthly chart of Dogecoin. According to the analyst, the last time a descending triangle formed on the weekly chart, DOGE experienced a jaw-dropping pump of 23,200%. Now, as history could repeat itself, Martinez is keeping a close eye on a crucial resistance for confirmation. As the tweet states: Dogecoin: The last time a descending triangle developed on the weekly chart DOGE pumped 23,200%. I’ll be looking at a sustained monthly close above $0.80 for confirmation. The journey for Dogecoin has been quite the rollercoaster ride. Back in January 2018, DOGE reached an all-time high of nearly $0.02, only to enter a prolonged phase of consolidation, forming the descending triangle over the next three years. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap However, with the onset of the new bull market, catalyzed by Bitcoin’s momentum, DOGE finally managed to break out of its extended consolidation pattern, surging to a peak of $0.7588 on May 8. Dogecoin Price Analysis 1D Chart Taking a closer look at the 1-day chart, it becomes evident that Dogecoin is now facing a critical turning point. Will the price manage to reverse its trend, or will it succumb to a continuation of the downtrend after a short pause of bullish activity? In the case of Dogecoin, the ascending triangle could signal a trend reversal. Since DOGE reached the local high of $0.1591 on November 01, 2022 as a result of the hype surrounding Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, DOGE has been in a clear downtrend. From November to mid-June, DOGE has written lower highs, lower lows on the 1-day chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 But since hitting a 13-month low at $0.0536 on June 10, DOGE has shown signs of an uptrend, forming what’s known as an ascending triangle. This particular pattern falls under the category of consolidation formations, usually indicating a continuation of the previous trend after a brief period of consolidation. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as this one, an ascending triangle can signal a trend reversal. As the Dogecoin community eagerly awaits the potential implications of this ascending triangle, it is essential to observe the resistance levels that lie ahead. Dogecoin must confirm the pattern by continuing its upward trajectory and break through the $0.075 resistance. This level has proven to be a formidable barrier in the past, as three previous attempts to breach it were unsuccessful. In the event of a successful breakout, the first hurdle lies at $0.0783, marked by the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Should DOGE surpass this resistance, a rise to $0.0936 becomes a realistic possibility, where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level is situated. Further bullish targets include $0.1036 (50% Fibonacci retracement level), $0.1186 (61.8% Fibonacci retracement level), and $0.1363 (78.6% Fibonacci retracement level). Ultimately, reaching the previous high of $0.1591 from November 2022 would be the most ambitious goal, although the potential for heightened selling pressure at that point remains a consideration. Currently, a drop below $0.07 would invalidate the ascending triangle theory. Should this happen, the first bearish target could be $0.0636. Then, the yearly low at $0.0536 could come into focus.

42393003,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWnT,1690181514,"Bitcoin Traders Cautious Despite Spot ETF Optimism, Leverage Indicators Suggest","BlackRock (BLK) filing for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) last month brought renewed optimism into the crypto market, pushing bitcoin (BTC) and related investment vehicles higher.  Still, traders in the perpetual futures market tied to bitcoin remain risk averse, unwilling to take on high leverage.  Data tracked by Glassnode and Blockware Solutions show the ratio of open interest in BTC perpetual futures to bitcoin's market cap has been locked in a narrow range of 1.5% to 1.7% in the past four weeks. The ratio remains well below the high of 2.6% seen in September last year.  ""It shows that there has not been a change in the risk appetite of futures traders, despite BTC holding the $30,000 mark for the past month,"" analysts at Blockware Solutions said in a newsletter on Friday.  ""Open interest/market cap ratio remains relatively low, which means that spot will likely keep driving the price higher in the short to medium term as supply continues to slowly contract into the hands of long-term holders,"" analysts added.  Perhaps traders do not see a bitcoin spot ETF as a game changer or worry about lingering regulatory uncertainty taking a toll on market valuations in the short term.  Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry. Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active contracts.  Leverage allows traders to open positions worth more than the money or coins deposited as a margin at the exchange. The use of leverage can magnify both profits and losses and exposes traders to liquidations – forced unwinding of bullish long or bearish short positions due to margin shortage. The higher the degree of leverage, the greater the probability that liquidations inject volatility into the market.  Another way to track the use of leverage in the market is by dividing the open interest by the value of BTC held in wallets tied to derivative exchange wallets. The so-called estimated leverage, popularised by South Korea-based CryptoQuant, has remained largely stagnant since June 20, a sign that the average trader is playing safe.  Low degree of leverage in the market means reduced price volatility. Bitcoin has been listless in the range of $29,500 to $32,000 in the past four weeks.

Altman is the co-founder of Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT.  The company ramped up expectations on Twitter over the weekend and Semafor first reported the news, although the launch was expected with an announcement going to the press under embargo.  A prompt to update the mobile app was shown to users on Sunday which blocked functionality in the app with the message ""It's time. Join us in the World App. July 24, 2023 11 am.""  WLD surged on crypto exchanges, adding more than 20%, according to CoinGecko data.  Developer access  Developers will now have access to the Worldcoin software development kit (SDK) to create tools and apps using the World ID, the project's identity protocol. In order to be fully verified, users must scan their irises using Orb, a tailor-made device that uses the scan to create a unique identifier, but doesn't process or store any related data locally, according to the company.  So far, the SDK has been available in beta mode, and verified users could have participated in four token airdrops.  ""Beta tokens will get converted and they [users that participated in the beta] will be able to use those however they wish inside of World App or take them out elsewhere,"" said Tiago Sada, head of product, engineering & design at Tools for Humanity, the startup behind Worldcoin. The token is based on the Ethereum ERC-20 design.  Asked about the token being tradeable, Sada said ""We'll see what what other parties choose to do. What we know is that there are certain features like some peer to peer concepts, that will be available from day one on the World App, and then everything else will be up to different people,"" meaning the developers who build with the protocol.  Biometric verification  The introduction of the token also means the project is finalizing its migration to the Optimism network, a layer 2 scaling option for Ethereum, and that Orb availability will be ramped up worldwide.  Up to now, some 200 Orbs had been made available, according to Sada. The firm plans to make 1,500 Orbs by the end of the year, and add the option to book appointments as opposed to pop-ups, Sada said. The Orbs are made in Germany, said Tools for Humanity's chief communications officer Rebecca Hahn.  Verification will be available in 35 cities in the coming months, and the app is available in 120 countries.  The Orbs have scanned over 2 million people: 32% of them in each of Asia and Africa, 19% in Latin America, and 17% in Europe, the firm said in its whitepaper.  The use of biometric data has raised eyebrows, but the company says it uses artificial intelligence to create unique codes to represent the scans and complies with ""very, very local and very specific rules and regulations in each of the markets where there's an Orb,"" said Hahn.  For example, U.S. citizens and those based in the country cannot access the token, but they can get a verified World ID due to a lack of ""regulatory clarity,"" said Sada. The company is confident it will see usage of the network in the U.S. based on people's excitement to sign up to World ID, Sada said.  Tools for Humanity raised a $115 million Series C in May. The round was led by Blockchain Capital with participation from a16z, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global.  ""In the age of AI, the need for proof of personhood is no longer a topic of serious debate; instead, the critical question is whether or not the proof of personhood solutions we have can be privacy-first, decentralized, and maximally inclusive,"" Worldcoin co-founder Alex Blania said in a press release.

42393000,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWY5,1690177277,Meet the Hong Kong Lawmaker Who Invited Coinbase to Town,"Hong Kong was once a crypto hot spot, home to initial coin offerings and exchanges galore, before regulators began knocking on doors and talking about banning retail investment, which scared most industry participants away to other jurisdictions.  Johnny Ng is working to bring them back, with inadvertent help from U.S. regulators.  A member of the city’s Legislative Council (LegCo), Ng sent a viral tweet last month inviting crypto exchanges globally – and Coinbase specifically – to apply for a license in Hong Kong. Four days earlier, Coinbase had been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so it was plausible to think the company was looking for a new home.  Elected to LegCo last year, Ng has arguably become the de facto head of the legislature’s crypto caucus. He has lobbied Hong Kong chief executive John Lee to support digital assets in a high-profile way. This year, Lee gave a speech at the inauguration of the Institute of Web 3.0 Hong Kong. It was a big deal given Hong Kong’s former status as a crypto hub.  His efforts come at a time when an increasingly inhospitable U.S. government is driving digital asset firms offshore while other jurisdictions jockey to become crypto hubs.  On the city’s Web3 push, Ng said, “I wouldn’t say it’s just me, but I am a part of it.”  From skeptic to believer  I recently met Ng for lunch in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong. We went to what he called his canteen, an upscale dim sum place with a view of the harbor. The shrimp dumplings came each in its own little basket, with gold brushed onto their skin. The staff knew his favorite table, slightly secluded from the rest, and addressed him as Legislator Ng.  Ng said he first heard about Bitcoin around 2011 when he was working on facial recognition technology. A friend asked if he wanted to start mining. Ng said he wasn’t convinced then.  Six years later, when BTC was trading at a couple thousand dollars, he read the Bitcoin white paper and became interested. He started to look into why it was valued, attended local meetups and found true believers.  Now he’s one too. Since becoming part of LegCo last year, he’s been promoting Web3.  Being a member of Hong Kong’s LegCo isn’t a full-time job so Ng also co-founded an accelerator for Web3 startups called G-Rocket. He claimed there’s no conflict of interest because he declared his stake on a public registry and has recused himself from voting on Web3-related bills.  New licensing regulations  Exchanges have to get licenses under Hong Kong’s new regulations to provide virtual asset trading services, and they will be operating under defined and strict parameters. For prospects like Coinbase, this is potentially appealing because they now have a clear route to operate under regulation.  While a great deal has been made about allowing retail investors access to virtual assets, the coins Hong Kong residents will be able to access will be limited to those with large market capitalization that meet other criteria, including having a 12-month track record and being included in two indices that meet the regulator's guidelines.  The most common question Ng has fielded from licensed players is whether they can list more types of coins, but he said there will need to be meaningful volume first and Hong Kong is taking it “step by step.”  So far, only OSL and HashKey Group have Type 1 and 7 licenses under the previous opt-in regime, which means their applications for a license under the new regime should be smooth. When I said to Ng that at least one of those two isn’t profitable, Ng said you can’t judge the licensing regime from the first two platforms that come under it. “To be honest,” he said, “no one knows what they’re doing. They’re not very into this, they just got the license first.”  Only larger players may be able to get licenses, he said, given the requirements for capital, hiring of responsible officers and experience.  “Bigger exchanges are more stable,” Ng said, though he hedged by saying there’s no certainty. “Even the biggest can fall.”  Beijing’s long shadow  Ng is quick to say that “Hong Kong isn’t a country, it’s just an administrative region” of mainland China. But he said the “One Country Two Systems” model allows Hong Kong to do things which suit it.  “In the previous government [under former chief executive Carrie Lam], the opposition made passing laws a mess because they kept filibustering,” Ng said. (The opposition Democratic Party members resigned en masse after members were disqualified for supporting Hong Kong independence and refusing to recognize Beijing’s sovereignty over the city). “If you slow down government,” he said, “it doesn’t work.”  There is still the question of whether Hong Kong will fall in line with Beijing’s stance on crypto. Ng said Beijing was never against the tech, just the hype, which lured retail investors into bad investments. “China has 1.4 billion people with different levels of education,” he said.  Ng is part of a consultative body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, which plays an advisory role to the mainland Chinese government. Wearing that hat, Ng submitted proposals to the Chinese government on blockchain in 2018 and Web3 earlier this year. He said he hasn’t received a response to either.  Underdog  One reason Ng gave for advocating on behalf of Web3 is the technology’s potential to increase social mobility for young people. “Being born in the ’80s makes you a crypto elder,” he said.  The grandson of a migrant from Zhongshan in China, Ng said he grew up poor, born on the Kowloon peninsula. It's a long held joke in this city that the richest don’t leave Hong Kong Island, across the harbor from Kowloon.  Looking back on his youth, he said the same families who were rich then in Hong Kong remain the richest now.  “Traditionally successful entrepreneurs may not be interested in this industry,” he said. “Even if they are, they might not know how to play it.”  Exit question  I asked Ng whether he’s going to tweet an invite to Binance, the largest crypto exchange globally, which like Coinbase has been targeted by the U.S. SEC. Unlike Coinbase, which is unequivocally a U.S. company, Binance has at times been cagey about where it’s headquartered, and SEC charges against the exchange go beyond allegedly listing unregistered securities: Binance is also accused of allowing commingling of funds, inflation of trading volume, and actively skirting regulation.  “Binance?” Ng said with a laugh. “Yes, I didn’t mention that name.” He explained that he invited Coinbase because it’s publicly listed (unlike closely held Binance). If Coinbase were to come, it’d show Hong Kong policy is competitive.  No more named invitations are forthcoming, Ng said. “Everyone is welcome.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/24/meet-the-hong-kong-lawmaker-who-invited-coinbase-to-town,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc0e3c38c7c0f48fb6902e03cf49211ba8410ee2-3708x2820.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15232678,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543905,1690162722,MATIC Bullish Momentum Shows Signs Of Weakening: Key Levels To Monitor,"MATIC, following a notable price pullback that briefly dipped to $0.53, has encountered a slowdown in its bullish momentum. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin witnessed a decrease of around 1.5% in its value, with weekly losses amounting to 4.8%. Related Reading: XRP Sluggish: Unraveling The Factors Behind Its Gradual Weakening Currently, MATIC is hovering around a critical support level. This indicates that bears might dominate the upcoming trading sessions unless they move away from this support zone. To regain bullish traction, MATIC must sustain a price above the current support level. If successful, the altcoin may attempt to rise again. However, to fully restore its bullish momentum, it will be essential for MATIC to trade above the $0.85 price mark, which has previously acted as significant resistance. The slight decline in MATIC’s market capitalization indicates a potential slowdown in buying strength on its daily chart. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.75, having experienced a sharp decline from its previous position at $0.90. Despite a recovery attempt, MATIC is currently trapped at a crucial support level. The $0.75 price mark holds significant importance, as failure to sustain it could lead to a loss of buyer momentum, potentially pushing the price down to $0.65. If the altcoin falls below $0.65, it may further drop to $0.60. For MATIC to reverse its downward trend in the upcoming trading sessions, it must successfully surpass the $0.80 level. Achieving this could propel MATIC towards the challenging resistance at $0.85, a historical price ceiling for the altcoin. Technical Analysis Due to decreased demand, the altcoin experienced a decline in buying strength when it failed to maintain its price at $0.76. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the half-line, the reduced presence of buyers was evident. If bears push the price further, sellers could gain complete control of the price action. Additionally, the altcoin’s price was slightly above the 20-Simple Moving Average (20-SMA) line. However, in the next trading session, MATIC might dip below the 20-SMA, indicating a gradual exit of buyers from the market. The daily chart for the altcoin has shown clear signs of buyers exiting the market, with a sell signal becoming evident. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed one red histogram, signaling a sell indication for the altcoin. Moreover, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicated a negative direction for the asset. The -DI line (orange) crossed over the +DI line (blue), pointing to the altcoin’s bearish movement.

42392998,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWNp,1690161821,"First Mover Asia: Bybit CEO Ben Zhou: Regulators See Crypto as an ‘Opportunity,’ Not a Crisis","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds near $30,000, as investors remain cautious, an analyst says.  Insights: Ben Zhou, the CEO of crypto exchange Bybit, sees different regional hubs competing for business in the future.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,258 +10.7 ▲ 0.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $29,951 +90.7 ▲ 0.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,882 +13.1 ▲ 0.7% S&P 500  4,536.34 +1.5 ▲ 0.0% Gold  $1,964 −0.8 ▼ 0.0% Nikkei 225  32,304.25 −186.3 ▼ 0.6% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,258 +10.7 ▲ 0.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $29,951 +90.7 ▲ 0.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,882 +13.1 ▲ 0.7% S&P 500 4,536.34 +1.5 ▲ 0.0% Gold $1,964 −0.8 ▼ 0.0% Nikkei 225 32,304.25 −186.3 ▼ 0.6% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Crypto Traders Are Cautious as BTC Maintains $30K  As Asia begins its trading week, the CoinDesk Market Index is at 1,302, up 1.27%.  Bitcoin is at $29,951, up 0.3%, while ether is up 0.7% at $1,882.  “The trading range remains relatively narrow due to investors' cautious stance, primarily influenced by ongoing developments surrounding the legal case of XRP,” Johnny Teng, Senior Researcher at LBank Labs, wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “The disappointment expressed by SEC chair Gary Gensler over the court's ruling on the securitization of XRP token has added to uncertainty, with the possibility of an appeal by the SEC further complicating the situation.”  Anticipated selling pressure from the U.S. government's sale of confiscated BTC and profit realization by short-term holders, combined with strong support from institutional players and the existence of significant liquidity around $24,300, is contributing to a state of heightened uncertainty in the bitcoin market, necessitating prudent decision-making by investors, added Teng.  BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale said that the market appears to be continuing a consolidation, and the sentiment is still positive, but both bulls and bears need to be cautious.  “For now, bulls may want to be cautious since drops are not out of the question,” DiPasquale wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “Bears will need to be extra cautious, since their downside risk, at this point, is far greater than any potential gain projections.”  This week is scheduled to be a busy one, with the FOMC decision on interest-rate policy due Wednesday, alongside plenty of earnings. But its already been telegraphed that this rate hike will be the last, meaning traders might have already priced it in.

Crypto licensing is no longer a process governed by anxiety and fear, Zhou observed, and while different jurisdictions are taking unique approaches, there is a shared commonality in that regulators are looking to work with crypto companies and not against them.  “You start to see many regulators realizing this is actually an opportunity, rather than a crisis,” Zhou told CoinDesk. “Hong Kong, for example, is becoming extremely aggressive, trying to attract crypto companies, trying to attract talent.""  While all regulators, broadly, want the same goal they aren’t at the same place in the race.  Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), in Zhou’s opinion, is right now “more advanced” than Hong Kong.  “I think Hong Kong is at the very early stage, a little bit like how Singapore was maybe three, four years ago,” he said. “They're at the grandfathering stage.”  VARA, as Zhou explains from his interactions with them in getting Bybit licensed, has sophisticated,detailed procedures exchanges need to go through in order to get licensed. These include explaining how the exchange scrutinizes transactions, addresses sanctions, Anti-Money Laundering practices, and preventing engagement with polluted addresses.  Bybit doesn’t operate in the U.S., but once welcomed customers from Canada. It exited the country in May, citing a “challenging regulatory environment.”  “The attitude towards crypto in Canada has changed dramatically after FTX,"" he said.  Bybit had ongoing conversations with Canadian regulators and was invited to apply for a license, but post-FTX, the company decided to leave the market due to rules prohibiting stablecoins.  It should be noted that Hong Kong also bans stablecoins – for now. It just wants specific regulations in place first before retail traders will be allowed to have access to them (and forget about algorithmic stablecoins).  Does that mean Bybit will consider re-entry into the Canadian market?  Certainly, Zhou said, if the rules change.
