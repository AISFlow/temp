Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Prices  Bitcoin, Ether Drop on a Difficult Day for Cryptos  By James Rubin  Cryptocurrencies on Tuesday drifted further away from their recent highs as investors processed the latest spike in macroeconomic uncertainty and braced for aftershocks of the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected 75 basis point rate hike.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $21,200, off slightly for the past 24 hours, although it was down more than 5% earlier in the day. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands over $24,000 as recently as last Wednesday amid renewed investor optimism that inflation might have peaked and that the global economy was declining at a reasonable pace. But the rally proved short-lived as BTC returned to the $18,000 to $22,000 range it has occupied since the first part of June, at one point dipping below $21,000 on Tuesday.  ""We're really stuck in this range,"" Paul Eisma, head of trading at crypto finance firm XBTO Group, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""And we're waiting to see what the data is and what the Fed really what their guidance is ... what they foresee.""  Ether was recently trading just above $1,440, off less than a percentage point from the previous day but well off its most recent high above $1,600. The second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin rallied last week on optimism about the Merge, which would shift the Ethereum blockchain from a more energy intensive proof-of-work model to proof-of-stake, and investors' increased appetite for risk. A heightened level of options open interest, relative to that of BTC, underscored this trend.  But ether's 10% plunge on Monday represented its biggest dip in more than a month as the crypto broke from a six-day trading range of $1,460 to $1,660. The focus has shifted to ether's 50-day moving average of $1,293, as CoinDesk Senior Markets Reporter Omkar Godbole wrote. However, Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner Katie Stockton wrote in a research note published Monday that support could dip lower, highlighting short-term signs of investor exhaustion. ""A pullback in ether may find initial support at the 50-day [moving average] (~$1,293), but we expect an eventual retest of interim support ($1,000) on the next down leg,"" Stockton wrote.  Most other major cryptos fell deeply in the red, with UNI and SUSHI down more than 11% and 10%, respectively, at one point and SAND dropping by more than 6%.  Equities decline  Stock indexes suffered through a dreary day, with the tech-focused Nasdaq declining nearly 2% and the S&P 500, which has a tech-heavy component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, falling 1.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Investors digested a Tuesday wave of disappointing earnings and other news. Among the low points: Retail giant Walmart (WMT) said that demand was shrinking because of rising prices for energy and fuel. Auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) missed its estimates for profitability. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in two years.  Meanwhile, the fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine took a new but hardly unexpected turn with Russia's announcement Monday that it would cut gas flow through the pipeline that serves western Europe. Rising energy prices have played a major role in inflation throughout the continent and has put European economies on edge. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy prices, edged up near $100 per barrel and its price has risen nearly 40% since the start of the year.  Eisma noted the U.S. Federal Reserve's difficult position in combatting inflation without casting the economy into a deep, rapid recession and investors' understandable caution.  ""The reality is the Fed is in a bind,"" Eisma said. ""They have to have a balanced approach, but they don't want inflation expectations to get embedded because that's more dangerous than putting the economy in a mild recession.""  He added : ""This is a tricky week. If, with so much event risk this week and volatility, it's somewhat smart to either take some short-term profits to see if sort of the dynamic has changed. It's always smart to lessen risk going into the events that are coming in this week.""  Insights  Binance Deserves Some Criticisms, but It’s Not a ‘Ponzi Scheme’  By Sam Reynolds  Binance’s CEO is once again suing the media, and this time he might have a case.  In the Chinese edition of Bloomberg Businessweek, published by Hong Kong-based firm Modern Media Cl, Bloomberg’s profile piece on Changpeng Zhao originally used the term “Ponzi scheme” in its headline.  The headline has since been changed, but court documents captured the original, which included the direct transliterated term for Ponzi scheme (龐氏騙局) and not a less-direct term that would leave some room for interpretation and debate.  This is strange because for all Binance’s flaws, it being a Ponzi is not something that even its fiercest critics would say.  Binance’s critics have pointed out that it has had at one time a lax Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) regime, which is said to have made it a hub for illicit activity and a portal for sanctioned Iranians to trade.  For its part, Binance responded by highlighting its dozens of new hires in its KYC/AML department, including a number of heavy hitters from the law enforcement community. What might have been possible in Binance’s early days isn’t going to happen under their watch, is the mantra.  But for Chinese readers, ""Ponzi scheme,"" when speaking about crypto, would be familiar territory. In China, state media often refer to it that way when mentioning crypto.  Just scroll through stories on Xinhua (a state news service) and you’ll see crypto being referred to as a Ponzi or a pyramid scheme. The language is similar to how regulators in China describe it. After all, (real) Ponzi schemes run rampant through the Chinese traditional finance markets, so regulators are undoubtedly concerned that this is the next major one.  As Bloomberg Businessweek’s Chinese edition is widely available within mainland China, it could be that the editors at Modern Media Cl chose to use aggressive, but familiar, language about crypto that would please authorities in China and the censors. After all, Binance began its operations in China before leaving as the regulatory environment turned hostile. Zhao, a Canadian national, is said to be persona non grata in the country.  2020 lawsuit  Zhao is no stranger to suing the media on claims of defamation. In 2020 Binance sued Forbes over the publication of language describing an alleged ""Tai Chi"" strategy that involved setting up a web of corporations to deflect regulatory scrutiny of Binance’s U.S. operations to its offshore counterparts.  Binance denied the veracity of the document, and said its provenance involved a pitch from a third-party corporate services firm that was never implemented.  If the Chinese version of Bloomberg Businessweek’s headline was about money laundering or the ""Tai Chi"" document, it would have an effective defense available to it in the form of qualified privilege, a libel defense created by U.K. courts (as a common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong courts cite case law from the U.K., and this defense has been tried before) that protects journalists from being found guilty of defamation even if they are wrong but have done a ""responsible"" amount of diligence in reporting.  In matters of public interest there’s a “right to be wrong ... not completely wrong, of course, but the defense will defeat a libel claim if, despite the journalist’s best efforts, some facts or allegations turn out to be wrong or false,” as one legal academic put it.  ""Tai Chi"" and Binance’s web of ownership are matters of public interest, and even if Forbes’ sources were wrong there’s still a defense available.  Ultimately, Binance dropped the case. But the firm still doesn’t have a declared headquarters, and for all that can be determined, the exchange exists as an intricate web of offshore entities.  But that doesn’t mean it's a Ponzi scheme.

42411444,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlaZ,1658871020,Regulators Should Ban Crypto Advertising in Sports,"I’ve long been a critic of broadcast and cable networks for permitting “sin” products to be advertised during the hours when impressionable youngsters are watching a sporting event.  Ever since I can remember, touchdowns, home runs and other achievements in sports have been associated with beer ads. A few years ago, the alcoholic beverage industry grew more aggressive and began featuring hard liquor commercials. And because of the legalization of online betting, watching a game today is similar to being at a bookies convention.  Arthur Solomon was a senior VP/senior counselor at Burson-Marsteller and spokesman for the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Then there’s crypto. In recent years, digital asset firms have signed deals with countless celebrities to pitch their products. Blockchain protocols (including an infamously defunct one) advertise at our nation’s stadiums and arenas. Not to sound out of touch, but the government should put a stop to this flagrant activity. It has done that before.  The one “sin” product that is no longer permitted to advertise on TV sporting events are cigarettes and other tobacco products. But that’s not because the networks, sports marketers, teams or leagues didn’t want to continue calling a home run an “Old Goldie,” as it was described on the Brooklyn Dodgers broadcasts. The government banned tobacco commercials on television.  Now some people might think I am anti-sports. They couldn’t be more wrong. For a number of years I was a sports writer and editor for New York City dailies and a wire service before crossing the fence to public relations after several news outlets went bust.  After 10 years at a national PR agency, I was recruited by Burson-Marsteller, a giant international agency. My assignments there included redesigning the fan balloting publicity program for Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and assorted sports marketing projects for corporate accounts, including the Olympics. I was designated the U.S. spokesman for the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee and acted as a troubleshooter at the 1988 Summer Games.  See also: Why Sports and Crypto Getting Together Is a Win-Win | Opinion  During my stretch at B-M, I most often selected the athletes to be used in sports marketing accounts. I’m not anti-sports or anti-athletes. I believe that any entertainer or sports star should make as much money as he or she can. But there’s the rub.  It’s almost impossible to find a celebrity athlete who doesn’t remind me of a sideshow pitchman. In fact, some athletes endorse so many products that an individual needs a scorecard to remember which athlete is backing which product.  Moreover, athletes are increasingly endorsing highly risky crypto projects and products. This is irresponsible, considering the trust or envy our top performing athletes can engender. Is the money so good that you’d want to contribute to others losing theirs?  Banning crypto  While celebrity athlete’s endorsements shouldn’t be taken seriously by consumers, government regulators should put a stop to athletes’ endorsements of crypto.  A Yahoo Finance article in January reported that “cryptocurrency popularity has boomed in recent years, and celebrities have gotten in on the fanfare. But as criminal activity in the space soars, so has the likelihood that influencer endorsements could lure investors into costly digital-asset scams.”  A May article by Market Realist said, “Crypto exchanges have found a way to market their products in the sports industry, and they have taken full advantage of that. The crypto exchanges have invested billions of dollars into sports teams and players.”  I believe that crypto endorsements by teams, leagues and athletes should be banned because it’s largely unregulated investment advice. There are professional investment advisers who are regulated by the government to give financial advice, and I believe that the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies shouldn’t permit someone, just because he can hit a home run or throw a touchdown pass, to give financial advice on public airwaves.  See also: Watch Out for These Risks Before Investing in Bitcoin or Ether | Opinion  I also believe that leagues and teams are shameless, and that crypto is even worse than the beer and liquor and gambling commercials viewed by kids and vulnerable adults during games. Crypto gambling can bankrupt a family. Until it is regulated at the federal and state levels, like other financial assets are, much of it can be a con.  In fact, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says more government regulation is needed to police the proliferation of cryptocurrency and ward off fraudulent or illicit transactions, according to an Associated Press story.  If you believe that celebrity athletes know what they're talking about when they endorse crypto publicly, the Brooklyn Bridge is once again up for sale.

42374188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY8FJ,1658869794,Startup Incubator Launch House Debuts $10M Fund With Web3 in Focus,"Launch House, a startup community dedicated to building for the new Silicon Valley, debuted its first fund, House Capital, on Tuesday with $10 million committed to invest in early-stage companies within its community and external high-growth startups. The investment thesis is broad across the tech landscape but includes Web3 innovations.  “Launch House is basically a membership community for startup people,” co-founder Brett Goldstein told CoinDesk in an interview. “We have these co-living residency programs where they live in this house in Los Angeles or this house in New York and they build their startups in these houses. Obviously, it makes a lot of sense for us to invest in the best companies that come through those houses.”  Funding for House Capital came through a number of limited partners across tech and entertainment companies plus general partners from other funds, including Andrew Chen and Sriram Krishnan from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and James Currier from NFX. In February, a16z led the $12 million Series A round for Launch House.  A16z launched a record-breaking $4.5 billion crypto fund in May, and NFX recently committed $62.6 million in follow-on investments in portfolio companies that included some crypto names.  House Capital will invest up to $150,000 in each deal with investments happening as the firm comes across new companies rather than at a set pace, said Launch House co-founder Michael Houck. The fund has already deployed capital to 17 startups, and the majority were Launch House veterans. The investments included crypto-accounting software Coinbooks.  Goldstein, Houck and fellow Launch House co-founder Jacob Peters serve as the general partners of House Capital.  The majority of House Capital returns will be invested back into Launch House to bolster its programming and member experiences. Founders backed by House Capital will receive lifetime memberships to Launch House and its amenities, including fundraising support, digital cohorts and in-person residencies and retreats.  Launch House is debuting its first fund during a global bear market that saw crypto venture capital investments drop 26% year-over-year during the first six months of 2022, but the partners aren’t worried about the timing.  “If you are able to raise a fund, and we were very fortunate to be able to do that, it provides a crazy opportunity where you’re not competing as strongly as you would have last year against other people trying to raise their first funds or big firms continuing to deploy at the same rate,” explained Houck.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/26/startup-incubator-launch-house-debuts-10m-fund-with-web3-in-focus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1becc6fa478aa123701db5ee30c0d4432a2de8e2-5312x3984.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
543154,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496770,1658869537,Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Crypto Risk Appetite Remains Low,"The crypto market has been moving in the red during today’s trading session with Bitcoin and Ethereum surrendering the past week’s gains. The first cryptocurrency by market capitalization seems to be reacting to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOME) meeting set for tomorrow. During this event, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to potentially announce an increase in interest rates. Projection aimed at a 75 basis points (bps) hike, but the financial institution might surprise the market with a 100 bps in an attempt to cut down inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a metric used to measure inflation in the U.S. dollar, stands at a 40-year-old high. This has forced the Fed to shift its monetary policy by hiking interest rates, reducing its balance sheet, and removing liquidity from global markets. As a consequence, Bitcoin and the crypto market have been trending to the downside. The benchmark crypto saw a period of relative stability when it was able to stabilize at around $20,000, BTC’s price current level. The altcoins sector was less fortunate as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and other major cryptocurrencies broke below critical resistance. Some altcoins return to their 2020 levels as Bitcoin dominance trended to the upside. This is an indication of uncertainty and risk-off sentiment in the crypto market. The metric saw a decline over the past two weeks on the back of expectations of mitigating inflation, supported by a drop in the price of commodities, and the announcement of a date for the Ethereum “Merge”. Data from Arcane Research supports the above as the research firm records a decrease in performance for their Large, Mid, and Small Cap Index. As seen below, these indexes have been recording heavier losses than Bitcoin as BTC Dominance picks up bullish momentum. Bitcoin Dominance Spike Hints At Crypto Market Uncertainty Arcane Research noted that the overall weakness in the sector is driven by a “natural rotation as traders seek safety in a falling market”. The increase in Bitcoin dominance has been accompanied by a rise in stablecoin total market share. In other words, market participants are buying Bitcoin and stablecoins to protect them from potential downside risks. The report stated: Ether’s lack of strength relative to bitcoin has caused its market dominance to fall 0.34% over the last week. On the other hand, Bitcoin has seen its market share increase by 0.47%. This is a natural rotation as market fall, given that investors perceive bitcoin as a lower-risk asset than ether. Tomorrow’s FOMC meeting will decide the short-term fate of BTC dominance and the fate of larger cryptocurrencies.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-grows-as-crypto-risk-appetite-remains-low/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bukele’s announcements are intended to counter speculation about a potential default by El Salvador, amid strained relations between the Central American country and the traditional credit market, including the International Monetary Fund, which repeatedly recommended El Salvador discontinue the use of bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender due to the financial risks and liabilities created.  El Salvador is down roughly 54% on its investments in bitcoin, representing a potential loss of $55.8 million, according to CoinDesk data based on Bukele's announcements. So far, the country has spent $103.9 million in bitcoin, at an average price of $45,171 per coin.  El Salvador’s government plans to start the purchasing operation in six weeks, after the corresponding paperwork is finished, Bukele said on Twitter, adding that the government will pay the market price for each bond at the time of the transactions.  According to Bukele, El Salvador has enough liquidity to pay its current commitments in a timely manner and to buy all its debt until 2025 in advance.  The bonds maturing in 2023 total $800 million, and those maturing in 2025 represent a similar amount.  In November, Bukele announced plans to issue a $1 billion “bitcoin bond” that will use Liquid, a bitcoin-based service created by Blockstream. However, that initiative was postponed due to unfavorable market conditions, El Salvador’s finance minister said recently.

The decline dropped BTC‘s price approximately 36% below its 200-day moving average of $32,000  Bitcoin’s downturn is occurring in conjunction with a decrease in its RSI (relative strength index) to 41. RSI is an indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of price movements. Often used as a proxy for momentum (particularly when assets are trending), levels of 70 and above are often interpreted as indicating that an asset (in this case BTC), is overbought. Levels of 30 or below often indicate that an asset is oversold.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets.

Crypto Markets Seem in Risk-Off Mode to Begin the Week  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin showed weakness again in Tuesday trading as its price fell an additional 6%, following the 5.7% decline on Monday amid investors’ return to more risk-averse strategies.  From a technical vantage point, BTC has fallen below both the 10- and 20-period exponential moving averages (EMA). Moreover, the 10-period EMA has begun to cross below the 20-period EMA, which traders may view as being short-term bearish in nature. Bitcoin’s price is challenging the support level of $20,500, as Monday’s “Market Wrap” suggested. Intraday volume is approaching average levels over the most recent 20 days of trading, which adds credence to the strength of the move  RSI levels have fallen to 41, which most investors will likely interpret as neutral because it sits close to midway between the overbought and oversold benchmarks of 70 and 30. While no technical indicator should be viewed as solely predictive, it's worth examining BTC’s recent history when RSI levels approached 70.  So far in 2022, BTC’s RSI levels have approached or surpassed 70 on three occasions, those being February 7, March 27 and July 19 (70, 75.34, and 69.01 respectively). Looking at BTC prices 30 days after the first two instances shows declines of 13% and 16%, with the RSI falling to 40.52 and 41.78.  As it stands today, BTC is 11% below where it stood on July 19, while the RSI has fallen to 41. A repeat of recent price behavior would imply that BTC could trade within a relatively flat range over the next two to three weeks.  An item to examine when it comes to on-chain data is the bitcoin options put/call ratio across exchanges. For clarity, the metric divides the volume of purchased puts by the volume of purchased calls over the most recent 24 hours.  The buyer of a put is purchasing the right to sell at a certain price, whereas the buyer of a call is purchasing the right to buy at a specific price. The ratio between puts and calls can be used as an indication of trader sentiment.  As more traders look to protect themselves from potential price declines, the put/call ratio is likely to increase. The opposite holds true when traders wish to benefit from anticipated increases in price (i.e., the put/call ratio decreases).  The recent increases in the put/call ratio imply traders are purchasing downside protection to guard against further declines in price. Moreover, the motivation for doing so is at least partly to reduce exposure ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where an interest rate announcement is expected, and Thursday’s release of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) data.

543203,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526018-bnb-binance-coin-is-a-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1658867940,BNB: Binance Coin Is A Buy,"The Binance blockchain is fast, EVM compatible and supports multi-chain. This makes it an excellent ecosystem for new developers. The BNB token is necessary for transactions on the blockchain and is also an integral part of the Binance exchange. Given its use and deflationary nature, I believe BNB could go much higher from here. Thesis Summary Binance Coin ( BNB-USD ) is the native token of the Binance exchange and was launched in 2017. It has come a long way since, and its blockchain has grown significantly. The BNB token is necessary to operate on the BNB blockchain and is also an integral part of the BNB exchange ecosystem. Given the popularity of the exchange and how fast the network is growing, I believe BNB is a good buy at today's price. The BNB Chain The Binance blockchain used to be made up of two layers. On the governance side, we had the Binance Beacon Chain, and on the execution side, we had the BNB Smart Chain ((BSC)). Since February, these have merged to create the single Binance Chain. With this move, Binance aims to create an ecosystem beyond the Binance exchange. The Binance Chain is EVM compatible and allows for creating smart contracts and DApps that can be used cross-chain. BNB uses Proof-of-Stake Authority, which allows it to attain fast transaction speeds. The company has stated it has reached 1.4 million TPS . However, the chain was limited to 21 validators, but this has recently been increased to 40. The BNB chain aims to be a place to develop ""MetaFi"". The objective of MetaFi is to allow for the development of a wide variety of blockchain functionalities. These blockchains applications will be able to coexist in one single ecosystem, thanks to the network's multi-chain capabilities. Security, Scalability and Decentralization Now, let's talk about Security, Scalability and Decentralization. The Binance coin is quite centralized. It is controlled by only 40 validators, and it is supported by the Binance exchange. With that said, the current merge aims to, at least, improve on-chain governance. In terms of Security and Scalability, BNB does excel, though. Binance is perhaps one of the fastest blockchains out there, being able to complete 1.4 million TPS. Binance is also one of the most secure exchanges, and although there have been some hacks within its ecosystem, the main chain has not been attacked successfully. The Binance Smart Chain is a great place for new startups to launch their blockchain projects. The big caveat is that it is a centralized blockchain, and it also doesn't help that the company was founded in China, although, given the current laws, it does not operate there anymore. Ecosystem Here are some popular dApps that BNB powers through the BSC network. Pundi X: The dApp is a digital payments solution integrated with BNB. The dApp provides its partner merchants with point-of-sale devices that enable them to accept cryptocurrencies like BNB as payments for transactions. Binance developers would be able to use the tokens listed on Pundi X's open platform in 25 countries. HTC: HTC is the brains behind 'EXODUS 1', a crypto phone compatible with Binance Coin. It's like having a mini-bank in one's pocket. The device offers native support for Binance Coin in Zion, which allows EXODUS users to access the platform. Decentraland (MANA-USD): BNB users can also take advantage of the products and services offered by DeFi gaming platform Decentraland. The token can be used for various auctions and competitions hosted on the platform. Moreover, users can directly participate in these events via Binance's Trust Wallet dApp browser. ADAMANT Messenger: The decentralized messaging platform offers cryptocurrency transfers and BNB among its listed digital assets. Tokenomics The BNB Token supply is capped at 200 M. To deal with price fluctuations, Binance keeps the supply of its tokens scarce through various measures like repurchase and burn events. The platform uses 20% of its profits to repurchase tokens and burn them. The process continues until the platform possesses 50% of all tokens, i.e., 100 M BNB. Eventually, the platform burns all the repurchased tokens so that only 100 M tokens remain in circulation. Users can use the token to pay any fee on the platform, including the listing fee, exchange fee and withdrawing fee. Recently, Binance also introduced BEP-95, a proposal that expands on the current burn mechanism. With BEP-95, some BNB is burned with every transaction. This ratio will be determined through on-chain governance. Overall, the current tokenomics makes BNB quite deflationary, which is good for investors. Price Target BNB has many uses, both within the exchange and outside of it. The supply is capped, and tokens are regularly being burned. With that said, let's look at the price forecast based on EWT. BNB price analysis (Author's work) Like many other cryptos, I see BNB as having completed a wave 1 up into $700, which ended around May 2021. Since then, we have been correcting in an A-B-C structure, and based on the recent action, I believe the low could be in. If this is the case, the next wave 3 up should take us to the 1.618 fib extension of wave 1, measured from the low struck in wave 2. This is why my long-term target for BNB is over $1200. Other Considerations With that said, there are some risks to our bullish thesis. On the more immediate side of things, there's still room for BNB to make one more low to complete this correction. The upcoming Fed meeting will be a crucial catalyst. On the other hand, we have to consider that BNB relies on the existence of the Binance exchange. The problem with this is that crypto exchanges are facing increased regulatory pressure. For example, Binance was recently fined by the Dutch government. Takeaway In conclusion, I find that Binance Coin is a compelling cryptocurrency. It has many great uses and is supported by a significant exchange. The biggest problem is the centralisation, but not all cryptos have to be decentralised.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526018-bnb-binance-coin-is-a-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/543203.jpeg

42393824,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMih,1658865340,10 Crypto Sports All-Stars,"“The Fed keeps printing trillions of dollars,” said the bitcoin advocate. “The best defense against inflation, I believe, is bitcoin, and they will keep printing money.”  The man spoke fluent crypto. He sounded like a speaker at a Bitcoin conference. And in fact he was a speaker at a Bitcoin conference. But he also happens to be future Hall of Fame Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who’s one of CoinDesk’s inaugural Crypto Sports All-Stars.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  It’s a solid roster. It’s packed with elite National Football League quarterbacks, tennis players and soccer players who all believe in the power of decentralized self-sovereign finance. We limited ourselves to 10, and the list is admittedly arbitrary – LeBron James would like a word – but it gives a sense of how deeply crypto has oozed into mainstream professional sports.  Oh, and as for the return on their crypto investment? For each Crypto All-Star, we tried to calculate what you would have gained – or lost – if you invested $1,000 in the All-Star's chosen project at the time of his or her announcement.  So let’s meet the team and size up your fortune!  1. Team Captain: Tom Brady  Did Brady curse bitcoin? On May 9, 2021, with the price of bitcoin hovering around $58,000, the quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers added “laser eyes” to his Twitter avatar. The price then plunged to $30,000. “Alright the laser eyes didn’t work,” Brady admitted. “Anyone have any ideas?”  Yes, there were more ideas! He had the idea to use a flamethrower to thaw a block of ice with bitcoin inside. (That was in a commercial for crypto exchange FTX.)  He launched an NFT (non-fungible token) collection that sold out in under 10 minutes. He and his wife, Gisele, now have equity in FTX, and Brady co-founded NFT platform Autograph that raised a cool $170 million in January.  Perhaps most endearingly, after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin claimed to not even know who Brady is, the football player tweeted, “What’s up Vitalik! You may not know me but just wanted to say I’m a big fan of yours.""  2. Lionel Messi  When you head to the website of fan token Socios.com, the first thing you see is a giant image of Argentine soccer player Lionel Messi’s bearded mug. He has a big smile and he’s proudly holding his phone to show the Socios app. Messi has good reason to smile: He signed a whopping $20 million deal to promote Socios, explaining that he wanted to “create a more connected and rewarding future for fans around the world.” It’s certainly a more rewarding future, or at least it is for him.  3. Serena Williams  The tennis legend is more than just crypto-curious. At Bitcoin 2022 Conference in Miami, she revealed that she considers bitcoin a “super strong investment,” and her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, has invested in a bitcoin rewards startup called Lolli, because she believes that “earning and owning bitcoin is a step towards financial inclusivity for all people.”  4. Floyd Mayweather Jr.  A throwback to the glorious wackiness of the 2017 initial coin offering craze. On Instagram, the legendary former boxer boldly announced to the world, “I’m gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO,” referring to an early prediction market project. The world was baffled. What the hell is an ICO? What’s he talking about? “Is it real?” CoinDesk wondered at the time. That post has since been deleted, but Mayweather would later shill more ICOs (including one that triggered a lawsuit), wore a tee shirt promoting “Ethereum Max” in June 2021, was roundly booed at a bitcoin conference and had one simple request for the world: “You can call me Floyd Crypto Mayweather.”  5. Jessica Pegula  Currently the seventh-ranked women’s tennis player in the world, Pegula became the first female athlete to drop an NFT collection in March 2021, telling the Tennis Channel that “it's a really cool different kind of outlet for female athletes.” She noted that “sometimes you have to take some chances,” and hoped that she “inspires more athletes and more girls to do the same thing.""  6. Aaron Rodgers  “I believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright,” Rodgers tweeted. “That's why I’m teaming up with Cash App to take a portion of my salary in bitcoin today.” Wearing a black suit and tie (in a John Wick Halloween costume), Rodgers sipped a glass of whiskey and said, “Bitcoin to the moon,” announcing that he and Cash App will give away $1 million worth of bitcoin so that “we can go to the moon together.”  7. Spencer Dinwiddie  When not dishing dimes for the Dallas Mavericks, Dinwiddie co-founded the social token platform Calaxy (raising $26 million). He has been publicly bullish on bitcoin since October 2018 (in a Bleacher Report profile, he described how he traded bitcoin on his phone before NBA practices). He appeared on Pomp’s podcast in 2020. He tried to have his National Basketball Association contract tokenized, and he even hosted “New Money” for CoinDesk TV. The man is prescient. In May 2021, he told me that his NBA colleagues are warming to crypto, and that “everybody wants in.”  8. Megan Rapinoe  Long a champion of inclusiveness and equality, the soccer player helped bring female athletes into the NFT market by launching “The Collective Series,” a spread of digital trading cards that also includes skateboarder Mariah Duran, fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, and Women's National Basketball Association icon Sue Bird. Rapinoe’s natural charisma is so strong that as Jezebel’s Shannon Melero put it, she “tragically forc[es] fans like me to consider buying cryptocurrency.”  9. Russell Okung  It pays to be early. In May 2019, long before it became fashionable, Okung, then a player for the Los Angeles Chargers, tweeted a simple statement: “Pay me in bitcoin.” Crypto Twitter was ecstatic; “I see you!!!” gushed entrepreneur Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, along with six fire emojis. Okung got his wish. Not only did he receive half his NFL salary in bitcoin (the first NFL player to do so), he also helped launch the “Bitcoin Is” educational campaign and even jostled with Tesla CEO Elon Musk over miners’ energy usage, paying for a billboard that said “Stick to space, Elon.”  10. Steph Curry  In a commercial for FTX, Steph Curry, a guard on the Golden State Warriors, insists that he’s not an expert in crypto. Maybe. But he was savvy enough to snag an equity stake in FTX. He dropped 3,000 sneaker NFTs, he bought a Bored Ape (at one point worth 75 ETH), and he even made the Ape his Twitter avatar.  His teammates are also into crypto. Both Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala are getting paid partially in bitcoin, and the Warriors signed an NFT partnership with FTX. Maybe most importantly, Curry wisely followed Brady’s advice: “Whatever you do … don’t laser eyes!”  Honorable Mention – Dennis Rodman  Rodman has been out of the NBA for over two decades. But The Worm deserves a shout-out for an incredible tee shirt he wore to Singapore, where he had hoped to help broker peace between then-U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un: “Peace Starts in Singapore - PotCoin.com” We agree that none of those words make any sense.

42374179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY83z,1658865059,Investors Waiting for Safe Token Can Buy Gnosis Tokens for Now,"A blockchain project called Safe has grown over the past year to become one of the biggest institutional-grade wallets for managing digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain with $38 billion stored. Although the platform is planning to launch its own token called SAFE, executives aren't sure on the timeline for the launch.  Crypto analysts, however, say that investors can start betting on Safe’s success though a back door of sorts by buying the GNO token, which is linked to Safe’s parent company, Gnosis.  “If SAFE does well, GNO holders do well,” Matt Hepler, vice president of portfolio management at Arca, a crypto asset management firm, wrote to CoinDesk in an email. “It also allows Gnosis to increase focus on their digital-asset infrastructure business. It's a win-win.” He said Arca doesn't hold the GNO tokens.  GNO’s price has climbed over 30% since earlier this month when Safe raised $100 million in a strategic funding round from more than 50 investors, including 1kx, Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global Management and Digital Currency Group. (DCG is CoinDesk's parent company.)  Safe has amassed more than 80,000 “safes” – or Ethereum-based smart contract wallets designed to give users “complete self-custody” of funds. Combined, those safes have processed more than 600,000 transactions since launching in 2017. The platform uses account abstraction, which allows users to customize how transactions are approved, alongside smart contracts and multi-signature wallets, to provide additional security.  Gnosis Safe  The Gnosis Safe project was initially developed as an internal tool, and is being rebranded as simply Safe following a community vote to spin off from Gnosis, according to a blog post. The Gnosis community passed a measure in April to determine how SAFE tokens would be allocated.  ""Gnosis Safe has organically become critical infrastructure for Web3 as a means to securely manage digital assets,"" the post reads.  So in that sense, its ambitions might be greater than the original scope of Gnosis, whose main purpose is to serve as a test blockchain for the Ethereum network. Users can stake GNO tokens on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and earn rewards for validating transactions. The chain has more than 100,000 validators.  “Lots of things have been done on the Ethereum clients that cannot really shine on Ethereum yet because Ethereum is very conservative in terms of introducing any kind of change,” Gnosis co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Stefan George said in an interview. “Because Gnosis Chain is less valuable than Ethereum, we can be less conservative and push what is possible on an EVM network.” EVM stands for Ethereum virtual machine, which is the software platform that developers use to create decentralized applications on Ethereum.  George had told CoinDesk that the SAFE token was likely to launch in September or October. Later, he circled back to clarify that there was still too much uncertainty to name a concrete date.  Once SAFE goes live, 5% of the tokens will be airdropped to Safe and GNO users, and over four years, 15% of tokens will be vested in GnosisDAO, which guides the development, support and governance decisions of the Gnosis ecosystem. Holders of the GNO tokens can participate in the governance of GnosisDAO by signaling their approval or disapproval of improvement proposals.  Arca's Hepler said he believes that Safe’s expansion can unlock further growth potential for Gnosis and generate opportunities for investors.  “When businesses are spun out, they usually create a lot of value because they can operate more efficiently, they can raise capital, and it also attracts new investors,” Hepler said. “I might want to invest in Gnosis Safe or CowSwap, but not Gnosis collective.”",POSITIVE,SAFE,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SAFE,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/26/investors-waiting-for-safe-token-can-buy-gnosis-tokens-for-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/065cae472e83597ccbfe2aaaeb55cb1b854897d7-1024x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY87l,1658865046,Bitmain Partner Antalpha Unveils Lending Products for Miners,"MIAMI — Financial services company Antalpha unveiled several novel lending products for crypto miners at Bitmain's World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) here on Tuesday.  The products unveiled by Antalpha include co-lending with other financiers; financing to offload electricity costs, one of miners' biggest operating expenses; and deals collateralized with hashrate (a measure of computational power) instead of tokens or equipment as is common in the industry, as well as financing collateralized by both hashrate and mined tokens.  It also is offering lending with no margin calls, a type of structured lending.  A co-lending deal is currently under discussion, Antalpha Managing Director of Business Development Max Liao told CoinDesk on the sidelines of the conference.  Crypto miners have been facing margin calls on their loans as the price of bitcoin has dropped in the last few months, while capital has dried up amid a bear market. During Antalpha's presentation on Tuesday, phones flashed across the room as miners and other financiers eagerly took pictures of sample deals shown on the screen, an indication of the interest for a new player in mining finance.  Antalpha is a Bitmain strategic partner, much like cloud mining platform BitFuFu. The firm is based in Singapore, with its 150 or so employees spread across Hong Kong, the U.S. and Switzerland, according to Liao.  ""Our goal is to become a proper financial institution,"" Liao said, which is why the firm has a global presence and prioritizes risk management.  The company has been focusing particularly on financial services and asset management, as well as equipment financing, he said. Antalpha is applying for a Type 9 digital asset license in Hong Kong, Liao said.  ""We're not looking to replace any of the big vendors out there,"" Liao said. However, Antalpha will step in if other lenders ""are not fulfilling their function."" That means if lenders are either unable or unwilling to predict or assess the risk associated with mining loans, don't have the capital to give out loans or are too conservative to invest in the market, he said.  The loans come with interest rates of around 6.6% to 8%per year, and loan-to-value ratios from 60% to 90%, according to Liao's presentation.  The firm has about $700 million of client's assets on its balance sheet and doesn't leverage its internal assets, Liao said. The company believes it is in a good position to evaluate miners' risks due its relationship with Bitmain, the world's largest manufacturer of bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs, and its mining pool affiliate, AntPool. The mining pool will be collateralizing the hashrate for the hashrate loans, which will come with no margin calls or liquidations, according to Liao's presentation.  Bitcoin financing is one of Antalpha's core businesses, but mining financing ""is very important for the overall ecosystem right now because there is a credit crunch happening"" and borrowers might not be able to find much-needed cash, Liao said.

""If some cryptos are deemed securities, that would make the life of so many brokerages so much harder.""  While Coinbase is hardest hit, with a 20% drop late on Tuesday afternoon, related players like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Marathon Digital (MARA) are also suffering sizable declines of roughly 11%.  Checking cryptocurrencies themselves, bitcoin (BTC) – possibly the only crypto the SEC may not deem a security – is outperforming with a 3% decline. Ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL (SOL) are off closer to 7%.  ""While the digital asset industry was born and grew outside of any real scrutiny by the SEC, that appears to have changed,"" Tyler Gellasch, executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, told CoinDesk.

While the Ethereum network is working to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, Ethereum Classic is slated to remain proof-of-work (PoW). PoS will drastically change how Ethereum validates blocks, adds them to the blockchain and issues new ether (ETH). In doing so, it will eliminate the need for specialized mining rigs, such as the ones Bitmain makes.  Ethereum Classic, however, will continue to mine its native ETC cryptocurrency using these rigs.  The initial $10 million investment went to the development and exploration of applications of the Ethereum Classic mainnet, as to promote the overall performance of the network.  Bitmain started selling its latest Ethereum mining model (the Antminer E9) earlier in July. The mining rig manufacturer also announced at the World Digital Mining Summit in Miami that it will be accepting payments in ETC for all of its Antminer models.

Bitcoin Has Now Left The Zone Below 0.55 Mayer Multiple As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC price has escaped above the Mayer Multiple bottom zone. The “Mayer Multiple” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the current Bitcoin price and the 200-day moving average of the same. A “moving average” (or MA in brief) is an analytical tool that takes the average of any quantity over a specified period, and as its name implies, it moves with the quantity and changes its value accordingly. MAs are quite useful in studying long-term trends as they eliminate any short-term fluctuations and smooth out the curve. Related Reading | Bitcoin Puell Multiple Lifts Off From Buy Zone, Bull Momentum To Follow? The Mayer Multiple basically tells us how the latest value of the crypto has deviated from the average during the past 200 days. Based on this, it becomes possible to say whether the coin is currently overbought or oversold. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin “Mayer Multiple = 0.55” line during the last several years: Looks like the price of the coin has crossed above the level recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 30, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the the price of Bitcoin was under a Mayer Multiple value of 0.55 until very recently. At this value of the indicator, the BTC price is trading 45% lower than the 200-day average. Historically, cyclical bottoms in the crypto’s price have formed under this level. Related Reading | On-Chain Data: Bitcoin Whales With 10k+ BTC Have Been Growing This zone with Mayer Multiple values less than 0.55 has been rarely observed, with the crypto closing under it on a total of 127 days out of the 4186 days of trading life for the coin. This means that BTC has only spent 3% of its history in this region. Currently, it seems like Bitcoin is now shooting above the level after spending some time below it recently. If the past is anything to go by, this could mean that a bottom is now in for the crypto as the worst of the bear market may be over.

The bipartisan Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act comes on the heels of similar legislation introduced earlier in 2022 by senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). “While digital currencies have the potential to become an ordinary part of Americans’ everyday lives, our current tax code stands in the way,” said Toomey. The new bill, which complements the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act introduced earlier this year in the House of Representatives, aims to ""allow Americans to use cryptocurrencies more easily as an everyday method of payment by exempting from taxes small personal transactions like buying a cup of coffee,” Toomey added. Nevertheless, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) continues to stand by its policy that any crypto transactions can be subject to capital gains tax. “When you sell virtual currency, you must recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale, subject to any limitations on the deductibility of capital losses,” according to the agency's website . Crypto advocates, in turn, have argued that the widespread use of digital tokens as a medium of payment is limited partly because of that policy among other factors such as price volatility. “Cryptocurrency needs the same exemption for small, personal transactions that we have for foreign currency,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center. “This would foster use of crypto for retail payments, subscription services, and micro transactions. More importantly, it would foster the development of decentralized blockchain infrastructure generally because networks depend on small transaction fees that today saddle users with compliance friction that no doubt costs the economy more than the tax revenue that’s otherwise generated.""

42374216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBjh,1658859852,Measuring the Value of Digital Ownership via a Web3 Benchmark,"Contributing Writers:  Kelly Ye, CFA, head of research, and Max Good, senior index research analyst at CoinDesk Indices  Introduction  Web3 – also known as Web 3.0 or Web 3 is a term that has become increasingly popular as the evolution of the Internet advances with digital assets. The term itself describes the next generation of the Internet that allows users to participate beyond reading, enabled by Web1, and writing, enabled by Web2. For example, in the 1990s, Web1 was comprised mostly of a collection of links and homepages that were readable but not particularly interactive. In 2004, the next version of the Internet, Web2 allowed people to not only read content but also create their own and publish it through blogs and social media channels. As people became better informed on how their personal data was collected and used by the publishing and social media platforms, a greater need arose for more privacy, ownership and control of individual information and content. Therefore, Web3 is emerging as the next iteration of the Internet that aims to reduce dependency on large technology companies through the use of decentralized protocols.[1]  The digital assets that represent Web3 are characterized by open, autonomous and decentralized technologies within internet ecosystems that enable trustless infrastructure and remove intermediaries and central monopolies. This gives individual users power and ownership over their data, identity, digital assets, security and transactions. Web3 technologies can run autonomously with no need for a centralized organization to maintain their operation; this frees up creative resources to build out a universe of decentralized financial tools and applications (dapps).  According to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS)[2], the standard for defining the industries of digital assets, Web3 is not defined as an industry, industry group or sector. Rather, it is comprised of a diverse set of digital assets across industry groups.  In this paper we describe the CoinDesk Industry Group Select Equal Weight Index (DIGS), which is designed to measure the performance of the largest digital asset in each DACS Industry Group that meets certain market capitalization, trading, and custody requirements. Its constituents are equally weighted at each reconstitution.  What is in the DIGS Index Selection universe?  Since Web3 covers a broad range of applications that extends beyond one industry, industry group or sector within DACS, a digital asset is eligible for inclusion in the index universe, if it is ranked in the top 200 in the latest published DACS report with an assigned Industry Group. (Exhibit 1)  Exhibit 1: CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) Sectors, Industry Groups and Industries     In addition to the DACS Industry Group assignment, investability and liquidity criteria are important so that the Index can be tracked by investable products. Eligible digital assets must:  Have an average market cap of $1.5 billion over the seven days leading up to the reconstitution ($1.2 billion for current constituents)  Be listed on three eligible exchanges with custodian services available from Coinbase Custody  Be accessible by U.S. investors  Furthermore, the index excludes stablecoins or meme coins.  How are assets in DIGS chosen?  In the spirit of size, liquidity and diversification across industry groups, the index constituent selection process targets the largest digital asset from each industry group, subject to a buffer rule to reduce turnover. If only one digital asset is eligible in an industry group, it will automatically be included in the Index. If at least two digital assets are eligible in an industry group, a ranking is applied to choose the constituent. The ranking process sorts by market cap, and if the biggest asset is incumbent or there are no current constituents from the industry group that asset will be included in the index. However, to reduce turnover, a new asset may only replace an incumbent within its industry group if the market cap is 1.2 times that of the existing asset.  Based on this selection process, it is possible that some industry groups may not be represented in the index if no digital assets qualify.  What is currently in DIGS?  The DIGS index reconstitutes quarterly on the second business day of January, April, July and October. At its inception date of April 4, 2022, the index is made of 10 digital assets included in DIGS, each representing a unique industry group: Oracle (LINK); Shared Storage (FIL); Private (ZEC); Transparent (BTC); Credit Platform (AAVE); DAO (MKR); Exchanges (UNI); Metaverse (MANA); Multi-Chain / Parachain (AVAX); and Single Chain (ETH). Since the constituents each represent a unique Industry Group and are equally weighted, the index is well-diversified across assets and industry groups with each representing 10% of the index weight.  However, one or more than one included industry group may be assigned to a sector. Therefore, not all sectors are represented equally. At index inception, 30% is in decentralized finance (DeFi); 20% is in Smart Contract Platform, Computing and Currency; and 10% is in Culture & Entertainment.  Exhibit 2: Top Ten Assets in DIGS by Industry Group and Sector     Represented DACS industry group definitions[3]  Oracle: Oracle refers to any project with the primary ability to gather, organize and transmit either on-chain to on-chain data or off-chain to on-chain data in real time. It typically operates with a native token to cover transaction costs and governance rights.  Shared storage: Shared storage refers to the decentralization of storage servers that are traditionally owned and operated by a central organization. Shared storage decentralizes the storage responsibilities across an open-source network of miners with a system of economic incentives. This allows for pseudonymous, private file sharing on a decentralized network. The centralization of data storage is a high risk for potential hacks and bad actors to access sensitive information. Shared storage platforms increase security of data storage by running on a blockchain network that allows for privacy and pseudonymity of data transmitters.  Private: Any digital asset whose ledger does not display the deposit addresses of the sender or the receiver. In addition, the ledger does not reveal the wallet balances of any holder. This can include blockchains that utilize zero knowledge proofs (zksnarks, zkrollups), Schnorr signatures and any similar innovations that hide the addresses of users while maintaining trust.  Transparent: Any digital asset whose ledger displays the deposit addresses of both senders and receivers and may reveal wallet balances publicly.  Credit platforms: Decentralized credit programs where participants can lend out their tokens and earn an interest rate determined by an automated protocol.  Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO): DAOs are open-source blockchain protocols governed by a set of rules, embedded in smart contracts that are created by its elected members who can automatically execute certain actions without the need for intermediaries. A DAO can be defined as a protocol with the intended goal of securing a basket of digital assets while allowing the contributors to that basket to have direct governance rights over that basket. The governance rights allow contributors to vote to approve of or deny proposals.  Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges allow token holders to do peer-to-peer trading that cannot be controlled, censored or altered by any central authority.  Metaverse: A loose network of virtual worlds with social connections and interactions as a primary function. Based on blockchain technology, it encompasses virtual worlds and augmented reality. Metaverse includes gaming realms, GameFi and virtual real estate. Virtual worlds must maintain a decentralized marketplace and offer the ability to tokenize and trade digital assets within the metaverse.  Multi-chain/ parachain: A smart contract platform that allows for multiple parallel blockchains and cross-chain interoperability. It can be structured with a relay chain that allows slots for external parallel chains or parachains. The relay chain allows for pooled security and pooled block execution, resulting in each parachain to become an isolated, independently validated blockchain that can achieve its own levels of scalability.  Single chain: A layer 1 blockchain in which all transactions are recorded on the primary distributed ledger. Single chain allows for layer 2 scaling systems that remain tied to the primary blockchain for transactional competency.  Conclusion  Web3 is an extremely important advancement to the functionality of the Internet, allowing users to participate in it beyond reading and writing by owning their personal content to reduce dependency on large technology companies through the use decentralized protocols. This gives the individual users power over their data, identity, digital assets, security and transactions.

543152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496725,1658859537,Arcane Research: Stablecoins Supply Drops Almost 19% In Q2 2022,"The total supply of stablecoins decreased globally by 18.8% at the end of the second quarter of 2022 as the equities markets and risky assets experience volatile times due to rising inflation and other macro reasons. Stabelcoins Supply Falls In The Second Quarter Digital tokens called stablecoins are anchored to fiat money like the dollar. These currencies are supported by a combination of cash reserves, commercial holdings, and other physical assets and make use of blockchain technology. This week, Arcane Research released a paper that detailed the supply pattern. In their analysis, Arcane looked at supply information for popular tokens like USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, MIM, and USTC. Data indicated that the overall supply was above $180 billion in May 2022. By the end of the second quarter, that amount had dropped to $151.3 billion, indicating an 18.8% decline in worldwide supply. The report claims that the significant reduction, which is estimated to be worth $35.1 billion, is the greatest quarterly supply drop in stablecoins history. This occurs at a time when the cryptocurrency market is struggling and the prices of market leaders like Bitcoin have fallen dramatically. The crypto ecosystem entered the seven seas in 2022, and stablecoins were not left unphased.

In fact, the analysis predicted that somewhere in October 2022, the market value of USDC will increase by around USDT. According to Arcane, Tether (USDT) has been the market’s largest stablecoin, fully utilizing the first mover advantage. However, in November 2021, it decreased by 50%. As the market capitalization of USDT fell from $78 billion to $66.3 billion in 2022, the fall continued. USDC market cap at $54 Billion. Source: TradingView The top two stablecoins in cryptocurrency at the time of publication are USDT and USDC. The market capitalization of both tokens is over $50 billion. Binance USD (BUSD), the nearest rival, comes in third with a market worth of roughly $17.83 billion.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Treasury Department was likely to impose a fine against the exchange, though it did not suggest a timeline for the enforcement action.  Kraken sent CoinDesk a statement from Chief Legal Officer Marco Santori saying that the exchange would not comment ""on specific discussions with regulators.""  ""Kraken has robust compliance measures in place and continues to grow its compliance team to match its business growth. Kraken closely monitors compliance with sanctions laws and, as a general matter, reports to regulators even potential issues,"" Santori said.  A recent Reuters investigation found that crypto exchange Binance continued to allow Iranian users to place trades despite the sanctions and a company ban on doing business there.  Federal sanctions have long been a tool for the U.S. government to block individuals or nations from accessing the global financial system. Multiple crypto-users and addresses in Iran have been sanctioned in the past.  Several crypto platforms have proactively blocked Iranian users. NFT trading site OpenSea blocked Iranian users earlier this year, while Ethereum incubator ConsenSys blocked Iranian students from a coding boot camp in 2021.  Treasury has also not been shy about fining crypto companies in the past. BitGo, a crypto exchange, and BitPay, a transaction processor, have both faced steep Treasury fines for alleged sanctions violations.  Kraken’s CEO and co-founder, Jesse Powell, has been vocal about his willingness to challenge regulations he sees as unfair, including international sanctions.  In February, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Powell pushed back against calls to freeze the accounts of Kraken’s Russian users, tweeting: “Our mission at [Kraken] is to bridge individual humans out of the legacy financial system and to bring them into the world of crypto, where arbitrary lines on maps no longer matter, where they don’t have to worry about being caught in broad, indiscriminate wealth confiscation.”  In a corporate culture memo released in June, Kraken also described itself as a company that believes the “weaponization of the financial system is immoral” and promised to “engage in disputes with government agencies where outdated laws are unfairly exclusionary.”  UPDATE (July 26, 18:29 UTC): Added statement from Kraken and additional background.

42411440,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlQe,1658859081,What DAO Governance Has in Common With the ‘Eggheads’ Who Call a Recession,"There are two stories I want to talk about that are related, but not directly. The first: it seems possible that the U.S. economy is in or will soon enter a recession – but officials who make that call are hesitant to say so. Second, a popular Ethereum-based staking protocol overseen by a decentralized autonomous organization, aka a DAO, is preparing for a down market.  Every story is a macroeconomic story now. Inflation is roaring. Wage growth and disposable income are dropping. Asset prices are depressed. And on Thursday, a preliminary reading of the second-quarter gross domestic product is due to be released, with the hope that the data can answer whether we’re in a recession.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  See also: The Market Indicator Flashing 'Recession'  The White House made a statement this week that even if the number shows the economy is shrinking, it wouldn’t use the “r” word. Typically, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. We’ve already had one. Economists are expecting 0.4% annualized sequential growth, but it could be negative (and either way it’s likely to be revised).  Consequences in the crypto world  For crypto, a worsening economic outlook could mean an acceleration of job cuts, slowed hiring and delayed launches. Choppy markets, and rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will also prompt people to take capital out of the markets and make safer investments.  Some crypto projects are preparing for all of that. Last week, leadership of Lido, a critically important Ethereum staking protocol, proposed selling some of the project’s treasury assets to the venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital. The deal was to sell 10 million LDO for 14.5 million in DAI dollar-denominated stablecoins.  The governance proposal was rejected, primarily because the sale of $1.45 per LDO token was below the market price and there was no token lockup. That second point is important, because even though the deal was pitched as a way to strengthen the connection between Dragonfly and Lido, there were real concerns that Dragonfly would dump tokens at a time convenient for the fund but inconvenient for holders.  If this seems like a win for crypto governance, you have to take a closer look. The deal was set to go through – despite community objections to giving venture capitalists “free money” – until an anonymous whale wallet holding 17 million LDO tokens voted to scuttle it. (The Defiant reported this address has transactions linked to Alameda Research.)  Token concentration is a real problem for the notion of democracy in DAO land. Many organizations messed up token distributions and ended up with plutocracies that can sway governance votes.  Lido has 75 employees and needs to find a way to ensure solvency in case of a multiyear bear market. Its treasury is primarily denominated in LDO, ETH and stETH. The proposal to cash out for stablecoins was made after a community member’s “back of the napkin” calculation that the protocol was staring down bankruptcy at current burn rates.  Lido’s leadership intends to issue a revised proposal, taking in the communities’ comments. Cobie, the mega-popular Crypto Twitter personality who said he used to work for Lido and still has significant exposure, floated the idea that the DAO hire a chief financial officer.  Whale watch  But the prospect of whales is concerning – a separate Lido holder with 15 million tokens voted in favor of the initial deal. Governance in a market where motivated parties can literally buy voting tokens on the open market may always be suspect. But at least it’s somewhat transparent.  Bloomberg’s Steve Matthews wrote a great piece about the “obscure panel of ‘eggheads’” from Stanford University who will get the say on whether the U.S. is in a recession. Indeed, even if everyone feels like we’re in a recession, the ultimate call goes to the National Bureau of Economic Research.  See also: ENS and the Limitations of DAO Governance | Opinion  That means, on Thursday, if data shows the U.S. GDP has shrunk for the second consecutive quarter, we may not officially be in a recession. In a way, this could be a good thing. In these “narrative-driven” times, (the same trend that gave the world meme stocks and dog tokens), beliefs about the economy matter. And a single word could have an outsized impact.  The political implications here are odd. Is it right that a single entity gets to define a trend that affects everyone – potentially bucking common sense? What about if they’re voting for the greater good, and give people what they ultimately want? In either case, these machinations are everywhere.",NEUTRAL,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | LDO,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/26/what-dao-governance-has-in-common-with-the-eggheads-who-call-a-recession,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81ce76d1dc326d09897cff012d45be95d06ceb6d-1456x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are some who are wondering if the Lido Finance stETH derivative is the best way to play the merge because of the peg discount. I think there is a better alternative for arbitraging Ethereum. When I last covered Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) a little over a month ago, a key component in the long-awaited Proof of Stake chain merge had been delayed. Out of a desire to not re-write that article, for those who pay less attention to the technical aspect of blockchains: Ethereum is primarily a PoW (Proof of Work) consensus blockchain. However, there is a parallel Ethereum chain already that runs a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus instead. The PoS chain is called the Beacon Chain. What developers and market participants have been waiting to see completed is the joining of Ethereum's PoW mainnet with the PoS Beacon Chain. The completion of which has been referred to as ""The Merge."" The Merge now has a new target date of September 19th. Lido Finance Arbitrage A major part of transitioning to a Proof of Stake mechanism requires ETH validators to stake their assets before the merge is actually completed. This helps to secure the Beacon Chain pre-merge as mainnet validators currently have a vested interest in mining on the proof of work chain. Following the merge, there will be no incentive for proof of work mining. Thus, staking ETH on Beacon Chain becomes the only way to generate rewards from ETH transactions post-merge. The catch for those who want to participate by staking their ETH pre-merge is those tokens are locked until after the merge is finalized. And there are now over 13.1 million ETH tokens staked on Beacon: Staked ETH (Dune Analytics) At 11% of ETH's total supply, that's a lot of liquidity to lockup without an exact date that the tokens can be un-staked. Hence, the excitement for a completed merge. What has helped traders and DeFi participants continue their trading activity is Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ). Lido Finance is a DeFi protocol that offers liquidity for staked ETH. On the Ethereum chain, ETH holders can stake their tokens to the Beacon Chain through Lido and then mint a derivative of their ETH called ""Lido Staked ETH,"" or stETH. stETH is intended to be pegged to the underlying asset on a 1:1 basis. Holders of stETH can then redeem those ETH derivatives for real ETH when the merge is over and the underlying Ethereum on the network can be un-staked. Lido users would benefit from this model because they can lockup their ETH on the new chain and then continue to participate in other DeFi activities by using their stETH derivatives in trades. This has led to an explosion in activity through Lido as that protocol has gone from roughly 10% of staked ETH deposits on Beacon a year ago to over 31% now. Staked Ethereum on Beacon (Dune Analytics) What makes the Lido situation interesting is there is now an arbitrage opportunity because the stETH peg has gone under 1. stETH to ETH Peg (CoinMarketCap) While the stETH peg has always fluctuated, from October of last year through April of this year, the peg was stable and very close to 1:1. Volatility picked up when crypto funds started blowing up earlier this year. Coupled with what was surely a run on customer assets before withdrawals were halted, Celsius ( CEL-USD ) collapsed because it had significant exposure to stETH. During the crypto contagion meltdown that claimed Celsius, stETH traded down to a 7% discount against ETH. The current discount is roughly 2%. The opportunity this peg now presents DeFi players is essentially the chance to claim 1.0 ETH when un-staking is available post-merge by buying stETH for 0.98 ETH now. With a new target date for ""The Merge,"" we have renewed speculation on the best way to trade it as a catalyst. Though the gap has closed since mid-June, some believe buying Lido Staked ETH still provides a valuable pricing arbitrage opportunity for ETH merge traders. Capturing ETH Aribtrage While the deeper discount in stETH didn't last very long, I don't think the current discount is large enough to justify an stETH position purely for the value gap. I take that view for two main reasons. The first is that even if the merge goes off without issue, stETH can't actually be redeemed for ETH immediately. ETH withdrawals won't be enabled until another upgrade after the merge takes place according to Ethereum.org : Withdrawals are planned for the Shanghai upgrade, the next major upgrade following The Merge. This means that newly issued ETH, though accumulating on the Beacon Chain, will remain locked and illiquid for at least 6-12 months following The Merge. Essentially, anybody buying stETH under the assumption they will be able to immediately redeem it for ETH in late September following a successful merge of mainnet and Beacon is mistaken. The second reason I think stETH is the wrong way to play pricing arbitrage in Ethereum is that it isn't the deepest discount in Ethereum derivatives. There is a far better pricing arbitrage in the Grayscale Ethereum trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ); shares of which closed at a 28% discount to net asset value on Monday. ETHE Premium Rate Trend (Grayscale) As ETH was finding its footing a bit over the last few weeks, the discount rate in ETHE shares moved from 35% in June to 25% a few days ago. In my view, if you're bullish Ethereum, the best arbitrage opportunity is in ETHE shares rather than in stETH. While ETHE shares lack redemption for Ethereum, stETH also lacks redemption for Ethereum until after a post-merger upgrade. If the past timeline of ""The Merge"" has been any indication, the Ethereum development team will likely take its time with the Shanghai upgrade after the merge has been completed. This means redemption could take as long as a year, at minimum. A Different Kind of Risk A legitimate advantage stETH has over ETHE shares is stETH can be swapped at all hours. The DeFi market never closes while ETHE shares are at the mercy of standard market hours. This can make entering or exiting an Ethereum position more challenging if a trend reversal happens when the equity market is closed. But if you're not looking for an Ethereum derivative that offers DeFi liquidity, ETHE has far more upside as an arbitrage play simply because the price discount to the net asset value is so much larger than the stETH peg arbitrage. There are reasons to get stETH through Lido Finance if you're a long term believer in the Ethereum network. Having liquidity while ETH has been staked allows for on-chain DeFi activity. There are other risks that come with that approach, however. We've seen numerous instances of funds getting hacked from DeFi protocols through the years and there is always the risk of human error with keys leading to total loss of funds. The point is, if you're purely looking for ETH arb, ETHE is probably the better opportunity than stETH as we approach the merge. Summary Ethereum, like many cryptos, has struggled in recent sessions. While we've experienced a nice rally from $1,040 to $1,600 in the last two weeks, the short term direction isn't yet clear as Ethereum just gave up $1,500 Monday night. A deeper pullback could be necessary to set up a more sustainable bear market rally continuation after a consolidation period. Of course, the bear market rally could also be over already and fresh lows could be coming. Furthermore, the Ethereum merger could ultimately be a ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" event. And that's if it even happens in mid-September at all. We could also simply be dealing with volatility leading up to Wednesday's FOMC. While I'm still personally long both ETH directly in a cold storage wallet and Grayscale's ETHE shares through a retirement account, I wouldn't totally rule out a better entry in the days ahead.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525934-ethereum-steth-peg-is-wrong-arbitrage-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/543201.jpeg

543151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496733,1658857453,Top 4 Gaming Projects on Solana,"Many blockchains try to build momentum in the play-to-earn gaming vertical. Thanks to its high throughput and low fees, Solana makes for an excellent candidate. Several popular games have already been built on this network and have successfully grown their communities. DeFi Land DeFi Land has become one of the most popular Solana-based blockchain games. Players can choose various gameplay types, enabling a more immersive gaming experience on the Solana blockchain. Moreover, the agriculture-oriented gameplay – involving fishing, shooting, farming, crafting, etc. – is an appealing and approachable concept. It lowers the entry barriers and has the potential to bring more people into play-to-earn gaming. It was the first Solana gamification project to launch, and the team delivered on the initial roadmap within nine months. Despite Solana’s multiple network outages, DeFiand has not had any downtime, thwarting nearly a dozen DDoS attacks. Moreover, the game has integrated with Raydium, Serum, Oracle, Tulip, Jupiter, and other projects to focus on interoperability and composability. DeFi Land distinguishes itself through eight kinds of NFTs with unique gameplay attached to each type. Additionally, there is a native NFT marketplace, staking support, Seed Planting for NFT incentivization, in-game currencies, and secured the first-ever Radio tower in the metaverse. Delivering such an array of products and services makes DeFi Land stand out from the rest. Furthermore, the team is looking to add PvP, co-op, and a mobile application. MonkeyLeague Competitive gameplay continues to bring more people to the P2E industry vertical. MonkeyLeague is a prominent Solana-based title as it combines Web3 elements with eSports gaming. Players can build their dream team of soccer players, compete against others, and reap the rewards by rising the ranks. However, there is also some strategy involved, as players need to think about how they approach matches and handle their squad. What sets MonkeyLeague apart from the rest is its high-production-value multiplayer gaming. It creates an exciting turn-based play-and-earn soccer game combined with decentralized finance elements. Anyone can pick up MonkeyLeague, but mastering the game is something different. Additionally, players own the game’s assets, including Stadiums, where games are played. Owning a Stadium can lead to generating passive revenue in MonkeyLeague. In addition to hosting matches in a Stadium, players can earn through winning matches and rooting for the winning team as a spectator. MonkeyLeague is developed by UnCaged Studios, which recently secured $24 million in Series A funding. That money will advance the development of MonkeyLeague and the Game OS platform, designed to help Wb2/Web3 development houses enter the crypto space. Neopets Meta Free-to-play games with play-to-earn elements tend to attract tremendous interest. Such games need the inherent benefits of the Solana blockchain, including speed, efficiency, and low fees. Neopets Meta is currently the top-ranked Solana-based play-to-earn title where players engage in a virtual pet game. In addition, participants can explore various mini-games, PvE and PvP combat, and the care and customization system. Neopets Meta is built on the cult classic Neopets, which had over 150 million players. Bringing that familiar look and feel to the metaverse and combining it with P2E elements will bring modernized nostalgia to that former player base. For those new to Neopets, there is much to like, as there are no upfront investment costs to engage in this virtual pet metaverse. The option to collect resources and craft a house to furnish, decorate, and expand for one’s Neopet is rather appealing. SolChicks Another popular play-to-earn game on the Solana blockchain is SolChicks. The project launched with tremendous ambition, as the team aimed to build the leading fantasy NFT PvP and P2E gaming ecosystem. With its cute characters and high-production-value gameplay, SolChicks has certainly delivered on most promises. The initial excitement surrounding the project became apparent as SolChick sold out its two NFT mint sales relatively quickly. Gameplay-wise, there is a fair bit of lore, a gripping storyline, and engaging combat mechanics. Additionally, players will face PvP and PvE content, offering a good mix of changing conditions. Players can also collect the SolChicks they like and use them to tackle different in-game content types. Players who want to check out a game demo can do so here. It is good to see a demo of a blockchain game, something more teams will hopefully introduce over time.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | SOL | RAY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/top-4-gaming-projects-on-solana/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
42393801,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLTl,1658857404,What Happens to Celsius Creditors if Crypto Prices Recover?,"Suppose bitcoin’s (BTC) price doubles over the coming months. Would the hundreds of thousands of customers whose cryptocurrency assets are frozen within stricken lending platform Celsius Network come out ahead, or just break even?  This is uncharted territory for a U.S. bankruptcy court.  The high volatility of cryptocurrencies created the extreme market conditions that saw crypto lender Celsius freeze customer withdrawals in early June and later confess to a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. But an equally dramatic upswing in cryptocurrency prices could conceivably happen before the case – in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York – is concluded.  The possibility of a thaw in the crypto winter was mentioned at the first bankruptcy hearing by Patrick Nash – a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm representing Celsius – who added that the majority of customers are expected to remain “long crypto.”  The strategy of waiting for an eventual change in the crypto climate was echoed by Vincent Indelicato, a partner at law firm Proskauer who is focused on corporate restructurings.  “Stakeholders may very well want to use the bankruptcy process to wait out the crypto winter and hibernate until it thaws a little bit so that they could then capture the upside of the rebound,” Indelicato said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Crypto recovery  The option to take recoveries in crypto sounds like it could be a boon for Celsius account holders, but much depends on what that means in practice, said Daniel Besikof, a partner at law firm Loeb & Loeb.  “The general rule is that creditors in bankruptcy have claims, denominated in [U.S. dollars], measured as of the date of the bankruptcy filing. It will be interesting to see how that rule is applied in this unique setting,” said Besikof in an interview.  Imagine a hypothetical account holder who has $1 million worth of bitcoin on the bankruptcy petition date of his or her exchange, Besikof suggested. In this example, if bitcoin goes down, recoveries on the claim will also likely go down. But if bitcoin doubles, would that creditor have a claim that’s now worth $2 million? Could he or she recover more than $1 million?  The courts will have to decide, Besikof said.  “I could see exchanges arguing that the account holder’s recovery is capped at $1 million, even if the exchange is flush with cash and crypto assets from the price increases,” he said. “That argument would create a potential windfall for the equity holders, but would be highly detrimental to account holders. This concern could be alleviated if the plan provided for the return of some or all of the customer’s crypto.”  The situation is somewhat analogous to certain oil and gas companies that filed at the bottom of that market, only to become solvent later on in the case as oil prices increased, Besikof said. “However, in those cases, creditors were actually paid in full – the value of what they were owed did not also increase with the price of oil.”  Go to rehab  It’s worth highlighting ongoing legal disputes involving cryptocurrency firms, such as the now infamous customer losses associated with collapsed exchange Mt. Gox, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in Japan back in 2014.  A ruling on the legal status of property of the crypto assets – approximately 200,000 BTC held by the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate that kept appreciating in value until it eventually overtook the total legal claim value of all creditors – might have been useful. But the court punted on the issue by switching to civil rehabilitation, a type of proceeding in Japan that bears some similarity to U.S. Chapter 11 restructuring, where a debtor retains the power to continue to manage its business.  That said, Mt. Gox is only really an indication of how things have progressed within the slow-moving jurisdiction of Japan, and doesn’t provide a clear indication of what will happen under the U.S. bankruptcy code, noted Thomas Braziel, the founder of 507 Capital, a firm that has purchased Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims.  “The problem with talking about previous cases is that it’s not U.S. bankruptcy law, or even U.S. law at all,” Braziel said in an interview. “So while of course it’s interesting, I don't think that the U.S. bankruptcy court is going to consider this non-estate property, and it’s all held in trust.”  As it stands, the dispositive issue of whether the cryptocurrency assets are custodial (meaning their title and ownership remains the property of the customer) or those assets are now the property of the bankruptcy estate, is determined by the language in the firm’s customer agreements.  The terms attached to Celsius’ custody wallets, which were purely for storage and did not pay interest, seem to suggest the firm should give that property back to those customers, but those assets only make up 4% of the outstanding pie (about $180 million at today’s prices). The rest of the assets are locked up in Celsius’ high-yield Earn program. According to the firm’s terms and conditions, customers who elect to use this service will “grant Celsius all rights and title to such digital assets, for Celsius to use in its sole discretion while using the Earn Service.”  However, those terms of service aren’t the endpoint in a case like this; they’re more like the starting point, noted Braziel. “There are tons of contractual terms that are totally unenforceable in bankruptcy court, let alone any court of law,” he said. “And if the firm wasn’t following the rules within a given jurisdiction where something was offered, then the terms of service aren’t even applicable.”  Just one of the cans of worms to be opened further into the bankruptcy proceedings concerns those non-accredited investors (mom-and-pop investors, basically) who were grandfathered into the Earn program by Celsius as the firm fielded scrutiny from state regulators, but who would properly belong in the custodial wallet bucket if they were to remain on the platform.  “There are different pockets that are very interesting,” said Braziel. “Those guys who got grandfathered in should probably form an ad hoc group; basically a group of people with common interests that like an argument enough to foot the bill themselves.”  Rip it up and start again  Some of these questions may well become moot, or at least secondary, if the stakeholders can find the right conceptual framework for a reorganization plan that works for the customers, said Proskauer’s Indelicato.  Bankruptcy cases often become a tug of war between groups of stakeholders who may turn out to be the customers and the equity holders in this case, noted Indelicato. These parties will focus on who gets the biggest piece of the pie, and how you measure a piece of that pie, he said.  “If you’re an equity holder, you may want to assert a view that the crypto assets should be frozen and valued at the time of the filing, not as they appreciate over the life of the case – assuming that we see market appreciation of cryptocurrency prices.”  A crypto-market value appreciation, should it happen while the case rumbles on, will become an important driver for customers of Celsius, who already hold conviction in the technology and who may also want to avoid tax and other unintended consequences of cashing out, said Indelicato.  “This is very much uncharted territory, and because of that I think the conventional toolbox and ruleset really gets thrown out the window,” Indelicato said. “Just take the playbook and rip it up. For those reasons, the Celsius and Voyager Digital cases will require innovation, creativity and people who can think outside the box.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/26/what-happens-to-celsius-creditors-if-crypto-prices-recover,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f323a8d13d6ce1cc05e258956fd51a72b457b94c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Full state support for the Free Economic Zone provides unique benefits and affordable electricity for mining. In 2018, the Armenian government entrusted ECOS to create and manage a Free Economic Zone to support the development of high technologies and the blockchain industry in the country. Today, the company maintains more than 250,000 users that use cloudmining and hosting services worldwide, and you can become a part of the ECOS mining ecosystem! An end-to-end infrastructure was built on the territory of the data center, including a service center, warehouses and regular supplies of spare parts, armed guards and staff of servicemen located on the territory 24/7. ECOS data center receives an additional 60 MW of clean, affordable and stable electricity from high-voltage networks, which makes it possible to claim almost 100% up-time electricity. The new plot can accommodate more than 20,000 mining devices on an area of ​​2.2ha, with the potential to expand to an additional 200MW. Moreover, the optimal temperature of this region allows to eliminate problems with overheating without additional expenses – the average annual temperature in Hrazdan is 4.8°C. Also, we have to mention ECOS end-to-end service: The company takes full care and responsibility for the purchase of mining equipment from Bitmain, on behalf of our clients or simply helps to move from other data-centers to ECOS, the company’s employees test, install and maintain equipment 24/7 and you can watch and control your assets directly from the mobile app. This is a really good opportunity to earn passive income with ECOS hosting and manage it with two clicks on your smartphone. Your earnings on mining are not so easy? Let’s check out all the benefits here. “We have come a long way from legalizing mining in Armenia to launching our own energy infrastructure that is ready for scaling. We want to offer our partners simplicity in everything: from launching your mining business on our data-center to daily monitoring of the result in the application without leaving your home” — said Ilya Goldberg, managing partner of ECOS. — “Our bundled product is made to serve both institutional and retail clients from any part of the world.” Armenia patronizes the blockchain/mining sector and has allowed the creation of FEZ with unique conditions such as 0% income tax and 0% VAT, 0% import and export duties, 0% property and real estate taxes for the next 25 years, which allows our partners to receive maximum revenue on capital. At present days due to the lack of stable and affordable electricity in the world and the constantly changing legal requirements, ECOS services are extremely relevant, the company said. Crypto winter is coming to an end and now is the best time to start mining. Historically, it is most profitable to invest in cryptocurrencies during such periods.

543147,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243629,1658855057,Here Are The Top 5 DeFi Tokens of the Week,"Blockchain provides a platform to build trustless, permissionless, and decentralized Dapps. These features are necessary for a Dapp to provide everyone equal and safe access to financial services. Various Defi protocols are providing people access to a large variety of financial services. So, if you have been thinking of investing in DeFi tokens, here is a list of the top 5 DeFi tokens of the week. Top 5 DeFi tokens of the week 1. Maker DAO A decentralized protocol called MakerDAO is working to stabilize the cryptocurrency market. The Maker Protocol uses the two-token mechanism. First is Dai, a stablecoin that gives collateral backing. A decentralized stablecoin, in the opinion of the Maker Foundation and the MakerDAO community, is necessary for any protocol or individual to experience the benefits of digital money. The second is MKR, a governance token used by stakeholders to control Dai and maintain the system. Holders of the MKR token can vote on several governance-related issues, including the stability fee, debt ceiling, acceptable forms of collateral, the Dai Savings Rate, and more. Additionally, MKR is utilized in the Surplus Auction to pay stability fee payments and buy extra Dai from collateral auctions. As soon as the auction is over, the protocol immediately burns the MKR, reducing the supply. $MKR currently trades at $97 and has a market cap of $862 million. $MKR token price has jumped around 46% from its June low. The jump in price may be due to Maker DAO’s efforts to onboard Real World assets on its platform. Recently, the MakerDAO community approved a proposal to incorporate a US bank into its collateral system. The maximum loan amount passed to the Huntingdon Valley Bank is $100 million. It can borrow the money in DAI by putting down security in an off-chain account. 2. Curve DAO Curve uses the StableSwap invariant, which has substantially less slippage for stablecoin trades than many other well-known invariants, to produce exceptionally efficient stablecoin trades (e.g., constant-product). Tokens that are stable representations of one another are referred to as stablecoins in this context. This encompasses, among other things, USD-pegged stablecoins (such as DAI and USDC), ETH, sETH (synthetic ETH), and other forms of wrapped BTC. The StableSwap invariant is implemented by a curve pool, effectively a smart contract that includes the logic for exchanging stable tokens. All Curve pools enforce the StableSwap invariant. A Curve pool, also known as a plain pool, is the StableSwap invariant implemented with two or more tokens in its most basic form. Pools with lending capabilities, or lending pools, as well as meta pools, which are pools that permit the exchange of one or more tokens with the tokens of one or more underlying base pools, are examples of alternative and more complex pools. CRV currently trades at $1.462 and has a market cap of $568 million. CRV token saw a massive price jump of 173% in the last 1 month. Recent bullish price action is due to Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve, acknowledging that they will be launching an over-collateralized stablecoin soon. 3. GMX Low swap fees and trades with no price impact are supported by the decentralized spot and perpetual exchange known as GMX- a unique multi-asset pool that supports trading and generates fees for liquidity providers via market making, swap fees, and leverage trading. Chainlink oracles deliver average prices from top volume exchanges and provide dynamic pricing. The GMX protocol makes money by deducting fees on trade opening and closing transactions and a “borrow fee” for each hour a leveraged position is open. When opening and closing a trade, a trading fee of 0.1 percent of your position size is charged. You can stake $GMX tokens to receive the reward in the following three ways. Escrowed GMX Multiplier Points AVAX / ETH Rewards The Escrowed GMX (esGMX) that holders of Staked GMX are entitled to and receive as compensation can be used in one of the following two ways. Staked for incentives akin to those from regular GMX vested over a year to become regular GMX tokens 30% of protocol income goes to GMX stakers, the token utility drives up demand for GMX. As a result, 86 percent of the supply in circulation is currently staked. Because this staked GMX is yielding a 27.41% APR, there is a significant demand for the token. $GMX trades presently at $28 and has a market cap of $219 million. $GMX was one of the only tokens that performed better than $ETH during the massive market sell-off in the past few months. $GMX token has seen bullish price action and has jumped around 178% from its lows. 4.

42411098,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8cr,1658853664,Is Crypto Sports Betting Ready for the Big Leagues?,"Kimkibu makes his money betting on sports. Based in South Korea, he mostly trades on Betfair, one of the largest online betting exchanges, where wagers are placed in British pounds, U.S. dollars and other government currencies.  Last year he began trading on cryptocurrency-based platforms including Polymarket, Degens and SX Bet, mainly because the commissions taken out of winnings were cheaper than on Betfair.  ""If I find something similar with low commissions, I move there,"" Kimkibu said.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Still, these alternative betting venues account for only 10% of the Istanbul native’s trades. ""I wish I could totally move to these platforms from Betfair, but, sadly, they don't have enough volume,"" Kimkibu said.  Lurk in any one of more than a half dozen sports betting Discord servers or Telegram channels and you’ll find thousands of people like Kimkibu.  Frustrated with incumbent exchanges’ high costs and minimal innovation, these gamblers are eagerly waiting for the right blockchain-powered sports betting service to open, one with audited smart contracts, user-friendly policies, low commissions and fees – and meaningful volume.  The prize for whoever delivers such a service is ample: According to Grand View Research, the global sports betting market is forecasted to grow to $182.12 billion in revenue by 2030, from $76.75 billion last year.  While users like Kimkibu wait, new builders are jumping in and traditional betting sites are testing the waters of decentralized technology. Regulators are watching.  Stacked deck  The old casino adage, ""The house always wins"" reflects bettors' experience of always being put into an inferior position, with stacked odds. Online betting has faced numerous issues such as account limitations, rejected payouts, a pervasive lack of trust and sense of unfairness, and high fees on deposits and withdrawals.  Winners are not always handsomely rewarded in the traditional sports betting world. Betfair charges a 20% commission, called a premium charge, from players who win more than 250,000 British pounds. Also, some centralized sports betting platforms reserve the right to limit the size of bets. If you are too good at betting, your bet – and hence potential winnings – could be capped.  Some see blockchain technology offering a solution to all those problems: decentralized, transparent platforms that allow customers to control their funds without third-party interference. Each transaction is governed by a smart contract, a self-executing software program. Users wouldn’t have to trust decentralized prediction markets with their funds.  While sports betting may seem like a vice, it has potential benefits for nonparticipants. Much like prediction markets for events like elections or the weather, sports markets challenge traders to put their money where their mouths are. If these markets became big and liquid, the winnings to be had could theoretically encourage those with true expertise to express their beliefs about what will happen through their bets. That, in turn, would provide the public with a more accurate and reliable picture of “expert opinion” than bloviating pundits or sportscasters.  Some accoutrements of the blockchain, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi) activities like yield farming and liquidity provision, could help generate sufficient liquidity and volume to produce high-quality information.  Where to build  Thousands of transactions happen in sports betting each day. Decentralized sports betting exchanges fell victim to high on-chain computation, or gas, fees.  When it launched in March 2018, SX Bet (formerly named SportX), a peer-to-peer betting exchange, was built on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain. With activity during the “DeFi summer” of 2020 driving up gas costs on Ethereum, SX had to pause the addition of new betting markets. It then moved to Polygon, a parallel network to Ethereum where the fees were lower. But Polygon fees started to creep up, too, so in May 2021 the SX and Polygon teams teamed up to build a blockchain just for the sports exchange, with the goal of further cutting transaction costs.  All these projects are still on their way to finding a suitable place to settle down. Various blockchains have different characteristics that might be more appealing to various marketplaces. ""There is just going to be experimentation, like when we figured out different ways to do electricity or communications,"" said Clay Graubard, founder of media and information company Baserate.io and a longtime observer of prediction markets.  Some decentralized sports betting protocols, such as Divvy, Aver and BetDEX, are building on the Solana blockchain, known for its cheap and fast transactions and ability to expand.  ""If there's any delay when it comes to gamblers, they're not going to come back at all,"" said Carlos Liang, the founder of Divvy, a decentralized betting protocol.  However, over the 18 months, Solana has suffered multiple outages.  The elephant in the room  Winning the blessing of regulators is the inevitable hurdle for prediction markets of all stripes, including sports betting exchanges. Some, like Gnosis, have tried hard but failed, then pivoted to becoming an investor, supporting similar projects.  ""We tried to get a license in Gibraltar to operate prediction markets. And it took us several years until we stopped trying,” said Stefan George, the co-founder of Gnosis.  Earlier this year, decentralized predictions platform Polymarket (which offers betting on sports along with politics, coronavirus, crypto and other topics) was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and agreed to bar U.S. residents from trading. It continued to serve traders in other parts of the world and opened new information markets just three weeks after the enforcement action.  Months later, Polymarket signed up J. Christopher Giancarlo, the former head of CFTC, as the new chairman of its advisory board. Harry Jones, a Polymarket representative, told CoinDesk that Giancarlo is a ""very useful addition to the team."" Polymarket’s goal is ""absolutely to return to America with a regulated offering by the CFTC.""  For now, decentralized sports exchanges may not take U.S. money. Only Kalshi, a centralized prediction market platform, is licensed by the CFTC to list event contracts. (PredictIt, a popular site for election markets, operates under a special dispensation from the CFTC.) However, there are no sports markets among Kalshi’s offerings. No wonder: Cryptocurrency derivatives platform ErisX withdrew a proposal to list future contracts tied to the outcome of National Football League games, anticipating that the CFTC would deem it to be prohibited gambling.  If the CFTC were to change its stance, such markets could serve a valid risk-management function for sports-related businesses, much like wheat futures contracts protect farmers from wild price swings, argues Brian Quintenz, former CFTC commissioner.  ""If you're a restaurant owner whose business fluctuates wildly, depending on the success of a sports team [and] there's actually now a contract that allows them to hedge some of that risk, why is that any less legitimate?"" said Quintenz, who is now a Kalshi board member but spoke in his capacity as a private individual.  One foot in, one foot out  Eyeing the rising builders in decentralized sports betting projects, some legacy sports betting players appear to be doubling down on their crypto plans.  After its marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFT) clocked $44 million in sales, sports betting giant DraftKings became a Polygon network validator. DraftKings’ public development roadmap calls the potential to accept crypto payments from customers a ""win/win"" proposition. Customers want to be able to pay with crypto, and DraftKings wants to accept it, the company said.  Stake.com, an online casino licensed by the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, is a step ahead of DraftKings and then some: it deals only in cryptocurrencies.  In the eyes of blockchain-based sports betting projects, merely accepting crypto pales in comparison to what they are building. However, the incremental steps taken by centralized players could draw more retail participants to crypto and Web3, making the pie bigger.  ""I think that whatever applications that are built in the ecosystem to go after the much larger user base and slowly bring them on are only beneficial to everyone who's in that,"" said Varun Sudhakar, CEO and co-founder at BetDEX Labs Inc.  Game time?  George at Gnosis said now is at least a much better time to build a decentralized sports betting platform than when his firm tried.  But there are still lots of problems that need to be addressed. The most prominent one is the lack of volume.  SX Bet told CoinDesk in an email that it is a week or so away from hitting $200 million in cumulative bets since inception. Over half of that volume has happened in the last six months alone. However, by Kimkibu’s reckoning, Betfair could do that much volume in a month.  Solutions are also brewing. Some projects aim to utilize DeFi technology to attract liquidity and boost volume. Azuro, in which Gnosis is an investor, claims that it has created a new liquidity pool design, allowing any liquidity providers to contribute to the pool and gain exposure to all betting markets happening on the protocol. The money in the pool will be used for seeding initial liquidity behind thousands of betting markets.  Although Gnosis stepped back to become a behind-the-scenes supporter in this area, it learned a lesson that, in the end, the winner of this race would be the one that can get in the next wave of users.  But at least gaining those crypto natives should be a good start. Lots of participants, like Kimkibu, have been waiting a long time for a suitable service to arrive.  ""Hopefully, next year with new startups I'm hoping to bring at least 50% of my trades to those projects,"" Kimkibu said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/26/is-crypto-sports-betting-ready-for-the-big-leagues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7d33c94aea5fa6ea6678ec1bd10721ee49b281f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411437,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlDQ,1658852644,Sports Picked up the Web3 Ball. Now Let Everyone Run With It,"Every aspect of modern life is going fully digital. This is causing our expectations about the ways we interact with the “old economy” to shift dramatically. Sports, however, has been extremely slow to adapt when compared with other industries. Momentum is now building, in both amateur and professional sectors. And while sports tech is a fast-growing category, sports will have to do more than just “get an app” to survive and thrive.  Web3 infrastructure is the key to unlocking new digital markets for sports. These new rails also provide compelling solutions to historical problems in marketing, sales and sponsorships as well as for franchise and venue operations. There is a robust conversation taking place right now about a generational opportunity to reshape outdated distribution models and create a more equitable and transparent system. It’s important to understand the choke points, progress to date and roadmap toward a level playing field.  Joseph Bradley is head of business development at Heirloom, a software-as-a-service startup building tools that make it easy for enterprises to enter Web3. This article is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Web3 adoption in sports to date has been tepid and experimental. The National Football League (NFL) picked up the ball with the so-called Crypto Bowl in February, giving away a commemorative non-fungible token (NFT) with each ticket sale. But the effect, like actor Matt Damon’s much-derided “Fortune Favors the Brave” ad for Crypto.com, was both showy and shallow. It was a missed opportunity to demonstrate blockchain’s true utility.  That’s not to say the context isn’t challenging. The coronavirus pandemic initially stalled adoption of new technologies. Venues closed; when they re-opened they continued to languish. In-person attendance at sporting events was already down and it is showing no signs of recovery. Latest figures for Major League Baseball (MLB) show 23 out of 30 teams are down in attendance this season. The average attendance at National Basketball Association (NBA) games is down 3.7%, and in the National Hockey League (NHL) attendance is down 9.3%, both compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Sponsors are understandably seeking change. We are witnessing the underlying friction of converging traditional, “messy” real-world transactions with digital systems that will provide scale and resilience for the business model.  Professional sports buy-in  With all of the recent turbulence, conditions are still ripe for innovation. When sports leagues were grounded in 2020, the need for sports to go digital was underscored. Additionally the pandemic gave leagues, teams and all other associated businesses the opportunity to start the much-needed digital transformation. This in the context of the explosion of Web3, where potential has been compelling. Even just five years ago some business processes would have been almost impossible to transition. Web3 unlocks solutions at the confluence of much-needed process efficiency and new revenue opportunities. With blockchain-enabled technologies, a new commercial landscape is made possible.  Professional sports is beginning to slowly lean into the new paradigm. The NFL now allows teams to partner with blockchain tech companies for sponsorships. For the moment, deals can’t run past three years. Of course, this isn’t all-out adoption of the technology but it’s certainly a step in the right direction.  Crypto is the second-highest spending sector in NBA sponsorships this year. Sponsorships often come with visibility into the sponsored organization and provide a sense of legitimacy to the leagues and teams. (Think gambling apps prior to large scale adoption.) The fusion of these real and digital worlds is accelerating. And with that fusion there are growing markets for data capture and analytics, esports, NFTs and immersive technologies. All of them require novel data handling that lends itself to the Web3 paradigm.  This buy-in is global. Just one recent example: Digital media platform OneFootball was named last week as the “official video moments partner” of Serie A, the Italian soccer league. The deal awarded rights to mint and distribute NFTs based on video clips of matches. OneFootball, which this year secured $300 million in funding to develop Web3 projects, has a similar partnership with the German Bundesliga soccer league. Across all sports, Web3 is helping build more personalized connections between brands and their fans.  Amateur athletics’ seismic shift  Sports-based blockchain products are likely to have an even greater impact on amateur sport as the very nature of how these sports monetize is evolving. We have an overdue chance to remodel the college sports ecosystem – to the benefit of both schools and athletes. Tectonic plates are shifting in the wake of legislation passed by some U.S. states allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness (NIL) and the subsequent response from the major college sports authority, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).  Its new policies quite literally changed the game. Now all student athletes can take advantage of commercial opportunities directly. As a result, we now have the chance to address the problems and ambiguities amateur sports has lived with for far too long as a direct result of the professionalization of amateur sports. Not least the complex accounting arrangements for sales of merchandise.  Who does own value resulting from sales of named jerseys, or posters depicting players in action? The university or the student? Schools are exploring how things will play out in this new set of rules.  While the end-state may not yet be totally clear, more concrete is the starting point.  Blockchain-based solutions are the key to this and other historical conundrums. Specifically, we mean self-sovereign identities (SSI) and transactional efficiency. SSIs, digital identities managed in a decentralized system, give individuals sole ownership and control over how their personal data is used. Self-sovereignty is achieved via a combination of NFTs, decentralized identifiers (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) depending on the use case. These create private yet provable authentication and authorization agreements.  This makes all information both private and available. All parties in the arrangement can now have access to only the critical information they need. Schools and the NCAA can ensure the guidelines are followed while students, brokers and brands can have deal details kept private.The market is thrown open to student athletes with greater self-determination – and also to the colleges they represent.  Tokenized contracts, multi-signature wallets and traceable, searchable records bring transparency to athlete compensation and to individual or team revenue streams. Merchandise, licensing deals, TV syndication, streaming, parking income and concessions – all can be reflected with extreme granularity for all parties involved. This is Web3-driven transactional efficiency at scale.  Enabling these types of interactions does not mean ripping out legacy technical systems that rely on Web2 architecture. Web2 rails and primitives are still very much a part of the picture. This is precisely what makes this opportunity achievable. The blockchain workflow necessary to weld Web2 to effective blockchain workflow is now available. The goal is to amplify what is in place while introducing technology that force multiplies the desired end state. After all, Web2 accreted with intelligently architected blockchain systems creates Web3.  Better fan experience, deeper fan engagement  What can Web3 offer sports fans?  NFTs’ power to unite digital with physical utility has already begun to take flight. We’ve seen how these unique assets can create game tickets and immortalize historic moments, like a Lebron James slam dunk. But loyalty programs, coupons, unique collectibles – even preferred parking spots – will continue to drive new levels of synchronicity in the experience for the fans. A more cohesive fan experience is the prelude for additional sports-related products and services to be optimized at a personal level for fans' financial behaviors. By creating systems that empower fans to engage on their terms, leagues and teams can seamlessly interweave an individualized fan experience with the economics of sports. Better experience means a more robust bottom line.  I’m not going to suggest that a transition of this magnitude is going to be overnight. It’s true that the end state is not yet totally clear, particularly for examples like the adoption of NIL regulations for NCAA schools. Nevertheless a new paradigm has emerged. It’s compelling, it’s already here and available.  The sports world is evolving to the new demands that a digital-first fanbase demands. Sponsors, athletes, leagues and teams will all be the beneficiaries if this architecture is properly implemented. At scale new revenue streams and dramatically decreased transactional friction across almost every aspect the ecosystem will synchronize the needs and wants of the athlete, the fan, the team and the leagues. The focus will then be on the very reason all are here – the sport itself.  Now it’s time to enjoy the game.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Joseph Bradley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/26/sports-picked-up-the-web3-ball-now-let-everyone-run-with-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ed8ea8f7ead8195da5705329f8ad62dcb66c7dc-3213x2410.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Each edition of the “Sky’s the Limit” generative profile picture (PFP) collection grants its holders voting rights over distribution of a previously unlicensed Notorious B.I.G. (whose real name is Christopher Wallace) freestyle. Artists can sample the freestyle in their own music “with the approval and oversight of the collective (and estate),” according to a press release.  The collaboration is the first NFT release of its kind for the rapper's estate. The NFTs will also give holders access to The Brook Metaverse, another venture from the estate that will soon be released as a “culture, music and entertainment metaverse.”  The collective’s voting proposals will be communicated through a private, token-gated Discord channel, according to the site, with any revenue made from sampling the freestyle going directly back to the platform.  Wayne Barrow, the estate’s manager, told CoinDesk he has been working with the slain rapper’s mother for a decade. “We're always trying to maximize where we are and get innovative on how we approach things for the future,” Barrow said.  As Web3 partnerships in the entertainment sphere become more popular, estates of late legends have been quick to try their hands at the new technology. The Elvis Presley estate made its first foray into the metaverse last January in partnership with Decentraland as part of a larger effort to create a Web3 “vault” of the artist’s intellectual property.  Even with OneOf’s partnerships extending outside the music realm in recent months, Josh James, the company’s co-founder, sees the collaboration with Biggie’s estate as its largest yet.  “Once we closed the deal, I think we all felt this weight. Like wow, we're doing this with Biggie,” James told CoinDesk in an interview. “We needed to make sure that we would respect his legacy, and I think we felt a responsibility to do it in the most authentic and real way possible.”  The platform’s drop party is in collaboration with EmpireDAO, a recently opened crypto co-working space in New York's lower Manhattan.

The crypto is dipping 4.8% to $20.85K as of around 11:15 a.m. ET, while ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is dropping nearly 9.5% to $1.38K over the past 24 hours. In turn, the global crypto market cap is falling 4.6% to under $1T, standing at $956.5B at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data. The crypto slump comes as all three major stock indices are pulling back, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( COMP.IND ) -1.5% getting hit the hardest, as traders weigh disappointing economic data ranging from the housing market to consumer confidence . That's on top of additional downbeat headlines that have shaken up the stock market, as more companies announce prospects for slower growth in the midst of Q2 earnings season. Shopify ( SHOP ), for example, was said to slash 10% of its workforce as it pulls back on e-commerce growth forecasts. In addition, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision Wednesday, as a bigger than expected rate hike could bode poorly for equities and hence crypto prices. Some of the big percentage decliners in the cryptosphere intraday are: cardano ( ADA-USD ) -7.3% , solana ( SOL-USD ) -8.7% , dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) -6.2% , polygon ( MATIC-USD ) -10.3% , avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) -7.8% , shiba inu ( SHIB-USD ) -7.2% and uniswap ( UNI-USD ) -9.8% .

As part of the agreement, Core is getting prepayments that will fund the additional infrastructure needed to host the miners, the company said in a press release.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves.  Core has a blend of self-mining and hosting operations. In the first quarter, the company earned $33.2 million from its hosting business, which was about 17% of its total revenue, according to a recent presentation.  In recent months, demand for hosting crypto miners has seen an uptick as infrastructure and power supply-related delays – as well as lack of capital – have caused bottlenecks for miners who are often now finding themselves with more mining rigs than available power.  Core said the server deployments for the new hosting deal will start in the third quarter, with estimated completion expected this year. This addition will have Core operating about 325,000 rigs – self-mining and hosting – by the end of 2022.

The two-day slide marks a clear breakdown of the six-day trading range of $1,460 to $1,660.  Sellers appear to be in total control, as evident from the nearly absent lower and upper wicks in Monday's candle and the going candle charts. Such candlesticks represent a bearish mood and often portend deeper declines.  The daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes, is charting smaller bars above the zero line, a sign of loss of upward momentum.  The focus, therefore, has shifted to the 50-day simple moving average at $1,293. Resistance is seen at the previous week's high of $1,664, followed by $2,160, the interim low registered on Jan. 24.  ""A pullback in ether may find initial support at the 50-day MA (~$1,293), but we expect an eventual retest of interim support ($1,000) on the next down leg,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a research note published Monday, noting short-term signs of investor exhaustion.  Stockton attributed the pullback from recent highs to short-term signs of exhaustion and said ether would take at least a few months to establish a major low.  An anticipated interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday seems to have taken center stage away from the supposedly bullish Ethereum blockchain's coming Merge, tentatively due on Sept. 19, which powered last week's rally from $1,200 to $1,660.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  In today’s newsletter:  Price Point: BTC is down 5% on the day and one trader predicts the world's largest cryptocurrency could hit lows of $15,000 in August due to a worsening macro environment.  Market Moves: Stablecoin tether has found stability for the first time in over two months. One trader said while tether has passed the market's stress test with a return to normalcy, concerns about its reserves will linger.  Chart of The Day: Ether's options market has turned cautious, Omkar Godbole writes.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading down 5% on Tuesday morning as global markets dropped. U.S. stock futures slipped as investors analyzed recent earning reports and awaited results from technology companies.  Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet will post their quarterly financial results after the U.S. market close on Tuesday. Amazon and Apple will report on Thursday. Also, the Federal Reserve is set to announce another interest rate hike on Wednesday.  Mike Schwitalla, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, said in a note Tuesday that the Fed’s decision will be more or less a ""nonevent.""  “Due to the good forward guidance of the Fed in recent weeks, I think the market is adequately positioned, and it will be more of a nonevent,” he said.  BTC might see levels as low as $15,000 in August because of the worsening macro environment, Schwitalla said. “We can see the medium-term downtrend, which has been in place since April.”  The horizontal lines in the chart above are supports and resistances.  “The big question now is whether or not the market can break through this trendline. In case of a breakout, prices of $29,000 are possible in the short term,” Schwitalla said.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently down 8.8% at about $1,400. Other altcoins were trading in the red on Tuesday, with near taking the largest hit, down 11.5%.  In other news, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly probing publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase on suspicion that Coinbase allowed trading of unregistered securities.  Meanwhile, some U.S. senators are trying to free Americans from tracking taxes every time cryptocurrencies change hands, introducing a bill that would exempt individuals from reporting any trade in which they earn less than $50.  Hong Kong-based crypto exchange OSL Digital Securities is set to distribute security tokens to professional investors in a private security token offering. The Ethereum-developed tokens distributed represented a $10,000 worth of a coupon-rate USD bond linked to the performance of bitcoin.  Also, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has sued Bloomberg Businessweek’s publisher Modern Media on defamation claims over a translated Chinese language article title that portrayed the crypto exchange chief as running a “Ponzi scheme.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC −10.5% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH −9.7% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA −9.6% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Tether (USDT), a stablecoin meant to be worth a dollar, has found stability for the first time in over two months.  The world's largest stablecoin by market value regained its dollar peg on July 20 and has remained steady since then, the first such instance since the collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD or UST (now TerraClassicUSD) in the second week of May.  Terra's UST, the-then third-largest stablecoin in the world, tanked on May 12, spurring panic selling in other dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Tether's peg broke, and the token fell to as low as 92 cents on some exchanges following UST's crash and averaged about 99 cents in June.  Tether's market capitalization has declined by $16 billion to $65 billion in two months, a sign of large redemptions by holders. This means that the company behind USDT, Tether Ltd., honored billions of dollars' worth of redemptions following UST's meltdown. Tether Ltd. has long been criticized for the lack of transparency about the nature of assets backing the stablecoin.  In other words, tether has passed the market's stress test, withstanding redemptions in volatile conditions and eventually reclaiming the peg.  ""The past two months have definitely been a stress test for stablecoins following the collapse of UST and sharp contraction in USDT's market cap,"" Clara Medalie, research director at crypto data provider Kaiko, said. ""Tether proved its ability to process billions in redemptions, despite lingering questions over the makeup of its reserves.""  It remains to be seen if tether's recent resilience bolsters investor confidence in the stablecoin, and trader and crypto analyst Alex Kruger is still skeptical about the stablecoin's resilience. Tether is heavily used in the bitcoin market and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Read the full story here: Tether Finds Stable Dollar Peg After Terra's Collapse  Chart of the Day  By Omkar Godbole  Ether's options market has turned cautious ahead of an expected Federal Reserve rate increase on Wednesday.  The put-call skews have turned positive, indicating renewed demand for puts or options offering protection against price drops.  Traders appear to be worried that macroeconomic factors may overpower the Merge optimism, yielding a fresh decline in ether.  The put-call skews fell below zero last week, indicating a bullish bias as updated deadline for the ETH Merge saw investors pile into call options.

While it remains to hover above the 50-day moving average, ADA may drop further down by $0.45 in the next 24 hours as the bears take control of the market. ADA has a fantastic weekend as it glided way up to $0.52 on July 24. However, the coin slid to $0.48 as a result of the issues involved in the Vasil upgrade. ADA bulls are trying to touch the $0.55 resistance level hoping to make a grand comeback but if it plummets to $0.45, then bulls would need to try harder. Suggested Reading | Cardano (ADA) Spikes 8%, Overtakes XRP In Last 24 Hours Cardano Bearish Movement Similar To Bitcoin’s Bitcoin movement has capsized similarly to Cardano’s bearish movement. Bitcoin has currently plunged below the $22,000 zone showing a drop of 4%. More so, Ethereum also dropped by 5% or $1,500 in price. All other major altcoins also plummeted in price. Dogecoin dipped to $0.06, Ripple plunged to $0.34, Polkadot lost 5%, and Solana slid further down by 6%. As seen in the recent 24-hour candlestick chart, Cardano’s price is forming the Evening Star pattern. It has rallied over the weekend hovering at $0.53 but ADA succumbed to the bears and registered a low price point as depicted in the past 48 hours. While the price looks favorable and is on top of the 50-day moving average, it has somewhat slipped into a dangerous coma at $0.493. Cardano RSI has moved further down to 50.96 from 58.22 in just a few hours which indicated a decline in market valuation. This also confirms ADA’s bearish momentum. More so, the coin’s trading volume also dropped by 33% overnight which implies that is very minimal buying action taking place. Additionally, its MACD or moving average convergence divergence curve also shows to be shooting for a bearish forking. ADA total market cap at $15.4 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com ADA Bulls To Tilt Market Dynamics ADA price can dangerously go down to $0.47 in the next couple of hours. With that in mind, ADA price will need to hold onto dear life at the support line of $0.45 to retain its bullish momentum in the market. The entire crypto market has been dominantly bearish for the past few days and Cardano has been devalued excessively with the next support level down at $0.457. The past week for Cardano has shown a somewhat zigzag pattern in terms of price action but now it seems the bears have dominated the market. ADA has shaved off as much as 5.74 in value. With the increased volatility happening and the bearish pressure mounting, more downturns are expected. Currently, the bulls are trying to overpower the bears but the bulls will need to hold on to the support line to tilt the market dynamics in their favor.

447137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496694,1658842211,Fanzee Raises $2M To Help Football Clubs Offer Gamified Experiences To Their Fans,"Fanzee said today it has closed on a $2 million round of funding to bring its idea of a Ton blockchain-based sports fan engagement platform. The startup has built a fan engagement platform aimed at sports clubs that want to increase their level of interaction with their fans, enabling them to foster a greater sense of community and reward their most loyal supporters. It’s an idea that has won considerable backing from investors such as TONcoin.fund, MEXC Pioneer, KuCoin Ventures, Huobi Incubator, vlg.digital, 3Commas, Orbs.com, and Hexit.capital, a part of Swiss based Hemma Group, to name just a few. Fanzee CEO Ajay Jojo said he is honored to have received the backing of some of the greatest minds in the Web3 movement and promised to deliver “immense value” to millions of sports fans by leveraging digital assets such as NFTs. Fanzee’s platform makes use of blockchain innovations such as tokenization to help sports clubs create interactive challenges such as quizzes. With it, they can effectively gamify fan loyalty programs and unlock new revenue streams, Fanzee said, while rewarding those fans for their participation. For instance, Fanzee can help soccer teams to create matchday challenges such as a morning quiz that’s based on the events from the previous match, and player-vs-player challenges where fans can bet on important match events with their friends. Other ideas include an end of match quiz designed to test fans on how closely they followed the game, and an end of match challenge that involves collecting three video moments from the game. By participating in these challenges, fans will be able to earn prizes such as experience points, NFT tokens and cryptocurrency (such as a club’s specific coin). Each fan who participates will be able to sign up and earn points towards their “fan level”. In that way, clubs could create their own fan leaderboards that rank all of their fans. This will inspire fans to step up their interaction in order to move on up the leaderboard to win even more valuable prizes. For example, a club could offer NFTs to its highest ranked fans that function as a match day ticket for the next home game. Fanzee will also operate a third-party marketplace where fans can come together to buy and sell digital assets relating to their clubs. So if someone wins an NFT providing a free ticket to the next game, but they’re unable to be there, they can sell that NFT to someone else who is able to take advantage of it. What’s more, Fanzee abstracts away the complexity of using crypto wallets by automating these processes for fans that like to keep things simple. Mark Chadwick, Head of Diligence at TONcoin.fund, a $250 million growth fund for projects building on the TON blockchain, said Fanzee’s focus is on bringing sport fans to the forefront by engaging with them in ways that were never possible before. “Fanzee’s platform, with its gamification mechanics, will generate true value for sports organizations and their fans,” Chadwick insisted.

Also, a quick personal note: I’ll be at the Asian American Journalists Association annual conference in Los Angeles this week. If you’re also going, say hi! CoinDesk will be at booth 310.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  White glove treatment  The narrative  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that nine cryptocurrencies are securities.  Why it matters  The SEC calling a cryptocurrency a security is not new. What is new is it doing so in a legal filing that doesn’t directly address the issuers of the tokens. The regulator appears to be laying the groundwork for bringing crypto trading platforms more fully into its umbrella.  Breaking it down  So, uh, did the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just announce that Coinbase, a publicly traded company it oversees, illegally listed noncompliant securities in an insider trading complaint?  (*Monday night edit: Lol. See below for more.)  The SEC alleged that nine cryptocurrencies, several of which are listed on Coinbase, are securities, in a complaint against three individuals arrested for insider trading (the Department of Justice also filed charges; it’s worth noting that Coinbase is not the defendant in any of these charges).  The full list includes Flexa's amp (AMP), rally (RLY), the rari governance token (RGT), derivaDAO (DDX), XYO (XYO), LCX (LCX), powerledger (POWR), DFX finance (DFX) and kromatika (KROM).  This appears to have taken everyone by surprise.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Flexa spokesperson said the company was “not contacted by the SEC” prior to the complaint being released and has “significant questions about the conclusions regarding AMP.”  The CEO of LCX tweeted that his token was approved by legal counsel and recognized as being a nonsecurity outside the U.S. (though it’s worth bearing in mind that even if something is not a security outside the U.S., it may still be a security within the U.S.)  It seems a fair assumption that the SEC must be planning on taking further action here. That could look like an enforcement action against Coinbase or against the issuers, but the base of this allegation is that these nine cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. It’s hard to imagine the SEC enforcement team shrugging its shoulders and saying “mission accomplished, time to move on” without doing anything further.  It’s likely going to be a legal fight though.  Coinbase published a blog post, authored by Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, saying “we … 100% disagree with the SEC’s decision to file these securities fraud charges and the substance of the charges themselves.”  The exchange went a step further: “Seven of the nine assets included in the SEC’s charges are listed on Coinbase’s platform. None of these assets are securities,” Grewal wrote.  It’s worth pointing out that the SEC laid out why it believes these cryptocurrencies are securities in the complaint, detailing how the agency’s attorneys applied the Howey Test to each asset. Coinbase – so far at least – has not detailed why it believes the assets are not securities.  It’s an open question as to what happens next. Typically, when the SEC says a certain asset is a security, it does so through either an enforcement action against or a settlement with the issuer.  That didn’t happen here.  You normally see exchanges rushing to delist or suspend trading in the alleged securities.  Again, that didn’t happen here.  The SEC is challenging Coinbase, and Coinbase for its part is challenging the regulator right back.  One frequent complaint about the SEC is that it is not providing clear regulatory guidelines for the industry. The counter to this viewpoint is that the Howey Test and other existing laws and regulations do, in fact, address how securities laws can or should apply to digital assets.  Last week’s action would suggest the SEC is continuing to support this latter view. Again, one of the remarkable aspects is that the SEC dedicated several pages of its complaint to explaining just why, in its view, the named assets are securities.  And SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s been pretty clear about his endgame. He wants cryptocurrency exchanges (namely, Coinbase, as one example) to register with the regulator as national securities exchanges.  Identifying assets already listed is a pretty dramatic step toward encouraging Coinbase to register (read: forcing).  To add to the oddness of Thursday’s actions, two Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officials also weighed in, saying their agency could have brought charges.  One of the statements, by Commissioner Caroline Pham, even took aim at the SEC for “regulation by enforcement,” before going on to suggest that the tokens may not be securities.  “The SEC complaint alleges that dozens of digital assets, including those that could be described as utility tokens and/or certain tokens relating to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), are securities,” Pham said in her statement.  (While other jurisdictions have detailed what a “utility token” may look like, the U.S. has so far not formally acknowledged the potential for a token to be a utility token, to the best of my knowledge.)  In a tweet from her personal account, Pham later said that the CFTC also has insider trading jurisdiction.  Commissioner Kristin Johnson likewise said in a statement that the different financial market regulators “stand united.”  “We must continue to work collaboratively to adopt a whole-of-government approach to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of important policy and regulatory debates and to ensure the protection of retail investors and preservation of the safety and soundness of our financial system,” Johnson said.  Admittedly I’ve only really been paying attention for a handful of years now, but I’ve never seen officials with a government agency weigh in on another agency’s enforcement action quite like this before.  By the way, in what appears to be a coincidence, Coinbase petitioned the SEC to ask for regulatory clarity, saying existing securities laws do not necessarily fit the digital asset infrastructure.  And on Monday night, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was looking into Coinbase for possibly listing securities. Gee, I wonder if the agency’s enforcement division has any specific assets in mind?  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Michael Barr has been sworn in as the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, and the SEC has a full slate of commissioners after Jaime Lizárraga was sworn in last week.

The broker downgraded the stock to underperform from hold with an unchanged price target of $180. MSTR shares fell 7% in pre-market trading.  MicroStrategy is a “tale of two cities” – bitcoin (BTC) and the core business intelligence (BI) business, Jefferies said. The company now holds 129,200 BTC, and the investment is generating losses due to the fall in the bitcoin price.  Bitcoin now makes up 52% of the company's enterprise value (EV) at $2.8 billion, which translates to a $1 billion unrealized loss on a $3.97 billion investment.  The downgrade is due to three main factors, the note said. It will be harder to execute large-scale BI deployments in the near term due to the tougher macro environment, execution surrounding the cloud transition has been “subpar” leading to a decline in billings growth and the stock trades at a premium relative to comparable companies.  For the second quarter, the broker forecasts total revenue growth of 4% (more than the analyst consensus of 3%), non-GAAP operating margins of 13.6%, compared with consensus at 15.5% and a total billings decline of 6% compared with expectations of 6% growth.  MicroStrategy has been a “visionary” on BTC and has established itself as a “thought leader” in the industry, the note said, adding that management has increased leverage on its balance sheet and issued new shares for more bitcoin investment. Management is expected to provide an update on the company’s intent to continue to invest in BTC, the note added.

The SEC is looking into major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase for dealing with unregistered securities, a word that authorities have been using to expressly refer to cryptocurrencies, which sparked outrage in response to recent news reports. The SEC filed prosecution against Coinbase four years after it was permitted to IPO using XRP and other tokens that were “now under scrutiny,” which particularly incensed the creators of Cryptolaw. As a matter of fact, Coinbase delisted XRP after investigations into the exchange started in December 2020 and regulators took note of the exchange’s strategy to lawfully handle assets. Regardless of how one feels about Coinbase and its CEO Brian Armstrong, in Deaton’s view, the regulation does not operate in this way, and the SEC’s activities, which started with the XRP case, prompted the crypto community to interact with the regulator. has been included in the conflict. SEC’s Investigation Into Coinbase The information released today concerning the SEC’s investigation into Coinbase adds to a report from the previous week about the arrest of a former exchange employee on suspicion of insider trading. The exchange responded by filing a lawsuit against the suspect, but the suspect denied dealing with unregistered securities, citing the regulator’s outdated interpretation of the law and highlighting the need for clarity in the regulation of cryptocurrencies as a whole. The conversation also chastised the SEC for employing coercive tactics rather than open dialogue. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, also referenced this mindset when he claimed that the SEC was taking a coercive stance rather than attempting to create clear regulations for the sector.

We should be paying close attention to GDP growth statistics on Thursday as analysts estimated a growth of roughly 0.5%. Meanwhile, a GDP that hovers below 0.5% will give away a bearish movement for both the digital and traditional markets. A negative sentiment is predictive of the possibility that the economy will move into recession. If in case the price range doesn’t hold up at $22,000, Bitcoin may fall in a heap at $19,000. It’s apparent that BTC is attempting to keep with the tremendous selling pressure initiated by the bears.

The world economy is being battered by high inflation and potentially its second recession in just over two years, the IMF said, given the impact of the Ukraine war and continued COVID lockdowns. However, markets like bitcoin, isolated from conventional banks, don’t seem to be a worry, the report says.  That relative calm comes despite recent collapses, such as the terraUSD stablecoin and Three Arrows Capital fund – turbulence that has made some regulators keen to exert greater control on the burgeoning market.  “Spillovers to the broader financial system have been limited so far,” the IMF said, citing a “dramatic sell-off that has led to large losses” for crypto investors.  In a June report, the European Systemic Risk Board said the continued rising popularity of crypto could mean wider financial market threats arise “quickly and suddenly.” The IMF itself has also called for more regulation of the sector, and has warned El Salvador to quit using bitcoin as legal tender.  Standard-setters worldwide are also working to set out exactly how banks should start getting into crypto markets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed a cap on bitcoin holdings – alongside a hefty capital requirement that would limit banks’ ability to lend based on crypto reserves.

The company's bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) investment keeps losing money in a challenging macro backdrop in a move that's fueling a 53% slump in its stock price YTD. While a slew of crypto-related firms are selling their holdings in the crypto, ""we expect an update on management's intent to continue to invest in bitcoin,"" as part of its devoted HODL strategy, Thill wrote in a note to clients. Furthermore, Thill attributed his downbeat coverage to MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) lack of execution on its Business Intelligence business amid a tougher macro backdrop, and ""execution surrounding the cloud transition has been sub-par,"" Thill explained. As MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is still in the early stages of its multi-year cloud transition, subscription billings growth fell to 18% in Q1 vs. 53% in Q4 2021 in the wake of macro uncertainty, the note said. As such, ""we will be watching to see if subs. billings can sustain growth momentum in Q2, or whether it decelerates further from Q1."" With MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) expected to report earnings next week, Thill sees revenue growth of 4% vs. the average Wall Street estimate of 3%; adjusted operating margins, excluding impairment losses, of 13.6% vs. Street at 15.5%; and billings growth of -6% vs. Street at 6%. SA contributor Juxtaposed Ideas believes MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) will announce another miss for Q2 ""given the destructive effects of the crypto winter and the CEO's doubling down on Bitcoin.""

Futures tracking ether racked up $88 million in losses, the most among crypto futures, as traders took profits following the move from $1,100 to over $1,600 in the past few weeks.  In the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) fell 4.4%, trading at just over support at $21,000 in European afternoon hours, with XRP and BNB mirroring the losses. Ether slid 8.8%, leading losses among major cryptocurrencies, with Solana’s SOL and dogecoin each dropping more than 7%.  “Without support from stock indices, the cryptocurrency market is buckling under its own weight with no meaningful growth drivers,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk. Current market conditions, he said, were “fueling expectations of a prolonged lull, which fit into historical patterns.”  ""Bitcoin bottom signals continued this week, but no clear buy signal emerged and the macroeconomic situation still dominates,” said Martin Hiesboeck, head of crypto research at Uphold, a crypto trading platform. He said a 75-basis point hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve this week is more likely than a 100-basis point increase, but he isn't expecting a big decrease in volatility in either case.

On Monday, Infrawatch PH submitted a twelve-page complaint urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines to take action against Binance’s operations there. Infrawatch PH, a think tank in the Philippines, is continuing its campaign to get Binance banned there by requesting that additional regulators look into the cryptocurrency exchange’s suspected unlawful business practices. The research group claims Binance has been conducting business illegally in the Philippines for several years. Infrawatch PH convenor Terry Ridon asserted that Binance does not have a presence in Manila and solely employs “third-party firms” that hire Filipinos for its technical and customer support services. He also referred Carlos Dominguez, a former finance secretary, who stated in public last month that Binance has no records with the SEC or the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Benefits of SEC’s Decision to Public The public has benefited from SEC’s decision to outlaw dishonest internet lending businesses. The nation’s unlicensed and unregulated exchanges for cryptocurrencies should also follow suit, according to Ridon. He noted that despite not having an SEC registration, Binance has been providing a variety of cryptocurrency products, including spot trading, margin trading, futures contracts, options, crypto loans, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, adding: “We believe these products are in the nature of securities, which under SEC rules, may not be sold or offered for or distribution within the Philippines without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.” The news comes following the Philippine Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) rejected a petition to prohibit Binance in early July, citing the BSP’s lack of regulatory clarity. Infrawatch PH’s objections against Binance were primarily directed at the DTI, and the think tank requested that the agency looks into the issue of unlawful marketing.

With so many constraints on how people can carry and express themselves in the real world, the metaverse has provided a much-needed escape to a place where there are no rules to self-expression. One metaverse project that has stuck firmly to this freedom of self-expression is the OVER Metaverse. The project has previously provided users the opportunity to customize and dress their avatars how they see fit, but it still remained limited to the range of preset outfits available. However, with its latest innovation, OVER will allow avatars to be dressed however and in whatever a user wants as they craft their Digital Identity. Purchase Clothes As NFTs Fashion often transcends time, and with the metaverse innovations, it is now transcending realities. The virtual reality world of the OVER Metaverse allows all users to be and present how they want. Its most recent innovation, the development of Fashion 4.0, will bring even more freedoms to this virtual reality. Before now, there was no way to purchase clothing in the metaverse. However, with OVER, users can have a “wardrobe” for their avatars according to their preferences. This means they are no longer limited to the preset fashion options available in the metaverse. Users can dress their digital twin in any clothing across a range of styles. This will change the precedent in the metaverse space that avatars do not need to be fashionable. For many individuals living in places where they are restricted on the type of clothing they can wear, their digital identities will be able to sport whatever clothing suits their preferences, thus promoting Freedom of Expression even in this virtual world. The TINUS Affiliate Program Anywhere there is fashion, there are bound to be designers, and OVER recognizes this. This is why the TINUS Affiliate Program exists. This program allows users to create clothing for others to buy and sell as NFTs in the metaverse. Not only can they create their own clothing, but they will be able to buy and wear original digital NFT creations that are designed by 3D artists and fashion houses. OVER plans to establish itself as a reference point for the diffusion of 3D creations from artists and fashion brands. It also supports the Freedom of Expression through this avenue by allowing stylists to create to their heart’s content and users to be able to patronize their favorite fashion brands. The OVER Metaverse will feature a dedicated space in the newest OVER Marketplace just for fashion creators and brands. Creator and brand will have their section where they can showcase their clothing, and users can buy the digital clothing. About OVER Metaverse The OVER Metaverse is a world-scale platform that bridges the real and virtual worlds. By combining the innovative technologies of augmented reality and the Ethereum blockchain, it is able to bring an immersive virtual experience to anyone with a smart device and an internet connection. OVER Metaverse caters primarily to interaction and content creation in the virtual world. This means that users can create and monetize 3D content, as well as participate in play-to-earn games.

(TBIS) entered a guilty plea for his part in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme that involves generating roughly $21 million through an ICO. In accordance with the prosecutors, the CEO and founder of TBIS, Michael Alan Stollery, 54, of Reseda, California, promoted TBIS as a cryptocurrency investment opportunity and used a number of false and deceptive claims to convince investors to buy “BARs,” the cryptocurrency token or coin offered by TBIS’s ICO. Stollery failed to register the ICO relating to TBIS’s cryptocurrency investment offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), despite being obliged to do so and failing to possess a legitimate exemption from the SEC’s registration requirements. The white papers, which inform investors of the cryptocurrency investment opportunity and its goal and underlying technology, were faked, according to Stollery’s claims to the authorities. False Relationships With Federal Reserve Moreover, according to the justice, Stollery misrepresented his relationships with the Federal Reserve and a number of other well-known firms by posting fake client testimonials on his company website. It stated that he had acknowledged combining investor money with personal funds spent on things unrelated to his business, such as paying credit card bills and expenses for his Hawaii apartment. Stollery entered a guilty plea to a single count of securities fraud. The maximum term for him is 20 years in jail, and his sentencing date is set for November 18.

John Momtazee, a co-founder of Moelis, will serve as the leader of the new group called the Global Blockchain Group. According to a statement from Momtazee, the establishment of the blockchain team shows the firm’s dedication to offering advice in both “existing and new industries.” He said, “With more than 50 unicorns and several decacorns in the sector already and nearly $20 billion of capital raised for blockchain companies last year, blockchain technology is poised to be as transformative to the global business landscape.” Last Week’s Cryptocurrency Market Bounce The news on Monday comes after a significant cryptocurrency market bounce last week following a bumpy second trading quarter, which saw Bitcoin post its worst quarter of losses in 11 years. When the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May, it sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency markets. A liquidity issue for cryptocurrency lenders and the demise of the hedge firm Three Arrows Capital also impacted prices in June.

Cryptojacking is a type of cyberattack whereby hackers implant a piece of software that mines cryptocurrencies on a victim's computer. Victims are often unaware of the exploit, which has contributed to the rise in cases, the report says.  In previous years, government, health-care and education sectors were the most common targets for cryptojacking, but there has been a ""dramatic reshuffling"" in 2022.  ""Cryptojacking targeting the retail industry increased 63% year to date, while attacks on the financial industry skyrocketed 269%,"" the report states.  The number of attacks on the finance industry is now five times greater than retail, which is second highest.  The rise has also been attributed to a decline in ransomware attacks, which is also caused by increased interest in cryptocurrency-related cyberattacks coupled with more stringent insurance processes around ransomware.  “It [cryptojacking] has a lower potential of being detected by the victim; unsuspecting users across the world see their devices get unaccountably slower, but it’s hard to tie it to criminal activity, much less point to the source,” Terry Greer-King, SonicWall vice president for EMEA, told Tech Monitor.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/26/cryptojacking-in-financial-sector-has-risen-269-this-year-sonicwall-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be577728d1905fb0da1d30a48de6c7812303c162-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jump Crypto and FTX Ventures served as the round’s lead investors. Other investors included Apollo, Griffin Gaming Partners, Franklin Templeton, Circle Ventures, Superscrypt, which was funded by Temasek, and ongoing support from a16z and Multicoin. Aptos wants to improve its products. The announcement said: “This funding comes at a critical time in our industry. At Aptos, we are taking this as an opportunity to build the reliable foundation web3 has been waiting for.” In 2021, Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, both formerly employed by Meta, co-founded Aptos. The Diem, a cryptocurrency initiative from the social media colossal that failed because of fierce regulatory opposition, was eventually sold. According to the statement, the business now wants to greatly enhance web3’s use and sociability while working with its key partners to identify market expectations. In a statement to Bloomberg, Ching stated, “We are building upgradeable, cutting-edge blockchain solutions that will significantly improve the web3 experience for developers, marketers, and consumers.” Aptos has secured $350 million in fundraising over two rounds, claims Crunchbase. After obtaining $200 million in its previous round, the startup’s current investment has increased its valuation, which was above $1 billion in March, according to Bloomberg. Funding at a Period of Declining VC Interest Mysten Labs, a second company founded by former Meta workers, is reportedly also raising fresh cash while creating a blockchain that makes use of the Move programming language. The unicorn stated that most of the developers, maintainers, and bright minds behind the “Move language and Move Prover” belong to their team, continuously working to “enhance the language, tools, and resources” that will bring the “simplicity and security of Move” to everyone. However, the announcement of the investments also follows a decline in venture capitalist interest in cryptocurrencies amid the market slump. The longer time it has taken to conclude crypto VC agreements, according to David Nage, venture capital portfolio manager at Arca, has resulted in lower valuations for the cryptocurrency sector.

The Lido Staked Ether (stETH) token, issued by the Lido Finance system, uses LDO as its native token. The Maker Protocol has released DAI, a stablecoin tethered to the dollar. Dragonfly Capital, a cryptocurrency venture capital firm, would have gotten 10 million LDO tokens valued at $1.45 each if it had succeeded. Proposal Received Rejection The proposal received 609 votes across the three choices but got a rejection with 43 million tokens in the negative. Nine whales, whose combined 40.3 million tokens made up the great bulk of the negative votes, contributed 40.3 million tokens to the rejection. The other two options – either no lockup or a one-year lockup on the LDO tokens – favor the idea. This vote was for the first 10 million LDO tokens to be distributed as part of the proposal. The second tranche of 10 million LDO tokens may be sold to LidoDAO’s treasury, but it’s unclear if a vote will be held after this initial rejection. Jacob Blish, a DAO member, proposed on July 18 to give LidoDAO a two-year runway to perform its duties under the Lido Finance protocol without worrying about additional fundraising. Lido Community Has No idea About The Outcome The project’s Discord and Twitter accounts have been silent since the results were announced, suggesting that members of the Lido community are unconcerned with the referendum’s outcome. The idea will now need to be revised and may be put to a second vote after being rejected. At least 57 businesses are included in the cryptocurrency and Web3 investment portfolio of Dragonfly Capital, which Haseeb Qureshi and Bo Feng run. In April, the company completed a $650 million fundraising round.

439471,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243872,1658830862,Tesla Posts $170M Impairment Loss While Making $64M On BTC Sale,"Tesla’s strong second-quarter profits, which showed a 42 percent increase in revenue, were offset by a $170 million impairment charge due to the collapse in bitcoin prices. According to information from Bitcoin Treasuries, Tesla spent $1.5 billion to purchase about 43,200 BTC during the first quarter of 2021. A quarter later, it sold 10% of its bitcoin for $272 million. Those transactions were only an experiment to show the liquidity and value of bitcoin as an alternative reserve asset, Tesla’s CFO Zach Kirkhorn said at the time, adding that Tesla’s bitcoin investment was long-term. However, Tesla said last week that it made $936 million by selling 75% of its bitcoin during the second quarter of this year. As per the company’s SEC filing, “We may raise or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any moment based on the needs of the business and our perception of the market and environmental circumstances, consistent with how we handle fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts.” According to accounting standards, digital assets are referred to as “indefinite-lived intangible assets.” Tesla is, therefore, required to value its bitcoin at its lowest point during a quarter and report a loss if it falls below its purchase price. Similarly, Tesla may benefit from its digital assets if it makes a profit. Tesla Reports $64 Million Profit The manufacturer of electric vehicles reported a $64 million profit on specific BTC to fiat currency exchanges for the six months ended June 30, when the asset was worth about $19,000. Tesla reportedly sold 29,060 BTC at an average price of $32,209, leaving the business with around 9,700 BTC ($205.1 million) on its balance sheet, according to Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde. According to statistics, the price of bitcoin last traded at $21,100 at 1:15 a.m. ET on Tuesday, down by 55 percent year to date. However, Varun Kumar, CEO of Hashflow, believes that the key cryptocurrency asset may have struck its macro bottom at roughly $18,000.

42374206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBYN,1658830380,Tether Finds Stable Dollar Peg After Terra's Collapse,"Tether (USDT), a stablecoin meant to be worth a dollar, has found stability for the first time in over two months.  The world's largest stablecoin by market value regained its dollar peg on July 20 and has remained steady since then, the first such instance since the collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD or UST (now TerraClassicUSD) in the second week of May.  Terra's UST, the-then third-largest stablecoin in the world, tanked on May 12, spurring panic selling in other dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Tether's peg broke, and the token fell to as low as 92 cents on some exchanges following UST's crash and averaged about 99 cents in June.  Tether's market capitalization has declined by $16 billion to $65 billion in two months, a sign of large redemptions by holders. This means that the company behind USDT, Tether Ltd., honored billions of dollars' worth of redemptions following UST's meltdown. Tether Ltd. has long been criticized for the lack of transparency about the nature of assets backing the stablecoin.  In other words, tether has passed the market's stress test, withstanding redemptions in volatile conditions and eventually reclaiming the peg.  ""The past two months have definitely been a stress test for stablecoins following the collapse of UST and sharp contraction in USDT's market cap,"" Clara Medalie, research director at crypto data provider Kaiko, said. ""Tether proved its ability to process billions in redemptions, despite lingering questions over the makeup of its reserves.""  It remains to be seen if tether's recent resilience bolsters investor confidence in the stablecoin, and trader and crypto analyst Alex Kruger is still skeptical about the stablecoin's resilience. Tether is heavily used in the bitcoin (BTC) market and in decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""Tether has once again passed the stress test under extreme market conditions,"" Kruger said. ""However, I do not foresee tether FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to diminish in any significant way until there is stablecoin issuer regulation in place and Tether adheres to it.""  Tether Ltd. has long claimed that the value of its stablecoin is always 100% backed by assets to ensure the stability of the 1:1 dollar peg. In May, Tether Ltd. published an attestation of holdings by independent accountants MHA Cayman, which showed the company held $39.2 billion in Treasurys and had $4.1 billion in bank deposits, $6.7 billion in money-market funds and $3.1 billion in secured loans. A potential loss of confidence in tether would most likely result in a severe liquidity shock to the broader crypto market, according to JPMorgan.  While tether is supposedly fully collateralized, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin backed by an endogenous token LUNA, whose value is tied to the stablecoin itself. The setup makes UST and algorithmic stablecoins vulnerable to bank runs, like the one seen in May.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA | USDT,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/26/tether-finds-stable-dollar-peg-after-terras-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f85d33b8dbf74798af566182daee5dcd71ff767-1116x600.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase announces the listing of NEST. This is a popular Chinese oracle project in 2020, but since then it has a bad reputation and has nearly disappeared. Coinbase is an investor in its ecosystem. In addition, Celer Network and Stargate Finance are included in the listing plan. — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 26, 2022 Six Tokens Ready For Listing On Coinbase The exchange announced that it would list Raydium with five other currencies based on Ethereum: Celer Network, Nest Protocol, Stargate Finance, SuperRare, and TE-Food. According to Coinbase, the exchange may reverse moves to list them. Consequently, the trading platform advised prospective investors to hold off on making purchases or selling any tokens until they list the assets on the market. Before listing a cryptocurrency, Coinbase claimed that it does not consider the token’s market capitalization or popularity. Coinbase states that some conditions must be met before a token can be listed, including meeting its “standard for legal, compliance, and technological security.” The cryptocurrency exchange further stated that if a token does not match the conditions, it would not be listed. The absence of sufficient information on the asset is another factor that could prevent a token from being listed when users anticipate it. It is also important to note that Coinbase may remove listed tokens if they fail to meet the criteria.

42374209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBat,1658828546,Institutional Traders Have Mixed Views About Tesla’s Decision to Sell Bitcoin,"Electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) sold over $936 million of bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter amid a broad crypto-market decline and weakening economic conditions. That sale led to generally positive reactions among the retail crypto community. However, institutional crypto traders were less sanguine.  During the company's earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla wanted to maximize its cash position amid the “uncertainty of the COVID-19 lockdowns in China.” Tesla recorded a $64 million gain on the sale.  Institutional crypto traders had mixed views about the move. Some said it was justified given Tesla’s business interests; others said the decision could influence market participants.  “The Tesla news is indeed a bearish headline, but not completely unexpected,” Katie Talati, director of research at Arca, told CoinDesk. According to its filings, Tesla “sold their BTC reserves at about $29K over the past quarter as a way to have positive free cash flow. Without this, they would have reported cashflow negative results.”  Talati said the news was “not a knock on the fundamental thesis for bitcoin” but had more to do with Tesla's treasury-management strategy during an overall down market.  “In the long run this shouldn't matter as the success of BTC depends on adoption across many corporates, individuals, and governments, not just one company,” she said.  Vadym Synegin, vice president at Web3 ecosystem WeWay, took the opposing view. The sales came “against Tesla’s initial plans to hold the premier coin for the long term,” he told CoinDesk. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was used “as a sacrifice” because the company had to bolster its cash position and performance in one of its most difficult quarters.  “Tesla said it is open to buying more bitcoin in the future, but industry stakeholders may not be pleased with the idea, seeing the instability the firm can wield,” Synegin said. “Its influence is huge in the industry.”  “While every firm has its corporate strategy, the Tesla sell-off might trigger some to reconsider their positions in both the short and long term, respectively,” he said.  Anton Gulin, business director at AAX Exchange, shared that view. While the sales were for “pure risk management and a desire to please investors before reporting” company earnings, retail investors take such actions seriously, he said.  “From an ethical point of view, Musk's actions and statements have already become a meme in their own right and are challenging to take seriously,” Gulin told CoinDesk. “It is just another example and indicator of why you should think with your head and not look for idols.”  “It is clear that [the] macro and micro factors are complex, and cash on hand is welcome,"" he said. ""It is also impossible to miss that the market has become more liquid, and this sell-off has not buried it to the ground. The industry has moved on.”  Musk is not the market  Other traders expressed the view that the bitcoin market is much larger even than any influential participant.  “If Tesla sold its bitcoin in Q2 of 2021, the impact of the news on the crypto market certainly would have been much greater,” Mikkel Morch, executive director at the crypto hedge fund ARK36, told CoinDesk.  Tesla's purchase last year ""gave the biggest cryptocurrency a much-needed boost, from the narrative perspective.

Ethereum 2.0 and general purpose rollups have the potential to make DeFi, NFTs, and other Ethereum dapps much more accessible and cost-effective, and even provide an efficient framework for micropayments. Optimistic rollups currently dominate the layer 2 landscape but general purpose ZK-rollups are coming and can become the preferred layer 2 solution as they offer faster finality and may also offer privacy features. Distributed ledger technology has the potential to solve some of the most prominent problems in the global economy, such as providing financial services to the 1.7 billion people that comprise the global unbanked population. 1 However, the largest blockchains are not accessible for low-income economies or viable for daily use as they can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This bottleneck entails elevated transaction costs when network activity is high. But creating a highly scalable blockchain with minimal fees without sacrificing decentralization and security is challenging. 2 To avoid this issue, developers have designed systems like interoperable blockchains and layer 2 solutions. These increase throughput while retaining security and decentralization. Even in their early stages of development and adoption, they are already transforming the crypto landscape significantly. One day, they may become the preferred option for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and more, onboarding millions more users to the blockchain as they offer lower fees and more programmability. In this report, we discuss why blockchains need to scale, the existing scaling solutions, the different types of layer 2 solutions, and how they may shape the crypto landscape. Key Takeaways: A one-size-fits-all blockchain scalability solution doesn’t exist. However, rollups, which aggregate transactions and post them as one to layer 1, will have an edge to scale most decentralized applications (dapps) due to their compatibility and security advantages. Ethereum 2.0 and general purpose rollups have the potential to make DeFi, NFTs, and other Ethereum dapps much more accessible and cost-effective, and even provide an efficient framework for micropayments. Optimistic rollups currently dominate the layer 2 landscape but general purpose ZK-rollups are coming and can become the preferred layer 2 solution as they offer faster finality and may also offer privacy features. Developers Must Solve the Scalability Bottleneck for Crypto to Reach Its Potential To perform all possible use cases and provide the best possible user experience, blockchains need the ability to process a high number of transactions per second. Today, the largest Blockchains by market cap, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), have limited transaction throughput, making them inadequate for many potential applications. The average transactions per second ((TPS)) the Bitcoin and Ethereum network have processed during May 2022 is around 3 and 14 respectively. 3,4 For comparison, these TPS capabilities are far from the Visa payment network’s 20,000 TPS. However, demand for the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks continues to grow, particularly for Ethereum’s, as we highlighted in Ethereum: The Basics . As a result of limited throughput and increasing demand, Ethereum’s transaction costs have increased. The chart below shows the cost of a simple ETH transaction from one address to another. Demand for transactions in the Ethereum network is typically linked to euphoria in the space which is correlated to price. For more complex transactions that require interaction with smart contracts, costs can be 5–20 times higher. 6 High transaction costs are a barrier to using blockchains, affecting low-income users the most, and may even de-incentivize the use of these blockchains if transaction costs get high enough. For distributed ledger networks to become the efficient and financially inclusive platform that powers the global economy, they must scale. Multiple Scaling Solutions Emerging to Increase TPS and Lower Fees Since Bitcoin’s inception, a primary focus for developers has been designing systems that can process a higher number of TPS with minimum fees. So far, the most popular approaches to scaling are improving layer 1 blockchains, interoperable blockchains, and layer 2 solutions. Improving Layer 1 Blockchains Mathematics and computer science research continue to improve consensus mechanisms and data architectures that increase throughput. For example, Solana ( SOL-USD ) uses an innovative proof of history consensus, which, paired with a reduced group of network validators using high-end hardware enables Solana to process up to a theoretical 50,000 TPS. However, the specialized hardware and low number of validators, means that Solana is more centralized than other chains. Centralization is a common tradeoff among the blockchains that can scale more than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Shard chains , an initiative on Ethereum’s agenda, are also a method of scaling layer 1s, but is highly complex and the complexity can introduce new risks and potential vulnerabilities, so thorough testing is required. Interoperable Blockchains Interoperable blockchains can be thought as a network of blockchains that can communicate with each other. The main idea behind interoperable blockchains as a scaling solution is to distribute the computational load between various chains and process transactions in parallel. Beyond scaling, interoperable blockchains augment the design space, as blockchains can be built with different architectures tailored for specific applications or functions. Polkadot ( DOT-USD ), Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) are ecosystems where interoperability enables the transfer of assets between blockchains securely and at a low cost. These three projects have unique architectures and come with trade-offs, in terms of scalability, security and decentralization. Layer 2 Solutions A layer 2 solution is built on top of an existing layer 1, like Ethereum, and its aim is to increase the capabilities of layer 1. A layer 2 offloads computational work from layer 1 by processing transactions off-chain, increasing transaction speed and throughput. A metaphor typically used to describe layer 2 solutions is a sideroad. The sideroad can offload traffic from the main road (the layer 1 chain), to increase the number of cars travelling at the same time (increase number of transactions per second). Layer 2 solutions have peculiar qualities that make them a compelling scaling solution. For example, layer 2 solutions do not require modifying a blockchain. Instead, they use existing features of layer 1 chains, such as smart contracts, which enables scaling without compromising decentralization or security. Another distinct property of certain layer 2s is that unlike layer 1 blockchains, their fees don’t necessarily increase with more transaction demand; in fact, they can even get cheaper. We will explain why later in the report. Layer 2 solutions span general-purpose to application-specific solutions. Some have their own security measures, and some inherit their security from layer 1. However, in essence, they all share the same logic of processing transactions off-chain for scaling purposes. We will focus on Channels and Rollups, which we believe today to be the most potentially transformative solutions. The Layer 2 Landscape Is Evolving, and Adoption Is Rising: Channels Channels are a peer-to-peer passage where parties can exchange multiple transactions off-chain while only submitting two transactions to layer 1, for the opening of the channel and its closure. Channels enable fast, almost feeless transactions, but they have limited use cases because they are application-specific and cannot run general-purpose smart contracts. The best example of a payment channel today is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which can process up to 100,000 TPS with almost zero fees. Conceived to enable microtransactions, the Lightning Network is gaining popularity as the Bitcoin circulating in it continues to grow. 7 A pioneer in accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments is El Salvador, where it is now possible to pay for daily transactions, such as a burger at McDonald's with Bitcoin . Rollups Rollups are a source of excitement within the Ethereum community given several highly anticipated milestones set to be hit in 2022. Over the last year, rollups have become Ethereum’s go-to layer 2 family of solutions, with roughly 95% of the market share. 8 Rollups are the only layer 2 solution that inherit the security of layer 1 and can scale general-purpose applications. Because of this feature, dapps can support rollups seamlessly, enabling users to interact with dapps at a fraction of a cost of layer 1. In rollups, numerous transactions are computed off-chain, and then compressed and aggregated into a batch , which contains information about the state . Thereafter, the batch is uploaded to the rollup smart contract on the layer 1 to update the state. The intricate step is proving that the new state is correct and that a malicious participant didn’t change it. The two major types of rollups, optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK), tackle this proving problem differently. Optimistic rollups: When the batch is uploaded to layer 1, a dispute resolution period that can last for about a week starts. During this period, any user can challenge the batch and state by submitting a fraud proof. If the fraud proof shows the batch was fraudulent, the last correct state is restored. If no fraud proofs are published or the batch is valid, nothing has to be done; hence, the name “optimistic rollup”. Submitting a fraud proof is a rare event due to economic incentives in place that promote correct behaviour. ZK-rollups: A ZK-proof is generated from the batch, which is an innovative bit of mathematics and cryptography, as it allows proving information without revealing the information itself. To update the state, this cryptographic proof is posted to layer 1 along with the batch. The ZK-proof can quickly prove that the new state is the result of carrying out all the computations in the batch, even if the computations would take a long time to run. A remarkable feature of rollups is that unlike layer 1 blockchains, their fees don’t necessarily increase with more transaction demand; in fact, they can even get cheaper. This is because the transaction costs of updating the state of the rollup is shared between all participants. With more users making transactions, the average transaction cost per user may decrease in certain scenarios, creating positive network effects. 9 Optimistic Rollups Dominate the Layer 2 Landscape but ZK-rollups Are Here to Challenge The layer 2 landscape today is practically exclusive to Ethereum, where Optimism and Arbitrum which are optimistic rollups are the current leaders. Their Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM)) compatibility means popular DeFi dapps like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), AAVE ( AAVE-USD ), and Curve Finance have been able to deploy in the Optimism and Arbitrum networks with minimum coding work. Optimism launched their highly anticipated token “OP” via airdrop on the 30th of May 2022. The token will be used for governance and community incentives. Arbitrum’s token airdrop is thought to arrive soon. ZK-rollups currently lag optimistic rollups, being limited to application-specific uses like DYDX, Loopring, and DeversiFi due to the complexity of the underlying tech. However, general-purpose ZK-rollups, which many experts thought would take longer to develop, are now market ready. They could improve on optimistic rollups’ shortcoming. Assets in an optimistic rollup must stay within the layer 2 protocol during dispute resolution period because the transaction could be challenged at any time. Effectively, the dispute resolution period must end for funds to move. Conversely, ZK-rollups’ time to finality can be measured in seconds. Vitalik Buterin and other prominent figures in the space have spoken about their long-term outlook for ZK-rollups, stating that they will win out in all use cases as ZK-proof technology improves. 10 Matter Labs is working on ZK-Sync2.0, a ZK-rollup with its own VM. The testnet for ZK-Sync2.0 went live in May 2022, and the team announced the mainnet is coming in 2022. 11 Polygon launched on the 20 th of July Polygon zkEVM, a ZK-rollup currently in testnet, expected to go live in 2023. 12 Both ZK-rollups will be able to run Ethereum smart contracts and dapps with minimum coding work. ZK-Rollups and Ethereum 2.0 May Be a Turning Point for Crypto The catalysts and technology coming to Ethereum form a compelling case to be positive about the growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem and increasing user adoption. Currently, rollups can process 1,000–4,000 TPS, which is good, but still not valid for certain applications, such as global-scale micropayments. Visa’s 20,000 TPS is the standard. However, as we discussed in Crypto in a Portfolio , major upgrades are coming to Ethereum, including the transition to proof of stake and shard chains. The latter is predicted to increase the Ethereum chain’s data availability more than 20-fold. 13 Rollups will get more than a 20x TPS boost, making them able to process up to roughly 100,000 TPS. High throughput, low transaction fees, fast finality, and EVM compatibility could mean that ZK-rollups become the standard framework for dapp deployment, merchant payments, and more. The main centralized exchanges, such as Binance ( BNB-USD ), FTX, and Coinbase ( COIN ), now support withdrawals to some optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, allowing users to onboard those frameworks easily. ZK-rollup support may be coming soon too. Additionally, user friendly apps like Argent Wallet allow users to onboard ZK-Sync directly and offer interaction with DeFi apps from their mobile app. Lower Transaction Fees Will Enable Further Blockchain Adoption Blockchains are set to become more scalable as the tech behind layer 2 solutions and interoperable blockchains evolves. With shard chains and rollups evolving, DeFi, NFTs and more will be accessible to many more users as transaction costs become a fraction of what they are currently. With 100,000 TPS, ZK-rollups could be an efficient framework for micropayments when ETH 2.0 is out thanks to their fast finality and low fees. Additionally, interoperable blockchains are a scalable framework that expand the design space of blockchains, meaning more developers could be attracted to build innovative products on interoperable chains. We believe the future for distributed ledger networks is bright and that one day, they could become the infrastructure for more efficient and inclusive financial systems, a plethora of dapps and could even host global micropayment networks.

42374207,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBZd,1658826000,US Senators Push Bill to Make Small Crypto Transactions Tax-Free,"Prominent U.S. senators are trying to free Americans from tracking taxes every time cryptocurrencies change hands, introducing a bill that would exempt them from reporting any transactions up to $50 or any trade in which they earn less than $50.  Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) joined with Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to push the exemption from tax requirements for crypto users making small investments or purchases. Their Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act matches a similar effort previously introduced in the House of Representatives. The idea of clearing low-level transactions from tax worries has also appeared elsewhere, including in a more comprehensive bill introduced this year by senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  “While digital currencies have the potential to become an ordinary part of Americans’ everyday lives, our current tax code stands in the way,” said Toomey. He has sought to help the crypto industry on multiple tracks before he retires from the Senate at the end of this session.  The latest bill will let people “use cryptocurrencies more easily as an everyday method of payment by exempting from taxes small personal transactions like buying a cup of coffee.”  The Internal Revenue Service has held a firm crypto policy: “When you sell virtual currency, you must recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale,” the IRS declares on its website.  That standard has been among the roadblocks standing in the way of crypto’s use in the U.S. as an alternative way to pay for things, industry advocates have argued.  “This would foster use of crypto for retail payments, subscription services, and micro transactions,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a crypto policy think tank in Washington. “More importantly, it would foster the development of decentralized blockchain infrastructure generally because networks depend on small transaction fees that today saddle users with compliance friction.”  However, the new legislation faces an uphill climb in a Congress on the verge of a lengthy August recess before the midterm elections. Though there has been some movement on an effort to regulate stablecoins, most congressional insiders predict that crypto is unlikely to see significant progress on legislation until next year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/26/us-senators-push-bill-to-make-small-crypto-transactions-tax-free,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ae6923b969dd8710886b0c7fa0df3d4b110cbc4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But bulls reclaim dominance with hopes to cross $15. Will the prices cross the threshold? Key Technical Points: The OKB prices jumped by 1.20% in the last 24 hours. The buyers sabotage the bearish attempt to test the 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of OKB is $12.54 million, indicating a drop of 16%. Past Performance of OKB The OKB prices reverse from the crucial support level of $10 after the descending triangle fallout predicted in our previous article. The bullish reversal beats the supply pressure at the $13.5 horizontal zone to reach the $15 mark. In short, the prices have exploded by 50% in the last month, but the supply inflow at the $15 threshold leads to long-wick candles and a double top reversal. Source – Tradingview OKB Technical Analysis The 4% drop in OKB prices with a spike in trading volume yesterday almost sealed the fate of a downtrend to challenge the 100-day SMA. However, the lower price rejection guiding buyers to reclaim dominance sabotages the double bottom breakout. As the market value upholds the 100-day average price, the bullish influence grows on the 50-day SMA. Hence, the possibility of a bullish crossover between the 50 and 100-day SMA increases. The lateral trend in the daily-RSI slope slightly below the overbought boundary continues to find support from the 14-day SMA. Hence, the indicator defends the bullish viewpoint on the upcoming trend. The fast and slow lines show a decline in the bullish spread, increasing bearish crossover chances with the declining trend in MACD histograms. Hence, the MACD indicator takes a bearish approach but, being a lagging indicator, we can expect a reversal with the $15 breakout. In a nutshell, the technical indicators have opposing viewpoints while the price action holds the bullish torch. Hence, the overall sentiment for the OKB technical analysis bolsters bullish bias. Upcoming Trend If the OKB prices beat the bearish influence of the $15 resistance level, a jump to the 200-day SMA at $17 is possible. Conversely, a downfall below the 100-day SMA will test the crucial support zone at $13.5.

The president of VIVERSE, Joseph Lin, said that the relationship with pixiv would “quickly grow the number of virtual characters” on VIVERSE and suit the “needs of customers who enjoy anime and manga genres.” HTC introduced the open virtual world platform VIVERSE in March of this year. HTC unveiled the Desire 22 in June as the first device to access its metaverse platform. Pixiv’s VRoid 3D project, released in 2018, lets users customize 3D characters. The press statement reports that the system generates more than 10,000 avatars daily. As per a press release, Pixiv is a website for artists specializing in Japanese illustration, manga, and fiction. It has over 81 million users and over 100 million works of art.

Key Technical Points: The MANA prices dropped by 5.52% in the last 24 hours. The falling trend retests the broken resistance trendline in the daily chart. The 24-hour trading volume of Decentraland is $228 million, indicating a drop of 8.03%. Past Performance of MANA As predicted in our previous article, the MANA prices break the resistance trendline to reach the psychological mark of $1. However, the breakout rally failed to exceed the $1 threshold leading to a correction phase, retesting the broken trendline. The price action forms an evening star pattern and echoes a double top reversal from $1 to break the 50-day SMA. Source – Tradingview MANA Technical Analysis The declining trend in the trading volume during the downtrend showcases a lack of a bearish commitment and teases a post-retest reversal. However, the reversal rally will have to face the sellers at $1 again. As the market value of Decentraland’s native token struggles to retain the 50-day average price, the lower price rejection brings hope for buyers. Hence, if the prices surpass the 50-day, SMA traders can expect a bull run reclaiming the $1 value. The sideways trend in the daily-RSI slope close to the halfway line restarts after the rejection in the nearly overbought zone. Moreover, the slope breaks below the 14 SMA, reflecting an increase in underlying bearishness. The MACD and signal lines fail to sustain a bullish spread leading to a high probability of a bearish crossover as the histograms decline. Hence, the indicator reflects an increase in selling pressure influencing the price trend. In a nutshell, the increased sales yesterday have influenced the technical indicators to give a bearish signal. However, the MANA price action analysis requests the traders to wait for the candle to close below the trendline before taking a short position. Upcoming Trend If the MANA dumps below the resistance trendline and the $0.77 support level, a downtrend to $0.67 seems unavoidable. Conversely, a post-retest reversal will change the bearish fate and might beat the $1 threshold.

But will the bullish reversal exceed $3.6? Key Technical Points: The QTUM prices jumped by 1.91% in the last 24 hours. The retracement rally from $3.6 retests the $3.16 support level. The 24-hour trading volume of Quantum is $155 million, indicating a gain of 157%. Past Performance of QTUM As warned in our previous article, the QTUM prices failed to exceed the $3.6 threshold leading to a retracement rally, retesting the $3.16 support level. The higher price rejection candles reflect an increased supply inflow at $3.6, but the rebound rally from $3.16 might undermine the sellers. It is because the evening star pattern at $3.6 will be nullified if the prices regain the $3.6 value. Source – Tradingview QTUM Technical Analysis The increased trading volume after the range breakout increases the volatility in QTUM prices. Hence, traders hoping to ride a bullish trend with the $3.6 conquest should expect a few volatile corrections along the way. As the market value sustains above the 50-day SMA, the price trend takes the 100-day SMA as the next bearish hurdle to cross. However, the multiple resistance before the 100-day SMA increases the uptrend difficulty. The sideways trend in the daily-RSI slope within the nearly overbought zone prepares to approach the 70% boundary. Moreover, the rising trend in the 14-day SMA displays a solid underlying bullishness. The MACD and signal lines continue to increase spread after crossing above the zero line. Moreover, the bullish histograms sustain high intensity reflecting a stable demand flow keeping the price buoyant above $3.16. In a nutshell, the technical analysis keeps an optimistic viewpoint despite the higher price rejection in QTUM prices. Upcoming Trend If the QTUM explodes above the $3.6 resistance level, an uptrend continuation will likely appreciate the market value by 18% to reach the $4.28 mark. Conversely, a bullish failure to cross the $3.6 level can lead to a consolidation range between $3.16 and $3.6.

Will the downtrend drop prices under $1400? Key Technical Points: The ETH prices dropped by 6% in the last 24 hours. The fallout rally approaches the 100 SMA at the $1360 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is $20.13 billion, indicating a gain of 2.13%. Past Performance of ETH As mentioned in our previous article, the ETH prices failed to exceed the $1650 level and retrace to retest the $1400 mark. In the 4-hour technical chart, the bearish breakout of the consolidation range also breaks the 50 SMA and the $1478 support level. Currently, prices have depreciated by 12.5% within the last 48 hours and approaches the 100 SMA. Source – Tradingview ETH Technical Analysis The sudden spikes in the intraday trading volume supporting the bearish candles in ETH prices indicate a massive supply inflow. Hence, the traders can expect the fallout rally to crack the $1360 support level. As the Ethereum market value falls under the 50 SMA in the 4-hour chart, 100 SMA takes up the responsibility to cushion the downtrend. However, the increased selling momentum might drive the prices right through the supporting SMA to hit $1300. The falling trend in the 4-hour RSI slope forms lower lows to crack under the halfway line reflecting an increase in bearish sentiments. Moreover, the 14 SMA continues to push the slope downwards, increasing the likelihood of continuing the correction phase. Moreover, the MACD and signal lines gain more spread after the recent bearish crossover and cross under the zero line. The growing trend in the bearish histograms adds a point bearish trend continuation theory. In a nutshell, the technical indicators support the price action analysis and increase the likelihood of a drop to $1300. Upcoming Trend If the Ethereum prices fail to sustain above the 100 SMA at the $1360 support level, a drop to 200 SMA at $1265 is feasible. Conversely, an early bullish reversal from the $1400 level will crash the prices and retest the $1478 fallout.

The 24-hour trading volume of Trust Wallet is $35.80 million, indicating a gain of 267%. Past Performance of TWT As mentioned in our previous article, the TWT prices breached the resistance trendline of the symmetrical triangle pattern and started to approach the $1 mark. Since the publication, the breakout rally has appreciated the market value of Trust Wallet Token by 10% and breached the $0.90 mark. However, the higher price rejection in the daily candles warns of a bearish retracement to retest $0.85. Source – Tradingview TWT Technical Analysis The sudden spikes in the intraday trading volume supporting the bullish growth in TWT prices indicate strong bullish players in the game. However, traders waiting to find a new buying spot can eye the $1 breakout. The growing prices of Trust Wallet Token influence a positive trend in the EMAs, especially the 50-day EMA. The likelihood of a golden crossover increases as the spread decreases between the 50 and 200-day EMA. The RSI indicator showcases a gradual growth in underlying bullishness as the slope sustains a diagonal uptrend above the halfway line. Moreover, the lack of bearish divergence symbolizes solid underlying sentiments. Moreover, the MACD and signal lines gain more spread after reclaiming the bullish alignment above the zero line. The rising trend in the bullish histograms adds a point bullish trend continuation theory. In a nutshell, the technical indicators ignore the higher price rejections and make the overall sentiment of our TWT technical analysis bullish.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) attention to Coinbase has intensified since the platform boosted the number of tokens in which it offers a trade. The SEC’s investigation into an alleged insider trading scheme, which prompted the commission to sue a former Coinbase manager and two other individuals last week, precedes the enforcement unit’s investigation into that matter. In separate civil proceedings, the SEC said that Nikhil Wahi and another defendant, Sameer Ramani, had profitably marketed at most minuscule 25 crypto assets, nine of which it had designated as securities. When asked if the SEC would take action against Coinbase for listing the coins described as securities in the complaint, an SEC representative declined to comment.

Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, has focused on trading platforms and claimed they have to take more measures to safeguard individual investors. US citizens can trade more than 150 tokens on Coinbase, the largest US trading platform. The company might need to register as an exchange with the SEC if those products were deemed securities.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the regulator was investigating some of the tokens listed on the exchange. The SEC alleged last week that seven cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase were securities in an unrelated insider trading case brought against a former product manager at the exchange.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously also said he believed that Coinbase should register as a national securities exchange, given some of the cryptocurrencies it has listed.  Coinbase, for its part, has criticized the SEC for not providing clear rules for defining how cryptocurrencies might be deemed securities. The exchange’s Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad said existing securities laws may not fit cryptocurrencies.  CEO Brian Armstrong’s stated goal of listing every token the exchange legally can appears to have had its drawbacks: According to two people interviewed by Bloomberg, the SEC gave Coinbase’s practices a closer look amid the increase in token listings.  Coinbase’s asset directory page featured over 200 tokens at press time Monday.  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in response to a CoinDesk query, ""We are confident that our rigorous diligence process – a process the SEC has already reviewed – keeps securities off our platform, and we look forward to engaging with the SEC on the matter.""  ""The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation,"" an SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.
