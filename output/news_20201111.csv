42385103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnA6Z,1605135704,Ethereum’s ‘Unannounced Hard Fork’ Was Trying to Prevent the Very Disruption It Caused,"The Takeaway:    The bulk of Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem went dark earlier today after a latent bug in the Ethereum code split the network’s transaction history in two.  The split resulted from a code change that was surreptitiously inserted into a previous Geth update; some Ethereum node operators ignored the update, which ironically was meant to prevent the very split that occurred.  The nodes that did not upgrade were under the impression the update was minor and did not know it included a change to Ethereum’s consensus design.  A post-mortem released today by Geth indicates that the bug was intentionally triggered. The case is perhaps Ethereum’s greatest challenge since the 2016 DAO fork, and it raises questions about Ethereum’s oft-touted decentralization and the effectiveness of its developer coordination going into Ethereum 2.0.    At first, it was an apparent issue with Infura, the ConsenSys-run servers that keep a majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications synced to the Ethereum network.      Infura went down around 8:00 UTC Wednesday, and with it, some of Ethereum’s most popular applications like Metamask, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound and MyCrypto, among others. Shortly after, Binance halted Ethereum trading after noticing conflicting transactions on its Ethereum node. As other exchanges suspended trading as well, the real issue became clear: A bug in the Go Ethereum (Geth) client, whose code underpins 80% of Ethereum’s applications, had split the Ethereum blockchain in two.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns      The two conflicting transaction histories meant Etheruem users were temporarily interacting with different versions of the Ethereum blockchain. More than causing delays, this put user funds at risk by knocking out the majority of Ethereum’s DeFi applications for a few hours.      Infura has fixed the issue, as have other service providers who were affected by the snafu, by updating their nodes. These stakeholders were running an older version of Geth, which contained a bug that Ethereum developers silently patched in recent update – an update which Infura and Blockchair, among others, ignored.      Besides these two service providers, other Ethereum users and wallet providers were also affected because they didn’t update their code, developers have told CoinDesk.      The fiasco has critics challenging Ethereum’s perceived decentralization, while stakeholders are wondering why the change was pushed in secret without coordination between Geth and other development teams.      To some, the split is the most pressing challenge for Ethereum since the infamous DAO hack of 2016.    Ethereum’s chain split: How it happened    In a just-published post-mortem, Péter Szilágyi, a team lead at Ethereum, wrote that a fork “was (deliberately) triggered on the Ethereum network.”      A representative from Optimism, an Ethereum scaling project, recently posted that the project purposefully triggered the bug the Geth update fixed, setting off the fork.      When the fork occurred, it created two versions of the Ethereum transaction ledger: one with transactions from updated Geth clients, and one with transactions from older Geth clients (like Infura).      “The fix was deployed several months ago and only today a transaction that caused that split came in,” Nikitia Zhavoronkov, the lead developer at Blockchair, an Ethereum block explorer who was affected by the fork, told CoinDesk in a direct message.      Read more: Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack?      Thinking the update was “a minor change to the code,” Blockchair didn’t bother with the update because it wouldn’t be worth the downtime for their services. But more than minor, developers apparently made a quiet change to Geth’s consensus mechanism in the update, as well.      “The Geth team indeed changed the consensus implementation in the v1.9.17 release, however the team did not create any new rules that the Ethereum community didn't know about or agree to,” Szilágyi writes in the post, saying these rules were laid out in an Ethereum Improvement Proposal three years ago.      “If you don't consider accidentally introducing a bug a ‘consensus upgrade,’ then you should also not consider fixing the said bug a few months later a ‘consensus upgrade’,” he argued.      Another post-mortem published by the Ethereum Foundation on November 12 states that the exploit occurred “at block 11234873, transaction 0x57f7f9,” adding that the minority chain for out-of-sync nodes was roughly 30 blocks long.    A call for transparency    Ironically, the fork was caused by the very consensus bug that Geth's update sought to address.      The Ethereum bounty program recently recognized John Yang, a newcomer to Ethereum’s open-source community, for discovering this and another vulnerability. Geth developer and Ethereum security expert Martin Swende tweeted the changes in the update fix the disclosed issues, intimating that the debacle is a “reminder to keep your node(s) up to date!”      Swende continues to say in the tweet thread that developers did not announce the big change to avoid drawing attention to the flaw. In his own explanation, Szilágyi said that “silently” fixing the bug invited less “disruption.”      Still, other Ethereum stakeholders are wondering why the bug could not have been disclosed in private with the teams that are building on Geth.      Read more: ‘High’ Severity Bug in Bitcoin Software Revealed 2 Years After Fix      “Each major project that the dev team is in close contact with should have a security contact that can help manage and coordinate a smooth upgrade, and we should work together,” Matt Luongo, the founder of Thesis, told CoinDesk.      “When forks are surprises, anyone who has built atop Ethereum like we have could lose money,” he continued.      Thesis builds the Keep Network, which issues tBTC, a form of tokenized bitcoin for the Ethereum blockchain. Luongo said the fork put tBTC users' funds at risk, but not because of the chain split, which has been resolved after Infura and others updated their Geth clients.      It’s because the downtime meant that users staking Ethereum in Keep Network couldn’t coordinate with the Ethereum mainchain; as a result, they risked having part of their stakes “slashed” for not meeting their fiduciary requirements. Thesis told CoinDesk that none of the bitcoin that collateralizes tBTC tokens was ever at risk.      Moreover, Thesis' case is just one example of the disruption the fork created for anyone who tried to use the ""minority chain"" during the split.      Despite the problems the split caused, prices for ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, rose 4.6% Wednesday after the news emerged, suggesting that traders see little systemic or long-term threat from the snafu.    Picking up the pieces    Zhavoronkov said that the mess-up was not malicious, but that “if [Geth] knew such thing could happen, they should’ve prepared a guide for node operators.” Luongo shared similar frustrations, saying that the Geth team are “good developers” but that they lack “experience running infrastructure” and are “underfunded.”      The comments key in on a frustration some Ethereum stakeholders share pertaining to why Geth kept the consensus change a secret. Going further, why did Infura, the backbone of Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem, among others, not know about a consensus-breaking bug in Ethereum’s code before it was triggered?      “This is a bit of a grey area and requires a case-by-case discussion,” Szilágyi explains in his post. “We all agree that transparency is king and that we should strive as much as possible towards it, but it's also important to look at all the details before heads start rolling.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Countdown Begins With Release of Deposit Contract      “In the case of Ethereum, it takes a lot of time (weeks, months) to get node operators to update even to a scheduled hard fork. Highlighting that a release contains important consensus or DoS fixes always runs the risk of someone trying to beat updaters to the punch line and taking the network down. Security via obscurity is definitely not something to aim for, but delaying a potential attack by enough to get most node operators immune may be worth the temporary ‘hit’ to transparency,” he continued.      Ultimately, Geth’s team believed there was too much risk in disclosing the vulnerability, so they decided that pushing the update surreptitiously invited the least risk.      “We'd argue that it actually did work,” Szilágyi says. Even though the update “took an unexpected turn with yesterday's network split,” Geth’s team still believes that keeping the issue hush “was the right call”      As Ethereum approaches its largest upgrade ever in Eth 2.0, the case could be a critical study in client coordination for the Ethereum ecosystem.      “The most important thing here IMO is that the folks who made this call are transparent about the reasoning, own any mistakes, and grow,” Luongo said. “Monero has dealt with [consensus bugs] well in the past, as has Bitcoin and Zcash. There are many examples, and while it's always tricky to coordinate across an industry, eschewing any sort of coordination is extremely dangerous.      “I hope this fork leads to tighter relationships and rethinking how projects on Ethereum interact with client development.”      Update 00:36 UTC November 12 – This article has been updated to better convey that the ""hard fork"" was not a deliberate code change, but a chain split which was triggered by the consensus bug that Ethereum developers quietly patched in the Geth v1.9.17 release.

42423992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3vh,1605133616,MakerDAO's DAI Stablecoin Breaks $1B Market Cap,"The stablecoin dai (DAI) broke a market capitalization of $1 billion on Wednesday, according to CoinGecko.  ""One billion dai in circulation is a huge milestone and a powerful validation that people around the world want more access, more transparency and more opportunity to maximize their economic potential,"" Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  Supply actually increased by $30 million at one point today, the MakerDAO Foundation confirmed, though it provided no additional details.  DAI is created when Ethereum users deposit one of many assets into the Maker Protocol and borrow against that asset in the form of DAI. The smart contracts enforce a value of $1 per DAI, which helps the stablecoin generally maintain a $1 peg, though it varies from time to time.  All of the relevant data about the MakerDAO system can be monitored at the Dai Stats website. As of this writing, the total supply is at around 993 million DAI. (The $1 billion market cap is explained by DAI being slightly above its peg at $1.01, as of press time.)  “Dai is a pioneer of protocol-created financial instruments – and reaching the milestone of one billion dai proves that it works, is here to stay and is the honey badger of Ethereum,"" Robert Leshner, founder of DeFi money market Compound, told CoinDesk.  It's worth noting that it was only February the whole DeFi market first broke $1 billion in total value locked.  On Compound, there's actually $1.6 billion in DAI locked up right now. As we've previously noted, this is because users deposit, borrow and deposit again, in loops (as much as collateralization rates will allow).  While most DAI that's used in the world takes the form of an ERC-20 token, not all of it does, and that is by design. DAI doesn't go into the ERC-20 smart contract until users withdraw it from MakerDAO, and in the future users could do so in other token standards, if better ones arise, Nik Kunkel, a developer at the Maker Foundation, explained.  ""In the Maker system, dai is not an ERC-20 token. Dai is just dai,"" Kunkel said.  About a third of the total supply is in the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) smart contract, despite the fact that it currently offers no return. Most dai, over 620 million, are currently in the ERC-20 smart contract, as viewable on Etherscan.  ""DSR is part of the protocol itself, so it's not opinionated about what form dai should be in,"" Kunkel explained.  Maker currently has $2.3 billion in assets locked according to DeFi Pulse, making it the second biggest DeFi application on Ethereum, after Uniswap.  ""MakerDAO was built to help people find a better, less biased and more transparent way to participate in the global financial system,"" Christensen said.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/11/makerdaos-dai-stablecoin-breaks-1b-market-cap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6c438d3e99926151660d496cbed21f77eade861-1500x893.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Constantin Kogan, managing partner at investment firm Wave Financial, sees an upside signal in the Power of Balance indicator, which uses opening, closing, high and low daily pricing to determine market movements. “The Power of Balance indicator signals in favor of an upward breakout, most likely a test of $16,000,” Kogan said.      Read More: Bitcoin to Consolidate Before December Rise Toward $20K, Say Analysts      Analysts seem to have found a short-term price floor, the area where order books will trigger buying, pushing the price back above that level if it does go that low.      “We've been ranging between $14,600 to $16,000 since Nov. 5. Bitcoin seems to have found a local floor at the $15,000 price,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk.      David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of ExoAlpha, echoed a similar assessment. “In the very short term, we may see some consolidation of the bitcoin price around $15,000, which would be healthy after the last powerful breakout, before grinding higher toward $20,000.”      “As BTC consolidates and more bullish fundamental news comes out for both bitcoin, like [Stanley] Druckenmiller coming out as an investor in BTC, and the general market, like the [Pfizer coronavirus] vaccine, it may provide the risk-on impetus to break above resistance at $16,000,” Tu added.      The market hailed the potential for coronavirus vaccinations being deployed over the next several months. That has pushed up global equities since Monday and major indexes were positive on Wednesday.    The Nikkei 225 closed up 1.7% as optimism over a coronavirus vaccine outweighed traders hitting the sell button on SoftBank, which fell 2.5% Wednesday.  Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day in the green up 1.3%, driven by optimism that a vaccine will help boost the continent’s economy.  In the United States the S&P 500 gained 0.77% as tech stocks climbed, led by Amazon in the green 2.8% and Apple jumping 2.7%.    Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has been trending down this week, with Tuesday continuing Monday’s drop in the relationship of their price movements.      For Efficient Frontier’s Tu, some fundamental aspects that would cause traditional markets to dump may simultaneously pump bitcoin. “[U.S. President] Trump's posturing around the election result and the multiple lawsuits and recounts coming from his administration may provide enough political instability to cause BTC to bid upwards.”    Ether in ETH 2.0 surpasses 50K    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $465 and climbing 3.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

42385116,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAOB,1605127369,Venezuela's Bitcoin Story Puts It in a Category of One,"Venezuela is an example of cryptocurrency adoption during an economic crisis. No other economy facing hyperinflation has come near the South American nation in terms of GDP-adjusted activity on peer-to-peer crypto exchanges, according to new CoinDesk Research analysis of data from LocalBitcoins and Paxful, the two largest such exchanges.      Previous reporting from CoinDesk has shown that amid platform bans by the government and Venezuelans’ unease toward foreign crypto coverage, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions remain at the center of the country’s thriving crypto scene. In general, Venezuelans cite a combination of factors for the rise of crypto there including migration, capital controls, risk of government seizure, demand for hard money and exposure to the petro, the cryptocurrency backed by the government.      Whatever the main cause, data indicate unique factors could be driving bitcoin adoption in Venezuela, which is far outpacing adoption in countries experiencing similar economic fallout.      The map above shows a visualization from CoinDesk's GDP-adjusted database of LocalBitcoins and Paxful volume by currency. Venezuela's dominance is apparent.      Other GDP-adjusted analyses of peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volumes, such as this one from analyst Matt Ahlborg, excluded Paxful, which has become a major platform. In this data visualization from CoinDesk, we include both LocalBitcoins and Paxful data and adjust for GDP. Peer-to-peer activity in Venezuela has continued to dominate – with a monthly level at least twice as high as the next-largest market, Nigeria. Paxful’s exit from Venezuela is imminent, but its growth in other parts of the world make it an important component of analysis that looks at peer-to-peer crypto trading on a global scale.      Peer-to-peer crypto exchanges are often where people come to buy their first crypto assets, Ahlborg argued in the same analysis, and so their activities can depict how the crypto asset is adopted on the ground level more truthfully than larger exchanges that are set up for fast-paced, speculative trading.      By and large, this is true in Venezuela. Expats use bitcoin to send remittances back home, where locals convert it to bolivars to buy food and pay bills. With crypto remittances from expats plunging, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions within the country have proven resilient. LocalBitcoins and Paxful trades using bolivars peaked in the first half of 2019, and have since hovered around $20 million.      Continued high volumes are driven by businesses' demand for bitcoin, according to Gabriel Jiménez, a Venezuelan blockchain entrepreneur who led the development of the petro. Venezuelan businesses often use bitcoin as a medium to obtain foreign currencies like the dollar, he said.      Read more: Here in Venezuela, Doctors Struggle to Access Aid From Crypto Platform      Yet, other countries that also suffer from hyperinflation have not come close to Venezuela in peer-to-peer bitcoin activity. Among the 10 economies that have experienced the highest rates of annual inflation since 2017, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, only Venezuela, Argentina and Iran have shown significant peer-to-peer bitcoin market activity, and none approach Venezuela in size or consistency. Venezuela's peer-to-peer bitcoin activity has been extraordinary, whether measured as an absolute or relative to GDP.      What sets Venezuela apart may be governmental support of a digital currency. The petro helped loosen Venezuelans’ fear of dealing with services like LocalBitcoins, said Jiménez.      Some high-inflation countries have moved in the other direction. The government of Zimbabwe, where the two largest peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges have shown zero activity, has made efforts to curb cryptocurrency adoption.      There are other factors: Venezuela's inflation rate is measured by the International Monetary Fund at orders of magnitude higher than any other economy in the top five by annual inflation rates. It hit 65,374% in 2018. The next-highest rate of inflation tracked by the IMF over the past three years is in Zimbabwe, where it is projected to be 319% in 2020.      “People living in Venezuela are living under a very unstable and predatory government. They suffer from extreme inflation and general economic instability. And here’s a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof asset, so it’s very attractive to people who are looking for a way to maintain value,"" said Andrea O'Sullivan, director of tech and innovation at James Madison Institute, a Washington think tank.    Peer-to-peer vs. centralized exchanges    According to Jiménez, Venezuelans prefer peer-to-peer exchanges also because they’re better than other alternatives. Centralized services, for example, have lower liquidity and less-developed trading capabilities due to a lack of service from Venezuelan banks.      The “early bird” factor is yet another reason. LocalBitcoins became such a popular exchange in Venezuela not only because it was inexpensive, but also because it was the first thing available to Venezeulans as soon as government normalization of cryptocurrencies was in the air around 2017, Jiménez added. Veteran LocalBitcoins traders have their ratings, number of successful trades and years of experience visible on their profile pages, which attracts and maintains customers’ loyalty to them and, in turn, both sides’ loyalty to the platform.      Read more: Venezuela Rolls Out Ethereum-Based Stock Exchange to Help Skirt US Sanctions      In contrast, Paxful only made plans to enter the market by late 2018, and research from CoinDesk shows that bolivar-bitcoin trades on the platform have only amounted to less than 1% of their LocalBitcoins counterparts in terms of monthly volume.      Yet, even though it’s slated to cease all operations in Venezuela because of heavy U.S. sanctions against the country, Paxful has been on the rise. In July, trades involving bolivars doubled the June volume, crossing the $100,000 line for the first time since the currency was reissued in August 2018, the research shows. The exchange is also enjoying explosive growth in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya.    People living in Venezuela suffer from extreme inflation and general economic instability. And here’s a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof asset, so it’s very attractive to people who are looking for a way to maintain value.    That said, Paxful’s monthly volume in each of these countries has only amounted to half of LocalBitcoins’ growth in Venezuela, our data visualization shows. Peer-to-peer activity continues to be most dominant in Venezuela, where it is used to skirt government restrictions and obtain foreign fiats.      It's possible that, as Jiménez suggested, Venezuela's peer-to-peer bitcoin activity wouldn’t be where it is today without crypto-friendly initiatives from the government itself. It's also possible that bitcoin adoption in Venezuela may be driven by the sheer rate of Venezuela's hyperinflation, which outpaces other crisis economies. As bitcoin's real-world uses continue to crystallize, yet other factors may emerge as drivers of its adoption.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Duy Nguyen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/11/venezuelas-bitcoin-story-puts-it-in-a-category-of-one,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a222b1e4b45899dbacf68d552eb77ea39d633c0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAHt,1605124233,"Flash Loans Aren’t the Problem, Centralized Price Oracles Are","Since the beginning of the year, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has rapidly grown to more than $12 billion in total value locked. With this exponential growth, incentives have increased for malicious actors to manipulate and attack vulnerable DeFi protocols, often at the expense of regular users.      One of the more recent tools used within many DeFi attacks are flash loans – a new type of financial primitive that allows users to open uncollateralized loans with the sole stipulation that the loan be paid back within the same transaction or it reverts. This is a significant departure from traditional DeFi lending, which often requires a user to over-collateralize a loan upfront.    Adelyn Zhou is CMO of Chainlink Labs, where she leads marketing for Chainlink, the world's most widely adopted decentralized oracle network.    The novelty of a flash loan is that it can temporarily make anyone in the world a very well-capitalized actor, with the potential to suddenly manipulate the market. In the recent string of attacks, we’ve seen malicious actors use flash loans to instantaneously borrow, swap, deposit and again borrow large numbers of tokens so they can artificially move a token’s price on a single exchange. This sequence is essentially the foot in the door, allowing the attacker to then exploit that exchange’s anomalous pricing.      When flash loans are used as part of a larger malicious scheme to manipulate a protocol and steal its funds, the phrase “flash loan attack” becomes the hot crypto term of the week. Media outlets and Twitter influencers alike focus on the workings of the flash loan, dissecting each step the malicious actor took to jump from token to token, protocol to protocol, all within one transaction.      But the phrase “flash loan attack” doesn’t capture the complete issue at hand. Flash loans do not create vulnerabilities within DeFi – they simply reveal vulnerabilities that already exist. “Flash loan attacks” are often just attacks on oracles, the entities that connect on-chain DeFi applications with off-chain data, such as the fair market price of a certain asset. The real systemic risk in the DeFi ecosystem is around centralized oracles, not flash loans.      For those on the sidelines watching an attack unfold, there’s something fascinating about flash loans. The idea that anyone can suddenly control huge amounts of money and deploy it in novel, exotic and, yes, sometimes even malicious ways showcases how this technology can empower the individual and unlock entirely new financial instruments. Rather than analyzing the ultimate function and target of the flash loan, we instead marvel at the ingenuity of its creator and the sophistication of the attack. As a result, flash loans are increasingly characterized as a dangerous DeFi innovation.      See also: Haseeb Qureshi - The DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack That Changed Everything      As Marc Zeller of Aave, a DeFi protocol that offers flash loans, succinctly points out, flash loans are just a tool: “They allow you to act like a whale for the duration of a transaction.” Any attack executed via a flash loan can also be executed without a flash loan by a well-capitalized actor. All a flash loan does is temporarily make anyone in the world a well-capitalized actor because obtaining a flash loan is permissionless and has no upfront collateral requirements.      Sure, open access to such funds greatly increases the number of people who can carry out such an attack. But even in a world without flash loans, increased adoption of blockchain technology will only continue to provide faster access to larger amounts of liquidity.    Focus on what’s wrong    We need to pay attention to what these malicious actors are actually doing with their newfound funds. A pattern has clearly emerged: Malicious parties use flash loans to exploit DeFi protocols that depend on a single decentralized exchange (DEX) as the protocol’s sole price oracle. They use the flash loan to manipulate and skew the price of one or multiple assets on the DEX, leading to inaccurate price data being fed to DeFi applications using that DEX-based price oracle.      The malicious actor then exploits the opportunity and generates a profit at the direct expense of regular users. In obsessing over the specific tool used during the exploit, our industry is overlooking the real lesson from these attacks: DeFi protocols relying on price oracles that fetch data from just a single trading venue can be compromised by actors with large amounts of money.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work      These are oracle attacks, with attack vectors that have not only been predicted, but also have already happened before. The focus on flash loans distracts us from a bigger issue that DeFi protocols with hundreds of millions and sometimes upward of $1 billion TVL still rely on single exchanges for their price feed oracle. As we’ve seen, a single exchange can be subjected to a wide variety of volume shifts and whale manipulation. The consequences for another protocol that relies on a centralized price feed are clear.      Today, numerous top DeFi dApps by TVL use decentralized networks of oracles that account for volume and liquidity differences across multiple exchanges asynchronously and across multiple different transactions, making them impervious to flash loan-funded manipulation. As more users are attracted to the financial accessibility and opportunity of this ecosystem, and as DeFi protocols absorb more value from global markets, it is incumbent upon the maintainers of these protocols to adopt decentralized oracle solutions that protect users from what are, by now, well-understood, preventable attacks.      So the next time you hear the phrase “flash loan attack,” think twice. The flash loan was likely used to target a specific vulnerability in the system: a price oracle without market coverage. The oracle is supposed to be a protocol’s definitive source of truth – about the price of an asset, about the state of a market. As we’ve seen, whoever can manipulate that source stands to gain tremendously. The truth behind flash loan attacks: They’re funded by flash loans, but they’re price oracle attacks.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Adelyn Zhou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/11/flash-loans-arent-the-problem-centralized-price-oracles-are,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ffe5f978e160a4e74858448366b740341ee1daf-1240x885.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAJ9,1605114721,"US Representatives Rip OCC, Brooks for 'Excessive Focus' on Crypto","Several U.S. lawmakers are displeased by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and its focus on crypto and fintech during a pandemic-caused recession.      Six members of Congress faulted the banking regulator's stance on crypto custody and stablecoin services, as well as its plans to offer a fintech charter, in a sharply worded letter Tuesday that questioned whether Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks has his priorities straight during COVID-19's health and economic crises.      Brooks has no business bolstering crypto banking while millions of Americans are still waiting for economic relief, wrote Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) in a letter co-signed by Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Jesús García (D-Ill.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). They blasted OCC's ""unilateral actions"" as short-sighted calls they said could put ""the entire hierarchy"" of dollar-denominated financial assets at risk.      ""The OCC plays an important role in providing stable forms of currency. However, the decisions of your agency have the potential to adversely affect banking and financial activities well beyond your jurisdiction,"" they wrote.      The letter appears to be the first substantial congressional critique of a financial regulator that has indeed thrown its weight behind crypto. In July, OCC gave national banks the go-ahead to custody assets like bitcoin and ether for their clients. Then, in September, the agency allowed banks to begin offering stablecoin issuers banking services.      Those twin decisions could take crypto banking mainstream in the United States. But, according to the lawmakers, they're not OCC's calls to unilaterally make. They castigated Brooks, a former Coinbase lawyer, for failing to consult with Congress and other agencies on his crypto regulation first.      ""We also question whether this is an appropriate priority for the OCC in the midst of this pandemic,"" the representatives wrote.      Read more: The OCC's Crypto Custody Letter Was Years in the Making      Cryptocurrency should not take precedence over America's systemic banking access issues, the representatives wrote. Around 8% of Americans use crypto. But a combined 25% of their fellow citizens are either unbanked or underbanked. Their shaky financials are deteriorating further amidst the pandemic, representatives said.      ""Arguably, the immediate needs of millions of at-risk individuals who have not yet received an economic stimulus check and/or cannot deposit their funds in a bank, deserve greater attention than an effort to increase access to financial services to the “banked community” via mobile phones,"" they wrote.      The representatives asked that Brooks explain OCC's stance on stablecoin regulation and consumer protection by Dec. 10.      Wednesday's letter isn't the first asking Brooks to explain himself; Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to Brooks in September, asking him to update the committee with the OCC's findings and detail the next steps the regulatory agency would be taking. Crapo also called for clear regulations to be drafted around cryptocurrency services in the letter.

The world's second-largest bank will issue $3 billion in blockchain bonds. President-elect Joe Biden's transition team features some noted crypto commenters.    Top shelf    Chain split Wednesday morning, around 08:00 UTC, Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura disclosed a service outage for its Ethereum mainnet API, related to one of the blockchain’s major clients, Geth. Industry participants began speculating over a possible “chain split,” or a type of unplanned and unannounced hard fork. The issue likely stems from the split between node operators who have and have not upgraded Geth. ""Those who haven’t been upgrading their Geth nodes for a while (I presume several months at least) got split with those with new Geth versions,"" Nikita Zhavoronkov, lead developer at Blockchair said, adding that his own services were restored after upgrading. As of press time, Infura has identified the root cause and has begun work towards recovery.      Blockchain bonds The world’s second-largest bank (market cap), China Construction Bank (CCB), will issue $3 billion worth of bonds on a blockchain. These tokenized bonds (offered at the state-owned bank’s Labuan, Malaysia, branch) will be exchangeable for bitcoin and U.S. dollars on the Fusang digital asset exchange. Tokenization reduces the number of financial intermediaries and costs associated with issuance, meaning that CCB can offer the certificates for as little as $100 (rather than the typical $4,000 price tag) and offer yields of 0.75% (compared to the 0.25% industry standard).      Tokenization chill Despite a DeFi cooldown, the number of tokenized BTC on Ethereum increased 21% since September. There are now well over 150,000 BTC, worth some $2.3 billion, on Ethereum. However, the trend has slowed significantly. Roughly $360 million worth of bitcoins was tokenized in October, compared to the $737 million tokenized in September, according to data from Dune Analytics. Notably, the pace of tokenization still outpaced the rate of mining issuance for the third consecutive month.      Brain trust President-elect Joe Biden announced his transition team yesterday, a “brain trust” of policy experts featuring some with close ties to the crypto industry. Most notably, former CFTC chairman and noted blockchain commentator Gary Gensler will lead the Biden financial policy transition team, responsible for Federal Reserve and banking and securities regulators review. MIT’s Simon Johnson, who has written about blockchain technology; Georgetown’s Chris Brummer and University of California’s Mehrsa Baradaran, known for their comments on Facebook’s libra project; and one of the “digital dollar’s” architects, Lev Menand, have also been tapped as part of the transition team.

(CoinDesk)  Service journalism: Multisignature wallets can keep your coins safer (if you use them right). (CoinDesk)  So you want to use a price oracle, ETH whisperer Samczsun writes. (Blog)  Sam Bankman-Fried: ""When incentives are gone, what's left? DeFi gets mixed marks.” (The Defiant)  Market intel    Coin consolidation Market analysts are largely bullish on bitcoin’s prospects to test all-time highs of $20,000, though many foresee a period of consolidation in the coming weeks and months. CoinDesk market reporter Omkar Godbole writes, “further notable gains look unlikely in the short term, as the cryptocurrency’s 60% rally from $9,800 to $15,900 seen over the past two months looks overstretched, per the technical charts.” A position also taken by Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, who sees consolidation between $14,000 to $16,000 in the next few weeks. Diminished sell-side liquidy, driven by increased institutional action, could be a factor here, Godbole notes.    At stake    Privacy coins Colorado-based cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has delisted a roster of privacy coins including zcash (ZEC), monero (XMR) and dash (DASH).      Citing regulatory concerns, Veronica McGregor, ShapeShift’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk’s Brady Dale that the action was taken to “derisk” the company.      At the moment, it seems like ShapeShift is alone in disabling certain privacy coins. There was no immediate change to regulatory policy that might have incentivized the move – though the general thrust of overriding guidance would suggest that privacy coins are in financial watchdogs’ crosshairs.      Dale spoke with Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center director of research and a zcash Foundation board member, who compared privacy coins to bags of cash – currently the denomination of choice for criminal activity.      The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, “basically says, you have to make sure you are taking reasonable steps from a cost-benefit analysis to stop the proceeds from crime from flowing through your institution,” Van Valkenburgh said.      What defines a reasonable step is still open to interpretation, given the broad mandate of laws like the Bank Secrecy Act. Van Valkenburgh noted that these vague regulations do offer ways for crypto companies to offer privacy coin services, “just as banks deal with cash.”      Notably, monero, the 14th largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the only one of the coins in question that offers privacy by design, is something of a pariah for centralized exchanges. Of the major exchanges, only Kraken offers XMR trading, Decrypt reported.      Blockchain forensic firm CypherTrace was tapped by the Department of Homeland Security to crack monero's privacy protections, while the IRS has offered a similar contract to Chainalysis and Integra to crack monero, zcash, dash, grin, komodo, verge and horizon.      Offering a peak behind the hood of regulatory conversations, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong essentially said this summer that regulators speak softly but carry a big stick.      “A lot of it is behind-the-scenes conversations where [regulators] are kind of saying: ‘We very much don’t think you should do this. And then we have the conversation: ‘Well, are you telling us that you don’t like it, or are you telling us that you are going to sue us if we do it?,’” Armstrong reportedly said.

Over a period of months, unknown persons set up phishing websites that mimicked Binance's own, and collected users' login details to attempt to access accounts and breach the platform.      The exchange announced Wednesday that it has now awarded a bounty of $200,000 to private investigators, whom it did not identify, for providing a report identifying one of the alleged attackers and providing information on how the attack was carried out.      Binance made the decision to hand over the promised bounty after two individuals said to be responsible for the phishing attempt were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) in February, and also sanctioned by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in September.      The security team at Binance had passed on the investigators' findings to U.S. law enforcement, along with ""other information and indicators,"" the exchange said. It also work with U.S. agencies to help identify the suspects.      The DoJ and OFAC named Danil Potekhin and Dimitrii Kamasavidi, both from Russia, as the alleged perpetrators of the phishing campaign. Further, the Justice Department accuses both of also having carried out similar attacks on the Bittrex, Poloniex and Gemini cryptocurrency exchanges resulting in combined losses of $17 million.

42433089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Bh,1605111550,Bitcoin Hashrate Rebounds as Asian Miners Bring Machines Back Online,"Bitcoin’s hashrate bounced 30% Wednesday from quarterly lows on Nov. 2 as miners brought ASIC machines back online after relocating them out of China’s Sichuan province as the wet season ended in late October, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Bitcoin’s mining difficulty registered a record-setting percentage decrease on Nov. 3 – the largest since the advent of ASIC miners – as bitcoin miners shuffled their machines around the globe to access cheaper power causing the network's hashrate to drop considerably.      A “large percentage” of all machines taken offline through the end of October are back online, said Alejandro De La Torre, vice president at Poolin, in a direct message with CoinDesk Wednesday. “There are, of course, some that may take longer,” he added, but most of the relocation process – typically a brief two-week period – is finished.      For most miners, the migration process is not very difficult, said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology, in a conversation with CoinDesk about miners migrating from Sichuan to Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other regions. “Most miners can un-rack, drive them over and re-install in less than two weeks,” he said.      Miners return to Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and other regions to tap into “fossil fuel, wind, or geothermal” power sources in those regions, De La Torre explained.      But this year’s miner migration is different from previous years. According to Vera, “Some Chinese miners have decided to move out of China altogether.” He named Iran, Kazakhstan and Venezuela as popular, low-cost mining destinations. “The Chinese are getting very comfortable with hosting their miners in [Iran and Kazakhstan] with local partners,” Vera told CoinDesk.      The rapid increase in hashrate should continue over the next couple of weeks, said Qingfei Lei, CMO at F2Pool. “Most of the rigs are back online, but not all of them,” Lei said, noting that he expects more hash power to return since “some rigs in transit are still offline.”      The returning hash power is helping to clean out Bitcoin’s previously congested mempool, a sort of holding depot for transactions awaiting confirmation by miners. The volume of transactions filling the mempool neared two-year highs on Oct. 28, reaching the highest unconfirmed transaction count since January 2018. Following the return of hash power, mempool transaction count has returned to somewhat normal levels through early November.      A positive difficulty adjustment is expected as the network reacts to the surge in temporarily inactive hash power, said De La Torre. Estimated to happen on Nov. 16, the increase would start the network’s rebound following the record-setting difficulty drop two weeks prior on Nov. 3.      At the current block pace, the adjustment is expected to be above 6%, Vera told CoinDesk. But he thinks it’s likely to reach an increase of more than 8%.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/11/bitcoin-hashrate-rebounds-as-asian-miners-bring-machines-back-online,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c71355d326dd97ad7f2ae97c3a52c714cfd9a741-1162x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3lh,1605110459,Ethereum Heavyweights Launch LiquidStake Loans to Ease Eth 2.0 ‘Lockup’,"A coalition of Ethereum OGs is tackling the so-called “lockup” issue, whereby the first generation of participants staking crypto on the transitioning Eth 2.0 blockchain must commit their coins to a restrictive multi-year contract.  Announced Wednesday, LiquidStake, which is being launched by crypto trading firm DARMA Capital, will allow ether (ETH) stakers to take out USDC stablecoin loan against their staked assets while earning staking rewards from the new network.  In addition, U.S.-registered investment fund DARMA, founded by former ConsenSys stalwarts Andrew Keys and James Slazas, intends to allocate over $50 million worth of ETH to Ethereum’s new deposit contract.  There are obvious economic incentives for participants to take part in Ethereum’s evolutionary step vis-a-vis staking because they can earn, say, 15% on those assets over the course of however many months it takes the network to complete further upgrades, said DARMA Capital founder Andrew Keys.  “I call it the one-way street problem,” Keys said. “Participants will not be able to ‘unstake’ those assets. So we’ve created LiquidStake, wherein users can earn staking rewards, and have their staked ETH be pledged as collateral to receive a USDC loan. This is very different from BlockFi and Celsius and other lenders, because in those cases you can’t stake the ether and you can’t earn the reward.”  Necessity and invention  The first phase (phase zero) of Ethereum’s migration to a proof-of-stake blockchain involves some 16,384 validators each committing a minimum of 32 ETH in a deposit contract. Those tokens will then be staked to secure and govern a new parallel Ethereum blockchain known as Beacon, a live environment for testing proof-of-stake, which will eventually return the staking rewards to those validators.  Since the deposit contract went live this week, some 52,801 ETH has been locked up, worth $23.8 million. (At least 524,288 ETH split between 16,384 stakers is needed to trigger Eth 2.0’s “genesis event” and activate the upgrade.) In addition to the staking rewards returned to those validors, earning potential can still be derived from those locked up funds. This is exactly the sort of innovation seen springing up everywhere in the decentralized finance (DeFi) field.  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Tops $22.5M One Week After Launch  The same can be said of Wall Street’s engineers who come up with new products in response to rule changes. As CoinDesk’s Michael Casey points out, it doesn't matter if the behavior-constraining rules are imposed by a government regulator or, in the Ethereum 2.0 case, by a protocol. “Constraints create an incentive for financial creativity,” he wrote.  LiquidStake is by no means the only attempt to solve this problem.  Indeed, a taxonomy for liquid staking includes a number of smart contract protocols issuing tokenized claims on staked assets, such as Rocket Pool, Blox or StakerDAO. Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are also keen to get in on the action, with various Eth 2.0 staking products in the offing.  Ethereum establishment  But LiquidStake is a confident play, heavily backed by what could be called the Ethereum establishment: the project involves the likes of ConsenSys, Bison Trails, Figment, OpenLaw, and Filecoin.  “LiquidStake offers an ideal solution for ETH holders looking to stay liquid while staking,” ConsenSys founder and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin said in a statement. “I’m excited to watch DARMA Capital play a significant role in the Eth2 transition with LiquidStake, which has selected ConsenSys’ Codefi platform as its staking partner.”  Filecoin founder Juan Benet added: “Protocol Labs already uses DARMA’s swaps for a crucial component in the Filecoin ecosystem, and we plan to do the same with our staked ETH treasury.”  Read more: ConsenSys Capital Co-Founder Departs to Bring Wall Street Money to Ethereum  DARMA Capital co-founder Slazas made clear that LiquidStake is for individuals who are going to borrow against collateral, while DARMA Capital is an entirely separate entity designed for institutions entering into total return swaps. (Such instruments are agreements in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains.)  “The big reason for institutions to want to enter into a swap is basically that it gives a lot of regulatory and tax clarity,” Slazas said. “There’s some great work being done to clarify if I move from Eth 1 to Eth 2 is that a taxable event? Given that those are up in the air, and we don’t know what the actual answer is today, if you enter into a swap, you do know the tax treatment of what a swap is.”  The LiquidStake business model is based on taking a cut of the interest rate, and then a part of the reward rate, said Slazas. “The exact interest rates and your loan to value rates will change a little bit. But what we're doing is we are just adding 5% of what the reward rate is, as our fee on the loans.”  See Also: CoinDesk Research Note on Ethereum's Transaction Model  LiquidStake helps the Ethereum community face the number one fear with respect to the Eth 2 upgrade, said Keys: liquidity.  “Now they can have all of their ETH deposited to stake, and if they need money they can take a loan,” said Keys. “It could be to pay their rent, or they could buy more ETH and stake that, or maybe they want to enter the wild world of DeFi.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | RPL,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/11/ethereum-heavyweights-launch-liquidstake-loans-to-ease-eth-20-lockup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fc30ff7a26f01c3336d4e39881345459e27eb21-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO393h,1605110453,African Startups Should Tokenize to Break Biased Funding Cycles,"In Africa, there is a long-running feud between white expatriates and ex-Ivy League founders on the one hand, and grassroots-bred Black local founders on the other. At stake is who has bragging rights to Africa’s hot, rising startup narrative.      Locals from East Africa and Nigeria accuse “wazungus,” or outsiders, of perpetuating racially biased venture capital funding cycles, muddying the funding landscape for the real African founders.    Michael Kimani is a creator at Cryptobaraza, an experienced market builder of fintech, blockchain and crypto products in Africa.    With close to $5 billion invested since 2014, mostly fromAsian, European and U.S. investment banks, venture capital firms, development agencies and limited partnerships, allocations in key African markets are causing disharmony.      In Kenya, the divide involves local and white expatriates, while in Nigeria the tension is between local founders and Nigerians schooled abroad.      It’s time for a radical solution rooted in the technology we want to develop.      I propose tokenizing African startup debt and equity on a blockchain, under a clear consumer framework, as a way to break the white man’s curse.    The issue is structural    The question of whether or not to invest in Africa has always been one of risk. In an environment where property rights are questionable, foreign investors' concerns boil down to “can I get my money in and out?”      Years of infringement of property rights, foreign currency controls and sudden shifts in governance have built a negative image among international firms.      To counter this, African startups have mastered the craft of incorporating in foreign jurisdictions better suited to the wishes of investors. Investors want somewhere that is safe and flexible, where there is legal precedent for protecting shareholder rights and clear processes for acquisitions and exits.      See also: This Bitcoin Documentary From Africa Is Streaming on Amazon Prime      One such jurisdiction is the U.S. state of Delaware, home to 70% of thousands of African startups incorporated outside the continent. Setting up in the U.S. and similar jurisdictions, with years of goodwill, is a great exposure to funding from U.S. angel and institutional investors.      Five years ago, Nigeria’s Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi were enrolled at Y Combinator, one of the world's most prestigious seed-stage accelerators. When they set out to build Paystack, a pan-African payments processor company, their dream was to build the Stripe of Africa. No Nigerian company had ever made the cut for the highly coveted cohort slots.      Y Combinator, based out of the U.S., had just begun to move into Africa as part of its strategy of unearthing ventures in emerging markets including India. For every startup that comes up through its ranks, Y combinator dolls out $125,000 in return for 7% of the startups using a “post-money” Simple Agreement for Future Equity (the “YC Safe”).    Jumia’s listing came under fire for not being African enough.    But there was a catch. To secure $120,000 in seed, Paystack had to be registered as a U.S. corporation in Delaware. Y Combinator's mandate at the time expressly stated it could only invest in American companies. (It now accepts startups from the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Canada as well.)      Considering the ease of setting up a startup in Delaware ($500 down and a 24-hour wait), it was a no-brainer to register a business with adequate protection to appease investors.      Paystack subsequently raised $1.3 million in 2018, then $8 million from Stripe, Visa, Tencent and Y Combinator. In mid-October, it was acquired by Stripe for $200 million.    What it means    Paystack’s $200 million was a monster validation for Africa’s tech ecosystems, proof that the continent’s ventures could pay off.      So, too, was Jumia, a highly acclaimed pan-African e-commerce company listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Jumia grew from pennies in 2012 to listing 17.6% of its shares for $1.1 billion in 2019.      But while Stripe’s acquisition sparked parades of excitement across Africa’s tech ecosystems, Jumia’s listing came under fire for not being African enough.      Jumia’s Sacha Poignonnec and Jeremy Hodara, two ex-McKinsey consultants specializing in retail, packaging and ecommerce, had spotted an opportunity in Africa. They registered a company in Berlin, Germany, in 2012 and then, with the help of locals in Nigeria, grew e-commerce operations to 6.8 million active customers across 14 African markets in under seven years.      The difference was, unlike Paystack’s two Nigerian founders, Jumia’s founders are both French.      The backlash that followed Jumia’s public listing resurfaced old wounds and pent-up feelings. Local founders felt discriminated against and this time they were backed by the numbers.      An analysis by The Guardian found that of the top-ten African-based startups that scored the highest amount of venture capital in Africa in 2019, eight were led by foreigners.      A report in 2019 by U.S.-based Village Capital showed 90% of funding for East African startups went to expat founders.      See also: Where FATF Crypto Compliance Gets Interesting: Africa      Viktoria Ventures, based out of Nairobi, East Africa, found that only 6% of startups that received more than $1 million in 2019 in Kenya and East Africa were led by locals. Expat founders continued to receive most of the funding in Ghana and Uganda as well. Nigeria and South Africa fared a little better, with 55% and 56% raised by local founders respectively.      Despite a lack of clear evidence that white founders are better at founding and growing startups than local black founders, or founders schooled locally versus abroad, statistics point to a bias in fund allocation. The ecosystem seems not to have figured out what a successful company looks like.      Jumia’s Frenchmen had played the best of both worlds, hiring locals to grease operations on the ground and a cadre of white executives for the fine-dining investor occasions.      But who is to blame?      Local investors do not have the expertise or risk appetite of high-flying Silicon Valley VCs. Local capital markets do not have the capacity to support the risk profile of early-stage ventures. Only 20% of venture cash into startups came from Africa-based investors. The stark difference in cost of capital between African credit markets and the global north tilts the scale in favor of transatlantic investors. It is only now that a cream of local founders are beginning to show exits and could potentially become investors themselves.    A new approach    I propose we wrest power from exclusive VC networks and give it back to the market. Unless we find a new source of capital, VCs will keep calling the shots that determine the winners and losers.      Let us turn every stake in a startup, be it equity or debt into representative digital tokens on a blockchain, backed by enforceable rights and obligations at an economic freezone or jurisdiction of choice. In other words, any digital stock or share would be legally admissible in a court of jurisdiction of choice as evidence of ownership.      Startups that wish to comply with the law, but still take advantage of this market, could issue shares using a token standard designed to mimic a paper share, while getting rid of the paper.    Unless we find a new source of capital, VCs will keep calling the shots that determine the winners and losers.    Once startups can be traded as digital tokens, we can use crypto asset exchange infrastructure to create exit opportunities for early stage investors, or distribute opportunities to investors from around the world to try their luck at funding African startups.      SureRemit, a Nigerian remittance startup proved it was possible to tokenize access to capital, during the famed initial coin offering (ICO) boom, an epoch in which more than 1,000 projects raised over $20 billion through tokenized funding.      SureRemit secured $10 million over a 30-day public crowdsale, by issuing half of a total 1 billion RMT tokens in exchange for bitcoin, litecoin, ether and stellar at the price of $0.02 per token.      The trouble was, RMT tokens are not pegged to equity or debt or stake in the company. RMT was merely intended as a utility token, not an instrument of equity or debt.      See also: Nigeria Protests Show Bitcoin Adoption Is Not Coming: It’s Here      The founders have since come under criticism from some disgruntled Nigerian investors over the CEO taking a break from running the company to further his studies, a declining token price struggling for liquidity and a utility token model that is yet to materialize.      In hindsight, ICOs was a peek into the potential of tokenization to unlock capital for young projects, but also showed the risk of funding amorphous projects with no consumer protection frameworks.      That’s why, a month ago, Nigeria’s Securities Exchange Commission drew up a framework for crypto assets, outlining a listing process for crypto assets such as tokenized securities and utility tokens.      In Delaware, an amendment to Title 8 of the Delaware code relating to the General Corporation allows Delaware corporations to use networks of electronic databases (examples of which are described currently as distributed ledgers or a blockchain) for the creation and maintenance of corporate records, including the corporation's stock ledger.      It appears we Africans have all the pieces and a playbook. If the world is awash with capital, it's time to tokenize African ventures and break the white man’s curse.

42433098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Rh,1605107096,"First Mover: Bitcoin Pause, Ethereum Snafu, 1,000% Returns Put Focus on Exchange Tokens","Bitcoin was higher, pushing toward the upper edge of its recent range between about $14,700 and $15,600.      ""The positive sentiment towards bitcoin has not gone away,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto prime broker Bequant.      In traditional markets, Asian shares tumbled, led by Alibaba and Tencent, as Chinese government issues regulations designed to curb growing influence of big tech companies. European shares were up, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. Gold weakened 0.1% to $1,875 an ounce.    Market Moves    Crypto-exchange tokens like Binance coin (BNB) and FTX's FTX (FTT) started out as a sort of in-house currency: Traders could use them within the closed environment to buy digital assets, getting discounts on transaction fees.      But recently some digital-asset traders are thinking of them a bit more like traditional stocks – as a bet on the exchange itself. It's also increasingly possible to park the tokens in various systems and protocols for yield, not too dissimilar from a dividend.      And some of them are registering outsize gains. Binance's BNB tokens have gained about 30% this year, while FTX token is up 157% and upstart Hxro's token has increased 10-fold in price.      Exchange management teams increasingly viewing the tokens as a way to bind loyalty among customers. The rationale, according to Jack Purdy, senior research analyst at the cryptocurrency research firm Messari, could be that the exchanges now view token holders as an important component to their long-term business success.      The specter of an unexpected move by authorities to crack down on the tokens – precisely because of their resemblance to stocks – remains a threat.      Exchange tokens ""are a gray area with equity-like characteristics,” Purdy said. “Regulatory concerns are definitely a problem because they definitely look like securities under U.S. laws.”      - Muyao Shen      Read More: Exchange Tokens Are Skyrocketing as They Act More Like Equity; That Could be a Problem    Bitcoin watch    After the recent rapid rally, the bitcoin market is likely to take a breather before continuing its rise toward the end of the year, analysts told CoinDesk.      “The cryptocurrency may consolidate for a short period before moving higher” toward the end of the year, said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      Indeed, further notable gains look unlikely in the short term, as the cryptocurrency’s 60% rally from $9,800 to $15,900 seen over the past two months looks overstretched, per the technical charts. Both the 14-day and 14-week relative strength indexes are hovering well above 70, indicating overbought conditions and scope for consolidation or minor pullback.      Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, expects bitcoin to consolidate in the range of $14,000 to $16,000 in the next few weeks.      He expects the pause to allow a rally in alternative cryptocurrencies, most of which have lagged bitcoin in the past two months.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Likely to Consolidate Before December Rise Toward $20K, Say Analysts    Token watch    Ether (ETH): Prices hold firm as Ethereum service provider Infura suffers outage from reported blockchain split.

Pulling from Armanino’s TrustExplorer API, the Chainlink integration makes the data available on-chain, which then lets app builders develop preventative measures against fractional reserve banking or other potential red flags.      “One of the things that we think will be immediate will probably be on Aave – they’ll build-in risk circuit-breakers,” said Noah Buxton, Armanino’s blockchain director. “They’ll look at if the token is collateralized – is it a stable stablecoin – and then be able to build risk functionality around that.”      One of the problems that lending protocol Compound has with listing stablecoins is ensuring that stablecoin issuers are actually capable of minting the coins and keeping them properly collateralized, said TrustToken CEO Rafael Cosman.

42433093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Hh,1605100356,"Bitcoin Likely to Consolidate Before December Rise Toward $20K, Say Analysts","After the recent rapid rally, the bitcoin (BTC) market is likely to take a breather before continuing its rise toward the end of the year, analysts told CoinDesk.      ""The cryptocurrency may consolidate for a short period before moving higher into Christmas,"" said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      Indeed, further notable gains look unlikely in the short term, as the cryptocurrency's 60% rally from $9,800 to $15,900 seen over the past two months looks overstretched, per the technical charts. Both the 14-day and 14-week relative strength indices are hovering well above 70, indicating overbought conditions and scope for consolidation or minor pullback.      Echoing Thomas' comments, Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, expects bitcoin to consolidate in the range of $14,000 to $16,000 in the next few weeks. However, he expects the pause to allow a rally in alternative cryptocurrencies, most of which have lagged bitcoin in the past two months.      Others suggest bitcoin may be heading for more than consolidation. ""Bitcoin is overbought after surging through critical resistance at $14,000, which suggests we could see a period of correction and consolidation,' Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital said.      Historically, bitcoin has seen multiple pullbacks of over 20% in previous bull markets. This time, however, a big drawdown looks likely as sell-side liquidity appears to have dried up with the increased institutional participation and strong holding sentiment among investors.      While observers stand divided on whether prices would consolidate or retreat in the short term, there seems to be a consensus that bitcoin's long-term prospects are bullish, with some anticipating a re-test of the record high of $20,000 by the end of December.      Also read: Bitcoin’s Weekly Close Above 2019 High Leaves Runway Clear to $20K      ""We expect short-term volatility alongside even more powerful upward trends, flirting with $20,000 before year's end and, if the stars align, $50,000 to $80,000 by the end of 2021,"" Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based trading firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk. Investor sentiment has never been better, Chu added.      Swissquote's Thomas also expects a weaker dollar and political uncertainty in the U.S. to power bitcoin higher in the long run.      All things considered, bitcoin is likely to maintain its overall upward trajectory. ""Look for the market to establish above $20,000 in 2021 before the next major upside extension into the $30,000-$40,000 range, Kruger said, and added that, ""any major setbacks should be well supported above $8,000.""

42433097,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Jh,1605099796,Audius Has Big Numbers by Crypto Standards but Can It Take On SoundCloud?,"The Takeaway:    Audius is an Ethereum-based streaming app looking to take on Spotify and Apple Music by offering artists a better deal.  Like many blockchain projects, Audius is both a company and a network controlled by token holders.  Audius has thousands of regular listeners using it, with a strong base in EDM and a growing cadre of underground hip-hop acts.  Streaming music is free for now and artists mainly use it to build their fan bases. Tokenized monetization options will come later, but when they do, artists will have incredible flexibility.    The music industry has problems the right blockchain application could fix, inching open the door for mainstream crypto adoption – at least that's the dream.      Audius is an Ethereum-enabled music distribution service that takes aim at recognized startups such as SoundCloud and Spotify. Its creators hope that offering a more attractive deal for musicians should help Audius build a stable of musicians so strong that users will come in droves.      According to the Audius block explorer, the network has seen between 30,000 and 50,000 unique users per day since the end of October – a not-insignificant sum in the emerging world of Web 3.0. (For context, according to its third-quarter earnings report, Spotify has 144 million paying users.)      ""It's just been kind of real and exciting to see this response,"" Roneil Rumburg, co-founder and CEO of Audius, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Especially in COVID-19, these [musicians] are really hurting. You can't tour. Most revenue streams have dried up.""      Read more: Audius Rallies EDM Artists, Crypto VCs to Back Vision for Music Payments on Ethereum      Audius had a big surge in interest at the end of October when it announced a distribution of the network's AUDIO token, marking the end of its beta network phase. It gave away 50 million AUDIO tokens to 10,000 super users, mainly the artists who are using Audius, but also to some listeners who play a lot of tracks and offer a lot of feedback.      ""The most exciting thing about Audius to me is that it's not trying to create a new ecosystem with the same players (i.e. DeFi or NFTs),"" Jesse Grushack, a ConsenSys alum and pioneer in the blockchain music space, told CoinDesk over Signal, referring to decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens. ""It's bringing in a totally 'virgin' crypto community that until the release of $AUDIO probably had no idea they were using crypto.""    What is Audius?    Like a lot of the creations in this industry, it is two things. There is the company and the network. The company has raised funds from various venture capital firms in two separate rounds, first from General Catalyst and Lightspeed Capital and second from Multicoin Capital and Blockchange.      Read more: Blockchain for Music Startup Raises $5.5. Million in New Funding      The network is a series of two kinds of nodes, one which hosts content and another that indexes it. On top of that network, there are apps that allow users to interact with the content.      The main app is the Audius web and mobile apps made by the company, but there are a few others already. Anyone can build an interface that interacts with content on Audius.      Artists and fans use the different applications to post content and stream it. To a small degree, users contribute to the useability of the network. When they are active online, the network might direct other users to copies of content that users have temporarily stored for other users who want to access the same file (much in the same way BitTorrent has for years).    How does Audius fit into the crypto world?    Audius is governed on the world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum. It uses an ERC-20 token, AUDIO, for governance and as a security mechanism. Node operators and artists have to stake AUDIO tokens in order to unlock different kinds of features and earning opportunities.      While in beta, Audius used the POA Network, an Ethereum sidechain, to run its content management. In late October, it announced a partial move to the Solana blockchain, which bills itself as incredibly fast and inexpensive.      It's the latest case in point of the ""one network, many chains"" thesis articulated by crypto evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos.      Read more: 'One Network, Many Chains' – The Case for Blockchain Interoperability      Additionally, payments are managed over the network using a basket of stablecoins. Or, it might be better to say, they will be. Monetization is not a major part of the Audius use case here in the early days, but the functionality is there when the time is right.    What kind of token model does Audius use?    Once upon a time, Audius had a two-token model, but that's because when the team first started laying out the vision there was really only one stablecoin, tether (USDT).      So Audius invented this notion of a stablecoin just for its platform called LOUD. However, by the time the company rolled out the beta network, there was a plethora of stablecoins, a trend that has only continued.      Now, Audius only uses the AUDIO token for governance, security and unlocking features.      Like many networks, node operators need to post AUDIO tokens in order to earn future token emissions in its inflationary system (and as a protection against poor performance or malicious performance on the system). According to a Medium post, Audius created 1 billion AUDIO tokens at genesis with 41% designated for the founders and the project and 36% for investors.      Read more: This a16z Alum Is Launching a VC Fund Focused on Platforms You Can 'Own'      The Open Audio Foundation controls another 178 million tokens designated for network growth, though it only has access to 65 million AUDIO immediately. Most everyone's genesis tokens are under some kind of vesting schedules.      As of this writing, the liquid supply is only a bit over 65.6 million AUDIO, according to CoinGecko.      There's currently an emission rate of 7% of new tokens, all of which goes to node operators for now, though Rumburg told CoinDesk that the Audius team hopes the community will vote to spread those emissions around to various stakeholders. (And obviously based on the numbers above, the team and investors have an enormous amount of vote weight there.)    How do musicians use Audius?    Camoufly is an electronic artist who has a lot of tracks posted on Audius, going back to October 2019.      ""I saw a big help coming from them with the launch of $AUDIO,"" Camoufly told CoinDesk, ""so all the music and work I've put on the platform has definitely paid back!""      Right now Audius is mainly a way for new artists to build an audience. The site is dominated by EDM artists, with hip-hop as the second-largest genre (and hardly any acts from other categories, thus far). It's also overwhelmingly underground, but it has a few acts with strong followings, such as Skrillex.      ""I think both of those groups have been very eager, excited to embrace new platforms because they both had a very difficult time breaking into the mainstream to some extent,"" Rumburg said.      Read more: Audius, the 'Decentralized Spotify,' Is Moving Part of Its Service to Solana Blockchain      The project has described itself as picking up where SoundCloud left off, as a way for music junkies to discover unknown acts and have the thrill of knowing new acts first.      ""Since I am an indie singer-songwriter, which is not the typical kind of music you will find there right now, it's still possible people will check you out,"" Noir Yon, a Berlin-based artist told CoinDesk over email. ""I hope it will grow bigger and more and more musicians of different genres will consider to upload their music in addition to other platforms as well.""      Obviously, the network doesn't really become sustainable until it has people spending money over it one way or another, but Rumburg notes that first Audius needs a lot more tracks and a lot more artists. When that happens, the team can start to roll out different approaches to monetization to see what works.      On that front, Audius opens up a plethora of strategies for artists. They can create interesting new ways of enlisting fans in helping them to grow their brands. So, for example, they can ""lock"" tracks, only allowing access to users who have, for example, shared one of their other songs or who hold one of their personal tokens.      Read more: The Man Who Tokenized Himself Gives Holders Power Over His Life      Personal tokens have been a big theme in 2020 and Rumburg said that for now Audius is functioning as a sort of Switzerland for such tokens – it's open to allowing any of the personal token networks to run on Audius.      It's theoretically possible to create any kind of rule for unlocking music. If more robust clients get built to access the Audius network (imagine video games that draw from it for background music or live-streamers who add it to their shows), that opens up other categories for rules and incentives that artists can provide.      A key goal is to make Audius a way for artists to distribute music and earn the lion's share of income that their music earns. Still, not many of its artists have opted into monetization yet.    What do node operators do?    Storage nodes need to have at least two terabytes of storage and a fast internet connection. Discovery node operators need to be able to store an IPFS-based directory of content. Together, they help users find the content they want as fast as possible.      For now, all new token emissions go to operators of these nodes.    Isn't there a problem with copyright and piracy on an open service like Audius?    In October 2019, The Verge went into detail about the history of intellectual property disputes in music and how Audius fits into that persistent story.      It has been true since the earliest days of the web: there's a category of user that is always happy to share content they have no right to.      Rumburg told CoinDesk that Audius already had a tool for rights holders to use that enables requests directly to the node that is hosting disputed content.      ""In the future, we envision there will be an arbitration system that allows the network to openly and transparently resolve disputes of this nature, alongside things like getting revenue shares and splits right if there is a dispute among track owners,"" Rumburg wrote in an email.      Read more: Musicians Want to Break Free of Big Tech      Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora may be good at making sure the right people get paid and the wrong things never get posted, but it is also worth noting that there are ways in which the existing infrastructure has railroaded creator rights in other ways.      Since the pivot to streaming, audio metadata legibility to end-users has become quite poor, robbing behind-the-scenes performers of credit and fans of the ability to get truly obsessive about the finer details.      And most reasonable people agree there's something off about who gets remunerated in the music industry.      ""When only 12% of the recorded music income goes to the people responsible for it,"" Grushack, the ConsenSys alum, wrote. ""We can't sit around and pretend that industry is doing a great job.""    What's the chief obstacle for Audius?    The problem for all applications like this is they need lots of users to obtain network effects. Audius just needs more people coming on. That will attract more artists who will in turn attract more users. This is always the hard part.      It took a long time for Spotify to reach profitability and that has always been tenuous. Apple Music has a variety of unfair advantages.      Music has consistently been a tough area for technology, but the internet keeps trying.      This early, the fact Audius uses crypto is unlikely to make it especially more attractive, but its openness might help if it can build buzz. It's making a similar pitch that other blockchain-based music projects have made before it: the music industry is unfair to artists and this can fix it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/11/audius-has-big-numbers-by-crypto-standards-but-can-it-take-on-soundcloud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1d5100cf85b9c8c6e789468a5535784d7bc6e06-1629x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Dh,1605092439,Exchange Tokens Are Skyrocketing as They Act More Like Equity; That Could Be a Problem,"Centralized exchange tokens have been skyrocketing this year, but none more so than Hxro, which has gained over 1,000% year to date. One of the reasons they have been doing so well might be because exchange tokens have been taking on the behavior of equity in the companies behind the exchanges, arguably the top revenue-getters in the crypto sector.      Unlike stocks, exchange tokens are unregulated. Thus, as they act more and more like equity – despite how promising their potential value may be – their regulatory uncertainty only grows bigger.      Hxro isn’t the only exchange token up this year. FTX’s FTX token is up 157% since Jan. 1 while OKEx’s OKB and Binance’s BNB have each gained roughly 30%. Compared with bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, both Hxro and the FTX token have outperformed the oldest cryptocurrency by roughly 890% and 69%, respectively.      One could make an argument that some centralized exchange tokens have become a better investment than bitcoin, which has rallied above $14,000 this week; what they are getting for the tokens is different from what they would get for buying a run-of-the-mill cryptocurrency.      Similar to frequent flyer programs offered by airline companies, exchange tokens were launched in theory to provide their owners with some benefits. Some allow holders to receive discounts on trading fees, for example. If people use exchange tokens the way they use air mileage programs, there is little reason to invest in these tokens any more than there is to buy miles.    Adding token holder value    Exchange tokens have gradually moved away from their initial role, becoming more like equity in companies that are trying to come up with ways to provide more value to token holders.      Dan Gunsberg, chief executive officer of Hxro, attributed the token’s rally to a liquidity provider program that the company introduced to its users earlier this year. The idea of cryptocurrency staking is similar to traditional savings accounts: Users earn passive income by holding their tokens on the exchange.      Staking may have started out as a way to encourage customers to use the tokens more frequently in trading, but for passive holders, the yield looks like a dividend on a stock.      Bigger players in the space, including Binance and Huobi, have also pushed out staking products for their users.      The rationale behind this behavior, according to Jack Purdy, senior research analyst at Messari, could be that exchanges now view token holders as an important component to their long-term business success.      In an interview with CoinDesk previously, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, chief executive officer of Binance, said that he expects decentralization will cannibalize his centralized exchange. Binance is pursuing a long-term goal of decentralization which can be a more cost-effective way for exchanges to run their platforms.      If decentralization wins out as the dominant business model for trading venues in digital currency markets, Zhao said, Binance could still profit from its holdings of the BNB tokens.      The much smaller Hxro is also planning to go fully decentralized, according to Gunsberg, and governance features will be added to its token soon. That means token holders will have influence in deciding how the protocol will develop in the future.      Often, a large portion of exchange tokens are distributed to founders, seed investors and project advisors. Binance is the biggest holder of the BNB token. Likewise, Hxro tokens for seed investors and advisors are locked in the company’s treasury wallet until June 2021, after which it will be released in eight quarterly distributions, according to the project’s profile page on Messari. Founders’ tokens are locked in the Hxro treasury wallet until June 2023.    A threat of future regulation?    Regulatory uncertainty remains a threat.      “Regulatory concerns are definitely a problem because they definitely look like securities under U.S. laws in which case they have a whole host of regulations to deal with from the SEC,” Purdy said.      Exchanges are already feeling some heat with a recent crackdown on crypto derivatives trading around the world. In early October, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal prosecutors charged derivatives exchange giant BitMEX with facilitating unregistered trading and other violations, while in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned the derivatives trading for retail traders.      OKEx, the second-largest crypto derivatives exchange, has suspended withdrawals indefinitely last month, after it said that one of the exchange’s key holders has “been out of touch” with the exchange because they are “currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.” The exchange’s native token OKB lost nearly 30% of its market value on the day after the news broke.      There’s some speculation that exchange tokens are booming based on the assumption that decentralization will eventually become the dominant business model in cryptocurrency trading, and that the centralized exchanges might emerge as winners. But anytime during that process, it’s possible that exchanges could pull out their tokens, according to Purdy.      Equity gives investors legal rights to part of a company. That’s not the case with exchange tokens because those exchanges don’t have to cede some of their ownership.      “[Exchange tokens] are a gray area with equity-like characteristics,” Purdy said. “But they are not perfectly equatable.”",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | FTT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/11/exchange-tokens-are-skyrocketing-as-they-act-more-like-equity-that-could-be-a-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f19432ccc02e02a823f5b5fb50c75918ed666557-1300x841.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433091,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO39Fh,1605090096,Ethereum Service Providers Scramble to Update Software After 'Unannounced Hard Fork',"The Ethereum blockchain network suffered issues Wednesday morning, with knock-on effects at related service providers.      In a service announcement soon after 08:00 UTC, Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura said it is experiencing a service outage for its Ethereum mainnet API and it was investigating the issue.      Infura provides API access to the Ethereum network for other applications and services. The outage has prompted some Infura users to halt Ethereum-based services over the issue, including Metamask and Binance.      The problems at Infura look to stem from a problem with Ethereum client Go Ethereum, or Geth.      Binance and Blockchair tweeted soon before press time tthere had possibly been a split in the Ethereum blockchain. However, Blockchair said it had fixed the issue by upgrading Geth.      See also: Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Tops $22.5M One Week After Launch      ""At some point Ethereum developers introduced a change in the code that led today to a chain split starting from block 11234873 (07:08 UTC),"" said Nikita Zhavoronkov, lead developer at Blockchair, on Twitter.      Calling it ""technically an unannounced hard fork,"" Zhavoronkov added that third-party services need to upgrade to fix the issue.      Talking to CoinDesk, he said the changes may have been made some time ago but caused the split today. ""Those who haven’t been upgrading their Geth nodes for a while (I presume several months at least) got split with those with new Geth versions,"" Zhavoronkov said, adding Infura's outage likely arose from the same issue.      The price of Ethereum's ether cryptocurrency is unaffected at press time, according to CoinDesk data.      UPDATES:      10:28 UTC – Binance says it has reinstated services for Ethereum-based tokens.      10:37 UTC – Infura says its team has ""identified the root cause and are preparing a fix to restore service functionality.""      10:41 UTC – Added clarifying information from Nikita Zhavoronkov.      11:31 UTC – Infura says it is still implementing a fix, explaining, ""The root cause was traced to several components within our infrastructure which were locked to an older stable version of the go-ethereum client which encountered a critical consensus bug at block 11234873.""      13:21 UTC – Infura says it is ""continuing with service recovery efforts"" and most services are returning to normal.",NEGATIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | FORKS,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/11/ethereum-service-providers-scramble-to-update-software-after-unannounced-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5d0bc9a9065f3e6a69633bcbcaf294dc5ade2de-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a Wednesday report by the South China Morning Post, tokenized bond certificates will be issued through the state-owned bank's Labuan, Malaysia, branch over a period of three months.      Notably, the digital securities will be exchangeable for bitcoin on the Fusang exchange, as well as U.S. dollars. Trading is slated to commence this Friday.      If successful, Fusang intends to work with the ""Big Four"" Chinese bank on the issuance of certificates in other currencies, including the yuan, said Fusang CEO Henry Chong in the report.      See also: Beijing Municipal Government Conference Notes Plans to Pilot CBDC in China’s Capital      With the blockchain issuance, CCB – the second-largest bank globally by market capitalization – aims to reduce the costs traditionally associated with financial intermediaries. It will also offer the debt instruments at lower amounts to make them accessible to retail investors.      Bonds are tradable debt securities issued by a government or company to support spending obligations. Chinese bonds usually trade for tens of thousands of yuan (over $4,000) meaning they are mainly accessible to institutional and professional investors.      The bank aims to reduce that barrier to entry by making certificates available for a minimum of $100.

42433079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO38th,1605058200,Cyberattackers Demand $11M in Bitcoin From Japanese Gaming Giant Capcom,"Japanese Gaming Giant Capcom, creator of popular games including Resident Evil and Street Fighter, fell victim to a ransomware hit in early November, with attackers allegedly demanding $11 million in bitcoin in exchange for not leaking illegally obtained confidential information to the public, CoinDesk Japan reported Tuesday.      In a Nov. 4 press release, Capcom said the group’s networks had come under attack in the early morning hours of Nov. 2. The attacks affected “certain systems” including email and file servers, and there was no indication any customer information was breached, the announcement said. The company is currently consulting with local law enforcement on the investigation into the attack.      Cybercriminals demanding bitcoin continues to be a problem in 2020, as high-profile Twitter accounts and the New Zealand stock exchange came under siege in similar attacks earlier this year.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Ransomware Problem Won’t Go Away      In October, Japan’s government and schools came under attack from extortionists demanding bitcoin, threatening acts of violence. Similar reports had surfaced in Austria.      On Tuesday, Nikkei Japan reported a group calling itself ""RAGNAR LOCKER"" had succeeded on Nov. 9 in downloading 1 terabyte of sensitive data from Capcom, including personal information of employees and customers. In return for not leaking the information, the attackers reportedly ordered the company to contact the organization by 8:00 a.m. Japan time by Nov 11.      Japanese media organization Asahi Shimbun also reported on Nov. 9 that some of Capcom's internal servers and computers were infected with ransomware, and certain company operations were temporarily suspended. When a network is infected with ransomware, user access is restricted. Ransomware creators then demand ransoms from affected companies and others to lift the restrictions.      Asahi's TV news program ""Hodo Station"" said on Nov. 10 that cybercriminals may be demanding Capcom pay a ransom of 1.1 billion yen ($11 million) in bitcoin, CoinDesk Japan reported.      On Wednesday, The Japan Times and Nikkei Japan reported that the hacker group has released some of the illegally obtained information after Capcom failed to meet the 8:00 a.m. deadline. According to Japan Times, some content is viewable and contains images of passports.      Capcom refrained from commenting on details, but did say that it has not confirmed that any customer information leaks so far.
