42404129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOJQ,1583447406,Ethereum’s ProgPoW Debate Is About Much More Than Mining,"What do we talk about when we talk about programmatic proof-of-work (ProgPoW) on Ethereum?      On the surface, ProgPoW is a proposed update to the mining algorithm of the world’s second-largest blockchain by market cap that would theoretically favor less well-resourced miners.      At its core, though, ProgPoW has become a flashpoint for how Ethereum makes big decisions. The developers have effectively become the legislative body of the decentralized nation-state that is Ethereum. And if they make a decision that makes enough miners angry, it could split the chain (again).      The ProgPoW debate reignited on Friday, Feb. 21 in the Ethereum Core Developers call when Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1057 – the code change involving ProgPoW – moved forward, surprising many in the greater Ethereum world, such that Vitalik Buterin himself called it ""ninja re-approved.""      ProgPoW could drive a split on Ethereum if it goes forward, potentially similar to what happened after the DAO hack in 2016, which led to the creation of ethereum classic (ETC). But ethereum (and its native currency, ETH) is worth vastly more now than it was then. Much more is at stake.      The next big decision regarding ProgPoW will be made at the Ethereum Core Developers meeting on Friday at 14:00 UTC (those interested can watch it live on YouTube; we’ll be there). If the developers who preside over the blockchain decide to move ProgPoW forward, it won't happen for weeks, however.      The current plan is to allocate a whole hour to ProgPoW, according to the final agenda for tomorrow's call, with spokespeople from both sides making their case.    ProgPoW revisited    The Ethereum ecosystem has been talking about ProgPoW for a long time. In January 2019 it looked close to happening and then fell apart. Least Authority, a cloud storage company founded by Zcash's Zooko Wilcox that has a sideline in security audits, was one of the auditors that found ProgPoW did what it billed itself as doing.      Nevertheless, the proposal didn't move.      Which brings us back to the core question: How does Ethereum make big decisions?      Theoretically, Ethereum governance comes down to the miners. The people running mining rigs can run whatever code they want and when enough miners are on a given fork of Ethereum code, that's the official code.      But here’s the catch: The code comes from the core developers, but the core developers have no power to force that code on miners. On the other hand, the miners are unlikely to ever be coordinated well enough to tell the developers what to do. So developers have all the writing power and miners have all the execution power.      Except, there are many barely relevant blockchains out there that are mined and don't have much value. It takes more than mining to give a chain value. It takes adoption. So in that way, people – businesses and individuals using Ethereum to track intellectual property rights, raise funds in a distributed way and make piles of asset-backed loans – have the final say.      Case in point: Ethereum Classic is the original chain of Ethereum and yet Ethereum dwarfs it in real value. That’s because the community voted with its feet and made Ethereum the “legitimate” chain after the two split in summer 2016.      So it isn't really the miners who have final say, because they are only going to keep working on the chain that has value. And the people give it value. (Well, sort of the people. More on that below.)      So who is really in charge of Ethereum? It's tough to say! Decision-making is quite distributed, and the question is whether or not that distribution has yielded stability or stasis.      ""I think this is more kind of a referendum on the Ethereum governance process,"" Spencer Noon, an investor at DTC Capital and a ProgPoW opponent, told CoinDesk. ""Frankly, contentious issues like this, contentious anything, this is how you harden your governance. If it didn't happen with ProgPoW this would have come up with some other issue.""    How EIPs work    Ethereum developers have a process for deciding what to add to the blockchain’s official codebase (for mining and other things as well). It’s called the ""EIP process.""      Basically, the core developers decide by consensus whether or not to go forward with major and minor changes and then it becomes real when the miners implement it.      Hudson Jameson, who serves as an interface between the core devs and all of Ethereum's many fans wrote on Reddit recently, ""We rely on the core developers to be altruistic and listen to the community. I consider my role as a developer-community liaison who helps the protocol devs know what the community is thinking.""      Developers never really meant to get in the middle of the philosophical questions, and yet that's where they are. The EIP process as written on the Ethereum Foundation website actually addresses this:      ""The EIPs process and AllCoreDevs call were not designed to address contentious non-technical issues, but, due to the lack of other ways to address these, often end up entangled in them.”      Eric Conner of Gnosis wrote an evaluation of the decision-making process and suggested there should be an official way of discussing these matters.      To that end, Jameson told CoinDesk key stakeholders are working on an updated EIP process that will incorporate more kinds of input, which may enable more people to get heard.    What is a fork and how does it happen?    A fork happens when there's no consensus between miners about which chain to mine on a blockchain. Little forks happen all the time when two miners think they've both found a block, but pretty soon the network will coalesce around the work of one miner and the miner working on the other block will have just wasted some time.      Too bad for the losing miner but also no big deal. That miner will quit and join everyone else. The world will not notice, because they will stop mining that forked chain. When miners don't coalesce around one chain, though, that becomes a contentious fork.      Code updates can engender such forks.      When a new set of code gets released, if some miners upgrade to it and some refuse to, the group that refuses will create a new copy of the chain. Now every wallet has become two wallets. Your private key will work in two places!      Crypto has been through this tumult a bunch of times now, so all the big players know the drill. But still, it engenders unexpected work, vitriol, confused oracles (see DeFi below) and general market chaos.    Is there any significant precedent for a minority of miners bringing users with them?    Yes.      Bitcoin had this brutal debate about ""block size"" which culminated in 2017. No need to go into it here, but it resulted in a fork that led to the creation of bitcoin cash (BCH). Not wanting to see two currencies, Coinbase, for example, did not acknowledge the bitcoin cash fork for several months.      But other exchanges did acknowledge bitcoin cash, and while it never became ""bitcoin"" it did end up proving to have more value than many expected it would have, which left Coinbase users feeling as though they had been penalized for using Coinbase.      So Coinbase eventually relented and listed BCH, which meant BTC users on the app got a nice airdrop by the time it showed up. So in that way, exchanges legitimize chain splits. So now you've got two chains! What does that matter? More on that below.      Either way, there's discussion underway in terms of how to better reflect the various stakeholders' views in a given debate, especially a contentious one.      Any choice that's made about the ""officialness"" of given discussion could limit voices, however, because some channels may not be active or might even be blocked in some parts of the world. What language is used to have official Ethereum conversation? What time are the discussions? These are all important questions for global software and decentralized governance.      And, of course, increasing complexity is also going to implicitly advantage one constituency: the status quo. The more people get involved with overseeing any process the easier it becomes to just leave everything as it is.    What is the point of the ProgPoW upgrade?    Preventing centralization.      Under Ethereum’s current Ethash algorithm, application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs) are very powerful, meaning they mine ETH at a lower price than graphics processing units (GPUs).      Ethereum-specialized ASICs, which have been around since 2018, are very expensive. Deep-pocketed organizations are the ones most likely to run them, threatening a concentration of hash power that could lead to questions about the trustworthiness of the chain.      Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a developer who specializes in software for hardware, is one of three developers who put together the ProgPoW code, and the only one not working pseudonymously. She spoke to CoinDesk and said there are several hacks against Ethash, several of which are also described in Least Authority's audit.      Minehan is quick to point out the term ""ASIC"" isn't super helpful, because in a way every computing device is an ASIC of one kind or another. Minehan contends that software should be designed for the hardware you want to favor, not against hardware you don't like.      ProgPoW is designed to use all the capabilities of GPUs, which are machines that can do several things (rather than Ethereum-specific ASICs, which can only mine ETH).      Basically, Minehan wrote early in the debate, Ethereum can be more decentralized if it favors GPUs because GPU owners have options.      Here's the reasoning: When there are many devices in the world that can do many different things (such as GPUs), that situation better decentralizes Ethereum because those machines can switch back and forth to contributing to the security of the network. They will contribute when their owners deem that it makes sense for them to do so. But they can also do other things with those devices. This is key.      When the network starts to be dominated by big rigs that can only do one thing, there won't be this network that can switch in and out of working for Ethereum when and if it makes sense.      The concern is that one day there could be enough Ethereum ASICs out there that people stop mining with GPUs, which would probably mean Ethereum would have a higher hash rate but fewer players, and it's the number of players that increases the security from the whims of centralization, not the hash rate.    But aren't ASICs inevitable?    Probably. Maybe?      Minehan argues that the key difference here is that prior algorithms have not been designed with GPU hardware in mind, as mentioned above. ASICs gain efficiency by stripping things out.    Is the ProgPoW update related to Eth 2.0?    No. Definitely not.      The heart and soul of the next generation of Ethereum is proof-of-stake (PoS) and ProgPoW is all about PoW.      But when PoS kicks in, a PoW chain will still run as a shard, for at least a couple more years. Judging by the way everything else goes on Ethereum (especially as the chain becomes more valuable) a few more years could become ""many more years.""      The first objection most opponents make to ProgPoW is that the imminence of Eth 2.0 mitigates the need. ""That was the same excuse used in March 2018,"" Minehan told CoinDesk. ""We cannot tie Eth 1.0 features to Eth 2.0 features. These are separate teams.""      Miners will continue to earn fresh ETH on the PoW chain as long as that shard runs, but then again, they won't be as powerful. So maybe centralization wouldn't matter as much?      Unless it would. Don't you envy the core devs?    But will Eth 2.0 ever actually happen?    Probably. Last summer it was expected to go live this quarter, then it became July 2020 but who can say?      Stakeholders get very touchy about this question when asked. Nothing ever comes out on time, after all, and that’s usually OK.      ""Here's where I think the real debate is, it's not miners versus dapps. It's really Eth 1.0 versus Eth 2.0,"" Minehan said.    Why not just give GPU miners what they want in the meantime? What's the fear?    Breaking DeFi.      Decentralized finance is big. As we've previously reported, there's roughly $1 billion in crypto assets locked up in various DeFi projects. When there's a contentious fork, it creates two of everything, bringing us back to the two-chain question. Just as every ETH becomes two ETH on two chains, a hard fork would copy every smart contract (and the balances in them!) at the block where the fork happened. So, as an example, every loan on Compound would become two loans on two different chains.      Two chains might really screw with oracles, the eyeballs on the network that help DeFi software know what to do. Oracle shenanigans were a problem very recently.      The real issue, though, is for something like USDC, which promises one real dollar for each USDC ERC-20 token. What does it do when there are two chains with two copies of all those tokens?      That said, Dragonfly Capital's Haseeb Qureshi wrote a post with crypto veteran Leland Lee arguing that Ethereum is now unforkable. The piece argues that big players in DeFi, especially MakerDAO, will have the power to pick the chain that has value after a fork.      In other words, there will never really be a fork because companies like MakerDAO and Circle (which runs CENTRE with Coinbase, and CENTRE runs USDC) will always be able to say this is the real chain and that one isn't. In fact, MakerDAO can hit its emergency eject button on the unwanted chain’s copied smart contracts and force everything to liquidate. We’ll call this the distributed-ledger equivalent of taking your smart-contract ball and going home to the preferred chain.      ""If you imagine the movie version of this saga, the minority chain looks like an abandoned metropolis,"" Qureshi and Lee wrote.    If one chain lives and the other pretty much dies, what's the harm?    CoinDesk has to be honest here: That's not super clear.      After all, if DeFi rallies to one chain and not the other, it's less likely that a company like Coinbase (to return to our example from bitcoin cash's split from bitcoin) would actually need to deal with the second chain.      So there could be a contentious fork, but then it's possible that so few adherents would remain on the lesser fork that even they would abandon it.      For what it's worth, Ethereum Classic has already considered ProgPoW and decided not to pursue it.    Who wants ProgPoW anyway?    This seems to be the split: The mining hash power on Ethereum voted overwhelmingly for ProgPoW but they aren't talking about it publicly much, other than these guys. Recently there have also been some proponents on GitHub, too.      The entrepreneurs, who are vocal, do not want ProgPoW, because they fear the consequences of a contentious split. The EthHub podcast did a great job representing this view.      Our own podcast, The Breakdown, also did a great analysis of the online conversation last week, concluding that Ethereum has entered a conservative era.    OK, but which side is Vitalik on?    For all intents and purposes, ethereum’s creator seems to be against it (though he hasn’t said definitively). He did, however, scold core developers for bringing the issue back, because the sudden return, he tweeted, ""did *not* help make people trust the governance or feel safe.”      The dispute seems to have taken the core developers somewhat by surprise.      Ethereum’s hard fork coordinator, James Hancock, said on the Feb. 21 dev call, ""I have not seen any evidence that there is an ideological [rift] or people willing to step up to actually have a network split and if I'm wrong about that I'll resign as hard fork coordinator.”      Despite all the controversy, Hancock could still be right. None of the vocal opponents of ProgPoW are miners, and it takes miners to split the chain.      Nevertheless, as of this writing, online sentiment seems to lean toward a Biden nomination... I mean ProgPoW stalling again. So Hancock was right but not in the way he meant.      To wade even deeper into this topic, Jameson wrote a more detailed explainer focused on game-theoretical and technical elements. For his part, Jameson comes down against ProgPoW in the end.    In sum    To recap: If developers are Ethereum's reluctant legislators, then miners are its distributed, decentralized executive branch.      Unlike in a real nation-state, Ethereum's executive arm can split itself and make a new chunk of land with copies of all the houses (wallets) and cities (smart contracts) that make this country great. They can do that at any time.      The denizens of Ethereum can choose to simultaneously live on both virtual landmasses, too, but there's a decent chance that the leaders of the cities (entrepreneurs) are powerful enough in the DeFi era that they can persuade citizens to only live on one.      It's fair to say, though, that most of these entrepreneurs would rather just not have to deal with it. CoinDesk will be on the call Friday and will report back as soon as it’s over.

42404127,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOHS,1583443800,South Korean Lawmakers Greenlight Strict Crypto AML Bill,"South Korean lawmakers voted Thursday to place tough new requirements on cryptocurrency exchanges, adding legitimacy to the country’s sprawling crypto economy – and potentially triggering a market consolidation down the road.      As reported by CoinDesk Korea, the legislation – an amendment to Korea’s existing Financial Information Act – shores up South Korea’s anti-money-laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs).      The act requires all VASPs to register with regulators and partner with a single bank for deposits and withdrawals. This linkage of virtual wallets and real-world bank accounts – both of which must be registered to a user’s actual name – will make it easy for regulators to track the movement of illicit funds.      Additionally, VASPs must get their systems certified by the Korean Internet Security Agency, a costly and often lengthy process that only six companies and exchanges have so far cleared.      That could squeeze out Korea’s smaller players who cannot afford to take on the regulatory burden, CoinDesk Korea reports. Exchanges may attempt to consolidate, raising funds and banding together to meet the new requirements.      But it could also be a death knell for gray-area projects trying to take advantage of investors, particularly initial coin offerings (ICO), which must follow the registration requirements under the new law.      “If this passes in Korea, blockchain companies and cryptocurrency will officially be regulated but accepted in Korea. Bad news for scammy ICOs and exchanges. Good news for blockchain professionals in Korea,” tweeted Doo Wan Nam, who works with MakerDAO.      The legislation is the latest example of a country working to comply with new global AML and CFT directives in the virtual asset space.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 4 percent in the past 24 hours, with a high reaching $9,150 on exchanges including Coinbase.

The extension will give users access to .crypto domain names directly from the Chrome browser, currently the most-used web browser. Developed by Unstoppable Domains, .crypto domains are smart contracts on the Ethereum network, meaning to take down a site an attacker would have to take down the overall network.      The new tool closely follows Unstoppable Domains’ eponymous browser launch, unveiled at the ETHDenver conference in late February.      But the two-year-old ethereum-based startup – backed by $4 million in Tim Draper seed funding and driven by its founders’ goal to get ahead of global censorship – always aimed higher than being a browser builder, according to founder Brad Kam.      “We don't intend to be a browser company, nor do we want to be a browser company,” said founder Brad Kam. “We want browsers to support the decentralized web and we wanted to provide a developer tool that could help inspire that.”      Releasing a chrome browser extension will help Unstoppable Domains’ visibility and likely market penetration, too.      Kam declined to say how many times the Unstoppable browser had been downloaded since its launch a few weeks back, but it surely pales in comparison to Chrome’s global dominance; the Google release represented 58 percent of the market in March, according to W3counter.com.      A Chrome extension comes with risks. Google has been known to lash out at crypto applications, content and extensions in the past: it took the Meta Mask wallet down last year only to reinstate it, without explanation.      While Kam admits there’s no way to stop this type of censorship, he insists that he’s not concerned.      “Even if Chrome were to do that, which would be unfortunate, that would make it slightly less convenient for some users, but it would not stop the decentralized web,"" he said.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/05/unstoppable-domains-chrome-extension-lets-users-browse-ethereum-based-sites,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dd5ab145a9bd98d596ad4d2888847ab773ccd87-1425x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOMN,1583430489,Yields of 25% to 42% Lure Lenders Back to DeFi Platform bZx,"Lenders and depositors are coming back to bZx because the decentralized protocol for margin trading is offering significantly higher yields on ether deposits compared to its peers.       The total number of ether (ETH) locked in bZx increased to 24,711 on Thursday, having jumped by over 20 percent from 17,739 to 21,514 on Wednesday, according to data site DeFi Pulse.    The 41.7 percent rise in deposits seen over the two days could be attributed to higher rates. The yearly interest rate a user would earn by lending ether on the bZx-powered Fulcrum platform stood at 41.9 percent on March 3, as per Consensys’ Codefi datahttps://app.defiscore.io/platforms/bzx/eth.     ""Yes, our high yields are attracting lenders,"" bZx founder and CEO Tom Bean told CoinDesk. ""Two weeks have also passed since the attacks, so lenders have some degree of comfort in starting to use the platform again.""      Meanwhile, other platforms such as Aave and Compound were offering meagre yields of 0.06 percent and 0.01 percent, respectively. Investors, therefore, flocked to the high-yielding bZx protocol, boosting liquidity and pushing down the rate of return on lending.       The yearly interest rate has now dropped to 24.5 percent from Wednesday’s 41.9 percent, but is still offering at least 24 percentage points more than Aave and Compound. So, the number of ETH locked on bZx could continue to rise.     Why are rates so high on bZx?    The decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol was exploited in consecutive flash loan attacks in February, following which users rushed for the exits, draining liquidity and pushing rates higher.       The first attack, which took place on Valentine’s Day (Feb. 14), saw a hacker walk away with a $350,000 profit. Four days later, on Feb. 18, a hacker launched another attack on bZx and pocketed $630,000.       The total number of ethers locked in bZx dropped from roughly 27,000 to 23,000 after the first attack, while the annual interest rate spiked from 0.07 percent on Feb. 14 to 98.18 percent on Feb. 16.            With the surge in interest rates, the amount of ether held as deposits rose from 23,000 to 40,800 by Feb. 18, only to fall back to 23,000 following the second attack. The number slipped further to 17,500 at the end of February.       The annual interest rate remained in the narrow range of 40 to 42 percent in the two weeks to March 2, before falling to 25 percent on Thursday. If the deposits continue to rise, rates could soon fall back to levels seen before the Feb. 14 attack. The amount of ether in bZx is still about 20 percent lower than pre-exploit levels.     Free market mechanics    The DeFi space is truly decentralized where interest rates are determined by forces of demand and supply and not by a centralized authority like the U.S. Federal Reserve.       In such an environment, interest rates are purely the price for loanable funds, determined by the interaction between the supply of funds available for lending and the demand for those funds borrowed.       In bZx’s case, the annual interest rate surged as investors withdrew ether deposits, causing supply shortage. However, rates subsequently dropped with the rise in deposits and liquidity on the platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/05/yields-of-25-to-42-lure-lenders-back-to-defi-platform-bzx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07789dafdb192832d563ef24ab91727f4486c3ad-1200x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404111,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhO3g,1583424830,How the Bitcoin Market Changed Since 2017’s Bull Run,"Although the bitcoin market's recent volatility may feel familiar to industry veterans, the circumstances are very different in 2020 than they were when bitcoin (BTC) surged to nearly $20,000 in late 2017.      Namely, there’s now Wall Street infrastructure for sophisticated bitcoin trading and holding, from Fidelity Investments to Bakkt. For another example, the brokerage startup Tagomi, co-founded in 2018 by Union Square Ventures alum Jennifer Campbell and backed by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, also offers institutional investors the options for trading between platforms without moving the price. Until recently, limited price spreads restricted market activity.      “During the last bull run there were a lot of trading desks with a pretty website, but behind the scenes there was a lot of sausage making,” Campbell said, describing how some funds literally just operated with one person’s personal exchange account.      These days, over in San Francisco, deliberately conservative exchanges like the bitcoin-focused startup River Financial have attracted talent such as Union Bank of Switzerland alum Zev Mintz. Mintz said the combination of a robust lending market with margin trading will be a “huge driver” of liquidity in 2020, as well as the growing “payments system” use case.      Indeed, merchant adoption remains modest yet consistent, according to Coinbase. Meanwhile, OKEx Financial Markets Director Lennix Lai said derivatives now make up nearly 66 percent of the platform’s daily global volume, more than $3 billion in derivatives alone.      Yet, it’s not the sheer number of trading platforms that differentiates this prospective bull run. Incumbents like BitMEX and Binance continue to churn volumes that dwarf those of OKEx.      “We were getting questions all the time about what can we do, can we buy bitcoin?” Mintz said of his former clients at UBS. “A lot of what I’m going to be doing in the next year [at River Financial] is building on some of these [dollar-cost-averaging] tools, giving users more insights and analytics into how their holdings are working and being as transparent as possible.”      These days, Campbell says, it’s easier to give more accurate price information from a variety of exchange platforms, in addition to “better ways for people to margin for shorts and lends.”      “The over-the-counter market has changed a lot. … It was really a couple of guys pressing ‘buy’ behind the scenes,” she said, comparing 2017 to 2020. “It’s moved from a dealer-driven market to one where people know how to execute trades through a prime broker, using algorithms or other strategies.”      It’s the presence of both Wild West options and regulator-friendly alternatives that differentiates 2020.    Whale szn    It’s cheaper now than it’s ever been to move large bitcoin trades in and out of a market.      By spreading trades across exchanges, institutional buyers avoid tipping the scales against their trades on platforms with limited spreads.      “A lot of the trading strategies that were too expensive before are now possible,” said Tagomi’s Campbell. “A lot of the strategies before were just arbitraging between exchanges, but that very quickly got subpoenaed away.”      She declined to comment on the startup’s work with more than 40 hedge funds, family offices and other institutional clients. Yet, Tagomi’s warm relations with companies like Facebook and Bakkt suggest the long-prophesied arrival of institutional investors, which bitcoin advocates claimed in previous years would boost bitcoin prices “to the moon,” may have already started as a whisper, not a bang.      For example, Lai estimated that 1 percent of OKEx’s clients in 2020 are the institutional traders that drive nearly 70 percent of the platform’s volumes.      The 2017 bitcoin market was retail driven. The cryptocurrency market, in general, may still be predominantly retail but bitcoin is much less so than before. OKEx’s Lai explained the appeal of bitcoin derivatives, trusting a company for traditional guarantees, attracts buyers who aren’t yet comfortable with independent custody of bitcoin itself. This can be especially true in emerging markets like India, where the Supreme Court recently ruled banks can work with crypto businesses and the demand for derivatives is surging.      “Because the volatility of bitcoin is particularly higher than a regular asset class,” Lai said. “Traders feel more safe that way, they deposit a lot more money.”      If bitcoin doesn’t become a mass-market product, then investor interest may eventually simmer down. (For his part, River Financial’s Mintz envisions bitcoin for “everyday payments” thanks to the Lightning Network.)      Still, it looks as though institutions around the world now routinely trade millions of dollars worth of bitcoin every day. That’s no longer a rare “whale call,” it’s the status quo.      “Those are the two components that are really important,” Mintz said, regarding how institutional interest and retail usage must coincide to drive demand beyond speculative trading. Institutions can now choose whether to trade bitcoin itself or representative options, both at scale.      “When you’re shorting on our platform, you’re actually borrowing bitcoin from someone else,” Tagomi’s Campbell added. “There’s physical bitcoin being exchanged. The same thing with margins … it’s all backed by physical assets, which is very different than trading futures [in 2017].”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/05/how-the-bitcoin-market-changed-since-2017s-bull-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95ca9ecc0c58fadeac6762578ebc722d4e22f1e6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOFU,1583418676,"With Freedom at Stake, More Hongkongers See Bitcoin's Unique Value","Leo Weese is president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong.      From June to November 2019, Hong Kong saw its worst civil unrest in 50 years. What began with peaceful marches with up to two million participants (about one-fourth of the territory’s population) escalated into more and more violent clashes involving protesters, police and triads. More than 2,500 people have been injured so far, and at least 7,000 arrested. Vandalism targeting Chinese banks, government buildings, the subway system and stores appeared to be connected to criminal organizations and the Chinese government.      Hong Kong is a key financial center in Asia. Its access to the international banking system, the liquid stock market and large concentration of wealth has made it significant not only for the People’s Republic of China, but also the international Bitcoin community.      Multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, token funds, advisory firms and crypto events have made Hong Kong their home and profit from the city’s easy taxation regime and lack of capital controls. There are at least 50 ATMs around the city where people can exchange their cash for bitcoin, ether or tether without sign-up or identification.      Before the protests, explaining the value proposition of bitcoin (BTC) had been difficult. People privileged convenience over abstract ideas like ""censorship resistance,"" and anonymity was seen as something only criminals desired. As the protest movement grew, what makes bitcoin unique and valuable became more and more obvious.    As the protest movement grew, what makes bitcoin unique and valuable became more and more obvious.    The mass protests of 2014 ended with mass arrests. Leading figures were jailed, and those who served their time continue to be harassed by authorities. In 2019 few were willing to step up as organizers and figures. The movement learned quickly to coordinate without central leadership. The goals are formed by consensus, the strategies are created spontaneously. Messages are spread on message boards and group chats. The Hong Kong protest movement was the first decentralized civil movement, and its tactics have been replicated from Beirut to Santiago.      As authorities began withholding or even withdrawing their approval for scheduled protest marches, locals suddenly risked long jail sentences for “unauthorized assembly” or even “rioting” (10 years), while others feared for their jobs. Those showing support for the movement were sometimes fired and violently attacked. People began to wear masks to disguise their faces.      In fear of being recorded digitally for having travelled to and from a protest location, protesters began abandoning their electronic stored value tickets, the Octopus card, in favor of cash. They even left change by subway ticketing machines so other passengers could safeguard their privacy. This was a good idea, as police used electronic payment records to determine who had participated in a protest.      Those holding bank accounts weren’t spared trouble. In December, police raided an organization that had crowdfunded money to defend arrested protesters, seizing $9 million and arresting four individuals for money laundering. HSBC, with which the Spark Alliance group had been banking, found itself in the highly controversial position of complying with laws and being targeted with vandalism. Its corporate symbols, “Stephen” and “Stitt,” had to be jailed in a wooden cage following an arson attack.      The most prominent Hong Kong groups that were using bitcoin at the height of the protests include HK Map Live. The tool, which had its iOS app banned from the App Store, was used to learn about street barricades, locations of police lines and special equipment like water cannons and armored vehicles. The data is crowdsourced and appreciated both by those seeking to support and avoid the protests, but the heavy traffic load was a big financial burden for the group. To cover these costs while preserving anonymity, the organizers mainly use bitcoin, gift cards, affiliate commissions for Amazon and donations made through Brave, the privacy-enhancing browser.      Hong Kong Free Press, after a difficult attempt to move funds out of Bitpay, shifted to the open-source payment processor BTCPay and raised almost 2 BTC in just a few weeks. Funds not immediately needed to keep one of the last remaining free media organizations running are not converted to fiat to avoid a similar fate of Spark Alliance.      A Telegram channel for protesters, whose name roughly translates to “Hong Kong School of Magic,” also raised funds with bitcoin while educating their 30,000 followers on how to buy masks on Amazon with bitcoin or buying and selling bitcoin in Hong Kong.      Capital flight out of Hong Kong was widely anticipated during this crisis, especially since the controversial extradition bill at the center of it would have also allowed for assets to be more easily reprimanded to mainland China, but there is no evidence bitcoin played a role here. In a system without capital controls, a bank wire remains the easiest mechanism to send funds abroad. While some, including prominent speculator Kyle Bass, expected the peg to the U.S. dollar to be broken, the exchange rate remained stable.      Cash remains the most useful tool for Hong Kong protesters to retain anonymity, as most transactions happen in the physical world and cash remains widely accepted. Most problems faced by protesters are not of financial nature either way. More pressing are the availability of legal support, anonymity of online messaging platforms, how to avoid arrests at assemblies or abuse at home.      In 2019 Hong Kong, with its usually highly reliable civil service, trusted judiciary and respected financial system, abandoned faith in its institutions on a scale unprecedented for a modern rich society. The ripple effects will be felt by businesses and individuals for years to come, and a lot of the trust the territory relied on will be hard to rebuild. Cryptocurrencies play only a small role in this for now, but those who have been able to make them work for them are doing well.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Leo Weese,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/05/with-freedom-at-stake-more-hongkongers-see-bitcoins-unique-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4a4cde7150a5377aa1879edde2d8c48cf44fcac-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhO8b,1583416800,The Team Behind CryptoKitties Is One Step Closer to Leaving Ethereum,"One of Ethereum’s early stars is pinning its future hopes to a blockchain of its own making.      Dapper Labs, the startup that raised roughly $39 million from venture capitalists after its brief success with the CryptoKitties collectibles game in late 2017, launched a simulator Thursday for its upcoming Flow blockchain.      The move positions Dapper Labs among a number of startups looking to build protocols that will unseat Ethereum as the blockchain of choice for a variety of applications.      “We built this blockchain because we wanted a different blockchain to build our games on top of,” said Dapper Labs co-founder Dieter Shirley.      The Flow Playground, as the Dapper Labs simulator is called, aims to attract app developers.      “When you have a new programming domain it makes sense to have a new programming paradigm,” Shirley said of the startup’s new programming language, Cadence.      From his perspective, scaling limitations weren’t the only reason Dapper Labs switched over from using Solidity, Ethereum’s native language. Shirley said Ethereum’s forthcoming sharding approach in Eth 2.0 would “really limit what you can do with smart contracts” and his team wanted to use a more “consumer-oriented” platform that can handle gaming volume without clogging the network, as CryptoKitties once did to the ethereum blockchain.      Dapper Labs failed to garner sustainable traction with Ethereum-based games following its breakout hit. This week CryptoKitties attracted fewer than 200 users, according to DappRadar, down from the 2017 peak of 14,914 daily active users. Recent partnerships with sports leagues like the UFC and the NBA suggest mainstream aspirations for the firm, which helped popularize ethereum's ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard.      With nearly 100 employees eager for their next big hit, Shirley said the Dapper Labs team is planning a token sale later this year for accredited investors, the details of which are still unclear.      “Blockchains have their own revenue stream as a part of them, from selling tokens,” Shirley said, adding that tokens won’t be sold to the public until it is legally “prudent” to do so. “We do think the financial support for building a blockchain should be separate from funding from the games. The games need to make sense on their own.”      The startup is tapping partners in academia to help roadtest the new blockchain in the early going.      “If Ethereum is blockchain 2.0, then we view Flow as version 4.0. We view Flow as the blockchain technology for the mass market,” Purdue University researcher David Broecker said in explaining why his team will eventually run a Flow node. “Being able to broaden opportunities for faculty and students is incredibly exciting.”      But inventing a new programming language and a new blockchain structure to boot, as Dapper Labs is doing, is notoriously fraught.      Regardless of how many companies are now creating their own languages associated with token sales, such feats are usually problematic, said independent software developer Yuval Kogman. He pointed to the example of JavaScript, which decades later is still so flawed that it’s become a running joke among developers.      “Designing languages is almost impossibly complex,” Kogman said. “I can't think of a single programmable or scriptable system where this actually went well unless the language itself was a central focus, designed with clear principles and requirements in mind.”      That’s why some Ethereum competitors are taking so long to lay the groundwork, and eagerly vying for limited developer mindshare with simulators and contests in the meantime.    Flippening?    Dapper Labs is hardly alone in this approach. Numerous startups are gunning for Ethereum’s throne.      For example, Chia CEO Bram Cohen is also inventing a language for the upcoming, venture-backed Chia Network. Cohen said he might “completely unseat Ethereum” with Chia, which will eventually allow token issuance and smart contracts just like both the above-mentioned blockchain projects. (While Flow doesn't have a prospective mainnet launch date yet, the Chia Network is scheduled for launch sometime before 2021.)      Cohen said the Chia ecosystem won’t be based on Eth 2.0’s upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) model, which he sees as fundamentally centralized. Shirley, on the other hand, is opting to follow that part of Ethereum’s strategy, letting stakeholders lock up funds to fuel the network. On the other hand, Shirley balked at the idea of using Ethereum-inspired projects like Tron, which is already popular with game developers, because Shirley said Tron is too centralized for his goals. Each founder views centralization risks through their own lens.      Likewise, Larry Pang, head of business development at the token-sale-funded startup IoTeX, said he expects to see more companies like Dapper Labs move away from ethereum once grants, events and other sponsored perks run out. (Dapper Labs didn’t receive any such grants, but Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin was formerly an adviser to the fund that owns Dapper Labs investor Fenbushi Digital.)      Unlike Chia and Dapper Labs, IoTeX didn’t invent a unique programming language for its token, used to raise nearly $30 million in a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO).      “Our blockchain is coded in Go … it was important to not completely isolate ourselves,” Pang said. “The ability to port smart contracts from the IoT world was also important to us.”      Regardless of whether Pang, Cohen or Shirley eventually “flip” Ethereum, developer Cindy Zimmerman, who worked on AxisPoint projects for clients such as Dapper Labs investor Warner Music Group (WMG), said it may be a “smart move” for companies trying to serve enterprise clients to stop relying on Ethereum. There are many reasons, she said, including the costs of operating nodes and broader congestion on the Ethereum network. (WMG could not be reached for comment by press time.)      “Developing their own in-house blockchain solution would allow WMG to have more control of the blockchain from a multitude of directions including information and security,” Zimmerman. “The challenge they might face with their in-house blockchain solution is viability to clients as well as other actors in the space.”      Therein lies the million-token question: Is there enough demand for blockchain-related products and services to justify the multiplayer battle among business-to-business startups?      As IoTeX’s Pang pointed out, “we’re realizing you can’t change how the enterprises see [their processes] and you have to meet them where they’re at.”      For now, Dapper Labs’ Shirley said his team is focused on attracting developers and prospective stakeholders to its nascent blockchain.      “At launch, the people running nodes will probably be our investors and our partners, people we know. But the architecture design of the blockchain doesn’t depend on a small number of known participants for security. It can scale to thousands of participants that are anonymous,” Shirley said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FLOW | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/05/the-team-behind-cryptokitties-is-one-step-closer-to-leaving-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/818ef69277f8ac51363cd30209d86adde8ba59df-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404120,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhO9a,1583411650,A New York Power Plant Is Mining $50K Worth of Bitcoin a Day,"An upstate New York power plant has been using some of its own electricity to mine bitcoin on an industrial scale.      Greenidge Generation, a natural gas power plant near the town of Dresden in the Finger Lakes region, announced it had successfully installed a mining farm in its facility. Comprised of nearly 7,000 mining rigs and powered by electricity generated on-site, the facility can mine an average of 5.5 bitcoins (BTC) every day, roughly $50,000, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Greenidge uses its own ""behind the meter"" power, the generated electricity it uses itself at the basic cost of production. Kevin Zhang, director of Greenidge's blockchain strategies, said in a statement the initiative would provide potential investors with unique exposure to both the cryptocurrency and energy markets.      The server farm comes as part of an extensive $65 million renovation of the power plant, which includes transforming the plant from coal to natural gas as well as investing in the electrical infrastructure needed to power the mining rigs.      Following the plant's conversion to natural gas, with both state and federal approval, in 2017, Greenidge Chief Executive Dale Irwin said the mining operation would complement the ""power plant's unique commitment to environmental stewardship.""      Because costs are already low and predictable, plant owners say they are in a ""favorable market position"" and believe they will remain profitable even after the halving event takes bitcoin's block reward down to 6.25 BTC in May.      “Due to our unique position as a co-generation facility, we are able to make money in down markets so that we’re available to catch the upside of volatile price swings,"" said Tim Rainey, Greenidge's chief financial officer, to Bloomberg.      First established in 1937, Greenidge is now owned by Connecticut-based Atlas Holdings, which helped install the mining rigs in the facility in the space of four months. The plant used to only open at peak times in the summer and winter months; the new mining initiative means it now operates all year round.      The server farm currently consumes 14 megawatts of the 106 megawatts of Greenidge's capacity. That's enough electricity to power well over 11,000 average U.S. homes.

42404130,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOKP,1583410259,Tron's Takeover of Steemit Is Internet History Repeating Itself,"Valerian Bennett is managing director of the Pop Network Foundation, which is dedicated to helping creators and communities find their freedom by decentralizing the streaming economy. He is a graduate of the BoostVC accelerator (Tribe 8) and limited partner at Amentum Capital.      On Dec. 23, 2019, as many around the world were settling into the Christmas holiday, a crypto disaster struck. Google-owned YouTube, the largest streaming media site on the web, started banning scores of content creators related to blockchain and cryptocurrency.      The outrage was swift and justified.      Many on Crypto YouTube, like Chris Dunn and IvanOnTech, have spent years developing their brands and building massive content libraries while attracting a large number of followers … all to have the result of their own labor arbitrarily taken from them. For some, like Alex Saunders, the purge had the effect of shutting down his primary business and financially threatening his family.      Even Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had some of his cryptocurrency research videos removed under the bizarre label of “Harmful or dangerous content.""      Then, just as quickly as the purge happened, it stopped. After days of unrest, YouTube announced the whole thing was a mistake and that everything would go back to normal.      Q: So, why did the ban happen in the first place?      A: No one knows, except Google and YouTube.      Q: Why don’t they tell us?      A: Because they don’t have to. It’s their platform, their rules and if you don’t like it you can leave.      Q: But the value of YouTube is built upon the videos that users submit. Surely YouTube must be accountable to its users, right?      A: Wrong.      This is the nature of centralization. When sufficient power aggregates to a central authority, that authority inevitably drifts away from representing the source of its power and ends up existing solely to preserve and expand power for itself. In the Crypto YouTube case, it means arbitrarily hurting creators and their communities without providing any recourse for grievance.    The key attraction of a decentralized economy is that it takes power and profits away from large institutions and corporations, and puts them into the rightful hands of the people.    As Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, summarized the episode, “Absolute power and centralization ALWAYS turns into this.”      So if absolute power is destined to corrupt absolutely, then how do we get from under the thumb of concentrated authority and, instead, create a system that is built for, by and accountable to its users above all else?    The 'freedom protocol'    Bitcoin provided one answer for this with its introduction of peer-to-peer electronic cash. As a measure of resistance to the unchecked power of banks and governments over the financial system we all use, Bitcoin created a decentralized system of money. In this blockchain-based system, governments and banks are not only unnecessary to move money, they are irrelevant.      This transformative power applied to a myriad of industries is one of the reasons there is so much genuine energy around blockchain.      Could blockchain technology make central authorities of social media, like YouTube, unnecessary and irrelevant while creating a system that is built for, by, and accountable to its users above all else? Yes!      We strongly believe in this future. Because we are building it.      Our mission at POP Network, a blockchain media platform, is to help creators and communities find their freedom by decentralizing the streaming economy.      Unlike YouTube, POP Network works peer-to-peer with blockchain crypto-economic incentives. Nodes share media independently rather than relying on a central server. The benefit of decentralization is that creators and their communities can no longer be “de-platformed” because, in essence, they are the platform.      As bitcoin is to money, POP Network is to media. Both feature the principle of decentralization combined with blockchain technology to create a system meant to reward the participants for the value they create while retaining self-sovereignty.      In this vision of the future, it is critical to note both networks make one big assumption: that “blockchain” and “decentralization” continue to evolve together.      But, what if an alternate future unfolds?      If bitcoin is described as open, decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant and is the prime example of blockchain and decentralization evolving together in the financial sector, then its inverse example is now coming to life. We have the first vision of what a closed, centralized, censorable state-sponsored digital currency would look like.      Say hello to the digital yuan.      Last fall the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the nation’s central bank, said the goal of its project is to replace all physical money with a new digital currency. Although the stated purpose is to give the government real-time influence on the economy, the functional result is improved state surveillance, advanced social engineering, and absolute central control.      This is Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon brought to life.      Now imagine this alternate ending applied to our YouTube censorship example.  Not only would creators have their videos removed, they would have their bank accounts closed and their savings confiscated. And, anyone that watched or shared those videos could also have their accounts closed and money seized. Object to this policy and guess what happens to you?      Given that potential outcome, would anyone watch a blockchain or cryptocurrency video again?      This type of economic censorship and social engineering is the nightmare scenario in the burgeoning decentralized streaming economy.      Unfortunately, this scenario is not so far-fetched.    The Rebirth or Death of Steem?    Tron’s recent acquisition of Steemit, a blockchain-based blogging and social media website built on top of the public Steem blockchain, once again raises the question of whether decentralized media can remain that way. Tron also bought BitTorrent, a company built on top of the open bittorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol.      Tron bills itself as “an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet.” But it seems Tron colluded with top exchanges Binance, Huobi, and Poloniex to stake custodial Steem (i.e. users’ funds) and replace elected DPoS witnesses on the Steem blockchain with their own. Effectively, they are mounting a hostile takeover of a public blockchain, making it subservient to a private corporation.      Even before this, Tron had an unspoken history of removing competitors to its native applications at the project level. POP Network has first-hand experience as it was originally developed on Tron before being excluded for competing too strongly with Tron’s native BitTorrent Token.      This iron-fisted control goes all the way down to individual content creators as Tron’s two flagship streaming products BitTorrent Live and newly acquired DLive greet visitors with an ominous warning: No Political Speech.      Formerly decentralized media projects BitTorrent, DLive and now Steemit, are controlled by corporations that have demonstrated both an ability and willingness to govern based on the same standards as old-line centralized projects. They govern in their own interests above user interests and without accountability.      Although we can’t be sure of the future, consolidation of the biggest pieces in a decentralized movement should be cause for deep contemplation.    History repeats    Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised by the promise of freedom, openness and neutrality of public blockchains being co-opted. We saw this story play out in the 1990s as the ideals of the original internet were overrun by moneyed interests.      It is clear that institutions seeking to utilize blockchain technology for their own benefit, while holding values in opposition to the intended push toward decentralization, will continue to grow in number. But will those institutions grow in value?      The key attraction of a decentralized economy is it takes power and profits away from large institutions and corporations, and puts them into the rightful hands of the people. This measure is typically reflected in the value of the native cryptocurrency of the network. If public blockchains are used just to reaggregate power and profits to private corporations or central governments, then what is their value to the users of those systems?      “Ultimately, I think the ongoing trend toward increasing centralization inevitably leads to a situation where a blockchain loses its entire raison d’etre as a permissionless platform with strong assurances and what we’re left with is a permissioned network that resembles today’s centralized networks but built on less efficient infrastructure. That doesn’t sound very interesting or exciting to me,” says Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital, of this inherent conflict.      Blockchain without decentralization doesn’t sound very interesting to me either.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BTT,Valerian Bennett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/05/trons-takeover-of-steemit-is-internet-history-repeating-itself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4332fff6e12cae47fd9256434278f7078c335663-1920x1324.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOAZ,1583409600,Web3 Foundation Funds Technical Bridge Connecting Polkadot to Bitcoin,"The Web3 Foundation, the non-profit entity behind Polkadot, has financed a new bridge to link the multi-blockchain network to bitcoin (BTC).      London-based developer house Interlay will receive funding from Web3 to build a ""BTC-Parachain"" to bring bitcoin-backed assets onto Polkadot. Using its open-source XCLAIM framework, the parachain would be an ""open and trustless system that leverages a dynamic set of collateralized intermediaries,"" the company said in a Medium post Thursday.      Launched in 2016 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a network for connecting and launching blockchain applications using parachains to link to different networks.      Once completed, users will be able to use the parachain to mint PolkaBTC on a 1:1 ratio with deposited bitcoin and will be redeemable for the original bitcoin at any time. ""XCLAIM is on average 95 percent faster and 65% cheaper than using HTLC atomic swaps with Bitcoin,"" Interlay said.      Fully interoperable across the Polkadot ecosystem, the parachain also stores DOT collateral that can be allocated to the user, with a premium, should there be a failure with the redemption process.      A regulated entity in Switzerland, the Web3 Foundation has been issuing grants, anywhere between $3,000 and $100,000, to projects looking to build on the Polkadot platform since the start of 2019. Web3 has so far financed nearly 100 project in five separate funding waves, according to its GitHub page.      Other projects supported by Web3 include a Metamask plugin, an interoperability bridge with EOS and a parachain linking Polkadot to the prospective Libra ecosystem.      In October, Web3 created a Polkadot ecosystem fund together with Polychain Capital. Although the foundation would not specify exactly how much had been set aside for the new fund, a spokesperson at the time said it was ""in the millions.""      It's unclear how much funding Interlay received from Web3. A Web3 spokesperson said the company did not disclose grant amounts per team.      UPDATE (Mar. 5, 13:45 UTC): A previous version of this article said the Web3 Foundation had funded 60 teams. This has since been updated to reflect the fact teams can each be awarded several grants across different projects.

42404132,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOLO,1583406000,Bitcoin Prints Bullish Price Pattern With Move Above $9K,"View  Bitcoin's hourly chart is signaling a bullish reversal and scope for a rally to $9,550. Daily chart indicators are also aligning in favor of the bulls.  Markets may shake out weak hands by revisiting sub-$9,000 levels briefly before printing stronger gains on the bull breakout.  The 200-day average at $8,713 is the level to beat for the bears.    Bitcoin (BTC) has crossed above $9,000, confirming a bullish breakout on technical charts and opening the doors for stronger gains.      The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands near $9,075 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.5 percent gain on the day. Meanwhile, its global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $9,050.      Today's rally is preceded by a bear failure at key support. Bitcoin sellers led the price action on Tuesday and Wednesday and printed intraday lows near $8,660, but could not establish a secure foothold below the 200-day average at $8,720.      Defense of the long-term average has paved the way for a bigger bull move, as expected.      Notably, with the rise from $8,660 to $9,090 (today's high so far), bitcoin has charted a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the hourly technical chart.    Hourly chart    The hourly candle, representing price action in the 60 minutes to 10:00 UTC, closed above neckline resistance of $9,000, confirming an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern – a transition from a bearish lower-highs and lower-lows set up to bullish higher-lows and higher-highs.      The breakout is backed by an uptick in buying volumes, as represented by the green bars, and has opened the doors to $9,550 (target as per the measured move method).      Seasoned traders would argue an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout does not always accelerate the bull move and often traps buyers on the wrong side of the market. While that's true, its effect depends on context.      If the pattern appears following a notable price drop, as is the case here, the breakout usually causes more buyers to join the market.      Further, markets often crowd out weak hands (buyers) following an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout by revisiting the former hurdle-turned-support of the neckline. So, a brief drop to or below $9,000 may be seen before rally toward higher resistance levels.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is flashing green, having defended the 200-day average for the second day running on Wednesday.      The cryptocurrency's price rise is in line with a bullish reversal doji pattern confirmed on Monday.      The relative strength index has breached the descending trendline, signaling an end of the pullback from the recent high of $10,500. Further, the MACD histogram is producing higher lows in support of the bulls.      All in all, technical charts look to have aligned in favor of a rise to resistance at $9,312 (Feb. 19 low). A violation there would expose the inverse-head-and-shoulders breakout target of $9,550.      The bullish case would weaken only if prices print a UTC close below the 200-day average at $8,713.

London-based Provable Things announced Thursday it had successfully launched pTokens – 1:1 proxies for cryptocurrencies on other blockchains – onto the Ethereum mainnet, and that they would be fully interoperable with bitcoin (BTC) through the Bancor and Kyber integrations.      Provable Things founder Thomas Bertani said cross-chain interoperability was the ""missing link"" needed to take DeFi to the next stage of adoption. pTokens, he added, would enable ""liquidity [to] flow instantly and fluidly between different blockchains.""      Users holding value on bitcoin can now mint pBTC tokens on the ERC777 standard – allowing tokens to be sent on another user's behalf – and start using Ethereum-based DeFi applications, the company said in a press release.      Provable has already launched liquidity pools for pBTC on both Bancor Network and Kyber Network, which aim to facilitate seamless transactions between different blockchains and ecosystems.      Shane Hong, Kyber Network's marketing manager, said the Provable integration would greatly benefit the DeFi space, which recently saw its total value surpass the billion-dollar milestone.      ""Bitcoin is among the most widely held and used cryptocurrencies,"" Hong said in a statement to CoinDesk. The pBTC initiative would ""bring bitcoin liquidity to Ethereum DApps, enabling a whole new world of exciting decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystem.""      Nate Hindman, Bancor's head of growth, said his network's integration would give bitcoin holders the flexibility to earn on Ethereum-based DeFi apps and take their value back out into bitcoin. In an email to CoinDesk, he said bitcoin's large market cap could ""drive a wave of new users and liquidity to on-chain financial products on Ethereum.""      ""If pBTC becomes a key on-ramp for bitcoin users to access DeFi services on Ethereum and other chains then staking BTC in the pBTC liquidity pool on Bancor could generate attractive fees and rewards for users staking their pBTC on Bancor,"" Hindman added.      Similar integrations with the Litecoin and EOS blockchains have already been successfully tested. Support for Litecoin should come online within the next few weeks, a Provable Things spokesperson said.

42404126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhOGT,1583398826,UK Finance Watchdog Warns Against 'Unauthorized' Crypto Exchange BitMEX,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a warning over cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX.      In a notice posted Tuesday, the independent financial regulator said the exchange has been targeting British residents without its consent or approval.      ""Almost all firms and individuals offering, promoting or selling financial services or products in the UK have to be authorized by us,"" the watchdog said.      The FCA said it holds information indicating that BitMEX was conducting regulated activities that required its authorization.      As part of its normal activities, the financial regulator does flag entities it perceives as unlawful or suspicious, or cryptocurrency products, such as derivatives, it deems high risk for consumers. In fact, the authority said in 2018 that companies offering crypto derivatives likely need to be authorized because such products may be financial instruments under current directives.      A limited ban on selling crypto derivatives like exchange-traded notes is also planned by the regulator, which said such products are “ill-suited” to retail investors “who cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain crypto assets.”      ""We are working closely with our advisors to assess the situation. There is nothing more we can add at this time,"" BitMEX told CoinDesk.      In what appears to be a slip-up, the FCA also issued a warning over popular crypto exchange Kraken on Tuesday. However, the notice has since been removed, with Decrypt news editor Tim Copeland tweeting that the warning had been issued after the FCA confused the legitimate Kraken service with scammers purporting to be the exchange.      In January, BCB Group, a company that provides financial services to the likes of Coinbase, Bitstamp and Galaxy Digital, was awarded a payments license by the FCA. The firm's CEO, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk that conditions in the U.K were such that many crypto-to-crypto exchanges were light on meeting regulatory obligations, mainly since no fiat currency changes hands.      He said the watchdog's concerns become more severe depending on the type of financial product on offer, with derivatives being at the top of the list as they present the greatest risk to consumers.      ""This statement by the FCA is one which fulfills one of its 3 core objectives – keep markets efficient, provide a framework to raise capital, and protect consumers. Few would argue against stricter controls on access to this kind of product,"" Landsberg-Sadie said.      The FCA had not replied to CoinDesk's request for comment by press time.

42404115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhO6d,1583391600,BitGo Reveals Bitcoin Lending Push; $150M Booked So Far,"BitGo, one of the largest and oldest custodians for digital assets, is joining the fast-growing business of lending out bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to big investors. The Palo Alto-based company announced Thursday it is now offering institutional digital asset lending services.      Founded in 2013 by CEO Mike Belshe, BitGo started testing the new service a few months ago to big investors and has already racked up about $150 million in open loans, according to Nick Carmi, a former Deutsche Bank executive who is overseeing the effort as BitGo’s head of financial services. The new service is initially targeting BitGo’s existing custody clients, the company said in a statement.      BitGo is currently lending bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and stablecoins, Carmi said in an interview. The company also will lend out government-issued currencies including U.S. dollars to investors who post cryptocurrencies as collateral.      With big banks still mostly eschewing the 11-year-old digital-asset industry, a new breed of lenders is stepping into the void to meet the demand, partly from investors seeking to amplify returns on their cryptocurrency bets, through the use of leverage.      The business model of cryptocurrency lenders works much like that of traditional banks: Take in assets from depositors, pay them interest and then make loans at a higher interest rate. The lender can seize the collateral to pay off the loan if the borrower defaults.      “I'm running a matched spread and making a profit on that,” Carmi said. “This is no different from the way banks do it.”      BitGo’s new push comes as cryptocurrency lenders have reported runaway growth compared with traditional banks.      New York-based Genesis Trading, owned by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, said in January that its lending book swelled by 21 percent in the fourth quarter alone to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe. Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent - roughly in line with the broader economy’s expansion.      Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk, is an investor in BitGo. Other backers include the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and crypto-focused investor Galaxy Digital Ventures, led by the former hedge-fund executive and Goldman partner Mike Novogratz.      So far, Carmi said, the vast majority of BitGo’s loans are denominated in bitcoin — similar to the oldest cryptocurrency’s dominance in digital-asset markets.      According to BitGo’s website, Belshe started the company after serving in the early 2010s as a custodian for himself and other tech investors by securing digital coins on an offline laptop hidden beneath his couch. In an industry fraught with reports of scammers, hacks and regulatory missteps, cryptocurrency asset safekeeping has become a key priority for big investors willing to stomach the risks in exchange for outsize profits from betting on the notoriously volatile market.      Bitcoin prices nearly doubled in 2019 and are up 22 percent so far this year. Such performance contrasts with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the benchmark for large U.S. stocks, which has fallen 4.3 percent in 2020 amid coronavirus fears after climbing 29 percent last year.      Last month, BitGo announced plans to buy the two-year-old, blockchain-focused startup Harbor, best known for its failed effort in 2019 to tokenize $20 million of shares in a South Carolina high-rise building.      Belshe said in Thursday’s statement that “we are melding the best of Wall Street’s sophisticated understanding of how to work with institutional investors and the best of Silicon Valley’s technology and innovation.”",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | LTC | MARKET,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/05/bitgo-reveals-bitcoin-lending-push-150m-booked-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a301291419eb5e3b030f53a120c45f984355352a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yang declined to disclose the exact investment amount but said the valuation was between $50 million to $100 million. The firm is looking to conduct another round of financing within the first half of this year with a target to raise another $10-20 million that would value itself at $100 million to $200 million.      ""The purpose of the fund raise is to help us expand the network of our overseas partners since our cashflow and reserve ratio are healthy at the moment,"" Yang said via a phone call.      According to him, 70 percent of the capital Babel used to originate its loans has come from crypto-interbank lenders. Among them, Yang said, the U.S.-based Genesis Capital and BlockFi are two major partners.      Meanwhile, as of Dec. 31, the firm also had about $40 million worth of USDT as outstanding loans made to other crypto lending institutions.    Miners' push    According to Babel's 2019 annual report, the demand from Chinese crypto miners led to the first round of growth for the firm's lending business as bitcoin's price dropped below $4,000 in early 2019.      Out of the $52 million in outstanding loans Babel originated as of Q1 2019, $33.9 million-worth of USDT was lent to crypto miners, accounting for over 60 percent of the total amount.      CoinDesk reported at the time that Chinese crypto miners had turned to investment and capital firms in China to borrow digital assets to either pay for utility costs or stock up mining equipment while pledging their mined cryptocurrencies as collaterals. The strategy was not to sell their mined coins at a bearish market.      While the loans made to crypto miners have steadily gone up throughout 2019, their weight over the total outstanding amount decreased to 17 percent as of Q4 2019. Meanwhile, the demand from institutional investors and hedge funds have increased amid the crypto market's bull run since April last year.      Yang said the loans originated for institutional traders jumped to $131 million as of Dec. 31, accounting for nearly half of the total loans outstanding at the time.      He said the firm recently launched private banking services targeting at wealthy individuals from traditional industries and has attracted over $50 million worth of USDT from about a dozen high-net-worth individuals in China.",POSITIVE,USDT,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | USDT,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/05/crypto-lender-babel-hits-380m-in-outstanding-loans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a089e7d787e0e62c391335d114446d6469234aff-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404107,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMtr,1583379783,Stop Treating Bitcoin as Risky. It's a Safer Asset Than Most,"Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early stage startups with Slow Ventures.      People think I got into bitcoin (BTC) because I have a high risk tolerance.      Actually, I got in because I have a low risk tolerance for worst-case scenarios.      Bitcoin is often touted as a risky bet. It is nascent. It has only been around for about a decade. It is poorly understood by mass markets. It is an experiment. It could still fail. All of these claims are true. In many ways, the risk profile of bitcoin resembles that of an early stage startup. Bitcoin appears to be hovering between the trough of disillusionment and the slope of enlightenment. This means that most people continue to view cryptocurrency as kind of crazy. It’s a gamble.    The road to having bitcoin understood and viewed as a safe haven is a long one, demanding deep investment in education.    These dynamics mean that investors often bucket bitcoin as a risk asset. It gets put in the same category as high-growth stocks, high-yield debt, high-beta exchange-traded funds, venture capital investments and emerging markets.      Markets broadly have two modes: risk-on and risk-off. In risk-on scenarios, when markets are confident and things are moving higher, risk assets tend to outperform safe havens. When the markets are risk-off, safe-haven assets like gold, treasury bonds and cash fare better, and are often the only investments trading higher as investors sell out of their riskier positions.      Whether a financial product is a risk asset or a safe haven depends on a number of properties. In some cases it depends on the fundamentals of the asset. Share price is a reflection of the projected future cash flows of the business, which in turn depend on dynamics like customer demand. The dynamics can make companies more or less subject to movements of the markets. In other cases, the categorization of a given asset might depend on supply and demand dynamics. Gold, with its relatively fixed supply and consistent demand from entities like central banks, is resilient to market cycles and downward shocks. In all cases, however, I would argue that what matters most in understanding asset correlations and behavior is market perception. Do traders and investors view the asset as a good place to hunker down in volatile markets? Or do market participants view the investment as vulnerable to the downside, but also prime to participate in boom cycles?      The markets certainly still seem to view bitcoin as the latter. And as far as the price of bitcoin is concerned, and as far as any market correlations are concerned, that perception is all that matters.      This perception misses bitcoin’s most important properties. Bitcoin is, in many ways, the ultimate safe haven asset. It can be self-custodied, so even when systems of trust and rule of law breaks down, it can be held. It is open and borderless, with relatively liquid markets in every country in the world. It is censorship-resistant, meaning no government nor institution can, practically speaking, prevent investment or transaction in bitcoin. Bitcoin has a fixed supply, much like gold. Bitcoin is digital, which makes it practical to hoard, hold and transport. For doomsday preppers, dystopian sci-fi fans and apocalypse predictors, there is a lot to like about bitcoin.      Yet, if we look at the behavior of the bitcoin price over the last couple of weeks, as concerns over a global pandemic have ramped up, it is clear that bitcoin continues to behave more like a high-risk investment than like the safe haven which it promises to be.      Do the markets have it wrong? Should bitcoin be more correlated with gold than with Apple stock? Maybe. But as John Maynard Keynes put it, “The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The road to having bitcoin understood and viewed as a safe haven is a long one, demanding deep investment in education. What matters is the narrative around the asset, and right now the narrative around bitcoin is that it is an early-stage, high-risk bet. As far as the markets are concerned, that perception is reality.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/05/stop-treating-bitcoin-as-risky-its-a-safer-asset-than-most,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96c48f3a344d61792862b758bd5e3ca4125e549f-1542x910.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
