42421240,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsHl,1665439622,DIMO Helps Drivers Gain and Monetize Their Car Data,"One Michigan-based driver sold his car for $7,000 more than what he would have at his local dealer just by using data gathered by DIMO, an open-source, decentralized project that aims to connect drivers and their data with developers and manufacturers. As DIMO sees it, car data can provide valuable and monetizable insights – but drivers often aren’t the ones benefiting. DIMO wants to change this.  Although $7,000 is on the high end so far, Andy Chatham, co-founder of DIMO, said the average savings is over $1,000 for users who share their data on the platform.  Andy Chatham is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  ""It's already a $100 million plus industry – just people collecting and selling that data. But it's happening outside most people's understanding of their cars. So we're really just helping people participate in that directly,"" Chatham said.  Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) often sell data generated by cars, such as battery health information, but drivers themselves aren’t a part of this transaction. DIMO sees blockchain as a tool to ""flip this model on its head."" The project creates vehicle identities for cars and turns them into non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the blockchain.  ""It's kind of like the [Department of Motor Vehicles], but in the metaverse for the vehicle,"" Chatham said.  Drivers can get economic upside from the data they contribute, without losing ownership.  ""Whether it's being used to train a machine learning model, or evaluate the quality of some battery data, a lot of times this data becomes quite valuable,"" Chatham said.  DIMO is eyeing a big market. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, total sales for all new light-vehicle dealerships exceeded $1.18 trillion in 2021, and DIMO believes the U.S. used cars market is over three times bigger. The U.S. auto insurance market is valued at about $317 billion as well.  ""And just the data itself, like people paying for the data from the cars, is [worth] about $80 billion a year today,” said Chatham. “Even if we can go and make some of these markets 1% or 2% more efficient and return as much of that back to users as possible, like 1% of 1 trillion is a really big number.”  Meanwhile, DIMO also supports developers, who can build on the open-source platform and utilize real-world data from cars that contribute to the network, enabling them to create mobility apps that include vehicle valuation, auto insurance and roadside assistance.  Earlier this year, DIMO finished a $9 million funding round. Since launching last year over 30,000 users have registered and over a dozen mobility companies have begun assessing DIMO, with several already building products and services on the platform.  Chatham believes what they are creating is similar to the Helium network, a blockchain network that leverages a decentralized global network of internet hotspots with two tokens. DIMO also plans to issue a token that compensates users and gives them ownership of the platform and their data.  ""Token holders will be able to vote to control the baseline issuance and marketplace of apps and services,"" Chatham told CoinDesk.  Chatham will be presenting on ""Investing in the New IoT Economy"" at IDEAS Conference, and hopes to bring Web3 into peoples’ daily lives and to inspire them to think about new and beneficial ways to harness their data.  ""I think that's just kind of a powerful message to get across to people to have them start to think about the world a little differently,"" Chatham said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/10/dimo-helps-drivers-gain-and-monetize-their-car-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4f2cf6e11d8030ea33689744a55f5c77c1333f3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Plus, it was met with strong resistance around the $13.4 level. As the price approaches the white ascending trendline, it may find some support there.

42435033,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlUP,1665437406,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Flat Ahead of Inflation Report,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether started the work week slightly lower as markets await U.S. inflation data due Thursday. Impactful economic data announcements will be light until that point, although investors will be scrutinizing September’s Federal Open Market Committee minutes, which the U.S. central bank will release Wednesday.  The minutes will shape expectations for FOMC’s aggressiveness at its next meeting. FOMC is widely expected to raise the interest rate a hefty 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive time.  Bitcoin (BTC) recently declined 1.07% on below-average volume, falling 0.55% at the onset of U.S. trading hours. BTC’s daily volume has been below average in nine of the last 10 trading days, when compared to its 20-day moving average. The lack of volume suggests a lack of conviction, either bullish or bearish.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar path, declining 1.12%, also on below-average volume. ETH’s trading volume has fallen below its 20-day moving average for 12 consecutive days. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now sits just above $1,300 and is down 65% year to date.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, is relatively flat, down 0.90%. The top mover on Monday was quantstamp (QSP), up 32.18% to $0.019, while the day’s laggard was injective protocol (INJ), down 7.18% to $1.81.  Macro View  Traditional financial markets were lower across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 down 0.32%, 1.04% and 0.75%, respectively.  The Dollar index (DXY), which has held a largely inverse pricing relationship to BTC since August, is up 0.34%. BTC investors will be watching the index for signs of growing dollar strength, particularly in light of FOMC’s focus in reducing inflation.  In commodities, energy markets were lower, with WTI and European Brent crude down 2% and 2.1%, respectively. In metals, traditional safe-haven asset gold declined 2%, while copper futures rose 1.6%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin Continues Quiet Run Between $19,000 and $20,000  BTC continues to trade flat, reflecting the absence of catalysts that would spur significant price movement in either direction. Investors currently appear content to sit idly just three days ahead of Thursday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release.  The most recent Commitment of Traders report, released each Tuesday, showed that “large speculators” reduced their BTC holdings to essentially net neutral last week.  The COT report, published by the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, displays the holdings of participants in U.S. futures markets for different assets.  The CFTC will release the latest report this Tuesday. With BTC up just 2% last week on below-average volume, it's difficult to envision a scenario where large institutions purchased BTC en masse during the prior week.  The challenge for BTC and crypto assets in general appears related more to the overall economic environment than in market confidence in the asset itself.  BTC continues to be resilient in the face of challenging economic news, trading at an identical level to where it was in mid-June. Over that same time frame, the FOMC has raised interest rates three times and by 225 basis points, and is widely expected to raise rates by another 75 basis points in November.  The yield curve for two- and 10-year Treasurys continues to be inverted, and has been that way since July. Inverted yield curves have preceded recessions in 2008, 2001 and 1990, so investors have naturally been reluctant to allocate more capital to riskier assets, including crypto.  In a CNBC interview Monday morning, legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones tempered his previous bitcoin bullishness, saying he had a “minor allocation” of the crypto.  Technical indicators continue to blink neutral as the daily 14-day Relative Strength Index for BTC is 44. An RSI of 70 indicates that an asset may be overvalued, and 30 implies that it may be undervalued. An RSI of 44 indicates neither. BTC is also trading just shy of its 20-day moving average of $19,383.  On-chain data appears to echo the neutral-for-now sentiment as well. A look at BTC funding rates shows that following 11 consecutive days of positive readings, BTC funding rates now sit at roughly zero.  Funding rates can serve as a proxy for market sentiment, with positive funding rates implying that markets are long biased and negative rates implying the opposite.

I am personally not a crypto investor, but understand some of its virtues. Bitcoin assists in keeping inflation down. Cryptocurrency is an asset that is not used for the purchase of goods and services in large part and it absorbs around $1 trillion in US dollar value of world currency that may otherwise be used to purchase items or commodities that directly affect the consumer price index. This helps to control the velocity of money.Furthermore, it is in some ways just a wiring method similar to Zelle or Venmo, but its borderless and allows investors from other countries to evade strict currency controls.

42435023,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlOt,1665426713,"Portuguese Proposal Would Enact Taxes on Crypto Transfers, Capital Gains","A budget draft proposal submitted to parliament by Portugal’s Finance Minister Fernando Medina calls for taxing capital gains on cryptocurrency assets held by investors for less than a year.  While the country already taxed capital gains on cryptocurrency holdings derived from professional or business activities, individual citizens were exempt. The new budget draft, however, calls for a levy of 28% on capital gains from cryptocurrency assets held for less than a year. Gains on cryptos held for a period of longer than a year would remain unaffected.  Proceeds from the issuance of cryptocurrencies and crypto mining would also be considered income and subject to taxes in the government plan.  Finance Minister Fernando Medina last May told parliament that cryptocurrencies would soon be subject to taxation.  The draft proposal remains just that, and still must go through the full legislative process before becoming law.  Among the less wealthy of the Western European countries, Portugal for some time has promoted its friendly tax policies to incentivize foreign investors to inject a steady flow of capital into its economy. In 2012, the country launched its Golden Visa residency by investment program to spur job creation and reignite production within Portugal's borders. Since then, the number of foreign residents in Portugal has risen roughly 40%.

42435017,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlLD,1665426217,Bitcoin and Ether Fall Slightly as Macro Clouds Loom Over Market,"Crypto markets were lower on Monday, trading in sync with traditional markets as investors awaited a key U.S. inflation report due later this week.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based market index that measures performance of cryptocurrencies, was down 1% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) slid 1.0% and ether (ETH) lost 0.9%.  BTC was trading in a range between $19,200 and $19,600. The price slipped below $20,000 after Friday’s U.S. job growth report showed that hiring was slowing but still robust, suggesting the Federal Reserve will need to keep tightening monetary policy to bring down inflation.  A report Thursday from the Labor Department is expected to show Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data slowing to 8.1% in September from 8.3% in August – but still four times the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target.  “Today’s movement reflects the general bearish trend across all markets and is likely influenced by some de-risking ahead of inflation figures,” said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  However, there are some bullish signs. Digital asset investment products had outflows totaling $5 million last week, but the redemptions were fueled by withdrawals from “short” bitcoin products, or those betting on price declines, according to a CoinShares report Monday.  Short-bitcoin investment products had outflows totaling a record $15 million, according to the report.  “Bearish sentiment is dissipating,” CoinShares wrote.  Ether-focused funds saw minor outflows totaling $2.2 million last week, “highlighting continued hesitancy amongst investors post the Merge,” according to the report.  Macroeconomic clouds loom over the market as investors remain cautious ahead of the CPI report.  “Thursday is likely to be volatile, as the inflation number will provide more information on if or when the Fed will begin to pivot,” Carey said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/10/bitcoin-and-ether-fall-slightly-as-macro-clouds-loom-over-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b23ca65a4fdf8dc01bf6baff41d8dd64dbe5f6c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435042,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnmW9,1665420561,Binance Exec: BNB Smart Chain Hack Could Have Been Worse if Validators Hadn’t ‘Sprung Into Action’,"Validators on crypto platforms are becoming, out of necessity, more and more astute, said Patrick Hillmann, chief communications officer at crypto exchange Binance.  Over the weekend, BNB Chain, a blockchain closely connected with crypto exchange Binance, was the latest victim in a hack that ultimately drained the ecosystem of $100 million in crypto. The exploit, however, could’ve been worse.  “[The] elephant in the room here is as these attacks become more sophisticated … [I]f they were more organized, [the hackers] probably could have gotten more funds off of the ecosystem than they did,” Hillman said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday.  While the hackers were able to get away with roughly $100 million, the potential amount could have been as much as $570 million.  Read more: BNB Smart Chain Resumes Operations After $100M Exploit  “What we’re seeing here is that as we see more of these attacks on bridges, the communities that rally around these blockchains are getting much better at shutting them down quickly, updating their systems and being able to prevent a worst case scenario from happening,” Hillmann said.  On Thursday, BNB validators noticed some strange activity taking place on BSC Token Hub, one of the platform’s bridges ,and came to the conclusion the bridge was being utilized to mint additional BNB tokens, according to Hillmann. He compared the exploit to a group of thieves breaking into the U.S. Federal Reserve, printing their own money and then walking away with it.  Nearly 90 minutes after the initial exploit, concerns emerged, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao estimating the bridge had been exploited for $100 million.  “Luckily that community, the validators, sprung into action really quickly, were able to lock down the chain and actually prevent the lion's share of that new minted BNB from being able to actually leave the ecosystem,” Hillman said.  The attack prompted 26 of BNB Chain’s validators to act, preventing what could’ve been a $570 million hack, or the value of the 2 million BNB tokens that were fraudulently created, from being siphoned out.  Regarding whether centralization on the BNB Smart Chain is an issue of concern, Hillmann said there are benefits that come with a smaller community “overseeing and keeping the doors locked at night.”  “Because those 26 validators are able to work with one another so quickly, they’re able to prevent that worse case scenario from happening,” he said.  Read more: Binance CEO Zhao Taking Different Acquisition Tack Than FTX's Bankman-Fried  Moving forward, BNB Chain’s validators said they would hold a series of on-chain governance votes that would decide whether the hacked funds should be frozen, as well as whether a bug bounty reward system should be put in place to prevent future hacks.  Hillmann said that to ensure the BNB token is growing at a sustainable rate, and because the hackers “didn’t steal someone’s money,” the BNB community is planning to include $2 million worth of BNB tokens in its upcoming burn this year as a way to “bring it back down to parity.”  Furthermore, Hillman said the BNB Chain community is working with law enforcement to track down the hackers, who he suggested could be “either a state-based actor or a threat group that is tied to a state actor.”  “In some ways this was a very sophisticated attack and in some ways it wasn't,” Hillmann said.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | BNB,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/10/binance-exec-bnb-smart-chain-hack-could-have-been-worse-if-validators-hadnt-sprung-into-action,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a1f43f380144b1f8765ee1e3c2cbd6557b29a81-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) lets providers of wallets and other crypto services market themselves across the bloc, if they register with national authorities and meet minimum guarantees intended to protect investors and maintain stability.  The Monday vote by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, based on a deal struck privately with EU member states that meet in a body known as the Council, took place without further discussion, clearing the way for endorsement by the full European Parliament before the end of this year.  Lawmaker Stefan Berger, who shepherded talks for the parliament, called the move “good news” in a tweet welcoming the vote.  The European crypto industry has broadly welcomed the regulatory recognition, even if there are some qualms over the restrictions it places on the use of stablecoins, crypto assets that seek to maintain their value with respect to fiat currencies, as well over uncertainties about whether the rules will apply to non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The law will enter into force between 12 and 18 months after being published in the bloc’s official journal, which is likely to happen next spring.

With the introduction of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup technology, Polygon is hoping to become the chief scalable system for Ethereum.  At ETHCC in Paris in July, the company said it would be launching its zkEVM public testnet over the summer, and was aiming for a mainnet launch in early 2023. So today’s announcement was at least somewhat delayed.  Polygon’s latest technology will deploy the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, meaning that developers won’t have to use new programming languages and can move over their smart contracts from Ethereum without any hiccups.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  Rollups are systems aimed at addressing scalability issues of blockchains, with the goal of making transactions faster and cheaper. Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups process transactions in bundles and use “proofs.” These proofs are bite-size pieces of encoded data that confirm that the transaction is “true” and has not been altered.  ZK rollup development was long considered to be far away, but with Polygon’s announcement – as well as news from Matter Labs and Scroll that they are building their own zkEVM projects – the emergence of this technology appears well on its way.  “It was widely believed that zkEVM will take several more years to ship, which makes this an even more groundbreaking milestone, not only for Polygon but for the whole Web3 industry,” said Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic in a statement to CoinDesk.  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the software that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By integrating ZK-rollups with EVM (zkEVM), developers will not have to learn new programming languages, and can move their smart contracts over from Ethereum easily.  With the public testnet going live, some of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, including Aave and Uniswap, as well as Web3 social platform Lens, will be among the first protocols to make use of the zkEVM testnet.  “We are moving towards giving our users the full benefits of a working zkEVM — scalability without compromise” said Polygon co-founder David Schwartz.

42411335,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNDzV,1665417531,Why Celsius Doxxed Hundreds of Thousands of Users,"Celsius Network, the bankrupt crypto lender, reluctantly doxxed all of its users. Last week, more than 29,000 pages of court documents hit the servers, revealing the financial details of hundreds of thousands of users that kept money on the “neobank” Celsius.  The information appears to have been released as part of standard bankruptcy procedure as Celsius winds its way through the Chapter 11 restructuring process after freezing customer accounts in July. About 600,000 customer accounts are affected by the disclosure, revealing their wallet addresses, transaction histories, crypto holdings, recent transactions and other information.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The incident has raised serious concerns about financial transparency and fears that this public information could make Celsius users targets for harassment or theft. It does not appear to be a data breach or hack, as many initially suggested.  According to court documents, Celsius fought to prevent much of this information from getting out. In the end, users’ emails and home addresses were allowed to be redacted. One of the company’s arguments was that publishing this personal information would “reduce” the list’s resale value.  Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who’s overseeing the case and compelled Celsius to release this data trove, cited court precedent and inadequate proof that doxxing users would put them at risk.  “Sealing information such as that sought by the Debtors [Celsius] from public disclosure risks transforming the open and transparent bankruptcy process into something very different, which the Court is loath to do without a strong showing of real and not speculative risks,” Judge Glenn wrote in a September court filing.  Still, due to the default transparency of the blockchain, even the partially redacted information can be pieced together to “dox” Celsius users’ other on-chain activities, ​​Henry de Valence, founder of Web3 startup Penumbra Labs, noted on Twitter.  It’s also arguable that the court’s demands here far exceed the norm. Typically, companies going through the bankruptcy process will have to expose a full accounting of their assets, which Judge Glenn here took to include Celsius’ custody books going back to July.  All of this has led to the usual bromides often heard on Crypto Twitter: the dangers of trusting centralized intermediaries, the importance of practicing good “op-sec” when using public chains and the need for crypto-specific laws and regulations that meet the industry where it is.  People are already scanning through the list for names they recognize, and sending reminders that there might be more than one Neeraj Agrawal in the world. There’s been at least one example of wrongful public shaming so far, where one bitcoiner erroneously called out another for apparently using Celsius.  See also: Celsius Resembled Ponzi Scheme at Times, VermonT Regulator Says  I’d expect more of this now that a website launched making the data publicly searchable by name. That website, called Celsiusnetworth.com, also includes a ranking of doxxed Celsius users by the amount they lost – for easy schadenfreude.  The site itself appears to be conflating different individuals and aggregating data, meaning its accuracy is questionable at best.  It’s worth noting the irony that Celsius has not been exactly forthcoming throughout the bankruptcy process, and that its executives not only misled the public in the lead up to freezing its services but withdrew millions of dollars from custody accounts.  Whether Celsius creditors (read: users) will receive any payout after the firm restructures is an open question. They could have been doxxed for nothing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/10/why-celsius-doxxed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3d1666f28143bb9faf80a01dd7620d9baad0b53-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435047,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnmaR,1665416440,OECD Releases New Global Tax Reporting Framework for Crypto Assets,"The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released its new tax reporting framework, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), according to a press release Monday.  The framework, which was approved in August, ensures ""the collection and automatic exchange of information on transactions for relevant crypto,"" the report said. The definition of crypto assets ""includes assets that can be held and transferred in a decentralised manner, without the intervention of traditional financial intermediaries, including stablecoins, derivatives issued in the form of a crypto-asset and certain non-fungible tokens,"" the report said.  Intermediaries and other service providers facilitating exchanges between relevant crypto assets, such as exchanges, brokers and ATM operators, will also be included in the scope.  ""The current scope of assets, as well as the scope of obliged entities, covered by the Common Reporting Standard (current standards) do not provide tax administrations with adequate visibility on when taxpayers engage in tax-relevant transactions in, or hold, relevant crypto assets,"" the report said. Hence, the OECD has created this new framework.  CARF was developed in light of the crypto industry's rapid growth. Last year, the industry went from having a market capitalization of $715 billion in January to nearly touching $3 trillion before plummeting this year. In addition, these developments are in line with the recent developments in the global anti-money laundering standards from the Financial Action Task Force.  However, in May, the crypto industry pushed back on tax reporting measures for cryptocurrencies at an OECD meeting.  The CARF sets rules that crypto asset firms must report in the country that they conduct business in. Exchanges between relevant crypto assets and fiat currencies, along with exchanges between one or more type of crypto and transfers of crypto (including retail payment transactions), will need to be reported.  Like the OECD's Common Reporting Standard (CRS), the framework's due diligence process requires both the individual and entity customers and controlling persons to identify themselves. Indirect investments in crypto assets via derivatives and investment vehicles are now also covered by the CRS. Amendments were also made to include central bank digital currencies in the CRS, rather than in the CARF. The CRS sets out the financial account information to be exchanged and reported, plus due diligence procedures.  Alongside these rules ""work is ongoing on an implementation package to ensure the consistent domestic and international application of the CARF,"" the report noted.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/10/oecd-releases-new-global-tax-reporting-framework-for-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/214f8dc1ad36773bdd4ee01aa445ccf912f1de6b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The TRX price action showed a bullish breakout of a bearish trendline, with a 3% jump today, resulting in a bullish candle. However, the increase in selling pressure at $0.065 causes a higher price rejection to keep the bullish growth in check. So, will Tron prices break above the $0.065 mark? Key Points: The Tron price action shows a bullish breakout entry opportunity. The price jump challenges the 100-day EMA. The intraday trading volume in Tron is $499 million. Source - TradingView TRX Technical Analysis The TRX price action shows a bullish recovery rally from $0.058 after a long-term downtrend under the influence of a resistance trendline. The bull run accounts for a price jump of 10% in the last two weeks. However, the price breakout rally struggles to exceed the overhead resistance level of $0.065, leading to a higher rejection in the daily candle. Moreover, the 100-day EMA breakout rally reverses and approaches the 50-day EMA. Therefore, questions about the bullish trend sustaining in the daily chart are rising, while some expect it as a retest of the broken trendline.

The product, called Luxor Hashprice NDF, will be traded over-the-counter and will be first of its kind, according to a statement. The financial instrument will be based on hashprice, a term coined by Luxor that refers to the bitcoin mining revenue miners earn from a unit of hashrate, or compute power over a specific period of time.  With the bear market wreaking havoc on the bitcoin mining industry, participants exposed to the sector require new ways of hedging their downside. Traditionally, derivative products have been used in the traditional finance (TradFi) world to protect against market downturns.  “Hashprice-based derivatives such as the Luxor Hashprice NDF forward contract will usher in a new era of financial instruments for bitcoin miners and give them a much-needed tool to hedge their mining operations,” the statement said. It will also help investment firms such as prop traders and hedge funds gain exposure to the mining industry, the statement added.  The contracts for the product will settle in U.S. dollars, with Luxor providing buyers and sellers of the derivatives the option to reconcile them in bitcoin or U.S. dollar equivalents. Luxor will facilitate the order matchmaking and settlement process, while making the contract durations flexible based on customer needs.  With the bear market being a good opportunity for some to build, some industry participants have taken the plunge to deploy capital or introduce ways to help the struggling mining sector. Most recently, crypto asset management firm Grayscale said it is forming an investment vehicle that will help investors take advantage of the low prices of bitcoin mining infrastructure amid the ongoing crypto winter. Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.  Meanwhile, last month, crypto billionaire Jihan Wu – the founder of Bitmain – was reported to be setting up a $250 million fund to purchase distressed assets from mining firms.

It wasn't exactly a rousing endorsement of the crypto given Jones' major bullishness two-plus years ago. At the time, in mid-2020, the hedge fund giant said he had allocated 1%-2% of his multibillion-dollar portfolio to bitcoin (BTC).  He later said he could see allocating as much as 5% of his assets to bitcoin if the U.S. Federal Reserve continued on its path of monetary debasement. His remarks at that time helped pump crypto prices – then already in a bull market – even higher.  His milquetoast remarks on digital assets today were hardly noticed, with the price of bitcoin remaining mired in the low-$19,000 area.  In 2020, of course, the Fed was in the midst of any number of stimulus schemes aimed at keeping the economy and financial system afloat alongside the COVID-19 lockdowns. Today, the U.S. central bank is in the exact opposite mode as it rapidly tightens monetary policy to fight the inflation surge it helped create.  ""Inflation is a bit like toothpaste,"" said Jones this morning. ""Once you get it out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in."" The Fed, he said, ""is furiously trying to wash that taste out of [its] mouth ... If we go into recession, that has really negative consequences for a variety of assets.""

42420943,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw2n,1665405842,Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment,"Culture is the new currency. For the first decade of cryptocurrency’s existence, investing in the space was relatively simple: You could buy bitcoin, ether, XRP, ADA or any of the thousands of more exotic alt-coins. Prices soared, prices flopped.  Then, something changed. In the last two years, ever since the awkward acronym “NFT” [for non-fungible token] went mainstream, crypto has seeped into every corner of our culture. Sports: NBA Top Shot racked up 1 million users. Art: Crypto was such a juggernaut that even Sotheby’s, founded in 1744, began auctioning NFTs. Pop culture: Celebrities like Jimmy Fallon, Madonna and Kevin Hart changed their Twitter avatars to cartoon apes.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""I.D.E.A.S. Week."" Register here to become a part of the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), a new conference focused on the innovations happening across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.  “We’re seeing this convergence of culture, finance and technology,” says Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, a VC fund and accelerator. “It’s no longer just a technological paradigm shift. It’s no longer just a new financial system. It’s also a new way in which culture is made, consumed and distributed.”  For potential investors this represents an opportunity. An investment in crypto “culture” is a bet on the passions, hobbies and obsessions that regular people actually care about. “The average person doesn’t care about the underlying technology. They care about what it can do for them,” says Magdalena Kala, founder of venture fund Double Down. “When you look at the growing awareness of Web3,” says Kala, “it’s always tied to consumer culture.”  To find alpha, hunt for the passion. That’s essentially the investment thesis for Jarrod Dicker, partner at The Chernin Group (TCG) and a former vice president at The Washington Post. “When we look at investments we look at passion first and then say, how is this uniquely unlocked by crypto?”  He gives the example of music. “I have a ton of passion for music,” says Dicker. “Would I love to be a record label exec? Sure. But do I have any skills for that? No. I’m never going to get hired by Warner.” In today’s world of Web2, Dicker’s passion is just a wispy fantasy. But with Web3? He points to projects like Hume, a decentralized record label, that lets the community (through NFT ownership) find and grow musical talent.  See also: NFTs Can and Will Be So Much More | Opinion  Or maybe you have a passion for museums? “That might be a passion of mine,” says Dicker, “but would I ever be able to curate the Smithsonian? Hell no.” Enter Web3 projects like Arkive or PleasrDAO, where members act as curators and vote on which assets to acquire.  If your passion is sports? Then LinksDAO could help you become a part-owner of a golf course or WAGMI United could help you own a soccer team or SailGP a racing yacht. “These are fascinating, and for some reason, very under-discussed,” says Dicker. “I talk about it constantly, and we invest across that thesis.”  Let’s say, hypothetically, that you buy this underlying premise – that culture can be a good bet. How do you leverage this? How, specifically, do you gain exposure to this strange new market?  Web3 is gaining exposure  The beauty of the crypto market, from an investor’s perspective, is that you can take a stake in a number of different ways. VC funds like Outlier directly invest in projects at an exceptionally early phase. “We’ve got a particular way of investing in the space as an accelerator,” Burke explains. “We work with Project X, we take a stake in them at an early stage, and we help them raise money, hire people, develop product, go to market and, hopefully, grow their user base.”  That level of hands-on isn’t necessary, of course, for early-stage investing. “For the way that we’re looking at the market today, early exposure – the traditional equity-type of exposure – is probably the best right now,” says David Nage, portfolio manager at Arca. Specifically, Nage says that in 2021 the “lion’s share” of investment deals were for SAFTs, or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Once the prices dropped in early 2022, Nage saw a shift from SAFTs to the more traditional SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), along with a warrant for future tokens. (In other words, an investor would get a chunk of equity ownership, along with a stack of tokens at a future date.)  If you’re not interested or able to invest directly into a founding team? Then you can gain exposure through tokens. If you’re bullish on the potential of Project X, you can simply purchase X tokens in the same way you would buy shares of Tesla.  Or you could simply invest in the NFTs. This has been the playbook of the pseudonymous “Whale Shark,” who has bought over 400,000 NFTs and is one of the most prolific collectors in the space. “Each investment ‘class’ has their own pros and cons,” says Whale Shark over email. “While equity [investing in a founding team] provides the highest growth prospects, it lacks the liquidity of tokens.”  And don’t sleep on another way to gain exposure, and it could be the simplest method of all: The underlying blockchain protocols. “If you believe in these business models, why not just buy a bunch of Ethereum?” says Kala, referencing the fact that many of these projects operate on the Ethereum-based Polygon platform. Or you could make an “index bet” by spreading your investments across a number of platforms – Ethereum, Flow, Solana and others.  Nage agrees. By analogy, he notes that in the early-1990s internet, the protocol of TCP/IP was the main hub that SMTP and HTML were built upon. If you were a savvy 1990s investor who was confident in the future of the internet, wouldn’t it be nice to own a piece of TCP/IP? But that couldn’t be done. Those financial instruments didn’t exist. Today, however? If you believe in the promise of Web3 culture, as Nage puts it, “you have the ability to invest in the protocols where all of these things will be built.”  All that said, the word “culture” is almost comically vague and tricky to pin down. Culture can mean art, sports, fashion, music, gaming, archeology, dating, religion, movies, food, poetry – it’s a long list. And Web3 could disrupt each of these verticals. So rather than try to exhaustively (and futilely) catalog every potential investment opportunity as a way of sparking ideas and encouraging future research, we’ve highlighted a few of the use cases that professional crypto investors find particularly tantalizing.  Some are here right now. Others are imminent. And still others are perhaps three to five years from going mainstream, which could make now the perfect entry. (This could also, of course, all “go to zero.” Many, if not most, projects will fail. Risks abound. Caveat emptor.)  Use cases already in play  Gaming  To find a solid investment thesis, Nage likes to look at the wider macro trends – and a big one is gaming. “There are about 3 billion gamers around the world,” says Nage, who notes that since the days of Pong, “Gaming has grown through recessions and depressions and wars.”  The implication for Web3? Nage closely followed the explosive growth of Axie Infinity because “for the first time, players were able to use and play a game and extrapolate value instead of being locked into the circular economy that larger corporations own.” Nage acknowledged the subsequent decline of Axie (which highlights the risk in all of these projects), but says “the idea behind it is still there.” Seventy percent of Arca’s portfolio is devoted to gaming projects, and they’re currently tracking 1,000 games in development.  Dicker is also bullish on gaming. “There are very unique things that crypto enables that could help evolve experiences that people already love,” he says. He gives the example of chess. “Chess is a centuries-old game,” he says, but a play-to-earn chess game (such as Immortal Game) takes the classic game and injects it with new life. It’s the same user experience and user interface of chess, but it layers on crypto-infused “micro games” for added strategy. Other examples are crypto fantasy sports (such as Sorare) or crypto horse racing with Zed Run. As Dicker puts it, “People love horse racing, but it’s pretty cost-prohibitive to buy a horse and get to Belmont.”  ENS (Ethereum Name Service)  For Whale Shark, it’s smart to invest in things with utility – things that people will eventually need to do. That’s why he likes ENS. “It’s impossible to remember one’s ETH address,” says Whale Shark, “and with the ETH mainnet becoming an irreplaceable part of the ecosystem, everyone will eventually need an ENS domain for convenience’s sake.”  The creator economy  Film, music, art, entertainment – Web3 can help creators monetize their hard work, and the projects enabling this could flourish. “What are the interesting and creative ways where we can increase revenue streams for artists and engagement points for fans?” asks Kala. This is already happening. The Kings of Leon released an album as an NFT, for example, and Kala points to early decentralized content projects, like Tally Labs, that partner with Neil Strauss and members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club to collaboratively write a book.  Web3 to drive human behavior  “Humans are funny,” says Kala. “We know what we should be doing, but we don’t do it.” We know we’re supposed to exercise. We know we’re supposed to save money. Eat healthy. Drink water.  But we’re often lousy at all of these things, mainly because our short-term impulses (pleasure seeking) are not aligned with our long-term interests (health). What if Web3 can somehow snap our short-term and long-term incentives into alignment?  That’s the premise of Web3 projects like Stepn, where you need to buy an NFT to participate and then are rewarded for how many steps you take in the physical world. Kala can see projects like this gaining mainstream adoption (and therefore providing a juicy ROI), as this would be a “Web3 dopamine hit to drive human behavior.”  Use cases around the corner  NFT photography  Whale Shark predicts that the next wave of NFT assets could be photography because it’s a field “ripe for disruption.” His thesis: More photographers are now digitally native, and “the majority of content that we consume on the internet, whether through Instagram or other social media platforms, is photographic in nature.”  NFTs as brand loyalty programs  “I do love this notion of free-to-own,” says Dicker. Here’s what he means: A company drops a free NFT into a customer’s wallet and that NFT can unlock certain benefits over time. (It’s essentially a Web3 version of a frequent flier program.) “What the wallet is going to evolve to is way more powerful than email,” says Dicker, as it could enable a “tighter relationship” between a brand and consumer.  Mobile Web3 gaming  The first phase of Web3 gaming was almost entirely focused on laptops and desktops, as you generally needed to connect to a wallet (such as MetaMask). But this only reached a small slice of the world’s gamers. Of the 3 billion global gamers, says Nage, “50% to 70%” are playing on their phones. “We’ve seen over the last six months that designers have been focused on mobile as a deployment mechanism for Web3,” says Nage, and predicts mobile gaming will be “incredibly important in the next year or two.”  See also: Web3 Gaming Has a Long Way to Go Before It Becomes Mainstream  Security  Nage thinks that the next bull run will not arrive until there’s mass adoption of new users. This adoption, in turn, won’t come until there are significant upgrades to both the user experience (making it “frictionless”) and tighter security. “The security layer has to be pronounced, it has to build out,” says Nage, pointing to security-focused projects like OpenZeppelin (which does code audits) and Forta (real-time threat assessments) as a way to get exposure.  Zero-knowledge/self-sovereign identity  Most of us are now more concerned about protecting our online privacy, which makes the potential of “zero-knowledge proofs” (proof of identity without disclosing data) so alluring. And that upside could be larger than you think. “It’s not from a consumer perspective, it’s from an institutional perspective,” says Burke. He notes that the recent crashes in decentralized finance (DeFi), which “seemingly came out of nowhere” actually happened “because everyone can see what everyone else is doing, and everyone can see everyone else’s trades, on-chain.”  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Burke sees this as a “huge vulnerability if you’re an institution, trying to trade and take positions.” He acknowledges that many people consider full transparency to be a virtue, “but the reality is that people who have billions, and want to deploy it in the space, don’t like that.” He likens this financial transparency to “Wal-Mart having their entire supply chain online” – it exposes vulnerabilities that others can exploit. Burke suspects zero-knowledge privacy tools will be invoked as a solution, and it will be “driven by institutional demand, to basically obfuscate aspects of their trading activity.”  Web3 in the future (three to five years out)  What should count as “around the corner” and what should count as “the Future,” of course, is admittedly squishy because no one has a crystal ball. It’s possible that any of these could be in the prior category, and vice versa.  “Meta-Fi”  “Meta-Fi is a big theme for us,” says Burke. It applies the new tools of DeFi to the world of NFTs and the metaverse. “If culture can be financialized and turned into an asset, and that asset can be borrowed and lent against, then all of the sudden you have a huge amount of people whose current wealth is not recognized by the existing financial system.”  A simple example: You have an NFT, and that NFT can be used as collateral to get a loan or even fractionalized and sold to multiple buyers in smaller chunks. A more provocative example: Let’s imagine a star gamer who spends 16 hours a day crushing Fortnite. She has maxed out her armor and weapons – and these are incredibly valuable in the game. But outside of bragging rights and Twitch content, what can you actually do with that?  As Burke puts it, “Good luck going to a bank and saying, ‘I’m a millionaire in Fortnite.’” With Meta-Fi, in a decentralized game, players could flip those assets to real-world buying power. As with all of these categories and use cases, the precise way this happens is still a giant TBD – and that’s what makes it an investment opportunity. (For any category, Burke says that Outlier invests in multiple early-stage start-ups as a way of diversifying and spreading their bets, as “we can’t predict the winner.”)  NFT infrastructure  Burke says that while NFTs have tremendous potential, realistically there are still severe limitations on how they function in the current version of metaverse. “How much volume is actually being bought in Decentraland? Not much. It’s not really designed to be a shopping experience,” he says. Often the UI of the metaverse “degrades the thing people are shopping for,” because it’s “made to be a social space rather than a high-end retail experience.” In other words, a luxury piece of jewelry might look like pixelated garbage.  Someone will eventually fix this problem. Burke predicts that what will “drive a huge amount of users” is an “extended reach and distribution of NFTs.” Maybe that’s a more creative way of showcasing NFTs. Maybe it’s smoother integration into Web2. The exact how and what is still to be determined, but Burke is now eyeing “startups coming to market that evolve or upgrade how you experience an NFT.”  Vertical NFT marketplaces  As Kala puts it, we’re still in the “eBay era” of NFT marketplaces. The space is early and crude. She predicts that just as e-commerce became more niche – “with marketplaces for fashion, marketplaces for beauty” – the same thing could happen with Web3. “Over time when you have more adoption, I don’t see why you wouldn’t have more vertical categories,” she says. For example, she envisions a hub for music that has music content, a music community forum, a music NFT marketplace, and even a digital concert hall. “There could be a platform that serves your needs, and you’re able to engage in the entire ecosystem of music NFTs,” says Kala.  Interoperable metaverses  “One thing I’m excited about over the next three to five years is the notion of an open metaverse,” says Dicker. Many “closed” systems are being created, he says, such as Facebook and The Sandbox, but “I love the idea that these mechanics start to become more interoperable.” If this does indeed happen, then it will take new infrastructure and projects to build the tools to make these worlds interoperable. Dicker points to infrastructure projects like Altered State Machine as an opportunity.  “D Commerce”  E-commerce? That’s so Web2. Burke expects the eventual emergence of decentralized commerce, or “D Commerce,” that would effectively replicate everything that Amazon does, from payment to fulfillment, without trusting a centralized corporation.  And finally …  The mainstreaming of digital ownership  This is less of a specific slice of culture and more a broader trend that could become dominant in the next five years. It’s a trend that underpins all of the above ideas.  “The most exciting thing about Web3 is giving people that ownership mindset,” says Kala. She has a simple but powerful argument: People like owning things. They like owning homes, they like owning cars, they like owning stocks. “If you believe ownership matters, Web3 should be important to you.”  See also: What Is Web3? Understanding What Web3 Is... and Isn't  Whale Shark agrees, and in the final analysis he uses one word to encapsulate investments in crypto culture: Inevitability. His reasoning is that “life is going digital.” And if it’s true that life is going digital, he says it’s also true that “without blockchains like Ethereum and Flow, it’s not possible to bestow an equal level of ownership, scarcity management, and provenance” to digital assets. As he sees it, “The minor bear and bull cycles are irrelevant in the greater context in the digitization of life.”  Culture and Entertainment is a presentation category at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.

In crypto he found an ungoverned terrain to enact change. So he co-founded Quasar Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project in the Cosmos ecosystem with plans for chain-agnostic investment opportunities.

While crypto offers open and transparent monetary policies, investing in it is not for the meek. Investment options range from JPEGs of monkeys to labyrinthic multi-level yield optimization strategies that yoke your coins through 18 different global platforms to reap x% more of something. And in the base case, investing in the primates outperforms. A select few can fluently navigate it, but the balance of humanity can’t be expected to parse crypto’s spread of opportunity.  To help average users, crypto entrepreneurs have devised vault strategies. Quasar hopes to propagate these across crypto ecosystems. “Scaling intake of capital for professional asset managers is not easy. We leverage DeFi’s inherent benefits to allow for scalable global capital exodus,” Pletnev said in an interview with CoinDesk.  A primer on DeFi vaults  Vaults are investment vessels designed by experts for use by novices. They connect often-complex trading strategies with the capital of retail investors. Passive investors see their balance grow (hopefully) as a result of previously inaccessible investment strategies. And the designers of those strategies take a cut of the yield from investing capital they otherwise couldn’t have sourced.  More from IDEAS Week: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment  Vaults often support deeply complex financial engineering to extract the highest yield possible. “The vault enables you to pool money and execute a common goal,” said Pletnev. “Strategies can be arbitrage and delta neutral strategies, leveraged positions in predictive buying, predictive selling, literally anything.”  Vaults aren’t new. They’re at the core of now-legacy protocols like Yearn Finance, which helped spark the DeFi bull run of 2020. Quasar hopes to build a product for the next generation of yield strategies that cross crypto ecosystems.  To a multi-blockchain world  Quasar will utilize the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to broaden the ecosystem real estate that vault strategies can traverse. Often, decentralized finance applications are limited to their native chain – segregated ecosystems limit the strategies that DeFi yield artisans can craft.  Bridging ecosystems is desirable because it expands the liquidity available and offers cross-ecosystem arbitrage opportunities. Quasar could eventually offer vault strategies that span Ethereum and Cosmos among others.  The good of it  When COVID-19 hit, Pletnev’s parents lent him a slug of capital to invest. His investments performed well enough that neighbors wanted to deposit into this homegrown “fund” – but there are laws that prevent that sort of thing.  Access to financial opportunity and literacy, even in our commercial age, are often overlooked luxuries – something Pletnev knows firsthand. Both his parents were born in formerly Soviet states. “It’s really crazy how very little people in the West are aware of the kind of loops that people have to go through to reach their system,” he said.  More from IDEAS Week: Reuniting Borrowers and Lenders on Defi  From there, the appeal to DeFi is obvious. Government barriers and the annoyance and cost of physical-world financial advice and services create a market for easily accessible DeFi strategies. Crypto already offers global permissionless access to funds and transfers – but if only the savviest users can access the most remunerative opportunities, the social good will be limited. Quasar hopes to expand both the range of vault strategies on offer and the number of people with access to them.  If all goes to plan, Quasar will go live on Cosmos Mainnet around the end of 2022, connecting complete novices with some of DeFi’s most complex opportunities. “I want my mom to use the app,” Pletnev said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | YFI,Dante Sacco,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/10/defi-for-the-masses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22746fa88a6f6ca5ff334bb90f7df66a52787cdd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421244,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsMv,1665405766,Reuniting Borrowers and Lenders on Defi,"The advent of decentralized finance lending pools enabled the rise of a liquid decentralized money market. Improving DeFi lending in 2022 requires a revision of that advance and a return to the individual borrower and lender.  Paul Frambot co-founded Morpho, an Ethereum application that appends peer-to-peer borrowing and lending possibilities onto the lending pools of protocols such as Aave and Compound. Morpho’s goal, as he put it in an interview with CoinDesk, is to “make efficient lending a common good.”  Lending pools solve the shortfall in liquidity when matching individual lenders and borrowers. On Aave and Compound billions of dollars are held in lending pools, but this arrangement has its own costs.  Frambot is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come. Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  Pooled lending creates a notable spread between the interest rates that borrowers pay and lenders receive. Right now on Aave, lenders of USDC receive a variable interest rate of ~0.6% while borrowers pay a variable rate of ~1.7%.  Peer-to-peer lending brings rates in step, improving the transaction for both borrowers and lenders. But configuring it at scale has proven tricky. Luckily, Paul Frambot raised $20 million to solve just this issue.  Morpho, put simply  It hasn’t been a simple fix. The Morpho white paper runs 19 pages long, and that’s the abbreviated version – an internal yellow paper proving Morpho’s math unfurls to 70 pages. Satoshi Nakamoto wrapped up the Bitcoin white paper in a tidy eight.  To be brief: In Aave and Compound, lenders pool their money and the borrowers take from these pools of funds. Large sums in the pool lie dormant, unborrowed. To keep the bargain interesting for all lenders, borrowers pay higher rates and lenders collectively share the total interest.  The arrangement hurts both parties, but without viable alternatives it has become the default. Morpho has found a clever workaround – it sits atop these pools and opportunistically matches individual lenders and borrowers when possible. When matching fails, the unpaired capital reverts to the Aave or Compound pools.  The one-to-one transaction principle seems simple enough and is thoroughly tested. Airbnb connects you to one shelter, Uber connects you to a single car; in no case would a vagrant pedestrian accept their fractional share of a pool of the available homes and cars. Frambot calls Morpho a “mathematical improvement of the underlying protocol.”  A tenuous lending-protocol marriage  If Morpho creates a better bargain for both lender and borrower, who should be using Aave and Compound?  Well, Morpho has a thorny relationship with its pool-oriented peers. It relies on Aave and Compound pools when individual borrowers and lenders can’t be matched, but Morpho also hopes to siphon money from the pools into its own protocol. “The system is not generating more rewards,” says Frambot, “Aave users are just going to earn less and it’s going to be deposited to the Morpho users.”  Read More from IDEAS Week: DeFi for the Masses  While the share of deposited funds that Morpho can match in a direct lender-borrower match differs depending on the asset, Frambot reported that at the time of the interview ~$150 million total was in Morpho and ~$30 million of that was matched peer to peer. That leaves a sizable sum to Aave and Compound.  Frambot resists stereotyping Morpho’s relationship with Aave and Compound as symbiotic or vampiric. He calls it neutral. “This is going to grow the overall pie because Morpho is going to give access to rates that were not possible before,” he says.  The road map  Morpho’s near-term goal is the education and evangelization of users. The protocol is complicated and exotic. The discerning lender must mull plenty of weekend reading before depositing.  In the long term, Morpho’s road map plays on the protocol’s eponymous creature, the Morpho butterfly. We live in the era of the Morpho caterpillar in the apple (who knew?), where the inchoate protocol simply seeks to prove its matching mechanism constitutes an improvement over present state lending.  More from CoinDesk's IDEAS Week: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment  With luck, we’ll soon bear witness to the “chrysalis” and “butterfly” stages of development. Morpho plans to become (in the vein of UniSwap version 3) a protocol that improves the efficiency of their algorithms day over day and siphons funds from traditional finance.  Morpho needs to demonstrate its lending algorithms are competitive with those of traditional finance. From there, Frambot says, it can leverage DeFi’s inherent advantages. With lower infrastructure and development costs (and the inherent decentralization and transparency of DeFi), Morpho hopes to grow from niche crypto lending product to underpin lending operations of brand names in the finance world.  It’s an ambitious pursuit, though if it fails it won’t be for lack of effort. Baffled when asked what he does beyond crypto, Frambot coined the mantra, “Always build Morpho. Always. Always. Always.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Dante Sacco,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/10/reuniting-borrowers-and-lenders-on-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d95b5da71384e72bf3815271aad278be164e71f5-2270x2272.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421243,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsJp,1665405717,How One Scientist-Turned-Founder Is Bridging Drug Discovery With Blockchain,"After years working in labs studying the cell cycle and the genetics of human disease, Gennaro D'Urso founded Genetic Networks, a for-profit company focused on drug discovery. As a teenager, D’Urso lost vision in both of his eyes due to a genetic eye condition. He later received a corneal transplant, which allowed him to regain 20/20 vision in one of his eyes. This event led him to switch majors from business to science, and he eventually received his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics.  During his years of research, he focused on understanding how genes and proteins work together and how they can be identified and cataloged. While many drug companies look at gene targets that have the potential to be effective, he believes that the way drugs are currently tested is often unsustainable and inefficient due to the failure rates and associated research costs.  Gennaro D'Urso is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “Genetic Networks was really driven by … the limitations I saw in the pharmaceutical industry and the way it approaches drug discovery,” D'Urso told CoinDesk.D'Urso decided that his drug-discovery technologies would better function outside of academia. So he created Genetic Networks, where he creates functional profiles of how genes and drugs work. Using applied modular biology and genome-wide analytics, he believes that drugs can be repurposed in a way that is faster, safer and cheaper.  In 2021, a friend introduced him to Bitcoin. He later delved further into the world of blockchain and discovered decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which he believes have promising potential.  Read More: DAOs Are the New Way of Impact Work  “DAOs are not companies … A DAO can function as an accelerator, a catalyst,” D'Urso told CoinDesk.  While stressing that Genetic Networks is not currently associated with any DAO, he believes that the relationship between private companies and DAOs is at point that he has coined a “verge,” where they can function in tandem to discover promising drugs for those who desperately need them.  He believes DAOs could be used to solve some of the world’s greatest problems (“food, water, medicine, shelter”), while still potentially allowing the DAO community as a whole to profit from fruitful discoveries. At a higher level, D’Urso thinks DAOs could enter into contracts with private companies that would allow the funding DAOs to receive a portion of associated royalties.  Royalties in lieu of VC funding could be a promising alternative that gives founders more control, says D’Urso.  “PharmaDAO is just a brainchild,” D'Urso says, stressing that the blockchain world is not his wheelhouse. His primary domain is strictly off-chain, composed of Genetic Networks and the art/science of combining technology with drug discovery. Though newly introduced to the blockchain ecosystem, he has been reaching out to Web3 communities and experts to explain how he sees DAO structures as a good accompaniment and funding mechanism for his industry.  In addition to the possibility of combining Genetic Networks’ systematic drug discovery with DAO structures, D'Urso mentioned that big drug discoveries – and potentially big partnerships – may be on Genetic Networks’ horizon.  Outside of the DAO paradigm, he finds it inspiring that those in the developing world can leverage blockchain technology to gain agency over their finances by controlling their own crypto wallets: “We [those in the developed world] don’t appreciate how blockchain can really change the lives of those who are less fortunate.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Kade Garrett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/10/how-one-scientist-turned-founder-is-bridging-drug-discovery-with-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28d026429d75b1e06c03b9864a85acaec85a36d6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435038,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnmUv,1665399300,Crypto and Payments Firm MobileCoin Launches Stablecoin – ‘Electronic Dollars’,"Privacy-focused cryptocurrency and payments firm MobileCoin, in collaboration with stablecoin platform Reserve, has launched a stablecoin dubbed “Electronic Dollars” (eUSD). The company says eUSD is fully collateralized and is uniquely designed to protect users’ private transactional data.  According to MobileCoin, eUSD is backed by a basket of other stablecoins, namely, USD coin (USDC), Pax dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD). Each transaction is said to be encrypted using end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption. In other words, only the transacting parties can see their own transactional data, thanks to encryption that uses zero knowledge proofs (a way of proving something without revealing sensitive information).  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  The stablecoin eUSD is built on the MobileCoin blockchain, which, according to MobileCoin, is optimized for mobile devices. Apparently, MobileCoin was originally designed for integration with encrypted mobile messaging app, Signal. Consequently, eUSD will inherit the features of MobileCoin’s native cryptocurrency, MOB, although eUSD users will pay transaction fees (a flat $0.0026 per transaction) in eUSD and not MOB.  “To our knowledge, no project has created a native stablecoin with privacy properties, which is a first-class citizen in the ecosystem, and which never requires the use of ‘non-private’ transaction technologies to use normally. In short, no one has yet actually created a private digital dollar,” MobileCoin stated in the eUSD white paper.  How does eUSD work?  The eUSD relies on what seems to be a centralized governance structure where the MobileCoin Foundation acts as the primary governing body. The foundation elects “governors” who are authorized to mint and burn eUSD.  The stablecoin’s collateral is held in a popular Ethereum multisignature (multisig) wallet called Safe (formerly “Gnosis Safe”). New eUSD is only minted after governors confirm an equivalent amount of collateral has been transferred to the Safe wallet.  “Anybody can inspect the contract holding this basket [of collateral], to see what the current balances are. It's a Gnosis safe, which is also one of the most highly regarded contracts on Ethereum for holding assets,” Henry Holtzman, MobileCoin’s chief innovation officer explained during an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Gnosis Safe Rebrands as Safe, Raises $100M  Similarly, if a user redeems eUSD, the token is “verifiably burned” and governors release the corresponding collateral. Verifiable burning is when burned eUSD is sent to a “burn address” that renders it “visible” for transparency purposes, “but unspendable.”  However, everyday users won’t typically engage in burning and minting. An individual seeking eUSD would simply purchase it on an exchange. Approved liquidity providers (LPs) would be the ones minting large amounts of eUSD.  “Individuals have a much simpler experience than liquidity providers. Liquidity providers are creating Electronic Dollars in bulk and individuals are just buying them on an exchange,” Joshua Goldbard, CEO and founder of MobileCoin, told CoinDesk.  Auditing  Many asset-backed stablecoin issuers recruit third-party accounting firms to produce attestation reports confirming the existence of assets matching the stablecoin’s circulating supply. MobileCoin uses a “reserve-auditor” program that performs a similar function.  “We're also standing up an auditor that will let you see for yourself all the wrapping and unwrapping events, and see that the total supply is the same on both blockchains,” Holtzman said.  The reserve auditor connects to the Safe wallet via an application programming interface (API) and verifies that each newly minted eUSD has a corresponding amount of collateral in the wallet.  “We'll release it all open source. So if you want to run your own copy [of the reserve auditor], you can. You can examine it to make sure we really are backed exactly as we claim,” Holtzman told CoinDesk.  Collateralized asset bridge  Since eUSD is backed by assets that exist on other blockchains, a bridge connecting MobileCoin to those other blockchains is required. The eUSD collateral is held in Safe, which is an Ethereum smart contract. Therefore, a bridge between MobileCoin and Ethereum is required to move “wrapped” versions of eUSD between the two blockchains. Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets that are not native to the blockchains they exist on.  Governors approve liquidity providers and bridge operators to wrap and unwrap eUSD as it goes back and forth between the MobileCoin and Ethereum blockchains.  “Every wrap and every unwrap has to be signed by two partners. One of them is the person who is doing the wrapping and unwrapping, [that would be] the financial institution, and the other one is the bridge operator. And so together that way, the bridge operator can't steal, and the liquidity provider can't steal,” Holtzman explained to CoinDesk.  KYC and AML  Although eUSD relies on end-to-end zero-knowledge proof encryption to keep transactions private, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements are said to be in place at all on- and off-ramps.  “All of the on-ramps and off-ramps have full KYC and AML.

42435056,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnmej,1665395019,Back to Square One? Circle's USDC Market Cap Drops Below $50B for First Time Since Terra's Collapse,"Circle's dollar-pegged stablecoin USD coin (USDC) has returned to Earth after seeing impressive growth following the collapse of Terra in May.  The stablecoin's market value has dropped by $10 billion to $46 billion in three months, hitting the lowest since January, according to data source CoinGecko. The decline has more than reversed the rise from $48 billion to $56 billion seen after Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST went bust, sparking redemptions in tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin.  USDC appears to have lost market share to rivals Binance USD (BUSD), the world's third-largest stablecoin and tether. Since early July, BUSD's market value has increased by 21% to $21.66 billion and tether's has gone up by 3% to $68.3 billion.  According to industry experts, several factors, including stability in USDT, Tornado Cash sanctions and Binance's recent decision to consolidate order books, are responsible for USDC's dwindling market capitalization.  ""After Terra collapsed, there was a strong move to sell USDT and shift to quality, USDC, perpetuated by concerns that USDT was also heading to $0,"" Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at Arca, said. ""However, once the fears of USDT collapse subsided, investors began returning to stablecoins with the best market depth, which is usually USDT on non-U.S. exchanges.""  Hansen added that investors concerned with U.S. regulators prefer USDT to USDC and could be moving back to USDT.  USDC's safe haven appeal stems from the transparency of its reserves and due to its issuance being regulated in accordance with U.S. state money transmission supervision. On the contrary, tether's reputation has been long marred by controversy surrounding the nature of its reserves.  Nevertheless, tether withstood the market's stress test following Terra's collapse, with the issuing company honoring redemptions worth billions of dollars. While the stablecoin's peg broke and the price fell as low as 92 cents on some exchanges in the aftermath of the Terra crash, the volatility was short-lived. The stablecoin averaged about 99 cents in June and regained a stable dollar peg in July.  Amey Dandawate, a research analyst at Delphi Digital, said the drop in USDC's market supply could be attributed to crypto exchange Binance's decision to remove the stablecoin as a tradable coin on its platform. With an average daily volume of $20 billion, Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.  On Sept. 5, Binance announced that it would convert all investments in USDC, Pax dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) into BUSD, suspending spot, future and margin trading in the three stablecoins. Since then, USDC's market cap has dropped by nearly $5 billion while BUSD's market value has risen by over $2 billion.  ""Users can still deposit or withdraw these stablecoins, but they will be converted to BUSD for use on the exchange,"" Dandawate said in a note to clients. ""While combining different stablecoins into one enhances liquidity and capital efficiency for traders, it also helps Binance increase the usage of its native BUSD stablecoin over others.""  Lastly, Circle's decision to freeze USDC addresses associated with the blacklisted crypto mixer Tornado Cash may have contributed to USDC's market cap decline.  On Aug. 8, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, saying the application has been used to launder $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its inception in 2019.  Circle immediately froze over 75,000 USDC linked to the 44 Tornado Cash addresses in a tell-tale sign that other stablecoins like USDT, which remain non compliant, may be better at preserving investor privacy.  ""About $4 billion in USDC left the Ethereum ecosystem since the Tornado cash sanctions announced on Aug. 8, and USDC market share on Ethereum has declined by roughly 3%,"" Dustin Teander, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk in an email.  However, all is not lost for USDC, which remains a dominant force in decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""BUSD has seldom been used in DeFi and is not near the top 10 pools of Curve, Uniswap, Aave, etc. USDC usage, however, remains strong. Four of the top five Uniswap pools contain USDC,"" Teander said.

Is it a hidden trap for buyers? Despite the ongoing sell-offs in the crypto market over the past few months, the CAKE token price has offered a steady recovery to its holders. Initiated from the $2.5 mark, The altcoin has shown a direction rally over the past four months and has registered around 82.6% gains. Key Points: The PancakeSwap price action shows an increase in supply at $5, knocking down the breakout rally. The bearish crossover in the VI indicator warns of the support trendline fallout. The intraday trading volume in PancakeSwap is $30.72 million. Source - TradingView CAKE Technical Analysis An ascending trendline has actively supported the CAKE token during the recovery course.

The QNT price action shows the high-momentum uptrend taking a break at the $1155 resistance level due to increased selling pressure. In addition, the price action displays higher price rejection in two daily candles with bearish follow-through. Will this growing bearish influence crash the Quant market price? Key Points: The Quant price action shows an increase in supply at $155, knocking down the bull cycle. The early bull cycle in the stochastic RSI indicator keeps the hopes high for an uptrend continuation. The intraday trading volume in Quant is $118 million.

The Quant market price currently takes a bearish turnaround from the overhead resistance of $155. The present daily candle shows a 2.20% drop in market value, with long-wick formation reflecting a higher price rejection.

According to the statement, TrueFi issued a “notice of default” to Blockwater on Oct. 6 after it failed payment on a $3.4 million loan in Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.  Blockwater’s default seems to be the latest example of the crypto industry’s insolvency crisis. This year’s dramatic downturn of crypto markets, exacerbated by the implosion of the Terra blockchain, has led to the bankruptcy of multiple high-profile crypto firms, such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), crypto lender Celsius Network, digital asset broker Voyager Digital and crypto-mining data center operator Compute North.  Blockwater’s default on its debt came after TrueFi and Blockwater restructured the loan and extended the payment period in August. Blockwater managed to repay $654,000 of its outstanding debt after the restructuring efforts, but eventually missed payment. The remaining debt amounts to almost $3 million.  TrueFi determined that “a potential court-supervised administrative proceeding would lead to a better outcome for stakeholders given the complexity around the sudden insolvency,” according to the lending protocol’s statement.  “While we always prefer to pursue an out-of-court solution with distressed borrowers, in some instances an administrative proceeding is the best option in preserving value for stakeholders,” Roshan Dharia, head of lending at ArchBlock, which manages relationships between lenders and borrowers on the TrueFi protocol, told CoinDesk.  TrueFi remained in “active discussion” with Blockwater, and said that Blockwater’s insolvency does not affect the protocol’s other lending pools, per the statement.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | TUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/10/crypto-investment-firm-blockwater-technologies-defaults-on-defi-loan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5da39339487ab493f745e2872365aee602535712-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Sideways Weekend for Bitcoin as the Next Inflation Report Nears  By James Rubin  Nine days into the usually bustling crypto month of October, bitcoin has yet to find inspiration.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading about $19,400, roughly flat over the past 24 hours and about where it started the weekend. BTC spurted briefly early last week amid encouraging data suggesting that the economy was slowing and inflation might soon lessen, only to plunge below $20,000 as fresher employment indicators suggested otherwise.  ""Bitcoin's failure to breach $20,500 has led to a correction,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. ""Now the bulls will need to defend $19,500 in order to keep chances of a rally alive.""  Ether was recently changing hands slightly above $1,300, also flat from Saturday same time, and the previous day. The second largest crypto in market value has been sharing many of the same daily fluctuations with bitcoin since last month's Merge, the technological overhaul that is leading to a more energy-efficient Ethereum blockchain. The Merge's benefits will occur over time, so ether is likely to continue being part of wider, crypto price trends.  Most other major altcoins were recently trading sideways, with XRP and XLM up approximately 5% and 2.7%, respectively but popular meme coin DOGE off about 2%. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment continues to lag in fear territory, about where it has lingered for weeks.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose slightly.  Stocks  Equity markets ended the trading week in a three-day depression after an upbeat Monday and Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 3.8%, 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively after non-farm payrolls increased by 263,000, a 17% decrease from August, but more than the projected 250,000. Slackening employment and manufacturing indicators earlier in the week had given investors hope of the sort of economic slowdown that would enable the Federal Reserve to scale back its current diet of hawkish interest rate hikes.  Investors this week will be eyeing the latest consumer price index data on Tuesday, which is widely expected to arrive at 8.1%, slightly lower than last month's 8.3% but hardly enough to shift Fed thinking. The price impact of OPEC's decision this week to cut the supply of oil and the after-effects of Hurricane Ian loom in the background. On Friday, the University of Michigan releases its monthly Consumer Sentiment Index, a much-regarded reading of consumer attitudes about the economy. It is expected to fall slightly from last month's 58.5 reading.  Geopolitical uncertainty has plagued asset markets of all stripes in recent months. On Sunday, CoinDesk's Eli Tan reported that Ziya Sadr, an Iranian Bitcoin advocate, was arrested by Iranian security forces last month. The arrest came amid widespread anti-government protests over the state killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, though a reason has not been provided for his arrest.  BitBull's DiPasquale noted warily that if ""support breaks,"" bitcoin could drop below $19,000. However, he added that ""more volatility is expected this month,"" particularly as the CPI report approaches.

For BSC, the outage was the first in recent memory while for Solana, outages seem to be regularly scheduled events. But the problems for both offer reminders that neither is really decentralized, and that they remain far removed from being credible challengers to Ethereum.  Paradoxically, BSC's lack of decentralization appears to be its strength, while Solana's continues to be a weakness.  When analyzing the decentralization of a blockchain, a metric called the Nakamoto coefficient comes into play. First coined by Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, this metric determines just how decentralized a blockchain really is by considering how many nodes must collude to control the chain. Like any conspiracy, the more entities required to be a part of it, the more likely it will fail. So the higher the number the better.  Because of BSC’s relatively small base of validators, the chain’s Nakamoto coefficient is 7.  “It's hard not to presume that each Binance Chain validator is in some way connected or tied to Binance,” Messari’s Wilson Withiam wrote in April 2021. “They each take turns producing blocks in a seemingly predefined order. There doesn't appear to be any stake-weighted mechanism to determine which one produces the next block.”  Withiam’s colleague at Messari, Ryan Watkins, added: “The reason why BSC is faster and more scalable is not because of some magical technological innovation. No, it’s instead the magic of centralization.”  Contagion runs quickly  Certainly, this is a double-edged sword. Because of the lack of decentralization the point of failure that created this exploit could have taken down the network; contagion runs quickly. But at the same time, because of the centralization, a fix could be easily implemented. Binance’s influence over the nodes means that they were all compliant in updating their code to make the fix.  Solana, on the other hand, has seen its Nakamoto coefficient improve over the last year with its increased number of validators as it now stands at 31.  But at the same time, Solana's validators seem to be an unwieldy bunch, often breaking the network. Their lack of decentralization and lack of support from a large entity like Binance means shutdowns are frequent and painful.  Solana’s most recent outage, according to Decrypt, was caused by a validator running a duplicate validator instance. The code should not have allowed this to happen, but it ended up causing an inadvertent fork.  Before this outage, there have been at least a half-dozen other major outages as the protocol struggles with its code.  There’s also the argument that’s been made that comparing Solana to Ethereum with regards to decentralization isn’t right, but rather it should be compared to its layer 1 peers, of which it has a better Nakamoto coefficient.  Regardless, it's interesting to see how the question of centralization versus decentralization doesn’t yield the same results when comparing BSC and Solana. The centralization and support from Binance certainly helps as its scale is much more than Solana’s supporting foundation.
