The main iteration appears to be Algorand's addition of ""stateful smart contracts"" alongside features such as atomic transfers and Algorand Standard Assets that already run on the blockchain's base layer.  Simply put, these ""stateful"" smart contracts increase efficiency by storing certain information in user accounts, rather than its own code, according to a blog post by Algorand founder Silvio Micali.  That efficiency allows Algorand to charge static network transaction fees at low cost and scale faster than other competing DeFi-friendly chains.  ""Until now, restrictions around scale, transaction speeds and high transaction fees have been barriers to mainstream blockchain adoption,"" Algorand said, taking multiple pot-shots at the current DeFi leader, the Ethereum blockchain.

OMG Network can handle thousands of transactions at a third of the cost of Ethereum as a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that batches transactions before settlement, OMG Network CEO Vansa Chatikavanij said in a statement.      Tether – now the third largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $13.1 billion – has become the token of choice for traders. It scores in the top three Ethereum “gas guzzlers” consistently, according to Ethgasstaion.      Adjacently, the cost to transact on Ethereum has grown in near lockstep with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications (dapps) such as Uniswap and Compound.    Ethereum fees on the rise    High growth in both stablecoins and DeFi usage has had adverse results for Ethereum, which settles transactions for both finance applications.      Indeed, on Aug. 13, the average transaction fee on Ethereum broke all time-highs last set during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom.

OMG Network will also be used for withdrawals and deposits on Tether Inc. sister firm, Bitfinex, the blog states.      Batching Ethereum transactions on secondary layers, as OMG Network does, has become the preferred solution to scale the network.

About 21.7% of that amount was minted by renBTC, making it second behind wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) in the market.

Traders In the bitcoin options market don’t expect too drastic a pullback, however, as most strikes are well over $10,000.      Many traders remain bullish despite the recent price drop, seeing the decline as a bit of a respite before rising. “Last year's high was $13,852,” noted Rupert Douglas of institutional crypto broker Koine. “We are going to test that, but whether we have a significant pullback to around $10,000 first is a tough call,“ Douglas added.

The pilot program, offered through the Digital Currency Innovation Lab, a partnership between Hawaii’s Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) and Hawaii Technology Development Corporation (HTDC), marks the return of crypto firms to the state and is the first regulatory sandbox of its kind in Hawaii, according to a statement from ErisX.  Although the DFI didn’t exactly ban crypto when the state implemented the “double-reserve requirement” in 2017 – which required companies to hold reserves in fiat currencies matching the amount of crypto held by their clients – exchanges like Coinbase said ""aloha"" to the state, leaving because they saw the requirement as a costly burden.  But in January 2020, Hawaii introduced a bill that would allow financial institutions to hold digital assets.  In March, the state went a step further to potentially relax the stringent rules for virtual asset service providers by launching the Digital Currency Innovation Lab to address the heavy regulatory requirements and “create economic opportunities for Hawaii through early adoption of digital currency.”  According to ErisX General Counsel Laurian Cristea, following the launch of the lab, Hawaii invited crypto firms to apply for participation in the pilot program.  With the addition of Hawaii, ErisX, which pioneered crypto futures trading in the U.S., is now operational in 49 out of 53 possible U.S. states and territories, according to the exchange.  In a statement to the press, global crypto exchange bitFlyer, whose U.S. affiliate is headquartered in San Francisco, said the ""sandbox initiative marks the return of crypto exchanges to Hawaii, with the ultimate goal of seeing exchanges such as bitFlyer promoted to full licensees in the future.”  The full list of participants includes BlockFi, CEX.io, Apex Crypto, Cloud Nalu, Coinme, Flexa, Gemini, Novi, River Financial and Robinhood Crypto.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/19/hawaii-welcomes-crypto-exchanges-back-with-new-regulatory-sandbox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46267fd1eb4f99a5783601dfb093df680d75736e-1496x840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432550,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaL3h,1597866031,Stablecoin Demand May Drop if Traders Abandon Bitcoin ‘Cash and Carry’ Strategy,"Institutional demand for stablecoins may cool because yield on “carry trades” has been cut in half since Monday.      The annualized rolling one-month futures basis shot as high as 28% at the start of the week on the Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, the biggest in terms of open interest. That was the highest premium since February, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      That premium, however, dropped to 14% in under 48 hours. In other words, the carry strategy, if initiated now and held until next Friday, will yield an annualized return of 14%, down from 28% on Monday.      Carry trading, or cash and carry arbitrage, is a market-neutral strategy, one that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets. It involves buying the asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling a futures contract against it when the futures contract is trading at a premium to the spot price.      See also: Bitcoin Price Holds Below $12K Even as Hashrate Hits All-Time High      The premium, however, evaporates as the futures contract nears expiration and on the day of the settlement, the futures price converges with the spot price. Should futures draw high premiums, savvy traders initiate a carry strategy and lock in fixed returns.      Futures markets usually trade at a premium to the spot market and the spread tends to widen during price rallies. The annualized premium rose roughly from 9% to 27% in the last two weeks of July as bitcoin’s price rose from $9,000 to $12,000 and it remained near that level going into August.      Traders could have locked in an annualized profit of 28% on Monday by buying bitcoin in the spot market and selling the front month futures contract on OKEx. Doing that trade now would still profit, but by only half as much.      The decline in the carry strategy yield could also mean a cut in demand for dollar-backed stablecoins like tether (USDT).      “Stablecoins are widely used as funding currencies and there has been a high demand for these dollar-backed cryptocurrencies from institutions,” Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Indeed, the carry trade has been one of the main reasons for the surge in stablecoin issuance seen this year.      On Monday, the annualized cost of borrowing tether on the decentralized finance protocol Compound was 6.94%. Assuming carry traders borrowed USDT from Compound on Monday, holding the carry strategy until the August expiry, due next Friday, would generate a net yield of about 21% in annualized terms. (return of 28% from cash and carry adjusted for tether’s borrowing cost of 6.94%).      See also: First Mover: Money Legos Turn ‘Exuberant’ as Chainlink Stripped of ‘DeFi’      If the same strategy were executed at press time by borrowing USDT, the net yield would be 6.3%. That’s because the cost of borrowing USDT is now 7.68% and the OKEx futures are trading at a premium of 14%. Put simply, carry trades have become far less attractive. As such, institutional demand for stablecoins could soften, as noted by Skew.      The premium has declined sharply in the past 48 hours, possibly due to bitcoin’s failed breakout above $12,000 and resulting concern of deeper price pullbacks. The decline in premium may have been compounded by increased selling in futures as more traders piled into the cash and carry trade.      Whenever futures trade at discount to spot prices, traders execute reverse cash and carry trade by buying futures and taking a short position in the spot market.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/19/stablecoin-demand-may-drop-if-traders-abandon-bitcoin-cash-and-carry-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0f3709bc372b6554a0cc4ca0102d1194fa3fcec-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaKjh,1597865433,A Former Beauty Queen Raised $12M to 'Revolutionize' Cannabis. The Courts Can't Find Her,"Investors in the 2017 Paragon Coin token sale want their money back, but they can't find the celebrity couple behind the operation.      “The attorneys representing the defendants have withdrawn as counsel,” said attorney Donald Enright, who represents plaintiffs in this crypto-fueled legal dispute. Enright added the defendants “defaulted” by failing to appear in court and respond to the claims.      The Northern District of California decided in the infamous initial token offering (ICO) case Davy v. Paragon Coin, Inc. that token buyers trying to sue the project’s founders may qualify as a class to pursue a collective case. The lawsuit claims the token sale was an illegal securities offering and that buyers are entitled to a refund of their investment or compensatory damages. The defendants’ former counsel, attorney Howard Schiffman, declined to comment other than to say his law firm hasn’t worked with or heard from the accused in “years.”      His counterpart, Enright, said that doesn’t mean the case is over.      “Once we have the class certified we will then seek default judgment on behalf of the entire class for all of their damages,” he said, “for the full value of the Paragon ICO.”      Paragon raised roughly $12 million in digital assets during the token sale, according to litigation filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      The legal saga underscores the lasting hangover of 2017’s initial coin offering (ICO) craze, at a time when token sales are again surging in popularity.    Influencer game    The project appears to have been helmed by Jessica VerSteeg, a former beauty queen from Iowa who went on to appear in reality TV, and her husband, Russian entrepreneur Egor Lavrov.      But the defendants listed in court documents also include a hip-hop star.      Jayceon Terrell Taylor, aka “The Game,” who promoted the Paragon ICO on social media, was also named in the suit. Also named are technologists Eugene Bogorad, Alex Emelichev, Gareth Rhodes and Vadym Kurylovich. Most of the above-mentioned defendants could not be reached for comment by press time.      “Paragon offers everything from a cryptocurrency (ParagonCoin, traded as PRG) to a blockchain solution (ParagonChain) designed to expedite and digitize the marijuana supply chain,” a Forbes contributor wrote in July 2018. “Now, VerSteeg’s latest venture is Paragon Space, Los Angeles’ first cannabis co-working space set to open on September 1.”      It’s unclear if any of the project’s stated plans would have materialized had it not been for legal action from the SEC in 2018.      One of Paragon’s early contributors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he’s not concerned about future lawsuits because the team already obeyed the SEC by paying a penalty fee. It’s unclear whether the full fee was paid because, as of November 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported the Paragon team missed some of the deadlines to pay these fines.      Read more: SEC-Fined Crypto Project Abandons Cannabis Co-Working Venture      Both of the interviewed defendants from the Paragon case were not U.S.-based and said they weren’t concerned about being named in any ongoing lawsuit. As for American defendants and former legal counsel, aside from the above-mentioned Schiffman, their offices were closed due to COVID-19 or they did not otherwise respond to emails and voicemails by press time. In fact, VerSteeg and Lavrov haven’t been heard from since last year.      “As far I know, Egor is not responding to any messages and that’s all I know,” Bogorad, the project’s former chief strategy officer said, having only heard about legal trouble through the press. “I went back to Moscow. October 2017 was the last time I saw him. We were actually asking him [in 2018] about our tokens.”      The couple was still promoting Paragon throughout 2018, although they were rarely responsive to their former colleagues. The SEC fined the entrepreneurs in early 2019. Most of the couple’s old websites and social media accounts haven’t been active since mid-2019, when they posted on Instagram in July from Kiev, Ukraine.      “I think they’re together and disappeared together,” Bogorad said. “Last we heard from them they were visiting the development team near Kiev.”    ICO aftermath    If the class-action lawsuit proceeds, it’s unclear how the courts will find VerSteeg and Lavrov. As for the early contributors who haven’t gone missing, Bogorad says they never intended on starting the Paragon company themselves.      According to Bogorad, a long-time friend of Lavrov’s from Moscow, where they both worked in Russian political campaigns in 1999 and 2000, many of the people listed in the lawsuit don’t consider themselves Paragon Coin’s founding team.      Read more: The Bitcoiners Who Live ‘Permanently Not There’      He said Lavrov invited a group of roughly five people, plus VerSteeg, to a hacker house in California in 2017. They were paid in fiat or bitcoin, with the promise of future tokens as well, but didn’t see themselves as running a company. He said he was merely helping Lavrov with marketing to launch his company. Another team would be hired to run the company after the sale, Bogorad said.      “Once we finished the white paper and the ICO started I helped with the marketing, it was July to August 2017,” Bogorad said. “I wasn’t connected to the Facebook and Google advertising, which was the biggest cost-driver.”      The hacker-house team focused on marketing to bitcoin groups on Facebook, Bogorad said, while two guys focused on customer support and VerSteeg handled media outreach, including promotion with her friend The Game.      In 2017, VerSteeg gave joint interviews with IOTA co-founder David Sonstebo, who said “the beautiful thing about the Paragon project is they are combining the technologies that actually make sense.” When asked about VerSteeg in February 2020, the press team that arranged the interviews said they hadn’t heard from VerSteeg in years and Sonstebo said the IOTA Foundation wasn’t really involved in the ICO project.    'Paragon became toxic'    After the sale concluded, the California hacker house split up, mostly returning to Russian-speaking Europe.      None of the responsive participants in the sale, neither sellers nor buyers, could say exactly how much was raised. Bogorad estimated it was less than $15 million. The sale’s Etherscan data suggests relevant wallets were last active a few times back in August 2019, weeks before Bogorad last heard from VerSteeg and Lavrov.      Read more: After Friday’s SEC Actions, Experts Say ICO Party ‘Is Truly Over’      The anonymous ICO participant, who said Lavrov invited him to visit California for a short-term project in 2017, just like Bogorad, added that he didn’t enjoy working with these token founders and hopes to never see them again.      “Paragon became toxic. I’ve avoided any relations for more than one year,” he said.      The anonymous participant said this lawsuit is “just lawyers trying to spam courts.” He declined to specify which crypto projects he might be using or participating in these days. Meanwhile, Bogorad is still (informally) involved with token projects like Free TON, a fork of the folded Telegram blockchain project that was nixed by U.S. regulators. But he added he’s not a founding member of Free TON, just “highly enthusiastic about the project.”",NEGATIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | IOTA | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/19/a-former-beauty-queen-raised-12m-to-revolutionize-cannabis-the-courts-cant-find-her,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd6264e2eecf8ec6e5a1f04e3025a6faf4a231cf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaLBh,1597863644,The Bitcoiners Who Live 'Permanently Not There',"Katie Ananina is building her citadel, and selling others on the dream.      For the past year, the Russian emigre has jumped among the U.S. cities of Miami, Houston, San Francisco and Denver, plus Puerto Rico, random islands in the Caribbean and Guadalajara, Mexico, trying to find the right location to establish a base camp. It’s part of her lifestyle as well as her job.      Ananina is the founder of Plan B Passport, a business that works primarily with Bitcoiners to obtain legal residency status in their choice of six tax-haven nations. It’s an offshoot of Migronis Citizenship, a resettlement business, which itself has five offices globally.      See also: Kirk Phillips – Crypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These Years      “You go to the butcher that has the best meat, and farmer for the best fruits and vegetables, so do you shop for the lifestyle that you want?” Ananina said, dialing in from Guadalajara in April where she was awaiting an anarcho-capitalist meetup. “If it suits you better to own a passport from a tax haven, why wouldn’t you do that, right?”      While tax avoidance has been around since the first tax was levied, the crypto-rich – empowered by a technology that pays no heed to borders and driven by an ideology critical of all centralized authorities – are bringing it to the next level.      Like its larger parent company, Plan B offers information on “how to legally optimize"" one's tax strategies by moving lives, possessions or assets to the ""best jurisdictions,"" according to its website. Ananina also hosts free 20-minute consultations and the occasional web seminar. Recently, she's been looking for ways to break into the private island real estate market, thinking the nouveau riche of the coming bull run will be able to afford such luxuries.      This open approach to tax avoidance is perfectly legal. And given that multinationals often shuffle money around to avoid paying billions in taxes, you could argue it's normal these days.      “A lot of people are doing it. Like, more than you would think,” Ananina said.      Ronen Palan, an Israeli-born economist and Professor of International Political Economy in the Department of International Politics at the City University London who studies tax havens and offshore finance, agreed it's becoming more popular among the ultra-wealthy, but said it’s difficult to determine exactly how many individuals are eschewing their tax burdens by moving abroad. ""People don't usually identify themselves as tax evaders,"" he said.      “The actual number of people that physically relocate is a small portion of those that avoid paying taxes,” Palan said over Zoom. But it’s common enough for there to be an established term: “We call these individuals PNTs, 'permanently not there.'”      “Wealthy individuals, you find they have three houses, three domiciles, to ensure they are never in one country sufficiently long to become a tax resident,” he said. There's also a growing number of people willing to drop even the pretense of a residence.    Flag theory    At the individual and family level, many of today’s expatriates and tax arbitrageurs follow the obscure advice of the libertarian financial adviser Harry D. Schultz. He coined the term “Three Flag Theory” to describe a strategic approach to life and citizenship where people “plant flags” in different countries based on their favorable tax, regulatory and economic frameworks.      See also: Generation C: Preston Byrne – The Libertarian      Proponents get as many passports as necessary or obtain legal permanent residence status in tax haven nations, offering them the chance to shuffle capital and business documentation around. They become citizens of the world, or perpetual travelers, to maximize their profits and minimize their obligations to the state.      You can have one foot in New York and one in the Cayman Islands and have responsibilities to no one but yourself, Palan said. While the roots to this ""lifestyle"" may be found in libertarianism – Bill Maurer, director of UC Irvine's Institute for Money, called it ""late capitalist nomadism"" – Palan said it's less complicated: ""Many people enjoy the benefits of states. But they don’t like paying taxes.""      Others have taken Schultz's theory and run with it. Frank M. Ahearn, author New York Times best-seller ""How to Disappear,""translated it to ""six flag theory."" Today, it's common to see at least one flag representing an ""electronic haven in cyberspace,"" referring to a country with lenient regulations for maintaining private or corporate servers.      “Considering that the theory was first circulated over 30 years ago, you would think that by now most governments would have caught up with it and closed all the loopholes that enable it,” said Marc Gras, managing director of Far Horizon Capital, a company that works with businesses to relocate. “They have not.”      While western nations continue to fail to close the gaps, poorer countries, primarily in the global south, but also wealthy nations like Monaco are attracting high-net-worth individuals with simplified immigration policies and lenient definitions of residency. The ideal ""haven nation"" will enable visa-free travel with a number of countries, and have limitations on taxing income earned outside their borders. Many have low, or non-existent, tax policies on wealth and capital gains.      ""Countries are literally competing for your wealth,"" Ananina said. It's why she's excited to do the work her career enables.      “I've been looking at my past and feel like my whole life has been preparing me for bitcoin, anarchy and flag theory,” she said. “If I can't be absolutely stateless, I will hold some papers that will help me lead the life that I want to live. I will get as many papers as I can and it's going to give me more freedom,” she said.      Ananina is not alone in her pro-bitcoin, anti-state and very online convictions. One of the Bitcoin network’s earliest advocates, Roger Ver, is also a follower of Flag Theory and an example of living to maximize one’s personal autonomy – understood by having zero debts to the state.      See also: Roger Ver – The Gold Rush Begins: The Day Bitcoin Topped the US Dollar      “Go where you’re treated best,” Ver said during a recent phone call. Ver has been a Kittician, a citizen of St. Kitts & Nevis, since 2014 after leaving the United States for good in 2006.      “From the moment they tossed me in prison, I knew I was never going to live in the U.S. again,” he said. (Ver was convicted in 2002 for selling explosives over eBay.) “The day I was allowed to leave, I left. It took a further eight years to renounce my citizenship.”      He said many of his “cryptocurrency friends” are citizens of the small Caribbean island nation, population 52,441. Though he’s clear “citizen” doesn’t necessarily mean ""his neighbors"" have ever stepped foot on the island. “About two years ago, there were about 100 of us that met up,” he said. ""We spent the afternoon pounding on our laptops in tropical paradise.""      Ver said he gets queried on how to move abroad at least once a week. His advice? Deal with reputable agents “that know the people and the process,"" he said. Speaking from the experience of being scammed twice for “substantial sums of money,"" he said, ""unscrupulous people will try to trick you. ... You want feet on the ground.”      A veritable cottage industry of businesses like Ananina’s Plan B has sprung up to prevent situations like Ver’s.      These businesses work with government's ""citizenship by investment"" units, so people can pay a fee, fill out a few forms and claim their benefits. While the process varies by nation, in most cases, citizenship can be bought for six figures. ""It's not cheap,"" Ver said.      Read more: A Former Beauty Queen Raised $12M to ‘Revolutionize’ Cannabis. The Courts Can’t Find Her      While Plan B Passport is likely the first to cater exclusively to the crypto-rich, many companies view it as a profitable new sector within the “immigration industry.”      Migronis has helped resettle approximately 500 people since August 2012, Martyn Kovalko, head of marketing for the firm, said over email. Of those clients, about 10% came from the crypto community before Plan B was spun out, he estimated.      Far Horizon also boasts early crypto investors, exchanges and initial coin offering (ICO) operators among their clientele, Gras said. While he declined to name names, he did confirm many “have accumulated substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies.”    Crypto links    It’s not difficult to imagine a perpetual traveller holding non-state-backed currencies, or someone into crypto thinking favorably of Flag Theory.      “One could say that the Flag Theory concept and bitcoin (or cryptocurrencies) were both originally based out of libertarian principles such as freedom, autonomy and a disinclination to accept authority and centralized power,” Gras said.      See also: ‘Voluntarily Homeless’ Man Lives Off Bitcoin, Android Tablet and a Solar Charger      The concepts amplify one another. Distributive tools like the internet have led to an interest in the philosophy, Gras said, adding the number of flag theorists “stand at a record high.” And crypto has only made it easier to escape the boundaries of the state. Moving hundreds of thousands of dollars through the banking system is bound to raise an eye, according to Ronen Palan.      “There are various rules, particularly anti-money laundering rules, that have been introduced which require compliance. Essentially, banks have to know who owns the account and the source of the money,” Palan said. “They ask questions.”      But with bitcoin’s “radical ownership,” people can move their wealth instantly without checking in with compliance officers, Ananina said. “You don’t have to worry about selling your assets in the U.S. or figuring out how to move them through the banking system to an offshore account,” she said. “You just pick up ‘calculator,’ move to another country and you have your wealth with you.”    Citadels    While jet-setting may appeal to some, there’s a certain type of Bitcoiner who prefers to stay close to home, building out local systems independent of, and adversarial to, the state.      Justine, who goes by MsHodl on Twitter, is doing that in the Sierra Nevadas, the mountain range straddling the border between California and Nevada. She’s refurbishing an old farmstead owned by her family, with help from her stepfather and mother, and the occasional electrician and plumber.      “I was dreaming of a citadel before I heard the word,"" Justine said. ""Citadel"" is used in the Bitcoin community to refer to an idyllic version of tomorrow where individuals come together voluntarily to work and live off the land. The idea is to build systems that can exist with minimal contact with governments and corporations. When discussing the practicality of building a citadel on an unimproved private island, Katie Ananina said, ""We're anarchists, we do not care about running water.""      Citadels are both the antithesis and corollary of the concept of the “digital nomad” that the larger tech sector has embraced. Bitcoiners build citadels to shield their vast troves of wealth from governmental overreach – and the hordes of no-coiners – but they are also purposefully situated somewhere specific, somewhere worth defending.      While Justine agrees with people who flee the state to avoid their taxes, she said financial autonomy is just one aspect of self-sovereignty. To become truly independent, sometimes it means settling down and building. “Ultimate freedom comes with a lot of responsibility, and taking ownership,” she said.      See also: Jeff Dorman – What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars      The owner of a small business in the United States, Justine says she dutifully pays her taxes. “I work as hard as humanly possible to pay as little as possible, and find every loophole,” she said. “We live in an abusive relationship with the government and taxes are one part of it. But you can’t avoid it when you have something to lose.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/19/the-bitcoiners-who-live-permanently-not-there,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ccc97db97c433f7387aa54521db4293d0562df0-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There will be two blockchain voting pilots in different regions of the country next month. One will be run by Rostelecom, the state-owned major telecom provider, and the other by the Department of Information Technologies, a branch of the Moscow city hall that ran the previous blockchain voting pilots.      The platform by Rostelecom will be used for remote voting on Sept. 13 in two Russian regions, Kurskaya and Yaroslavskaya areas, where the residents will vote to fill the vacant seats at the Russian national parliament, the State Duma.      The system will be based on the private enterprise version of the Waves blockchain. According to the press release circulated Wednesday by Rostelecom and Waves, the system will allow for ""control by all authorized participants of the elections, including independent observers.""      Read more: Russian Voters’ Data on Sale After Blockchain Poll to Keep Putin in Power: Report      However, the nodes of the blockchain will be located on Rostelecom servers exclusively, and for security reasons there won't be a way for independent observers to run their own nodes, Rostelecom's press person Natalia Bakrenko told CoinDesk.      Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov said observers will still be able to watch what's going on: ""All information from the enterprise voting chain will be published on a special portal that can be accessed by anybody. Cryptographic instruments guarantee that the data cannot be tampered with.""      Despite the rough experience of previous blockchain-based voting in Russia, it remains a good business for Waves, Ivanov told CoinDesk:      ""Voting has always been one of the most low-hanging fruit for blockchain technology implementation. It is extremely important for us to participate in launching one of the first large scale projects implementing blockchain beyond monetary applications,"" Ivanov said.    Rough history    Rostelecom announced the further expansion of the blockchain voting experiment in July, after the technology was used for voting on controversial constitution amendments.      The process did not go smoothly. Journalists in Russia reported finding a way to decrypt people’s votes and retrieve personal identification numbers out of a weakly protected service file. After the voting, dark web vendors offered personal data of the voters for sale, although public officials denied the authenticity of the data.      The system was built on Bitfury's open-source Exonum blockchain with the help of Kaspersky Lab, according to CoinDesk's sources, although the anti-virus company did not confirm that.      Read more: Hacker Attempts to Disrupt Russia’s Blockchain Voting System      The first blockchain voting experiment in Russia took place in the fall 2019 during local elections in Moscow. Residents could vote electronically using an Ethereum-based system, which was criticized for weak security.      Blockchain voting has been under the purview of Moscow city's Department for Information Technology (DIT). Now, there will be two parallel pilots, one by DIT and one by Rostelecom.

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Next steps? The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s interpretative letter last month allows banks to provide services to crypto companies and custody cryptocurrencies directly – a sea change that could have been months in the making, writes CoinDesk regulatory reporter Nikhilesh De. It doesn’t appear banks have jumped at the news. However, the letter is just the beginning of a longer process. The OCC will interact with banks on their next steps if they do decide to pursue crypto services. These letters help banks interested in crypto determine if it makes sense for them to get involved in the space, the OCC’s Jonathan Gould said.      BTC in space SpaceChain’s International Space Station-hosted (ISS) hardware secured a bitcoin transfer while floating in Earth’s orbit. Using a multi-signature transaction hardware, the firm’s Chief Technology Officer Jeff Garzik authorized a 0.0099 BTC (about $92 at the time) transfer on June 26, the company disclosed Tuesday. Data can only reach the ISS via the craft's encrypted ground station links. SpaceChain says this adds security and resilience to transaction authorizations.      Prime brokerage Bequant is entering the prime brokerage space by building a crypto exchange, reports CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo. “Prime brokers are facilitators for financing and trading for deep-pocketed institutional investors. While the digital asset space doesn’t have a lot of prime broker options currently, several crypto firms including Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis Trading have announced in recent months their intent to build prime brokerage wings,” he reports.      Token loan Expobank, a former Barclays subsidiary in Russia, has issued a loan using tokens as collateral. Terms were not disclosed, but the loan was made to tax consultant Mikhail Uspensky, who bought WAVES in 2018 for a planned initial coin offering (ICO). The tokens are being held by a third-party notary. Expobank’s dabbling in token collateralized loans comes after Silvergate said it had issued a total of $22.5 million worth of loans collateralized by bitcoin in July. The California bank only started offering such loans to clients in January.      Private nodes Decentralized privacy startup HOPR has released its first “customized HOPR Hardware Node,” which the startup says removes any reliance on cloud servers predominantly controlled by Amazon and Alibaba. HOPR uses a token-incentivized mixnet solution, essentially doing the same for blockchain as Tor (the onion router) or a virtual private network (VPN) do on the internet. The mixnet node combines running an Ethereum node with next-level data privacy.    Quick bites  Riot Blockchain is buying 8,000 more bitcoin miners (Danny Nelson/CoinDesk)  A U.S. Senate report found, among other things, that bitcoin was a factor in Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The pace of development in this small corner of the crypto space can be difficult to follow. Since the end of May, total locked-in value exploded past $1 billion and now sits near $6.4 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.      A whole universe of meme-driven and meta-referential projects have launched, grabbed headlines and filled their coffers. Here’s a quick rundown on a few recent projects.      For instance, the governance token for yEarn.finance (YFI) has shot up over 32,000% in about a month, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports. Investors have dropped $645 billion into the application.      yEarn founder Andre Cronje said the price rise likely came from a combination of scarcity – there are only 30,000 YFI tokens – and the fact traders were using YFI in some of the other DeFi protocols.      While yEarn has delivered an actual product – an algorithm that identifies and executes various DeFi trading strategies – with up to 95% ROIs, many projects are to be taken less seriously.      Spaghetti Money, less than a day old, has already attracted $200 million in its protocol, which features a meme coin (PASTA), no public figurehead or governance model – and which has yet to be audited.      Gamblers on the decentralized betting site Prediqt think Spaghetti will attract a total of $500 million TVL within the first 36 hours.      Finally, Binance subsidiary WazirX, the Mumbai-based crypto exchange, announced it is developing a DeFi product with Matic Network, a blockchain scalability platform.      The project promises an automated money market, similar to the popular Ethereum-based Uniswap, to run on Matics’ “high speed” blockchain. The decision to opt for Matic was influenced by high gas fees on Ethereum, fees which are in part being driven northward by DeFi.    Market intel    Uptrend upturned? Bitcoin’s uptrend since mid-March appears to be running out of steam. “Monday’s breakout of $12,000 was almost entirely short-squeeze driven, and the resultant failure just ahead of larger offers [sell orders] at $12,500 has solidified the price range of $12,000-$12,500 as a key resistance area for an extended period,” QCP Capital said. The cryptocurrency dropped below $12,000 Tuesday, and chart analysis shows signs of bullish exhaustion, according to CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole.    Tech desk    Dust settles “Dust” is the technical term given to trace amounts of bitcoin – usually no more than a few hundred satoshis – that are considered too small to send in a transaction because the transaction fee would exceed the amount sent. The dust settles in a wallet, potentially allowing for nefarious actors or blockchain researchers to deanonymize the address. Dave Jevans, the CEO of blockchain analytics company CipherTrace, said that “hackers may use dusting as a strategy for identifying individuals who can then be phished or extorted.” Researchers and developers are working on solutions, including raising “dust limits” or consolidating unspent UTXOs, each with their own drawbacks.    Op-ed    A new internet Steven McKie, a founding partner and managing director at Amentum Capital, is developing, investing in and calling for others to build the “new internet.” The decentralized web’s development is made all the more necessary considering the privacy leaks, censorship and control centralized internet services exert. “Although the solutions to censorship resistance, lack of privacy and trust are right around the corner, further experimentation and development of the DWeb meme is necessary before the final barriers to the New Internet are sprung open,” he writes.

Arbol provides crop insurance for small to medium-sized farmers or enterprises. Smart contracts pay claims to subscribers when a preset value – such as the average monthly temperature or rainfall – turns out different than the contract specifies, the firm said.      Called parametric insurance, the financial derivative is often used in agriculture to hedge against future events, such as a bad harvest. Other firms, notably CME Group, also offer weather derivatives that require middlemen.      Arbol insurance, on the other hand, self-executes using a mix of smart contracts and Chainlink data – no holdups on payments.      Read more: How DeFi Could Disrupt Traditional Finance, Feat. Sergey Nazarov      “Users are able to create derivatives on the blockchain that pay out based on weather outcomes. This allows weather-exposed entities like farmers to hedge their weather risk,” Arbol said in the blog.

Decentralized weather data    Chainlink pipes data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other sources, the blog states.      Tamper-resistant data is necessary for parametric insurance products that don't require middlemen, Arbol founder and CEO Siddhartha Jha told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Arbol’s application is built on Ethereum smart contracts and also secures data via the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), according to a recent Arbol blog.

42404969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vup,1597841505,First Mover: Money Legos Turn 'Exuberant' as Chainlink Stripped of 'DeFi',"Price Point    It's been two steps forward, one step back for bitcoin (BTC) over the past couple months.      Prices were down early Wednesday for a second straight day after pushing earlier this week past $12,000 to a new 2020 high. The price move accelerated as traders got hit with margin calls on the BitMEX exchange.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      A sell-off on Tuesday didn't fit into any neat investment pattern: The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks rose to a record, in a move widely attributed to the Federal Reserve's trillion-dollar money injections, which theoretically could produce inflation. Bitcoin is seen by many investors as an inflation hedge, but gold prices, a traditional inflation hedge, rose. And the dollar fell, which also should theoretically push up bitcoin prices, since the cryptocurrency is denominated in dollars.    Market Moves    This year's rapid expansion in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been so remarkable that analysts with the Norwegian digital-asset analysis firm Arcane Research are now calling the phenomenon ""exuberant.""      It's been a ""summer of crazy returns,"" Arcane wrote Tuesday in a report. There are plenty of instances, most notably the recent mania in fresh-off-the-run ""yield farming"" tokens like Compound's COMP and the now-kaput YAM. CoinDesk's Paddy Baker reported early Wednesday news of another DeFi protocol, Spaghetti Money, which has no public figurehead or audited code, and it just attracted $200 million.      What investors are now trying to come to grips with is how much of this is real, promising innovation and how much is just crypto traders playing games with experimental DeFi building blocks; the projects are sometimes even referred to as ""Money Legos.""      Entrepreneurs say they're racing to build a better version of banks, trading firms and insurance companies, using blockchain technology and decentralized networks in concert to cut out rent-seeking middlemen; projects are supposedly controlled by ""autonomous"" governance systems. It's all part of the industry spirit, which often seems like it's live, but is still in beta and using real money.  And the sums are getting larger, fast. An index of 11 DeFi tokens created by the cryptocurrency exchange FTX has more than doubled in the past two months. Total value locked in DeFi systems, the most common way of measuring their success, has surged almost 10-fold this year to $6.8 billion, according to the website DeFi Pulse.      As with any hype cycle, there's a lot of room for confusion and loss. The data firm Messari wrote Tuesday in an email that some digital tokens referred to as ""DeFi tokens"" aren't even really DeFi tokens. (See the Chainlink entry in Token Watch, below.)      Eric Ervin, CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm Blockforce Capital, wrote Tuesday that YAM's rise and fall ""should serve as a reminder that when it comes to investing, there is no free lunch.""      And Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics wrote Tuesday that ""my preference, especially in the current crypto market, is to hold onto the more stable store-of-value coins.""      At a time when even traditional markets are now seen by many investors as irrationally exuberant, in the midst of a global pandemic and worldwide recession, it's getting increasingly difficult to sort the productive from the crazy.      -Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    ""Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of lethargy,” the Singapore-based QCP Capital said early Wednesday in its Telegram channel.      The leading cryptocurrency fell below $11,000, invalidating Monday's ascending triangle breakout, which is considered a bullish continuation pattern.      The failed breakout, coupled with the bloated bullish positioning in the futures market suggests scope for an extended correction.      The immediate support is seen near $11,600, which, if breached, would open the door for a decline to $11,000. The broader bullish view remains intact with the U.S. inflation expectations rising to six-month highs.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Bull Run is Slowing – Pullback Now Expected      – Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Chainlink (LINK) rises to record despite apparently not being a DeFi token: The token for the decentralized finance (DeFi) oracle provider has continued its price rally, a 10-fold increase since a market sell-off in March. Searches for “chainlink” as well as the token’s trading volumes have soared. The project’s market capitalization has also surpassed bitcoin cash’s (BCH), now the fifth highest among all digital assets at $6.2 billion, according to CoinGecko. Mati Greenspan, the founder of analyst firm Quantitative Economics, told CoinDesk some investors may be getting in over their heads. And the data firm Messari wrote Tuesday that Chainlink isn't technically a DeFi token because its price-feed service ""in and of itself is not financial in nature.""      YEarn.finance (YFI) skyrocketed on newly poured-in money: Prices for the governance token for the yEarn.finance have exploded since mid-July as investors flooded into the project. YEarn.finance, an aggregator of multiple lending protocols, optimizes for the highest yields for its users through several DeFi trading strategies. YFI holders can determine the overall direction of the protocol. CoinGecko shows YFI’s prices shot up to around $11,275 on Tuesday, an increase of more than 300-fold just since last month. The token’s limited supply – only 30,000 in total – is said to be a factor in the price increase, and YEarn founder Andre Cronje told CoinDesk that traders’ application of YFI in some other DeFi protocols may have contributed to the price surge.      Hive (HIVE) still trading at a premium to Steem: HIVE, the token resulting from a hard fork of Steem, changed hands at $0.269 on Tuesday versus the STEEM token's $0.245, according to CoinGecko. The fight between the Tron Foundation and the Steem community was detailed Tuesday in Decrypt. The acquisition of Steemit Inc by Justin Sun's Tron Foundation triggered widespread anger and fear that Sun might use the acquired Steem tokens to influence the community. The drama led to a hard fork and the creation of Hive.      -Muyao Shen    Analogs - on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. corporate-bond issuance hits annual record of $1.35T in just eight months (Bloomberg)      Volatile currency markets might reflect diversification out of dollar (Bloomberg)      Brazilian, South African, Turkish currencies doing even worse than USD (WSJ)      U.S. Treasury Secretary: ""The president wants us to do more.

42404964,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vpu,1597839701,Barclays' Former Russian Bank Has Issued a Token-Collateralized Loan,"Expobank, the former Russian subsidiary of global investment bank Barclays, has followed Silvergate and issued a loan that uses tokens, in this case, WAVES, as collateral.      The loan was made to an entrepreneur and tax consultant, Mikhail Uspensky, who bought WAVES in 2018 for a planned initial coin offering (ICO). When that fell through he tried staking them, before ultimately deciding to negotiate a token-collateralized loan with Expobank – who, it turns out, was receptive to experimenting with new loan issuances.      The tokens are now being held by a third-party notary. The loan amount, as well as the terms of the agreement, have not been disclosed.      Barclays acquired Expobank for $745 million, months before the 2008 financial crisis. The new Russian subsidiary failed to gain much traction in its home market and the U.K. investment bank sold it on to notable local banker Igor Kim for an undisclosed sum in early 2019.

42404967,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vsr,1597835542,Bitcoin’s Bull Run Is Slowing – Pullback Now Expected,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be set for an imminent retracement as the uptrend that had its origins in March's ""Black Thursday"" crash now looks to be running out of steam.      Singapore-based QCP Capital warned its Telegram subscribers Wednesday that bitcoin was showing signs of ""lethargy"" as it struggled to capture any new highs. Bitcoin fell below the key $12,000 milestone on Tuesday, pouring cold water on hopes earlier this week for a major bullish breakout.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped above $12,400 on Monday, confirming an ascending triangle breakout and signaling a continuation of the rally from the July lows of sub-$9,000.      But the breakout failed to invite stronger buying pressure and prices fell below $12,000 on Tuesday, invalidating the bullish setup. Chart analysts consider a failed breakout as a sign of bullish exhaustion – a slowing of price gains usually coupled with weakening buying pressure.      “Monday’s breakout of $12,000 was almost entirely short-squeeze driven, and the resultant failure just ahead of larger offers [sell orders] at $12,500 has solidified the price range of $12,000-$12,500 as a key resistance area for an extended period,” QCP Capital said.      Bitcoin may have a tough time establishing a foothold above $12,500 in the near term, as bullish positioning in the market is starting to look overstretched, QCP Capital said.      Open interest in bitcoin futures on major exchanges rose to record highs of just under $6 billion on Monday, up 200% from the March low of $1.93 billion, according to data source Skew.      Such bloated bullish positioning often leads to deeper price pullbacks – more so, in cases where it's accompanied by overbought readings on technical indicators. That seems to be the case as the weekly chart relative strength index has crossed above 70, a sign the rally may be overdone.      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, also thinks the rally in both BTC and DeFi-related coins has gone too far. “It's natural that we are seeing profit-taking and weak buying at higher levels,” Thomas said in a LinkedIn chat.      Bitcoin is trading near $11,800 at press time, representing a 3.4% drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency is feeling the pull of gravity after failing to keep gains above $12,000 for the second time in three weeks and may suffer a bigger drop if support near $11,600 is breached.      “On the short-term charts, we see $11,600-$11,700 level as the new key short-term pivot to watch, failing which we will likely get our anticipated retest of $11,000,” QCP Capital noted. That said, the broader outlook will remain bullish, as long as prices are held above the former resistance-turned-support of $10,500 – originally the February high.      A sell-off below that key support looks unlikely as inflation expectations in the U.S. are rising as rumors abound that the Federal Reserve may soon signal tolerance for higher inflation – meaning the central bank would keep interest rates low even if inflation rises above 2% target.      It's probably no coincidence that bitcoin's correlation with gold – the classic inflation hedge – has started to strengthen in recent weeks.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/19/bitcoins-bull-run-is-slowing-pullback-now-expected,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2cec872942d6ca4fe83a06d97e9fe13c76f36ee-1201x688.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is also the first crypto-asset firm to be registered with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, a designation that will soon be mandatory for all companies working in the digital asset space from January next year.  The London-based exchange, which is orientated towards institutions, is now authorized to host offerings, act as a trading venue as well as custody digital securities.  Co-founder and CFO Matthew Pollard told CoinDesk Archax had become a ""one-stop-shop"" for the still-nascent digital securities space.

The upshot from Wednesday's announcement is that institutions will be able to trade digital securities on an authorized market for the very first time in the U.K.  Archax CEO Graham Rodford said the exchange now has 35 issuances in the pipeline.

Spaghetti Money offers staking pools in several DeFi tokens, including yEarn (YFI), Maker (MKR), and Compound (COMP).  Launching 10 hours ago, investors have so far staked a total of $203 million in digital assets into its protocol. Total value locked (TVL) had surged by $3 million just as CoinDesk was going to press.  Spaghetti doesn't have a public team nor has its code been audited. Some of the code for staking rewards came from YAM – another yield farming protocol that went up in a fireball last week.  There's also a native PASTA token – that has no function since there isn't a governance model – that will be publicly distributed through a staking pool sometime in the next seven days.  Spaghetti is the latest in a series of ""meme"" coins that come up overnight with a catchy name and emoji to attract traders to stake millions of dollars into their pools.  There's now a prediction on decentralized survey site Prediqt betting Spaghetti will attract a total of $500 million TVL within the first 36 hours – something it's currently on track to make.  On Twitter, founder Robert Leshner of Compound, the first protocol to experience a yield farming craze, said that if Spaghetti's TVL hits $500 million then ""the industry needs to self-regulate and stop launching these meme farming games.""  The protocol's Twitter account caused confusion after it said Spaghetti was an ETC20 – rather than ERC20 – leading some to think it was launching on Ethereum Classic.
