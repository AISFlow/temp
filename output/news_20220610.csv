42394194,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgVV,1654904253,No One Is Saying 'Crypto Winter' at Consensus,"AUSTIN, Texas — We’ve wrapped up the first full public day of Consensus, and I’ve been asked to share my thoughts about what I’m seeing from the ground. But it’s hard to think of anything more meaningful to say than simply:  Wow.  Woah.  Dang.  For a bit of context, CoinDesk held the very first Consensus event just under seven years ago, in 2015. Attendance was a whopping 500 people.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This year’s Consensus is the first in-person iteration of the conference since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The most recent attendance number I’ve heard for this year’s event is 17,000.  So yeah. Wow. Woah. Dang.  I’ve attended most of the Consensus conferences since 2016, and one point of reference in particular stands out – the infamous 2018 conference at New York’s Marriott Marquis. It was the height of post-initial coin offering mania, and though the mood was beginning to turn sour, the event attracted nearly 9,000 attendees.  See also: US Stablecoin Law Could Actually Pass This Year, Lawmakers Say  That was seemingly too much for the Marriott's space to handle: The registration lines give attendees trauma flashbacks to this day. That grim memory is one reason we made the move to Austin, Texas, where I’m ecstatic to report that I’ve seen no such traffic jams so far despite almost double the attendance.  An even more interesting comparison to 2018 is the vibes, man. The 2018 event came after a brutal market crash, with bitcoin (BTC) trading at about $6,600 during the event (down 66% from the local peak just shy of $20,000 the preceding December). The mood was fairly grim.  This year’s event was also preceded by a market crash. Bitcoin is down 57% from its all-time high of $67,000 set last November. But unlike in 2018, it’s hard to find a downcast eye or frowning face at Consensus 2022.  The convention center is packed with curious attendees hungry for knowledge about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Ethereum scaling solutions and all kinds of relatively arcane, future-forward or speculative matters that don’t have much to do with the current market but could pay off big-time in the long run.  It’s true that markets in crypto are highly tied to sentiment – but for the most dedicated, it’s increasingly clear that sentiment isn’t entirely tied to markets. And that group is growing.  Another notable new presence at Consensus: real, widespread, in-your-face diversity. We’ve been talking for years about how the openness of crypto would make it accessible for a much broader spectrum of people, and we’re starting to see that really happen. As someone who grew up and lives in a multiracial environment, it made me feel particularly great to see a lot of Black folks in attendance, onstage and backstage. No small kudos for that has to go to the efforts of CoinDeskers and contributors including Isaiah Thomas, Tyrone Ross and Spencer Dinwiddie.  See also: Consensus Compared: Why 2022 Feels Different | Opinion  Unfortunately, Consensus’ growth also means more chances for attendees to misbehave. If you want to keep your dignity and reputation intact, you might want to avoid having full-length conversations while watching a panel, sneaking into unauthorized areas to pitch journalists or bringing a loudspeaker to disrupt panels (all behaviors I’ve seen in the last two days).  There’s a lot to gain at Consensus – but there’s even more to lose, if you leave people in the industry convinced you’re a jackass. Just because we have fun and make our own rules doesn’t mean we’re not respectful of each other.  Amid everything else, I managed to moderate a few panels on Thursday at the Big Ideas stage, put together by the Layer 2 features and opinion team. I got to talk about DAO design with Ellie Rennie from RMIT and others, and also had a VERY weird and fun conversation with Chris Gabriel, AKA YouTube’s MemeAnalysis. For those who couldn’t make it or watch the streams of those events, we’ll likely have some clips and write-ups available soon.  Of course, it would have been a whole lot cooler if you’d seen it all in person. Here’s hoping that next year you’ll join us.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42394199,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgq1,1654901918,How the Feds Are Prosecuting NFT Insider Trading Scheme as Wire Fraud – and Why That Matters,"The U.S. Department of Justice last week took an innovative step in applying established criminal theories of liability to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On June 1, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York announced an indictment charging Nathaniel Chastain with engaging in an insider trading scheme involving NFTs sold on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, where Chastain previously worked.  The DOJ trumpets the indictment as the “first ever digital asset insider trading scheme” and follows President Joe Biden’s executive order in March calling for various federal agencies to ensure “responsible development of digital assets.”  Coupled with the executive order, the indictment sends a strong signal for operators of NFT and cryptocurrency marketplaces that regulators are watching.  David L. Axelrod is the practice leader of securities enforcement and corporate governance litigation at Ballard Spahr LLP.  Andrew N. D'Aversa is an associate in the litigation department at Ballard Spahr.  An NFT is a type of digital asset stored on a blockchain that provides proof of ownership and a license to use it for specific purposes. Although the digital objects can vary, a large section of the market involves digital artwork and images. OpenSea permits users to create, sell and buy NFTs on its platform. Creation and transfers are evidenced on the Ethereum blockchain, and purchases are commonly made with ether, a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain.  According to the indictment, Chastain took advantage of the way OpenSea promotes NFTs on its site. Multiple times per week, OpenSea lists “featured NFTs” on its homepage. Featured NFTs usually appreciated in price after appearing on the homepage because of the “increase in publicity and resulting demand.” The Indictment alleges that Chastain knew which NFTs OpenSea would feature on its homepage, because he sometimes, in his role as an OpenSea employee, selected them.  The Indictment further alleges that Chastain agreed to keep these selections confidential and to not use his knowledge of the selections for personal gain.  Read More: US Charges Ex-OpenSea Exec With NFT Insider Trading  New York prosecutors' case  The Southern District of New York alleges that Chastain acted on that confidential business information before it became publicly known. According to the prosecutors, Chastain purchased NFTs shortly before they were featured on the OpenSea homepage and resold them at double, triple, quadruple or even quintuple the price he originally paid.  Chastain allegedly concealed the scheme by purchasing and selling the NFTs from various anonymous accounts and then transferring funds through even more anonymous accounts to cover his tracks.  While the indictment alleges facts and methods commonly seen in typical stock-related insider trading cases, it differs from common insider trading prosecutions in important ways. The indictment charges Chastain’s scheme as a violation of the general wire fraud statute, rather than as a violation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading statute and rules.  Nonetheless, the indictment uses the same insider trading theory commonly found in violations of another statute. For instance, the wire fraud count is premised on a “violation of the duties [Chastain] owed to OpenSea.” In other words, the DOJ’s theory is that the breach of Chastain’s agreement with OpenSea not to use confidential business information for personal gain constituted wire fraud. While insider trading prosecutions require a breach of duty, wire fraud prosecutions do not.  Although the indictment is grounded in the language commonly seen in insider trading cases – e.g. “confidential business information” and “obligation to refrain from using such information”– it stops short of labeling the NFTs at issue as securities. Thus, it appears that the government was concerned that it could not prevail if it brought this case as a typical insider trading case.  If this wire fraud theory proves successful, the DOJ could theoretically use it as a model to police market manipulation for other assets, regardless of whether they are considered securities.  It is curious that there is no companion SEC case to the action by the Southern District of New York. The SEC has been focusing on regulation of digital assets, especially NFTs.  In March, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was probing NFTs and had issued subpoenas related to NFT offerings. In May, the SEC announced that it had doubled the size of its crypto assets and cyber unit. Tucked into the announcement was a statement that the SEC will “focus on investigating securities law violations related to” NFTs as well as other crypto assets and stablecoins. And SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce reiterated that the SEC was focusing on fractional NFT s and NFT baskets.  Read More: Are Crypto Assets Securities?  Are NFTs Securities?  With all the attention and resources lavished by the SEC on examining crypto markets, it would not be surprising if the SEC adopted the position that some – or even many – NFTs are securities. That position would fit its aggressive stance on the regulation of cryptocurrency. It contains echoes of former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s “I believe every ICO (initial coin offering) I’ve seen is a security” statement in 2018.  In fact, it appears the SEC already has asserted that some NFTs are securities. That very assumption forms the basis for its recently issued subpoenas related to NFT offerings. What remains uncertain is not whether, but how aggressive, the SEC will be in regulating NFT marketplaces and, of course, whether its interpretation of the definition of securities as it relates to NFTs will be upheld by a court.  The Chastain indictment indicates that the Southern District of New York will be a partner with the SEC in regulating NFT marketplaces.  Operators of NFT and cryptocurrency markets should require employees, to the extent they do not already do so, to keep material, nonpublic information confidential and refrain from using it for personal gain. Operators should also monitor employee behavior to ensure they are not engaging in insider trading or other manipulative behavior based on material, nonpublic information learned through their employment.  Clear policies and procedures and regular training are also important tools to stop this type of behavior. The absence of an SEC companion case here does not indicate that NFTs are safe from future enforcement by the SEC on insider trading or other grounds.  It is more likely that the SEC believed the facts of this case and the particular digital assets involved did not present a strong claim for insider trading. It appears that not only the SEC, but also the DOJ, plan to aggressively regulate manipulative behavior in digital asset markets.  Although the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rarely invokes the power, it could also theoretically invoke its insider trading statute and regulations to police futures and derivatives of digital assets. This innovative new action by the Southern District of New York indicates that federal regulators are no longer limiting their focus to digital asset securities. When it comes to market manipulation, federal regulators are watching.  Read More: Former Head of Crypto-Skeptical SEC Gets Blowback for Pro-Blockchain Op-Ed  Marjorie J.

42394197,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgkt,1654901698,Consensus Compared: Why 2022 Feels Different,"“History doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes.” So said that great quote machine, Mark Twain.  It seems like the perfect framing for the takeaways from this week’s historic Consensus 2022 festival in Austin, Texas, the first Consensus in Austin and our first in-person Consensus since 2019, following two years of a COVID-19 pandemic-induced online format.  The past Consensus in which I’m seeing a rhyme is that of 2018, which was held in the Hilton Hotel in New York. Until this week’s massive 17,000-strong event, that 2018 Consensus was CoinDesk’s previous biggest in-person event, with almost 9,000 attendees.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In addition to the teeming crowds, Consensus 2018 was notable for some rather flashy, ostentatious displays of wealth. Two Lambos were parked out the front of the Hilton by an entrepreneur who had paid the City of New York an astronomical fee to plant them there. There were wild parties on boat trips and unfavorable articles in the New York Post about crypto bros taking over the city.  The timing of Consensus 2018 was also significant. It took place a few months into what was already being called “crypto winter.” The initial coin offering (ICO) bubble had spectacularly burst, lots of retail investors had lost their shirts, and although the parties were raging, there was a general sense that the gravy train of money that had flowed into the industry was drying up.  That, of course, is where the rhyme with Consensus 2022 exists. This year’s event occurs on the heels of a big sell-off in both crypto and traditional markets, including the contentious collapse of TerraLab’s UST stablecoin. Already people are throwing around the word “winter” like it’s a given.  Yet, as with 2018, the energy of this year’s Consensus feels intense.  Perhaps that’s because the marketing budgets that paid for sponsorships and attendance were agreed to before the meltdown began. Or perhaps it's because the unstoppable underlying interest in crypto, which is now drawing from a much wider pool of participants than in 2018 as it encompasses new concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Either way, what is most striking to me is the optimistic, almost welcoming mindset displayed at Consensus by various crypto old hands who’ve been through more than a few of these down periods.  That view was perhaps best encapsulated by Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and Chief Investment Officer Mark Yusko during an on-stage conversation I had with him, Selini Capital Chief Investment Officer Jordi Alexander and Digital Currency Group’s Rumi Morales, head of venture and growth investing. “Winter is the best time for venture investing,” Yusko said.  His point was that these down periods are when the important development work gets done on projects that matter and valuations are more reasonable. Away from the “number go up” speculation and the hype – with the mainstream press losing interest – engineers and entrepreneurs are able to focus and build.  That’s exactly what played out in last crypto winter, when huge advances were made in DeFi, NFTs and layer 2 blockchain scaling systems such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and the ZK-rollups used with Ethereum.  In fact, many people have told me that 2019 was the Consensus they enjoyed the most. The attendees numbers dropped down to around 5,000, but the conversations were quality, involving project development and the hard but important work of building.  Who knows whether Consensus 2023 will follow a similar pattern. We’re hopeful that it will be even bigger than this year. But this ebb and flow – but ultimately upward trajectory of crypto – is well entrenched, and Consensus’ experience has reflected that over time.  In fact, the very first event, in 2015, which attracted about 500 people was forged in the middle of an earlier version of crypto winter, a period in which prices had been beaten down by failures such as the Mt. Gox hack.  After that, the 2016 event was famed for being the height of the block-size debate and 2017 for the rising buzz around ICOs until it all went pear-shaped early into 2018.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

42415268,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhLu,1654900588,Tesla Board Member Kimbal Musk Says Most DAOs Are Not Actually Decentralized,"AUSTIN, Texas – Kimbal Musk, the billionaire philanthropist and brother of fellow entrepreneur Elon Musk who is now an avid creator of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), says most of these trustless structures are controlled by a few founder members.  Speaking at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, Musk, who last year launched the Big Green DAO, a Web 3 charity focused on food justice, said his research had revealed that most DAOs are not in fact designed to prevent an accumulation of power by a few members – something he has strived to avoid.  “Isn’t ‘decentralized’ in the name?” Musk rhetorically asked the crowd in Austin. “How much do you have to be decentralized to be decentralized? I think the most important guiding light is to have systems in place that prevent the accumulation of power to one person. Frankly, I think most DAOs are designed to allow the founders to maintain control.”  The DOA concept has seen a surge in interest alongside the excitement around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web 3. However, these nominally leaderless organizations and online investment collectives have been jokingly labeled as simply group chats with a bank account.  DAOs, for Musk, must continually be decentralizing in order to avoid power accumulation, which is why the donors and non-profit organizations who get to vote in the Big Green DOA have term limits, meaning they have to give up their place at the table and be voted back in to the organization on a quarterly basis. But Musk said term limits are something that doesn't typically exist in most DAOs.  “I had to feel myself giving up control of this beautiful thing I had spent 1,000 hours working on, and I think everyone should go through this process,” Musk said. “I think we started with six non-profits. I’ve watched them go through the process of giving up control.”  In terms of a progress update, Mush said 10 new non-profits have been brought on board, with a further 86 such organizations slated to be brought on this quarter, out of some 400 applications.  Speaking to the transparency of DAO-based philanthropy, Musk pointed out that normal charities spend 15% on their overhead before a single penny is given out.  “Even if we are not that good, we are probably going to do a better job,” he said.

42415255,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhDj,1654900230,"PayPal's Move to Allow Crypto Transfers to External Wallets the First Step Away From Fiat World, CEO Says","AUSTIN, Texas –— PayPal’s (PYPL) move this week to allow customers to transfer crypto out of PayPal's cryptocurrency walled garden to external wallets is the opening step from a fiat-orientated world to a digital currency one, according to CEO Dan Schulman.  Schulman, who was joined on stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, by PayPal crypto lead Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said that his company is playing a long game with crypto.  “We will instantaneously take your crypto and translate it in to fiat, and you will be able to use that in any one of our 35 million merchant accounts, so we are trying to add functionality,” Schulman said. “But what we just did with transfers is kind of like the opening step as you might think about us moving from a fiat-orientated world to a digital currency one.”  At first glance, PayPal’s long-awaited move is simply the fintech following a trend that includes Robinhood and other crypto apps. But enabling consumers to get crypto in and out of their PayPal wallets also leverages large, disparate networks, da Ponte said.  “Let’s assume there’s 100 million crypto users. The PayPal network that has hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of merchants was related but separated. We built a bridge between this fiat universe and this crypto universe.

42415275,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlUY,1654897818,"US Stablecoin Law Could Actually Pass This Year, Lawmakers Say","AUSTIN, Texas — The U.S. could have a new federal law on stablecoins by the end of this year, lawmakers told attendees at Consensus 2022 Friday.  Lawmakers worry that a lack of regulatory clarity may be putting the brakes on crypto innovation, and the recent collapse of terraUSD (UST) only adds fuel to the fire for those calling for action.  “I'm going to go out on a limb and say we get stablecoins done this year,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who put forward his own bill on the topic this year, told attendees. The audience applauded that prediction.  “We're going to need to have regulatory certainty about that,” Toomey said, citing broad consensus among lawmakers and policymakers on the need for action. “I know the [Biden] administration is interested in doing something in this space.”  While passing a bill in a matter of months is an extremely ambitious goal, especially with midterm elections coming in November, Toomey’s optimistic view appears to be shared across the aisle.  “I think we could do a stablecoin bill between now and the end of the year because it's urgent,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said, although she conceded that under normal procedures generating policy ideas via multiple committees and waiting for a new law “could be a decade.”  “We just had a financial crisis, we just had a meltdown,” Gillibrand said, referring to terraUSD's implosion.  On Tuesday. Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who was also on the panel at Consensus 2022, proposed a bill to resolve issues around crypto’s taxation and supervision.  Read more: Cynthia Lummis: Senator, Hodler  “We just had a disruption because there's no regulation, and it's not fair for the entire industry, to have no guidance or rules of the road from existing regulators,” Gillibrand said.  New U.S. crypto laws could potentially require stablecoin issuers to have proper reserves and disclose their holdings, reducing the likelihood of the kind of market panic that so dramatically led to terraUSD’s collapse last month.  Broader legislation on the Lummis-Gillibrand model would also seek to give issuers greater clarity over who they need to report to, settling a turf war between rival regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Like any law, it would also need to pass the House of Representatives – but there, too, at least some lawmakers are optimistic that this can be pushed through.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) said.  “This summer, you'll see a bipartisan bill out of the House Financial Services Committee on asset-backed stablecoins,” McHenry said. He is the ranking Republican on the committee.  “If … we have a broad agreement on this and the chair prioritizes it, you can see that reported out of committee and voted on the House floor before the election,” he said, meaning talks with the Senate begin in November or December.  “That's a pretty fast clip from a bill introduced, to it potentially being signed into law before the end of the year,” McHenry said.

42394213,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhpZ,1654895049,Tackling the Inflation Misinformation Machine,"One of the most common memes and messages across crypto communities is that deflation is better than inflation, and the more deflationary the asset, the better. Fueling the message to buy these assets is a widespread argument that inflation is out of control and that the monetary expansion that took place during the coronavirus pandemic is directly to blame.  Let’s start with the most foundational error common across multiple crypto ecosystems: the idea that deflationary systems are better than inflationary ones. Bitcoin maximalists tend to hit on this the hardest, but the Ethereum community can be just as bad. Ultrasound.money touts the deflationary impact of EIP-1559 and the coming Ethereum Merge as a good thing as well.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  The theory is appealing: If you have crypto and the rate at which new crypto is added goes to zero or starts to go negative, the value of your crypto should rise. The hidden assumption in there is that demand for said crypto remains the same or goes up. In reality, deflationary ecosystems don’t seem to work very well. And there’s lots of evidence for that, particularly from the Great Depression, when the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the faster its economy recovered.  The reason that deflationary systems cause economic collapse is that if people expect the value of their currency to increase, they avoid spending it and try to hold onto it. This leads to soaring savings (HODLing!) and plunging demand. Conversely, in highly inflationary systems, people rush to spend money. It’s no surprise that central banks aim for price stability overall.  It’s important to understand, however, that absolute price stability is an impossible and unreasonable target. Economies change over time, and prices have to as well. Manufacturing and technology have made buying things ever cheaper, but many services don’t benefit from the same productivity gains. Teachers still look after approximately the same number of kids as they did a century ago, while factory workers can use machinery to churn out a hundred times more stuff. It would be crazy for prices of TVs and education to be identical after all that time.  All things being equal, a little inflation is better than a little deflation. This allows central banks to set interest rates below the rate of inflation, if necessary. If you can borrow money at 1% and inflation is 3%, your effective “real” interest rate is actually -2%. It’s how central banks do airdrops. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to set interest rates below zero.  Read More: Inflation Unexpectedly Reaccelerated to 8.6% in May, Hitting a Fresh 4-Decade High  The second big topic that’s worth addressing is the idea that inflation in Western democracies is some kind of major policy failure or that it’s out of control. It’s neither. Inflation and central banks seem to be performing exactly as intended. Vast fiscal and monetary stimulus saved the world from what might have been a devastating recession at the start of the pandemic. Now, central banks and governments are pulling back. But monetary and fiscal policy isn’t an exact science; the idea that you can perfectly steer the global economy through a massive plunge in services sales, an explosion in product sales as people stay home and buy stuff, and then back to a surging services sector is ludicrous.  A good benchmark of whether this is going well overall, or badly, would be to compare the current pandemic to the last time we had a global market transformation on such a scale with different levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus and huge shifts in demand. The only real prior example of that was the entry and exit from World War II. After the war, the U.S. also experienced a surge of inflation as demobilization shifted demand with great speed from tanks and guns to kitchen appliances and cars.  That burst of inflation was also transitory. Over a period of three years after WW II, inflation peaked at an 18% annual rate before falling back to normal levels. It did not signal the start of prolonged inflation, and nobody now looks back on that as some kind of major policy failure. It was a reasonable consequence of shifting the entire world’s production and demand plan. The fact that inflation in the U.S. seems to have peaked at around 8% makes this transitory adjustment look good by comparison.  When it comes to building our future economy in a blockchain ecosystem, we must not fail to learn the lessons from the past. If we want Ethereum to become the engine of a new global economy (and I do!), and we’d like its ether (ETH) token to become a basic unit of pricing, then price stability, not deflation, is a preferred target. Pushing for ever more deflationary architectures will certainly please the HODLers, but it won’t position Ethereum to become a global economy in its own right.

Mastercard is working with NFT scaling platform Immutable X, Candy Digital, The Sandbox, Mintable, Spring, Nifty Gateway and Web 3 infrastructure provider MoonPay on the new capabilities, according to the press release.  “With 2.9 billion Mastercard cards worldwide, this change could have a big impact on the NFT ecosystem,” according to Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships.  Mastercard recently surveyed a group of over 35,000 people in 40 countries and found that 45% had purchased an NFT or would consider buying one, the company said. In addition, Mastercard found that about half of those surveyed sought more flexibility and wanted to be able to pay with crypto for everyday purchases, or use a credit or debit card to buy an NFT.  The payments firm also said it would focus on customer safety and protecting user data throughout the process of purchasing an NFT.  In January, U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it was teaming up with Mastercard to make NFT purchases more accessible to a broader range of consumers.

42415286,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlbT,1654893026,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Stocks Drop; Analysts See Risk of Further Downside,"Global markets were in risk-off mode on Friday, sending stocks and cryptos lower.  The U.S. consumer price index (CPI), the most widely tracked benchmark for inflation, rose 8.6% on a year-over-year basis in May, topping expectations that it would decline to 8.2% from April's 8.3%. That triggered a $500 price drop in BTC earlier in the New York trading day.  Typically, investors reduce their exposure to risk during times of rising inflation, which is not just a U.S. issue. The median global inflation rate is now 7.9% year over year, versus 3.05% last June, according to Deutsche Bank. ""The shock value from U.S. inflation has lessened even if today's print was pretty shocking in itself,"" the bank wrote in a research note.  The S&P 500 also declined on Friday, while gold, a traditional safe haven ticked higher. The 10-year Treasury yield returned above 3% as investors continued to position themselves for rising interest rates.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down by 4% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 6% drop in ether (ETH) over the same period. Most alternative cryptos (altcoins), which are deemed to be riskier, underperformed bitcoin on Friday. That suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $29,080, −3.08%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,677, −6.08%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,901, −2.91%    ●Gold: $1,876 per troy ounce, +1.46%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.16%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index returned to ""extreme fear"" territory, reversing a slight uptick over the past few days. Bearish sentiment has been a persistent theme over the past few months, which has kept some crypto buyers on the sidelines.  For now, technical indicators show short-term deterioration in bitcoin's price action, similar to equities. ""For bitcoin, risk now appears heightened of a retest of long-term support around $27,200, noting intermediate and long-term momentum gauges point to more downside,"" Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, wrote in an email.  Bitcoin faces lower support at $25K-$27K  Bitcoin declined from the $33,000 resistance level last week, which indicates a loss of upside momentum. That lowers the chance of a prolonged relief rally.  BTC is roughly flat over the past week and has been confined to a choppy trading range. Initial support is seen at $25,000, which is near the May 12 price low.  Momentum on the daily chart has weakened over the past few weeks, suggesting BTC's downtrend from November of last year could continue over the short term. A downtrend is defined by lower price highs and lower price lows.  Secondary support is at the 200-week moving average, currently at $22,294. Still, a sharp price decline could eventually stabilize at $17,673, which is a 78% retracement of BTC's prior uptrend from March 2020 to November 2021.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is oversold, which means selling pressure could subside over the next few weeks.  Oversold readings do not indicate a definitive price low, however, especially within the context of a downtrend. Rather, adding a short-term momentum overlay to the 14-week RSI can help determine when oversold signals give way to a potential trend reversal, similar to what occurred in April 2020 and August of last year.  The chart below shows when the RSI's downside momentum reverses to the upside, or when the red shaded areas turn gray.  At this point, a majority of momentum indicators remain bearish.  Altcoin roundup  Altcoins nosedive after CPI data: Major altcoins fell sharply in tandem with bitcoin as the consumer price index (CPI), the most widely tracked benchmark for inflation, rose 8.6% on a year-over-year basis in May to a new 40-year high, topping expectations that it would decline.

During the launch of a native OP token for Optimism&apos;s DAO, a hacker took advantage of a company error and stole 20 million tokens. It seems like the hacker has had a change of heart, as blockchain data from Etherscan shows that the tokens were sent back in 17 separate 1-million transactions yesterday. The attacker also sent one million OP tokens to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The attacker now has 2 million OP tokens in their custody after sending 18 million tokens to Optimism and Buterin. About 1 million of these tokens have been exchanged for ETH and sent to Tornado Cash for mixing. The Optimism Foundation has revealed in a post on Twitter that the 2 million tokens that have not been returned are now a bounty that will be paid back by Wintermute. In addition to this, it stated that it was currently working to retrieve the one million tokens that were sent to Vitalik Buterin. How Did The Attack Happen? The hacker gained control of the tokens due to an error between Optimism and Wintermute, a crypto market maker contracted to distribute the 20 million OP tokens. The wallet address Wintermute used to receive the tokens was inaccessible because of a layer-1 and layer-2 issue between the two companies.

The 24-hour trading volume of Pax Gold is $29 Million, indicating a hike of 33%. Past Performance of PAXG PAXG prices show a bullish reversal from the $1800 mark with lower price rejection avoiding a closing below $1800.

42394208,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhPv,1654888107,Why Terra’s Fall Offers a Unique Opportunity to Create a Better Stablecoin Environment,"No topic in the crypto world has been more prominent in recent weeks than stablecoins. Investors, regulators and crypto service providers, among others, wonder what the future holds for them. As stablecoins have a combined market capitalization of easily over $100 billion, there’s much at stake.  Stablecoins are a cornerstone of the crypto industry. But following the recent troubles of terraUSD's (UST) stablecoin, one of the most widely used algorithmic stablecoins, trust in these assets has eroded.  Changpeng Zhao is CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which offers a stablecoin. Zhao is a speaker at Consensus 2022.  The effects of UST's depegging from the U.S. dollar have been reported widely, but a vast amount of misinformation is circulating.  Stablecoins have been among the most revolutionary aspects of the crypto ecosystem. They’ve empowered the unbanked and created a semistable space in an incredibly volatile industry. Stablecoins have also established common ground between central banks, regulators and decentralized players.  Nevertheless, we need to stay grounded. Through informed decision-making, users can reduce their exposure to the wild risks seen with Terra. So while the current atmosphere may seem hostile, we have a unique opportunity to show the world that secure, regulated stablecoins exist.  Why stablecoins are essential  Stablecoins are incredibly important in the crypto ecosystem. Whether you're a simple ""HODLer"" investing spare change or a veteran trader, you can find a need for stablecoins.  For many in the crypto world, remembering a time without stablecoins is difficult. Creating a successful way to maintain stable value without off-ramping into fiat was revolutionary. Exiting a position into fiat currency can take days and increase costs. With this in mind, keeping value stable and on-chain in a trusted way can hugely improve liquidity.  Read More: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  Stablecoins also bring vital financial services to the unbanked and sufferers of rampant inflation. Rising consumer costs must no longer devour your savings when you can maintain their value with a reputable stablecoin. Closely related are remittances, as family and friends can cheaply and almost instantly transfer money globally with a stablecoin.  Don’t underestimate stringent requirements  I've often encountered the mindset that stablecoins offer a crypto panacea. The top 10 coins and tokens by market capitalization have always maintained a significant stablecoin presence. They've even provided ways to earn tempting, high annual percentage yields (APYs) in the crypto world with a stable asset. It almost sounds too good to be true.  But as we've seen with Terra, the house of cards can quickly collapse. The benefits of stablecoins are immense, but they can be doomed to fail without responsible, regulated mechanisms to support them. To me, there are several issues at play here, and they don't all involve the stablecoin issuer.  First, I want to discuss a crucial point many people don't understand: Not all stablecoins operate with the same principles.  Reserves-backed stablecoins  Most large stablecoins available are reserves-based. Some coins, like Binance USD (BUSD), maintain cash reserves that are periodically attested, regulated and guaranteed. Others hold various assets, including commercial paper, bonds and crypto. Even within this category, the ratio of reserves to issued coins can be a contentious topic.  For full stability, a reserve level of 100% should also be maintained. Of all available options, reserves-backed stablecoins typically provide the most user security.  Algorithmic stablecoins  Another commonly used model is algorithmic-based. You'll likely have heard the term recently, as this was terraUSD's (UST) operating model. These coins have little or no collateral backing and use algorithms to incentivize investor behavior. By affecting market demand and supply, an algorithmic stablecoin attempts to maintain its peg.  Terra, for example, tried to peg each coin to the U.S. dollar by being transferable at a 1:1 rate with $1 of LUNA. Converting 1 UST to $1 of LUNA and vice versa would burn the coin you provided, effectively manipulating supply.  Even with the brief description, the cracks are already visible. Pegging to the U.S. dollar through a seigniorage mechanism with your own token is a dangerous position. Acting like a central bank may look tempting, but we already know the limits their real-life counterparts have.  Terra exposed the algorithmic method's flaws  Many people in the crypto industry understood the Terra model’s limitations even before the protocol’s crash. Now Terra’s vulnerabilities are more widely known.  Terra printing money like the Federal Reserve didn't create value; it diluted it for existing holders. Having a small number of reserves also made repegging the stablecoin difficult at best. Also, tempting 20% APY returns on Anchor staking incentivized demand for a stablecoin that had little backing in value.  How did we get to where we are today?  So with these flaws visible, why was everyone jumping on the Terra train? Consider the following reasons. There was a general misunderstanding. I often wonder if many Terra investors understood what was maintaining its peg and generating such high APYs. As with any investment, you should always fully understand what you're investing in and how it works. To me, education plays a huge role in ensuring this never happens again.  Investors dreamed of creating quick monetary value. Some crypto enthusiasts have critiqued the traditional central bank model and derided it for its inflationary practices. However, when given a chance to operate like a central bank themselves, the blockchain community forgot the lessons from years of economic history, leading to an unsustainable tokenomic model with flawed incentives.  The community overlooked the importance of regulation. While many crypto enthusiasts see regulation as a foe, it can actually be a friend. To me, the recent Terra situation shows how unregulated stablecoins can dramatically fail without regulation.  The importance of regulatory cooperation  The regulatory process is not perfect and must change. The relationship between regulators and stablecoin issuers must develop and grow.  An existential fear of stablecoins?  A number of media pundits have inferred that central banks, governments and regulators view digital assets pegged to fiat as an existential threat. This is a misperception. The security of these institutions’ national fiat currencies and sovereignty isn’t at risk. However, this sentiment may have led to a scramble to create central bank digital currencies (CBDC), heightened fears about stablecoins and pushed stablecoin projects out of the market.  Stablecoin fear is misguided  Much of this fear is, however, misguided. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many provide a superior experience through sound reserves, oversight and attestations. A 100% reserve-backed stablecoin is easier for a regulator to stomach than an algorithmic one creating dollar value out of nothing.  Regulators need support to alleviate any fears  As much as regulators may worry about the outcome, the reality is that properly managed stablecoins currently aren't a threat to financial stability.  Read More: The Collapse of UST and LUNA Was Devastating, but There Is Still Hope for Crypto  The crypto community must be willing to engage with regulators, educate them and demonstrate responsible stablecoin models to foster a better understanding. We must also be mindful of regulators’ concerns and learn from their years of financial experience.  How can we all work together?  As an industry, we can begin to ease regulatory concerns by encouraging a broader debate. While financial stability is essential, it's not the only factor at play here. Greater consumer choice, competition and innovation will improve the stablecoin experience for all stakeholders.  With innovation and competition come new players in the market, but a natural aversion to change can leave regulators reluctant to work with new market entrants. So far, we've seen an approach that tends to prioritize those legacy winners deemed “too big to fail.” This has led to the protection of incumbents in the name of stability. Often, newcomers provide a broader perspective on various topics that regulators have in their sights, including financial crime, financial stability, market integrity and consumer protection.  Real-deal stablecoins already exist  So what's the ideal situation for a stablecoin? As we already covered, the most reliable stablecoin is fiat-backed. Taking this further, reserves should back the issued asset 100%, be attestable and maintained in cash or cash equivalents. Finally, we can't forget the role of regulators in ensuring these assets maintain high financial standards and provide appropriate backing.  USDP from Paxos is one example that meets all our criteria. It holds monthly attestations of its reserves and guarantees users can always switch between USDP and USD at a 1:1 rate. USDP also has a regulated status through the ​​New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  To ensure we provided the same safeguards with BUSD, we chose Paxos as our issuance partner. This cooperation provides BUSD holders with the same benefits USDP offers:  A 1:1 secure and compliant USD-backed stablecoin regulated by the NYDFS.  Actual cash and cash equivalent reserves consisting of 96% cash and 4% U.S. Treasury bills.  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insurance. If BUSD is compromised, the reserves are insured and safe. Users don't need to worry about losing any value on their BUSD holdings.  Monthly attestation of the reserves. These reports independently verify the entire BUSD token supply is backed by fiat in U.S. banks held and managed by Paxos.  Read More: Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference?  Let’s make the most of this period of reflection  Terra's situation has profoundly affected the crypto industry in value, trust and reputation. Nevertheless, there is a great opportunity to build back stronger. During the current correction, we have time to develop real applications as a basis for solid growth rather than high APY pipe dreams.  Regulators are even keener to further their dialogue with stablecoin issuers. In a way, the market has separated exceptional from lesser models. We can be thankful for that.  Crypto has developed at such a rapid speed that regulation is still fragmented and lacks harmonization. The situation constantly evolves, and so does our approach to meeting all new requirements.  When it comes to stablecoins, we're proud to lead the way in regulation through BUSD. We're also happy to show the whole industry how they can responsibly issue stablecoins. The recent crash and Terra situation have created an opportunity for us all to cooperate, learn and educate one another. Let's not miss this chance to nurture true stablecoins that regulators and users can rely on and deserve.  Read More: Terra Snapshot Expected This Week.

42415278,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlWR,1654886627,Jack Dorsey’s TBD Announces Web 3 Competitor: Web5,"AUSTIN, Texas — Jack Dorsey’s beef with Web 3 has never been a secret. In his view, Web 3 – blockchain boosters’ dream of a censorship-resistant, privacy-focused internet of the future – has become just as problematic as the Web 2 which preceded it.  Now, he’s out with an alternative.  At CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival here in Austin, TBD – the bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Dorsey’s Block (SQ) – announced its new vision for a decentralized internet layer on Friday. Its name? Web5.  TBD explained its pitch for Web5 in a statement shared with CoinDesk: “Identity and personal data have become the property of third parties. Web5 brings decentralized identity and data storage to individuals’ applications. It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.”  While the new project from TBD was announced Friday, it is still under open-source development and does not have an official release date.  A play on the Web 3 moniker embraced in other corners of the blockchain space, Web5 is built on the idea that incumbent “decentralized internet” contenders are going about things the wrong way.  Appearing at a Consensus panel clad in a black and bitcoin-yellow tracksuit emblazoned with the numeral 5, TBD lead Mike Brock explained that Web5 – in addition to being “two better than Web 3” – would beat out incumbent models by abandoning their blockchain-centric approaches to a censorship-free, identity-focused web experience.  “This is really a conversation about what technologies are built to purpose, and I don’t think that renting block space, in all cases, is a really good idea for decentralized applications,” Brock said.  He continued: “I think what we’re pushing forward with Web5 – and I admit it’s a provocative challenge to a lot of the assumptions about what it means to decentralize the internet – really actually is back to basics. We already have technologies that effectively decentralize. I mean, BitTorrent exists, Tor exists, [etc].”  Web 2 + Web 3 = Web5  Web5’s monetary layer will be built on the foundation of Bitcoin. This is unsurprising, given Dorsey’s outspoken Bitcoin “maximalism.” The other technologies underpinning Web5 are borrowed from myriad areas of cryptography and computer science.  Web5, like Web 3, will enable users to interact with one another without intermediaries. This, in theory, means no threat from government censors or centralized service outages, among other supposed advantages.  Similar to other attempts to create a decentralized layer on top of the web, Web5 will also aim to provide users with a “decentralized identity” allowing them to seamlessly move from application to application without needing to explicitly log in. User data, rather than getting stored with third-party products and services, will be controlled by users and only be exposed with their permission.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/jack-dorseys-tbd-announces-web-3-competitor-web5,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5817563f446db5176217f39ac7a4eb4a83167075-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Friday at Consensus 2022, the Abra Crypto Card will allow users to earn back crypto on any purchase, no matter the amount or category. Cardholders can choose from any of the more than 100 cryptocurrencies supported on the Abra platform, with no annual or foreign transaction fees. The card will also come with Amex Offers for shopping, travel, dining and services as well as presale ticket access and purchase protections.  “This has been a long time coming and is the first American Express crypto product,” said Abra CEO Bill Barhydt in an interview with CoinDesk. “Amex retail offers from hundreds of merchants are integrated into the app with the whole fraud and purchase protection all integrated with the Abra wallet.”  Crypto credit cards of some sort have been around for a long time in crypto, said Barhydt, but what makes this Amex-Abra tie-up of particular interest is the upscale clientele of the two companies.  “If you look at our client base and where the money is for us, it skews toward our private client business, which is upper-middle class to extremely wealthy, where they have six to eight figures worth of crypto with Abra,” he said. “That group has a natural affinity and overlap with American Express.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/american-express-adds-first-crypto-product-with-abra-rewards-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0d7a47825cdabf706f0991a64325e509bca51ce-1600x1091.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, said that storing crypto anonymously outside of regulated venues allowed people to bypass sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.  “We're working to address the unique risks associated with unhosted wallets,” Adeyemo said during an onstage interview Friday, warning that current arrangements allow inadvertent transactions with criminals or sanctioned individuals.  Read more: Joe Biden’s Crypto Executive Order Is a Symbol  “Unhosted wallets are effectively just addresses on a blockchain,” he added. “It can be difficult to determine who really owns and controls them, creating opportunities to abuse this heightened anonymity.”  Enforcing ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) identity checks on the owners of private wallets was first proposed by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin back in 2020, but the proposal has been repeatedly postponed under the Biden administration – while parallel moves in the European Union have raised hackles in the industry for crimping innovation and privacy.  ""I understand and respect the need for and the desire for privacy, but we need to make sure that we're also in a place where we're not creating avenues where those who want to move funds illicitly are able to use digital assets more than traditional assets,"" Adeyemo said.  The idea that crypto payments could evade sanctions placed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine has only heightened the stakes, but officials are promising to work with the sector, not against it.  Read more: The Unhosted Crypto Wallet Rule Is Back  “The only way that we can stop illicit actors from operating … [is] in partnership with investors and with innovators,” Adeyemo said, vowing to ensure that “responsible actors in the space are the partners of government, rather than working in opposition to us, or feeling as if our rules don't give you the room to innovate in a way that helps us solve these problems.”  He gave few clues about how that might work, saying, “I'm not gonna get ahead of our rule-making process,” but promised it would be flexible enough to work with an industry that changes from year to year.  “We have not seen that crypto has been the main avenue of evasion” of Russian sanctions, he said. “But where we do see it, we're going to go after it.”  Read more: Fed Chair Powell: 'War Underscores Need' for Crypto Regulation",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/10/unhosted-crypto-wallet-rules-will-allow-innovation-us-treasury-official-vows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d394cf39589ff4ac4f881ec161bfdfc790690d12-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funds were returned to an address belonging to Optimism, the Ethereum rollup provider, over the course of 17 transactions.  ""We see today’s news as a very positive development,"" Wintermute founder and CEO Evgeny Gaevoy told CoinDesk. ""The Optimism foundation has been made whole and can focus on building and growing the ecosystem. The person who discovered the exploit chose to wear a white hat, setting a good precedent for the whole crypto community.""  According to a tweet from Optimism, 2 million tokens were retained by the attacker as a bounty.  Before returning the tokens, the attacker sent an on-chain message to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stating their willingness to return the full 18 million OP in their possession.  “Hello, Vitalik, I believe in you, just want to know your opinion on this. BTW, help to verify the return address and I will return the remaining after you.     Previously, the attacker cashed out 1 million OP and sent an additional 1 million to Buterin, who is working to return the funds according to Optimism. At press time, 1 million tokens, worth close to $900,000, remained in the attacker’s wallet, blockchain data shows.  Optimism is a layer 2 rollup chain for Ethereum that helps scale the network with its quick transactions and low fees. It launched the OP governance token last month in a bid to shift towards greater community control.  The attacker managed to get a hold of OP tokens that were supposed to go to Wintermute, a crypto market maker that partnered with Optimism for “liquidity provisioning services” in the run-up to the token’s introduction. Trouble came when Wintermute mistakenly provided Optimism with an Ethereum address, rather than an Optimism address, to receive the loaned-out funds.  Before Wintermute could retrieve the funds, the attacker set up their own wallet at the address where Optimism sent the 20 million tokens.  In a statement released two days ago, Wintermute said it would not pursue legal action against the attacker if the funds were returned within a week.  ""Wintermute, while having to accept the bounty as a loss, can now fully focus on providing liquidity for the OP token,"" Gaevoy told CoinDesk on Friday.

42415290,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRldz,1654867803,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Slips Below $30K as Inflation Hits New Four-Decade High,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin fell below $30,000 after May inflation unexpectedly rose to 8.6%, Helene Braun reports.  Market Moves: Some crypto traders are still getting wiped out – ""rekt"" as it were – from margin calls on Terra-related tokens, including luna classic (LUNC) as well as the newly issued LUNA replacement tokens, Shaurya Malwa reports.  Price Point  By Helene Braun  The consumer price index (CPI), the most widely tracked benchmark for inflation, rose 8.6% on a year-over-year basis in May, topping expectations that it would decline to 8.2% from April's 8.3%. The core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – rose 6% year-over-year in May, dipping from April's 6.2%, but more than expectations for a 5.9% increase.  On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 1% in May, ahead of expectations for a gain of 0.7%, and more than tripling April's 0.3% advance. The core rate rose 0.6% in May, flat from April, but higher than expectations for an 0.5% increase.  The unexpected fresh four-decade high of 8.6% in headline inflation is problematic for monetary policymakers who are in the middle of a rate hike cycle, but may have been eyeing a pause at some point later this year. Now the question may be whether the Federal Reserve needs to raise rates by 75 basis points per meeting, rather than the planned 50 basis points.  Bitcoin (BTC) – which along with nearly all assets has taken a major hit as central banks in Western countries have begun tightening monetary policy over the past few months – dipped to $29,500 from $30,000 in the minutes after the report. It remains off by about 65% from its all-time high hit last November.  Link to full story: Inflation Unexpectedly Reaccelerated to 8.6% in May, Hitting a Fresh Four-Decade High  Market moves  Terra’s Luna, Luna Classic Tokens See Volatile Trading Amid New Developments - by Shaurya Malwa  Tokens related to the Terra ecosystem saw volatile trading in the past 24 hours amid legal developments against issuing company Terraform Labs, data shows.  The price of luna (LUNA) gained as much as 30% from $2.65 on Thursday to $3.44 on Friday morning, and then fell steeply even as the broader crypto market remained flat. Luna classic (LUNC) gained as much as 34% before sliding Friday morning, data from CoinGecko shows.  Such volatility arose amid reports of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigating whether Terraform Labs violated U.S. laws regarding how it marketed its tokens.  Futures tracking the two tokens saw nearly $18 million in liquidations while losses on futures of other major cryptos apart from bitcoin and ether remained under the $3 million mark.  The LUNA was issued to holders in late May following the depeg of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in early May – a move that saw the value of old Luna (now rebranded as LUNC) fall as much as 99.7%.

42415285,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlaD,1654865805,"Inflation Unexpectedly Reaccelerated to 8.6% in May, Hitting a Fresh 4-Decade High","The consumer price index (CPI), the most widely tracked benchmark for inflation, rose 8.6% on a year-over-year basis in May, topping expectations that it would decline to 8.2% from April's 8.3%. The core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – rose 6% year over year in May, dipping from April's 6.2%, but more than expectations for 5.9%.  On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 1% in May, ahead of expectations for a gain of 0.7%, and more than tripling from April's 0.3% advance. The core rate rose 0.6% in May, flat from April but higher than expectations for 0.5%.  The unexpected fresh four-decade high of 8.6% in headline inflation is problematic for monetary policymakers who are in the middle of a rate hike cycle but may have been eyeing a pause at some point later this year. Now the question may be whether the U.S. Federal Reserve needs to raise rates by 75 basis points per meeting rather than the planned 50 basis points.  Bitcoin (BTC) - along with nearly all assets – has taken a major hit as western central banks have begun tightening monetary policy over the past few months. BTC has dipped to $29,500 from $30,000 in the minutes after the report. It remains off by about 65% from its all-time high hit in the fourth quarter of 2021.  “There are certainly positive signs that would indicate the worst [on inflation] is behind us,” said Jonathan Silver, founder and CEO of Affinity Solutions, a global insights firm tracking consumer purchasing habits.  “The job market remains strong, which is putting money in people’s pockets. However, price increases are still outpacing people's paychecks. Hopefully, this trend will reverse itself as inflation reaches its peak and begins to dissipate. Our purchase spending data suggests that this is the direction we are headed,” he said.  Friday’s inflation report is the last major economic indicator that the Fed sees before its next meeting June 14-15, at which time the central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark federal funds rate by another 50 basis points, in what would be the third rate hike this year.  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic hinted in late May about the possibility of pausing rate hikes in September if inflation moves in the right direction. That was seemingly shot down by Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard days later, who said it’s “very hard to see the case” for any pause in the tightening cycle.  “If we do begin to see a reduction in the CPI number as expected I do think we will see that reflect well within all markets signaling that the tide is beginning to flow in the correct direction and we should see some more risk on investment come back to the markets with both BTC and total market seeing some increased volumes and price action,” Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy said. “A negative number would cause a much bigger downside event than the expected or even a slightly better than expected number has to the upside.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/10/inflation-unexpectedly-reaccelerated-to-86-in-may-hitting-a-fresh-four-decade-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ab52e5d0840a1d322dca11a421409654503a6fe-4897x3428.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415288,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlcj,1654860536,"Bitcoin Sees Weakness Ahead of CPI Report; Cardano, Solana Lead Fall in Major Cryptos","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered at just under $30,000 during European trading hours, showing signs of weakness ahead of the release of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report Friday.  The asset has traded in a relatively tight range of $28,000 to $31,000 over the past month amid a poor macroeconomic market sentiment and systemic risks in the crypto sector.  Price charts suggest bitcoin could drop to a support level of $29,400 over the weekend if current levels fail to hold. The asset has bounced several times from those levels over the past week, suggesting interest from buyers at those prices.  Friday saw weakness in several major cryptos, with Cardano’s ADA tokens falling 7% in the past 24 hours to lead losses among major tokens. Solana’s SOL fell 6%, ether (ETH) lost 2.3% and XRP fell 0.8%.  Overall, crypto market capitalization dropped by 2.3% to $1.28 trillion, continuing a slide from a capitalization of over $2.2 trillion in March.  The fall in crypto prices came ahead of the release of the CPI report scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET Friday. Economists expect inflation in May to rise over 0.7% from April, meaning an 8.3% rise since May of last year, according to CNBC.  Inflation concerns have contributed to bitcoin’s fall in the past several weeks. In May, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the largest amount since 2000 as it seeks to tighten monetary policy following $2 trillion in stimulus in the past few years. The Fed's tightening has caused a drop in global stocks, which carried over to losses in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Earlier in April, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a note that the Fed's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession, which added to investor concerns.

As a result, some experts advise that investors include these digital tokens in their 401(k) retirement plan. On the other hand, others question this choice. For example, Fidelity Investments, which manages more than $2.7 trillion in 401(k) plan assets, is the United States&apos; largest 401(k) plan provider. It recently announced that it would permit its clients to invest a portion of their retirement savings in Bitcoins if their employers agree. Some individuals are uncertain whether Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency for 401(k) investments. However, others are not sure whether investing in Bitcoin as part of a retirement plan is good. For example, Ronald Roge, chairman, and CEO of R.W. Roge &amp; Company in Naples, Florida, has made it known to Yahoo Money that he would be hesitant to recommend investors to put their bitcoin in a retirement plan.

The prices of luna (LUNA) gained as much as 30% – from $2.65 Thursday to $3.44 Friday morning – then fell steeply even as the broader crypto market remained flat. Luna classic (LUNC) gained as much as 34% before sliding this morning, data from CoinGecko shows.  Such volatility arose amid reports of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigating whether Terraform Labs violated U.S. laws regarding how it marketed its ecosystem tokens.  Futures tracking the two tokens saw nearly $18 million in liquidations while losses on futures of other major cryptos, apart from bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), remained under the $3 million mark.  The LUNA was issued to holders in late May following the depegging from the U.S. dollar of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in early May – a move that saw the value of what had been luna (now rebranded as LUNC) fall as much as 99.7%. Value locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) apps in the Terra ecosystem fell by $28 billion in addition, as reported.  The liquidations marked the highest losses for traders of the new LUNA tokens so far, data shows, with nearly $5 million in losses. However, LUNC futures saw higher losses at over $12 million, suggesting retail traders are continuing to prefer LUNC trading over LUNA.  Crypto firms Bybit and Binance are currently the only exchanges to offer LUNA futures to traders, while OKX and Huobi offer LUNC futures. OKX, popular in Asia, saw over $9 million in liquidations alone, the highest among its counterparts.  LUNA trades over $3.06 at writing time.

42393976,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbZJ,1654821851,Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear Market,"AUSTIN, Texas — There are “five unsolved problems of cryptocurrency,” according to Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital. That is: identity, scalability, privacy, interoperability and user experience, or UX.  Qureshi is among the smartest of the “smart money” set in the digital asset industry. His firm’s financial backing is an imprimatur, a way to legitimize the likely successful and impactful in a sea of volatile tokens.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here  He spoke today at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference, the world’s largest cryptocurrency event, and was joined on stage by other so-called gigabrains including Kanav Kariya, the president of Jump Crypto, and Dawn Song, founder of Oasis Protocol, a privacy-focused blockchain lauded for its technical features.  Almost all crypto projects that are successful in the long term solved one of these perennial problems, Qureshi said. His definition of “success” here is untethered from financial wins, and instead means a blockchain project that is finding real use.  Moreover, almost all today’s successful projects were founded in a bear market, Qureshi said. That might signal optimism for today’s markets, where bitcoin is well off its all-time high and a looming recession might spell death for the riskiest assets – like cryptos.  As it gathers to party and work at Consensus, the crypto industry – like the global economy – stares down a period of anomalous inflation and market uncertainty. It’s unknown whether crypto can weather the storm and what it will look like on the other side, and whether we’re approaching mass adoption or extinction.  “The question of whether these things have utility is very different from the question of their financial success,” Qureshi said in an interview. CoinDesk caught up with him after the “What’s next for DeFi and Web 3” fireside chat. (DeFi stands for centralized finance.) “Innovation happens when tackling new and important problems,” he said.  Qureshi mentioned the unicorns (or private companies with at least a $1 billion valuation) Uniswap and OpenSea. Coinbase (COIN), also name-dropped, was a former unicorn that successfully went public. All have become product leaders in such sectors as decentralized trading, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and retail onboarding, respectively, having found solutions to hard problems.  And all were founded during bear markets, he said. Popular opinion in crypto says that bear markets clear out the speculators so the most committed players can build. Hype does not always spell conviction.  But the current bear market is structurally different from any other that the digital asset industry has endured. Climbing interest rates pull capital out from the farthest end of the risk curve, and it’s still unknown how that will ultimately affect digital assets. There are fewer people speculating, and there's less demand for the risky leverage, yield or upside crypto provides.  Qureshi, however, is optimistic. “The 2018 bear market was exogenous,” he said, explaining how he was “shocked” when it happened because the pullback began and ended within the crypto industry. That may have meant crypto was a dead end, but it wasn’t.  “The reason crypto went down [in 2018] was that people lost confidence,” he said. “The bear market today is because of macro.”  On stage, Kariya made a similar point: DeFi is down, equities are down, global markets are down. “[This is] not particular to crypto. Leverage unwind [is occurring simultaneously] in a bunch of different buckets,” he said.

What’s unusual is that you might expect interest rates in DeFi to increase alongside the discount rate – but that isn’t happening, necessarily.  “DeFi is not a story about today – it's a story about the future,” Qureshi said. “Most protocols today make no money.” Uniswap, for instance, earns fees and pays returns to UNI token holders but doesn’t have revenues, Qureshi said.  Many crypto projects are in a similar position of building services, finding users and delaying the question of how to earn revenues. But that doesn’t mean profitability is an impossibility, and crypto does take a fundamentally different approach to “customer-company” relationships.  See also: Grayscale, Bitwise Confident a Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved Soon  The “DeFi Summer” of 2020 was largely driven by yield farming, or the token incentives protocols paid to users of crypto software. Qureshi referred to this as a “user acquisition strategy,” a way of getting “dollars” into their systems.  Yield farming has largely come and gone and is the type of expensive user incentive program that might only be possible in a period of cheap money. The good news for Qureshi is that yield farming was “not useful” and onboarded “cavalier users.”  Further, in bull markets, there’s a tendency in crypto for projects to barely “iterate” on their competitors' products – for example, by adding a native token to a crypto exchange – rather than properly innovate. After a time, these strategies exhaust themselves.  The industry now, facing a bear market, might see “iteration toward more intelligent ways of capturing users,” Qureshi said. Because it’s sink or swim, now. But there are still “five unsolved problems” to tackle.",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | ROSE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/10/dragonflys-haseeb-qureshi-is-still-optimistic-in-the-crypto-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f712de7d9f7f791176273b6224bc9fb7bf0cb3b6-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415274,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlTv,1654821755,Fidelity’s Abby Johnson Reaffirms Crypto Commitment in Bear Market,"AUSTIN, Texas – Offering battle-tested advice to the crowd here at Consensus 2022, Fidelity Investments CEO Abby Johnson said her belief in the long-term fundamentals of cryptocurrency remains strong.  “I figure this is my third crypto winter. There’s been plenty of ups and downs but I see that as an opportunity,” Johnson said of the bear market. “I was raised to be a contrarian thinker, and so I have this knee-jerk reaction: If you believe that the fundamentals of a long-term case are really strong, when everybody else is dipping [out], that’s the time to double down and go extra hard into it.”  To be clear, though, Johnson isn't happy about the sharp drop. ""I feel awful about the value that is lost, but I also believe the industry in crypto has a lot more to come,"" she said.  Fidelity – which Johnson’s grandfather founded the year after World War II ended – set up a separate legal entity called Fidelity Digital Assets in October 2018. But the closely held Boston-based investment brokerage's (and particularly Johnson’s) involvement stretches back to Bitcoin’s early days around 2014, a journey she reflected on in a fireside chat Thursday afternoon with Castle Island Ventures founding partner Matt Walsh.  Attracted by this “clean-slate approach to finance and moving wealth,” Johnson recalled, Fidelity came up with “about 52 use cases” for Bitcoin, the vast majority of which ended up mired in complexity and languishing on the shelf.  Early on, the decision to focus on the technology’s foundational level led Johnson’s team toward custody – but that was not one of the firm’s original use cases, she said, adding candidly that on the product side of things, Fidelity isn't as far along as she had hoped.  “When we first started talking about it, I think if someone had suggested offering custody for bitcoin, I’d have said, ‘No, that's the antithesis of bitcoin. Why would anyone want to do that?’”  Fidelity was one of the first major institutional players to deal with crypto directly rather than dabble with watered-down versions of blockchain technology, the fashionable route for corporations for a time. Walsh alluded to this distinction, quipping, ""It's not like you were trying to put lettuce on the blockchain.""  Johnson also talked about her decision to get into bitcoin mining at an early stage, which elicited a mix of consternation and confusion inside Fidelity. Even most crypto people wanted to do something more interesting than mining back in 2014, Johnson said.  “I really wanted to do mining because I wanted us to understand the whole ecosystem, I wanted us to have a seat at the table with people who were really driving things and understand the full stack,” Johnson said.  Johnson said a plan she had hatched to spend $200,000 on bitcoin mining equipment was initially rejected by Fidelity’s finance department. “People said ‘What is this? You want to buy a bunch of boxes from China?’”  Read more: Fidelity's Man: Can Tom Jessop Bridge Crypto and Wall Street for Good? (2018)  Johnson pointed out she no longer has to justify the move into mining as mere “innovation theater,” adding that she feels the same strength and commitment to Fidelity’s recent move to offer bitcoin exposure in clients’ 401 (k) retirement plans.  “I would have never thought that we would have gotten so much attention for bringing a little bit of bitcoin to a little bit of the 401(k) business,” Johnson said. “A lot of people now, that they've heard about it, have been asking, so I've been happily surprised at the amount of positive feedback that we've gotten on that.”  That said, the move to bring crypto to the 20 million or so retirement plans it oversees was met with immediate pushback from the U.S. Department of Labor as well as from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), because of concerns about the volatility of crypto.  “Seeing some of the regulators trying to lean into this is very encouraging and exciting for us,” Johnson said. “Because if they don't give us a route to make some of these connections, then it makes it really hard for us in the background to be able to make it feel seamless.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/fidelitys-abigail-johnson-reaffirms-crypto-commitment-in-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28e87adb43f83a3935d7b2c2c584334ce66f83ec-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415280,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlXh,1654819366,"Grayscale, Bitwise Confident a Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved Soon","AUSTIN, Texas — Officials from investment firms Grayscale and Bitwise are optimistic a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will finally be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) soon.  “There’s a perception in the crypto industry that the SEC is just saying no, and that’s not what the facts show,” said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer for Bitwise, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 here on Thursday.  Grayscale is owned by DCG, the parent company of CoinDesk, and runs the world’s largest bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Grayscale and Bitwise face impending deadlines for their spot bitcoin ETF applications. Grayscale’s proposal to convert GBTC to an ETF is going through a public comment period, with the deadline for the SEC’s decision coming July 6. The deadline for a decision on the Bitwise application is June 29.  Read more: Optimism for US Spot Bitcoin ETF Grows With Approval of Teucrium Futures Fund  Hougan pointed out the SEC has approved a limited interval market, and a bitcoin futures ETF based on the 1940 Investment Act. More recently, two bitcoin futures ETFs have been filed based on the 1933 Investment Act, the same act that spot bitcoin futures ETFs have been filed under.  “That’s a progression that ends in a spot bitcoin ETF,” Hougan said. “So they really are making progress, just not at the pace of the crypto community. But it’s wrong to see [the SEC] as just [holding things up].""  David LaValle, global head of ETFs at Grayscale, agreed.  “It’s not that long ago that there really was a question of if this was going to happen,” he said. “And now it’s clearly a question of when it’s going to happen.”  LaValle noted further that if the SEC rejects Grayscale’s application by July 6, the company would be “very focused on addressing all options.”  Valkyrie's position  Lori Tiernan, the chief strategy officer for Valkyrie, was also on the panel and optimistic a spot bitcoin ETF would be approved, although she said she expected it to come in the next several years.  Last month, the SEC approved Valkyrie’s application for a bitcoin futures ETF, the second such ETF to win approval under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, leading to greater optimism about the approval prospects of a spot bitcoin ETF.  Bitwise’s Hougan also said he believed a spot bitcoin ETF would not initially grow as large as some in the bitcoin community were expecting.  “I think the perception is that day one, a bitcoin ETF launches, and day two it has $30 billion in assets, and that’s just not the way ETF works,” Hougan said. “GLD is the fastest-growing ETF of all time. It hit $1 billion in three days, then hit $3 billion after a year, and after five years, it hit $30 billion.  “I think the effect of a [spot bitcoin] ETF will be overhyped before it launches, and then people will dismiss it. Eventually, [an ETF] will be the largest way that investors will hold bitcoin,” Hougan concluded.
