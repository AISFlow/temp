However, it's not the only cryptocurrency to achieve major milestones, as the upcoming Tradecurve exchange has surged in user count and reached a total of 13,000 sign-ups even before launch. We will go over both projects to see why this has been the case. Decentraland (MANA) Heads Into The Green Zone According to Weekly Chart Decentraland celebrated Metaverse Pride 23, an event that was held with Polygon Mind. Decentraland also saw numerous developments, where they introduced new profile updates, where users could swap names, modify their bio, add links and other information, and manage their wallets. As of July 4, 2023, the Decentraland cryptocurrency traded at $0.404545. During the past week, Decentraland saw its high point of value at $0.358488, with its low point at a value of $0.416113. Within the last two weeks, the total price increase of Decentraland was by 20.8%. In addition, within the past seven days, Decentraland climbed by 4%. This indicates that on its weekly chart, Decentraland has maintained its green zone and is heading upward in value. Tradecurve Hits 13,000 User Milestone However, Decentraland was not the only project to reach a significant milestone. Tradecurve is an upcoming hybrid exchange that focuses on privacy and anonymity. In addition, it's not locked to just crypto trading, as anyone can also trade bonds, US and European equity CFDs, ETFs, forex, indices, commodities, and options. As a result, 13,000 people have already signed up for the exchange even before its launch. TCRV Increased by 80% in Value During Stage 4 of the presale, TCRV trades at $0.018, indicating that the cryptocurrency has surged in value by 80% since the beginning giving solid ROI for early investors. In addition, it will surge by an additional 40% at Stage 5, meaning that investors who want to make the most significant ROI will want to get into it early. Analysts are also predicting that based on its feature sets, such as high leverage at 500:1, negative balance protection, and the VIP account system, TCRV can spike in value even further. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Analysts Predict a 100x Jump In value When Tradecurve Launches Current market experts predict that the growth of the TCRV token will be by 100x, fueled by its future listing on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap, and due to the introduction of Proof of Reserves (PoR) that will bolster transparency in the exchange. In addition, true borderless access appeals to millions of people, and the team estimates that they can onboard 100,000 users at launch. They've already raised $2.8 million out of the estimated $20 million, and the presale has seen significant appeal from investors and whales.

Amidst the uncertainty, seize the opportunity to participate in Uwerx presale bonuses, offering enticing rewards for early investors. This article provides a comprehensive overview to help you navigate the evolving crypto community and make informed investment decisions. Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction Polygon (MATIC) is a crypto and blockchain platform built on top of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Polygon (MATIC) aims to address the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain by providing faster transaction processing and lower fees. Polygon (MATIC) achieves this through a combination of technologies, including sidechains, plasma chains, and a decentralized network of validators. Polygon (MATIC) holds a value of $0.6339, boasting a market capitalization of $6B and a 24-hour trading volume of $552M. Market experts project a promising trajectory for Polygon (MATIC), anticipating a rise to $2.05 by the first quarter of 2025. Disrupting the Industry: Uwerx's (WERX) Low Transaction Fee Sets it Apart from Traditional Platforms. Uwerx is revolutionizing the freelancer marketplace with its array of innovative features. One notable highlight is its customized matching system, which optimizes connections between freelancers and clients based on their specific requirements, skills, and budget. Upon its launch on centralized exchanges, Uwerx plans to renounce contracts, cementing its disruptive approach. A significant aspect of this disruption is the platform's transaction fee, set at a mere 1%. This starkly contrasts the excessive charges imposed by traditional platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, making Uwerx a highly appealing choice for freelancers and clients. Its latest feature—the Uwerx Vault—adds another layer of innovation for token holders. Users can earn rewards based on platform variables by staking their WERX tokens in the vault, enhancing their engagement and potential benefits. Uwerx prioritizes security and reliability, evident in the rigorous audits conducted by reputable firms such as SolidProof and InterFi Network. These audits provide users with a sense of confidence and trust in the platform's integrity. Uwerx's achievements have garnered recognition, leading to its listing on CoinSniper. Moreover, it is set to be listed on Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange, on August 1st. These listings further enhance Uwerx's accessibility, liquidity, and overall standing in the crypto market. Uwerx (WERX) Test Airdrop and Long-Term Stability Measures: Exciting Opportunities and Trust for Token Holders Uwerx recently launched the initial version of its Alpha platform, providing users with a glimpse into its functionality and user experience. The platform is now preparing to transition from Alpha to the eagerly awaited Beta phase, bringing further improvements and enhanced features for a smoother user journey. Uwerx has made a comprehensive update available as a PDF document to demonstrate its commitment to transparency and user support. This update covers essential aspects such as sign-up, login, password recovery, freelancer and client roles, job creation, talent discovery, and key pages like activity tracking and the hiring dashboard. Uwerx's progress in shaping the future of freelancing is undeniable, driven by innovation, lower fees, and user-centric features. The platform highly values user feedback, encouraging individuals to share their insights at feedback@uwerx.network to actively contribute to its evolution. Exciting times lie ahead as Uwerx prepares for a Test Airdrop scheduled at the end of the presale on July 31st. This presents an excellent opportunity for participants to experience the platform's capabilities personally. To ensure stability and trust for token holders, Uwerx has implemented a nine-month lock on team tokens and plans to extend the token liquidity lock for 25 years after the presale. These long-term commitments showcase Uwerx's dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable environment. The rapid growth of the Uwerx platform, with over 5,500 sign-ups and a substantial presence on Twitter and Telegram, reflects its appeal to freelancers and clients seeking cutting-edge solutions. Uwerx (WERX) Presale Success: Breaking Records and Reaching New Heights Uwerx achieved outstanding success during its presale by swiftly completing stages 1 to 4. In the Stage 5 presale, Uwerx tokens are available at an attractive price of $0.047725 per token, accompanied by a tempting 15% bonus on each purchase. The price is set to rise to $0.05245 on Monday, July 10th at 18:00 UTC. This week, there will be a release of a clickable prototype for the presale, which will include pages for freelancer registration and client registration. Furthermore, the Uwerx Vault feature will be unveiled next week, and a poll will be conducted to determine the date of the test airdrop. This presents a remarkable opportunity to acquire tokens at a favorable value. Market analysts anticipate a promising trajectory for Uwerx, projecting a price of $1.33 by Q4 2023. Remaining responsive to community demands, the Uwerx team demonstrates flexibility by adjusting token allocations in light of the rapid speed of the presale.

14683850,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541891,1688888021,Solana (SOL) Tallies 10% Gains On Weekly Chart – Will It Cross $25?,"Solana (SOL) has witnessed a remarkable recovery in the past week, showcasing a string of steady gains. Presently, SOL has increased by 10% and is actively traded at $21.80, reflecting a slight uptick in the crypto’s price. While it’s important to note that SOL remains significantly distant from its all-time high of $260, the recent upward motion has lifted its value beyond the $20 mark, indicating promising signs of an extended bullish sentiment What’s Behind SOL Rise? There are several factors right now that could have influenced the rise in SOL’s price. These include macroeconomic factors such as inflation and crypto regulation in different areas. In addition, Solana has experienced some success in adoption with some ecosystems adopting the token and launching cross-chain bridges. Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely However, the most likely factor is the increase in DEX volume recorded this week. Blockchain analysis platform DefiLlama revealed in a report earlier in the week that Solana had experienced a spike in DEX volume. According to the report, SOL’s DEX volume surged by over 80% and is ranked fifth within the crypto market. This development is likely to have boosted its price action in the past week. Nonetheless, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not reacted to this uptrend and has been stagnant since its decline last November following the FTX collapse. Currently, the TVL sits at around $275 million with no noticeable increase in value despite the gains of SOL in recent days. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook And Prediction SOL is currently trending upward and has continued its positive price action towards the weekend. However, the intermittent red candles on its weekly chart show that the bears are active this week. Looking at the technical indicators, its relative strength index is at 50 in the neutral zone between the oversold region of 35 and the overbought region of 75. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently in the buy zone which is a bullish signal. In addition, the histogram bars are green and signal that a bullish trend is ahead and if the bulls persist, SOL is likely to have a sustained uptrend in the coming days. SOL is trading at $21.83 after it found critical support at the $15.43 price level weeks ago. This puts the altcoin close to the $22.50 resistance level. Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Losing Steam? Fatigue Appears To Undermine Price Rally A break above the $22.50 resistance level will help to boost its price to reclaim the $25 psychological resistance level. If this happens, SOL will likely rally to the $23.00 resistance level after breaking above $22. However, a price decline below $20 in the short term remains possible due to external market conditions that are bearish. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

14683028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541880,1688886047,Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Spikes 43% In A Week – Here’s Why,"BONE, the governance token of Shiba Inu, has experienced a significant uptick in the past week with its price surging by double digits during this period. At the time of writing, BONE has seen an increase of 0.5% in the past 24 hours reaching $1.20. Additionally, the token has witnessed a weekly rise of more than 40% making it the best performer among the top 100 tokens. This spike holds major significance as BONE has managed to be bullish despite the recent market sell-off, which has left the crypto market in a bearish state. The recent growth of BONE could be attributed to the statement of Shitoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu. Kusama Provides Tentative Date For Shibarium Launch Kusama had earlier in the week disclosed a potential date for the launch of Shibarium, the highly anticipated Layer-2 blockchain that would power the Shiba Inu ecosystem. According to a blog post on July 6, Kusama stated that the mainnet launch of Shibarium could be discussed and unveiled at the Blockchain Futurists Conference scheduled to take place in Toronto in August. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Sheds 13% As Bearish Sentiment Takes Over Kusama further defined the role of the multiple token systems that would be supported by Shibarium. According to him, the Shiba Inu ecosystem would be divided into four sections with each section utilizing a unique token. SHIB would be used to govern the community, while BONE governs and support community technology (such as Shibarium gas fees), LEASH would cater to community security and provides exclusivity, and TREAT moderates and enhances community projects. Following this disclosure, the price of BONE experienced a major uptrend due to the positive sentiments from the community. BONE’s unique role in relation to Shibarium gas fees makes it a vital token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Losing Steam? Fatigue Appears To Undermine Price Rally Shibarium is also seen as a significant development and has attracted the attention of many within the crypto community. Since its launch on March 11, PuppyNet, the testnet for Shibarium has displayed remarkable activities. The testnet has witnessed more than 27.5 million transactions from over $17 million wallets. This high level of activity on the Shibarium testnet is a major indicator of the potential of the network and BONE is central to this. BONE Price Prediction BONE has experienced a consistent upward trend since June 11, after it bottomed at $0.665. Since then, its price has increased by 100% in today’s trading reaching a high of $1.35. This positive trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks with more developments expected to be deployed on Shibarium. This will invariably trickle down to BONE providing more thrust for the memecoin to break new resistance limits. At the moment the current resistance mark is $1.5 and if there’s a major correction, the next support levels are $1.30 and $1.25, respectively.

This development occurs against the backdrop of the company’s ongoing struggles, such as regulatory scrutiny and a stagnant trading volume on the cryptocurrency market, which have hampered its growth prospects. Detailed information concerning the stock sales made by the exchange executives has been disclosed through filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The most recent Form 4 filing submitted to the SEC shows the stock sales executed by key individuals at Coinbase, namely Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, and CEO Brian Armstrong. Related Reading: SEC Sues Binance, Coinbase Then BlackRock Files For Bitcoin Spot ETF; Is This An Inside Job? Stock Sales By Coinbase Executives According to Coinbase’s SEC filings, in March, Armstrong and Grewal sold approximately $7 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) stocks. More recently, Armstrong sold shares exceeding $5.8 million in value this week, followed by an additional sale of shares worth $2.6 million on May 25. It is worth noting that Armstrong has not made any purchases of COIN shares in the past two years and has been selling more frequently in 2023. He previously disclosed his intention to gradually sell his 2% stake in Coinbase over the next year, with the proceeds being directed towards funding advancements in science and technology within his co-founded companies, including NewLimit (a biotechnology company) and ResearchHub (a scientific research firm). Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Takes On SEC, Igniting Crypto Community’s Passion for Clarity COIN Performance Amidst Challenges Coinbase token, COIN has witnessed a significant surge in its stock price, with gains of over 125% so far this year. Currently priced at $78.72, Coinbase Global Inc’s stock market cap is $18.46 billion with $13.20 million trading volume. This upward trend reflects positive investor sentiment towards the company. However, this upbeat trajectory has been affected by various factors, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities and a lawsuit filed by the SEC against the exchange. The SEC alleges that Coinbase offered unregistered securities, which poses a potential threat to the core trading business of the company. Amidst these challenges, the stock price of COIN experienced a 12% increase when BlackRock updated its Bitcoin ETF through Nasdaq, with Coinbase listed as a partner under a surveillance sharing arrangement. Meanwhile, the future of Coinbase Global’s stock performance remains uncertain, with investors and industry observers closely monitoring these developments as they unfold, shaping the company’s trajectory in the coming months.
