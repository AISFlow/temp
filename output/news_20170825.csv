At press time, the price of bitcoin had hit a high of $4,496, just 1% above opening, only to to fall back to $4,386, a move that marked the next leg in a volatile week for the cryptocurrency. Just this morning, the price surged above the $4,400 mark again after dropping below $4,000 several times over the last seven days.  Over the past week, however, the price of bitcoin is up 7%, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), and it's now up 68% month-over-month.  The steady uptick has come at a time when the rising prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has pushed the collective market capitalization for those networks to new heights as well.  Two days ago, the overall market cap climbed above $150 billion for the first time, according to data provider CoinMarketCap, and today the market was hovering near all-time highs.  At publication, the total value of all cryptocurrencies was $153 billion.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, BTC-e was the target of a law enforcement operation in late July, during which one of its alleged operators was arrested in Greece. US authorities later seized BTC-e's Web domain and unsealed a 21-count indictment, accusing Russian national Alexander Vinnik and BTC-e of facilitating the laundering of billions of dollars via bitcoin, along with a $110 million fine.  Yet days after the arrest, a forum account long associated with BTC-e posted a pledge to relaunch the exchange, promising to return funds to those who were held accounts at the time of the shutdown. BTC-e has since announced it plans to issue a debt token as part of that repayment effort.  Now, according to new update posted on Bitcoin Talk, BTC-e is in the process of ""transferring digital resources to an investment company"" that will support the planned exchange relaunch.  In a translated statement, BTC-e reiterated its promise that users ""will be able to withdraw 55% of the funds"" when the exchange is brought online. BTC-e indicated that it would move to publish more frequent updates after August 31, with the next update expected on August 30.  The account also answered a number of queries, perhaps most notably to one about the legal effort launched by US prosecutors.  ""At the moment, we have not received official documents from the United States. All that is at the moment is an order,"" it stated.

42379814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kotx,1503677738,Ethereum's 'Metropolis' Upgrade Could Still Be Months Away,"Contrary to recent chatter, ethereum developers have yet to finalize an exact release date for their upcoming 'Metropolis' hard fork.  However, a timeline towards the final testing stages was announced in an open meeting of the core development group today. A release date was originally projected for around August or September, but that plan has effectively been pushed back due to ongoing development.  Metropolis is the third of four planned upgrade releases mapped out by the ethereum team. As previously reported by CoinDesk, Metropolis can perhaps be seen as a major stepping stone toward improving overall usability of the platform. The Metropolis hard fork – when new software is rolled out that makes earlier versions incompatible with the network – will be released in two phases, Byzantium and Constantinople.  In today's meeting, the team successfully established full specifications for Ethereum Improvement Protocols (EIP)'s. Developers are now ready to move onto the next stage, which will involve further trials of the fork on a test network. Depending on how that process plays out, a release date could be confirmed.  The tests are due to begin between the end of this month and the start of September. A three-to-four week testing period is expected, meaning that the announce date for the fork could be released some time around the last week of September or the first week of October – if all goes according to plan, that is.

42379821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kp41,1503676131,China's New Fundraising Rules Could Lead to ICO Investigations,"New rules being developed by the Chinese government against illegal financing may be used to crack down on initial coin offerings (ICOs).  A draft  of the regulations has been released by the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, the executive Branch of the Chinese government. Officials are soliciting public comments over the next month before officially commencing the legislative process.  Though broadly focused on a range of fundraising activities, the fifteenth article of the draft ruleset identifies cryptocurrency-based funding efforts as potential targets for investigations.  The text states:    ""If the department overseeing illegal fundraising activities found a fundraising without proper permission, or a fundraising that violates the relevant provisions of the State, and if one of the following circumstances is found, the department shall launch an administrative investigation. Other relevant departments shall cooperate with the investigation.      ….    (2) to raise funds in the name of issuing or transferring equity, raising funds, selling insurance, or engaging in asset management activities, virtual currency, leasing, credit cooperation and mutual funds...""    The draft outlined that the government shall establish an interdepartmental committee to combat illegal fundraising. It also clarified, for the first time, that participants of illegal fundraising shall be responsible for their own losses.  There are currently two laws dealing with illegal fundraising in Chinese crime law system. The crime of fund fraud, which used to be punishable by death, now carries a maximum sentence of life in jail. The other one – the crime of illegally absorbing public deposits – carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.  The new regulations also come amid a public outrage on pyramid selling scams. Last month, several college graduates were found dead after being imprisoned and assaulted by members of a pyramid selling organization in Tianjin, China.

42379815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KovD,1503666007,Vietnam Is Preparing to Legally Recognize Bitcoin,"Vietnam's prime minister has approved a plan that could see the country formally recognize bitcoin as a form of payment by 2018.  According to regional news services VNA, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has tasked Vietnam's central bank as well as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Safety, to draw up a legal framework around cryptocurrencies.  An assessment for how the government should approach this process is due to be completed by August of next year. Once that is concluded, it's expected that drawing up the legal documents required to recognize cryptocurrencies under a regulatory framework will be completed by the end of 2018.  In tandem, officials will also begin work on a tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. According to VNA, a system governing how cryptocurrency users will be taxed in Vietnam is slated to be in place by June 2019.  If approved, the move would signal that leaders in Vietnam are moving away from the more cautious viewpoint expressed in 2014, when central bank officials warned consumers about the risk of cryptocurrencies.

42379826,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kp93,1503664206,Insightful ICO? Telecom Giant Telenor Wants to Disrupt Media with Tokens,"A product within telecommunications giant Telenor is hoping the technology behind initial coin offerings (ICOs) can help it disrupt the media business model.  Central to the Norway-based firm's exploration of the tech is its partnership with data distribution startup Hubii, which launched an ICO this week using the ethereum blockchain. Both companies believe the project will bring benefits: providing a way to create a decentralized, autonomous marketplace of content that can be sold across different platforms, as well as helping Telenor thwart a long-standing hacking problem.  The firms are also interested in how they could directly interact using smart contracts powered by ethereum, instead of via the pesky media companies now increasingly viewed as middlemen.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Telenor's head of business development at WowBox, Ketil Hoigaard, described the news app could stand to benefit from lessons learned from the Hubii Network ICO.  Hoigaard said:  ""Using technologies like blockchain to deliver these services is [the] key to succeed, to be honest, because I think [blockchain is] what's coming to all these verticals as a tool, a platform, to help deliver content to the end users in an easy way across borders.""  ICO interest  While Hoigaard is studying the ICO to glean insights for WowBox, he said, the project could signal to the larger company how blockchain could be useful in the business.  ""It’s still very early. If Hubii succeeds, and I think and hope they will, I think that is five magnitudes larger, using blockchain in WowBox is more to understand and see opportunity,"" he said.  Opportunity that already other areas of Telenor are looking into. For instance, Mark Briscombe, head of business modelling at Telenor has formally joined Hubii Network's impressive advisory board, which includes former Reuters editor-in-chief David Schlesinger and John Paton, the former CEO of Digital First Media.  In that role, Briscombe not only provides business advice to Hubii, but also seeks to learn from the startup's recent token sale.  And according to Hoigaard, Briscombe has been ""talking about staffing up a team"" to help WowBox understand the benefits of blockchain.  The unusual partnership between the startup and the incumbent has the telecommunications company moonlighting as a media outlet, serving local news content from Hubii's approximately 560 third-party content creators to 50 million users each month.  But matching all that content to the best-suited audience, across multiple national borders in Southeast Asia (where the project has so far been implemented) – and doing so in real time – has provided quite a technological hurdle.  Hoigaard, who called the process a ""nightmare,"" now hopes the ICO will help Telenor figure out how to more seamlessly manage content creation and distribution, while also eliminating middlemen to get cheaper content for its news app, WowBox.  The middlemen the companies are trying to disrupt (as in other similar attempts to reimagine media with blockchain) in this process would appear to be the publishers themselves.  As news and video consumption increasingly comes to users via algorithms, media companies that pay reporters, bloggers and videographers a salary stand to be increasingly marginalized by self-executing smart contracts written on a blockchain.  By moving the functions of a traditional media house to a system operated using blockchain tokens and smart contracts, both Hubii and Telenor hope they can make money and cut costs by paying the creators for their content directly.  ""I really want the original content and to use it as I want, in my context,"" said Hoigaard. ""And we are willing to pay for it, because we know the users will be there.""  A secure token  However, Telenor’s exploration of blockchain technology goes beyond the Hubii partnership.  Already, Telenor issues tokens from a traditional, centralized database to its WowBox customers in Bangladesh and Pakistan. But they have proved easy to hack. When Googling ""WowBox tokens,"" three of the four most-watched videos show how to hack the app to receive unlimited tokens.  In this way, Hoigaard remarked that he sees a public blockchain with a tradeable token as an elegant solution:  ""We are looking into using a blockchain and our own tokens for our millions of users. They will then get the actual token, on a blockchain, instead of just a database.""  From there Telenor hopes it can grow the program without roadblocks, and the company very much sees expansion on the horizon.  According to Hoigaard, of the 15 countries Telenor serves, Bangladesh, India and Thailand have ""innovation houses [that] are looking into blockchain.""

42379812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KorR,1503660605,Are Failing Currencies Boosting Crypto Interest? Investing.com Suggests Yes,"Bitcoin has long been touted as a digital currency that would gain traction where government-issued monies have failed – but is it really doing so?  Though some have written off the notion as the cryptocurrency has become more accepted as a store of value, new data actually supports the correlation. The new finding comes from Investing.com, and is based on traffic from its global user base.  The study, released this week, shows that users from five of the nations with the worst-performing currencies so far in 2017 (as determined by NomadCapitalist), visited its cryptocurrency pages more often than others.  Countries with a disproportionately high viewership included Venezuela, Argentina, Belarus, the U.K. and Egypt – all countries the entrepreneur platform views as having conditions favorable for capital flight.  Venezuela, for instance, has long suffered a serious economic and humanitarian crisis, and more than one in three Venezuelan users at Investing.com – or 36 percent – were interested in cryptocurrency information.  According to the data, Argentina had the third-highest percentage, with 15 percent of visitors from the nation accessing Investing.com's cryptocurrency research portals.  Safe haven appeal  The data suggests that the site's users – regardless of whether they live in South America, Europe or Africa – may be seeking to take refuge in cryptocurrencies during times of economic crisis.  Supporting this theory were remarks by Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. He stated that, while developed nations have an abundance of alternate investment opportunities, underdeveloped or politically unstable nations may lack such opportunities, and may be more inclined to invest in cryptocurrencies as a consequence.  Thibault told CoinDesk:  ""In a place without the reliable dollar or euro, citizens might resent and distrust their financial institutions. In this case, the danger of an unsupervised currency is not only minimized, but it becomes a real advantage and place of refuge.""  In a sense, Thibault is reinforcing the popular argument that the value proposition of cryptocurrency is highest when the risk posed by holding the local currency rises.  ""In the U.S. and other parts of the western world where more stability exists, we tend to look at cryptocurrencies as a nice trend, but hold reservations over the longevity of its surge and whether it is indeed here to stay,"" Thibault said.  Portfolio takeaways  While a small data point in the scheme of things, the study also speaks to the growing prominence of this narrative in the mainstream discourse on cryptocurrencies.  For example, in conversation with CoinDesk, Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, recently addressed Venezuela's possible affinity with cryptocurrency.  ""Imagine you live in Venezuela and you're keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It's not going to take you very long to make that decision,"" he said.  In short, the investor believes the cryptocurrency asset class is a $2 trillion opportunity, and one of his drivers is the idea it can displace traditional paper currency.  All in all, it's a useful reminder that while investors in countries with prosperous economies tend to perceive a higher risk for investing in cryptocurrency, real use cases may be taking off half a world away.

42379811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KoqB,1503655207,Bitcoin's Lightning Network Moves Closer to Compatibility,"Nearly a year after bitcoin's scattered group of Lightning Network developers first gathered to unite their different implementations, the rules they could one day use to connect their technologies are almost complete.  In interviews, those involved with the open-source project (viewed as one of the best ways to bring additional capacity to the nearly $70 billion network), spoke to the new sense of direction provided by bitcoin's recent SegWit upgrade. Still, they also cautioned that, while SegWit lays the foundation for Lightning, standards are needed to connect work that's already been done.  ""The specification is mostly complete, with minor amendments and inconsistencies that we are figuring out,"" said Blockstream engineer Christian Decker, co-author of an early Lightning research paper at ETH Zurich.  Put another way, if each Lightning implementation used different technologies, then the networks wouldn't be able to ""talk"" with one another, and thus wouldn't be useful for sending payments across the network. (Alice would not be able to send to a payment to Bob if he were using another, incompatible network.)    Lightning engineers, however, are almost done drawing up the standards. Lightning Labs CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk:    ""The specification isn't 100% at 1.0 yet, but it's very close.""  Building BOLTS  While this marks a major step for the second-layer payment network, however, there are plenty of other steps still to take.  The open-source GitHub specifications, comprised of 11 Lightning ""BOLTs,"" now describe the technical details that all implementations need to work on, such as transaction formats and how messages should be passed across the network.  The most obvious next step is translating these BOLT rules into actual code, though work here is also well underway. (MIT Digital Currency Initiative and bitcoin startups ACINQ, Blockstream and Lightning Labs are all currently coding up implementations that obey these rules.)  Additionally, Decker said he is working on a tool that tests how well the Lightning implementations work together. As Lightning developers finish coding up what's in the specifications, this will allow them to test whether they're truly compatible.  However, while it's ""moving along nicely,"" Decker said the tool, just like the other parts of the Lightning Network, is still in progress.

Data collected by CoinDesk shows that the applications – which relate to conducting and settling transactions within a payment network – were all filed February 22. To date, Bank of America has filed more than 30 known patent applications related to the technology, including as many as 18 during 2016 alone.  Combined, the breadth of the applications suggests that work is being done on blockchain-based payment systems within Bank of America. At the same time, the bank has issued no definitive statements on the subject to date, and it's not clear whether any of the proposed inventions will see the light of day.

Working with Microsoft Treasury, which handles the tech giant's corporate payments and strategic investments, the project is aimed at building a new blockchain-based system to facilitate transactions between the two companies.  Still, it remains to be seen whether the project turns into something at commercial scale.
