42403884,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvB2,1580164200,Deutsche Bank Says Digital Currencies Could Be Mainstream in 2 Years,"A digital currency could see widespread adoption within the next few years, a new report by Deutsche Bank suggests.      Published Monday, the Deutsche Bank report said digital currencies, while only a decade old, have already been shown to have the ""potential to radically change payments, banking, central banking and the balance of economic power.""      ""We believe a new digital currency could become mainstream within the next two years,"" according to the report, with both China's digital yuan initiative and Facebook's Libra project expected to launch this year. The report said that could make digital currencies available to more than 1.5 billion Chinese citizens and 2.5 billion Facebook users – combined, more than half of the world's population.      At its current adoption rate, cryptocurrencies are running parallel to the internet during its early years, the report reads. Should this continue, there could be more than 200 million blockchain wallets by 2030, up from the 50 million in 2020.      Monday's report is the third in Deutsche Bank's series that examines the future landscape for payments. As the first paper highlights, many existing cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are too volatile to be used as a viable means of payment or as a store of value. The second in the series indicated the inherent benefits of cash mean it would endure as a payments method possibly for decades to come.      Although many of these same sentiments are echoed in the third paper, researchers also highlighted that digital currencies could combine the convenience of electronic payments with the privacy of cash payments. In the case of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), they present new solutions for dealing with problems systemic in the global economy.      If CBDCs were fully rolled out, Deutsche Bank said, central banks could make interest-bearing accounts available to every citizen. That could ""resolve many problems caused by the current fractional reserve banking system,"" the report reads, and commercial banks would not be ""vulnerable to bank runs"": governments would not be forced into a position where they have to bail out the ""too big to fail"" institutions as they had to do in 2008, researchers said.      As part of its research, Deutsche Bank surveyed 3,600 bank clients. Although restricted to a smaller percentage of the population, the report noted a ""stark contrast"" in attitudes between older and younger respondents.      While a larger share of the older generation had never held cryptocurrencies or understood how they worked, the report found a ""large majority"" of millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 – had already traded cryptocurrencies and believed they would be beneficial for the overall economy.      Deutsche Bank said in 2017 the opportunities presented to businesses by blockchain technology were ""huge,"" predicting as much as 10 percent of global GDP could be tracked or regulated using the blockchain by 2027. In September 2019, the bank joined the Interbank Information Network (IIN), a blockchain-based payments initiative that uses JPMorgan's JPMCoin stablecoin.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/27/deutsche-bank-says-digital-currencies-could-be-mainstream-in-2-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2e6ebd42c43e90cdd701eefeb607a0dff7f8d82-2560x1785.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403879,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgv85,1580159115,"Bank of England's Stablecoin Ruling Targets Financial Stability, Exec Says","Financial stability was a key factor in the Bank of England's decision to hold stablecoin payment systems to the same regulatory standards as existing payment chains.      Christina Segal-Knowles, executive director of BoE’s Financial Market Infrastructure Directorate, justified the bank’s Financial Policy Committee’s (FPC) December ruling in a Jan. 23 speech, saying that without oversight, Britain could be left with a destabilizing “stablecoin-shaped hole in [its] payments regulation.”      That’s because stablecoins may seek to operate outside of the existing financial infrastructure – the one that card payments, online banking services and others inhabit. Those activities are regulated across authorization, clearance and settlement to keep the money moving and all parties assured.      Using a coffee shop transaction as an example, Segal-Knowles illustrated that stablecoins would have no such oversight.      “Stablecoins could mean that in future, when I tap my phone at a coffee shop, I may be able to pay with a token that provides a new payment method entirely – and which would not rely on either my bank or my credit and debit cards,” Segal-Knowles said.      The transaction therefore carries none of the assurances regulators offer for existing payment chains. As the FPC wrote in its December report:      “Poorly designed, operated or regulated payment chains pose risks not just to economic activity directly, but also indirectly via confidence in the financial system and the real economy.”      Two scones and a decaf today could compound into very real concerns tomorrow for a coffee shop trying to settle its books.      “If you’re used for payments you should be regulated to the same standard as other entities conducting payments activities,” she said. “It doesn’t matter what technology you are using. Same risk, same regulation.”      The FPC’s December ruling outlines that those and other standards must be enforced:    “Payment chains that use stablecoins should be regulated to standards equivalent to those applied to traditional payment chains. Firms in stablecoin-based systemic payment chains that are critical to their functioning should be regulated accordingly.”  “Where stablecoins are used in systemic payment chains as money-like instruments they should meet standards equivalent to those expected of commercial bank money in relation to stability of value, robustness of legal claim and the ability to redeem at par in fiat.”    The second ruling speaks to a more consequential future. Emerging units of transfer (the stablecoin) must be tightly regulated and standardized, especially if they may become systemically important, like Libra, which was mentioned by name in the FPC report. Facebook's proposed stablecoin and others could quickly become widespread, she said.      Segal-Knowles said these payment innovations are welcome in Britain – as long as the regulators have their say.      “To ensure that this period of innovation does not end in a leap backwards we need to be sure that regulation keeps pace,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/27/bank-of-englands-stablecoin-ruling-targets-financial-stability-exec-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30331dfea85becca2f5b4b9d375833fb3a9079e7-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Makarova discussed crypto in an interview with Ukrainian news outlet MC Today, commenting on a law signed last month by the country’s president, Volodymir Zelensky, which strengthens Ukraine's anti-money laundering practices in accordance with the latest Financial Action Task Force recommendations around cryptocurrency transactions.      For the first time, Ukrainian anti-money laundering law includes crypto as an asset to be monitored, among others. The threshold for triggering the scrutiny process is 30,000 Urkainian hryvnia (UAH), or US$1,200.      “If exchanges, exchangers, banks or other companies make payments in cryptocurrencies worth more than UAH 30,000 in equivalent, they must verify such transaction and collect detailed customer information,” Makarova said in the interview. “The customer must provide comprehensive information about the origin and destination of their virtual assets.”      If any such operation seems suspicious to the payment service provider, the firm is required to report the transaction to the financial watchdog, the State Financial Monitoring Service (SCFM). The agency also has the capacity to block suspicious transactions and even confiscate cryptocurrencies originating from illicit transactions, Makarova said.      “SCFM has access to an analytical product that allows investigations into the origins of crypto-assets and their uses,” Makarova said. “It is impossible to stop operations now, but it is possible to block crypto wallets and remove illegally obtained crypto assets. This can be done by accessing the crypto's private keys as a result of complex investigations.”      Cryptocurrency as an asset class is yet to be defined by the Ukrainian law. Makarova said a working group with participation from several national agencies is expected to come up with a new regulation for virtual assets in Ukraine “over the next four months.” A bill suggesting a 5 percent tax on crypto revenue was already introduced to the Ukrainian parliament in November.      There is no official statistics of how much crypto is currently circulating in Ukraine, but Makarova believes the volume is “quite high,” though most money laundering in the country is still conducted with cash.      “I think that our criminals and corrupt officials are quite conservative and still keep the funds mostly in cash,” Makarova said. “Therefore, in the legalization of cryptocurrencies, I see opportunities for the development of this industry in our country, not a threat.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/27/ukraine-plans-to-track-suspicious-crypto-transactions-above-1200,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abad742515ea9ea710cf8b1cf70580263a00131b-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvA3,1580133600,Israel’s Securities Regulator Asks Private Sector for DLT Proof-of-Concepts,"The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) intends to draft a regulation for distributed ledger technology-backed (DLT) digital asset exchange platforms, according to ISA Chair Anat Guetta.      ISA unveiled the plan at a Jan 20. conference near Tel Aviv, announcing it seeks to offer a “a complete digital value chain for investors” including digital assets registered, traded and settled using DLT. It is now calling on the private sector to pitch the regulator with proof-of-concept DLT trading systems.      “After this stage is concluded, we will create relevant regulation that will make it possible to introduce digital platforms in Israel's capital market,” Guetta said at the conference.      For Israel and the chief securities regulators who attended the Jan 20 conference, DLT offers more than just an evolution in their capital markets – it’s now a market imperative. Multiple officials spoke of how new, lower-cost DLT platforms could open financing opportunities to new market players, meeting notes show.      It could also set a precedent for other securities regulators, Guetta said.      ISA’s endorsement of DLT comes after a special committee studied the technology for six months, considering everything from smart contracts to token issuance.      “The committee concluded that DLT technology has transformative potential for Israel's capital market, and the ability to place it at the forefront of global technology,” Guetta said at the conference.      In a 54-page study of DLT’s history, use cases in other countries, potential benefits and legal implications in the Israeli context, the committee found DLT could offer faster settlement times and streamline clearance. It highlighted the advantages for initial public offerings (IPO).      “The greatest promise of using DLT in capital markets is in the field of IPOs, trading and clearance,” the committee’s final report read. “It includes reducing associated costs, reducing systemic economic risks, developing an innovative financial environment and even opening up the capital market to companies that were previously uninvolved.”      The ISA is no stranger to employing DLT. Its secure “Yael” messaging platform is based on a blockchain, as is a shareholder voting platform and a regulatory document archive.

The Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade has issued more than 1,000 permits to cryptocurrency miners, according to an official at the Iranian ICT Guild Organization (IIG), an industry body representing the country's computing sector.      However, IIG's Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini said that although there are now licensed cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, the new regulations have not attracted much foreign investment, according to a Financial Tribune report citing Ibena.      ""Our studies show that the crypto mining industry has the potential to add $8.5 billion to the economy,"" he said to local media. ""[But] most potential investors have left for neighboring countries, because they offer incentives for crypto miners.""      The Iranian mining industry has grown significantly in recent years, with many operators attracted to the country because of state-subsidized electricity tariffs. Some of the most popular online Iranian crypto mining channels have thousands of members.      In 2019, the Iranian government proposed legislation that would officially recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate business activity. Under a draft proposal, operators have to submit detailed information about their mining activities in return for a license that would need to be renewed on a yearly basis.      The licensing regime, which received formal approval from the Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade last summer, only applies to mining farms with equipment that consumes more than 30 kilowatts of energy, shutting out smaller household operations.      Prior to the licensing system, some mining operators told CoinDesk they operated within a climate of fear as the penalties for non-compliance were high. Those caught were likely to face fines, the confiscation of their equipment and even jail time. Some said they felt forced to consider moving to neighboring countries.

42403888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvEy,1580126400,Court Documents Reveal More Possible Investors in Telegram’s $1.7B ICO,"Some big names that may have invested in Telegram’s token sale are surfacing in court documents as the company fights a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      The list includes some prominent individuals as well as investment firms. One of them, a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation and a partner of Ribbit Capital Micky Malka, is mentioned in the deposition of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov. Asked if Telegram knew which of its investors could be a validator in TON proof-of-stake blockchain, Durov said:    “We didn't put together a separate list of the purchasers who we would assume have experience in validating other networks, although it was obvious that certain investors… such as, for example, Micky Malka that we have discussed earlier, might… have experience in these processes of validation or at least were closely affiliated with parties that had experience in such processes.”    Representatives for Ribbit Capital didn’t return CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      Another individual mentioned in the messages from Telegram Vice President Ilia Prerkopsky was David Yang, founder of digital dictionaries company ABBYY Lingvo and a member of the Band of Angels venture fund. The excerpts of the chats have been attached to the case by the SEC.      Discussing the second round of the token sale with Perekopsky in a Telegram chat in February 2018, Yang asked, “Tell me, if I myself, David Yang, without anybody's mediation addressed Telegram directly in January and expressed a wish to invest, would I get a quote from you?”      “100 percent,” Perekopsky responded. Yang didn’t respond to a request for comment.    Seeing through the redaction    U.S. investment funds Kleiner Perkins, Fortress, Draper Dragon, Dragoneer, DRW Holdings and Redpoint could have invested in the gram tokens, according to the witness declarations attached to the SEC’s motion for summary judgment submitted on Jan. 13.      There are eight declarations from TON investors explaining how they discovered the TON project and why they purchased grams. The names of the companies and testifying representatives have been redacted; however, the file names of these documents contain the names of supposed investors.      None of the companies mentioned returned CoinDesk’s requests for comment, but several sources familiar with the token sale confirmed they heard about these firms buying grams.      For example, a document named “Fortress Declaration Executed_Redacted” contains a declaration from a person who leads a team that “invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum and various Initial Coin Offerings.” According to the testimony, the fund ended up investing $10 million for about 26.5 million grams during the first round of the token sale in February 2018, and the witness himself invested $50,000 personally.      Another document, named “DRW Holdings, LLC Troutmann Declaration,” may be referring to the name of Kimberly Trautmann, head of DRW Venture Capital. In the testimony, the witness discusses investing $5 million for 13.2 million grams, hoping “to be able to trade them ... at some time after the TON blockchain became operational.”      A filing named “Redpoint - Telegram Declaration” contains the testimony of a person who represented several funds, together investing $10 million in Telegram. “I became interested in investing in the Telegram ICO because I did not think it was possible to invest in Telegram, the company, directly,” the witness said.      That was the common thinking among many investors, says Anatoliy Knyazev, managing partner of Britain-based investment firm EXANTE, which, according to Knyazev, also invested in TON.      “Telegram and Durov have never offered to buy Telegram’s shares, and everyone apparently would love to,” Knyazev said. “So people saw those tokens as a chance to participate in Telegram in some way.”      It was previously reported U.S. funds Benchmark, Lightspeed Ventures and Sequoia Capital also invested in TON.    TON Ventures and more fundraising    Two other passages in the documents offer information of additional fundraising efforts Telegram affiliates have been taking to further support the TON blockchain.      A document named “Dragoneer Decl. Executed_Redacted” contains a declaration of a witness who worked as a “senior analyst on an investment team focused on internet and software companies.” In January, the fund invested $15 million in exchange of 39.7 million of the future tokens.      According to the witness, on or about Aug. 13, 2019, John Hyman, who led Telegram’s fundraising in the U.S., contacted them together with Alexander Filatov, the managing partner of TON Labs, which turned out to be an unofficial tech partner of Telegram helping work on TON.      Hyman and Filatov were reaching out on behalf of TON Ventures, a British Virgin Islands-based entity that, according to the court documents, was formed in October 2018 “to stimulate development of the upcoming TON ecosystem by investing into carefully selected teams/projects around the world that are ready to develop infrastructure and use-case applications on the TON Blockchain.”      Similarly, a document named “Draper Dragon Tang Declaration” mentions communications with Hyman about a wallet-building startup. The document’s name might be referring to Andrew Tang, managing director of DFJ DragonFund, part of Tim Draper’s Draper Dragon. According to the witness, the fund he’s working with “is an active investor in the cryptocurrency space.” The fund invested $10 million for 26.5 million grams.      Later, Hyman reached out to the “Draper Dragon” witness, asking if he wanted to invest in a startup working on the wallet for grams. Hyman was seeking to raise “between $5-$10 million to develop this wallet,” the witness said.      “I came to understand from my discussions with Mr. Hyman in the summer of 2019 that he had left Telegram to work on building services on top of the TON network, and specifically a wallet application.” At that time, Hyman was working with Gram Vault, a startup building a custody solution for the future tokens, according to earlier documents in the case.      Both “Draper Dragon” and “Dragoneer” witnesses said they refused to invest in the gram wallet. “I found it notable that this use case for the TON network required separate capital raise because I expected that Telegram was going to be supporting use cases,” the “Dragoneer” witness said.      Alexander Filatov maintains TON Labs is an independent software development company that “designed and deployed a comprehensive operating system on top of the TON blockchain.”      “TON Labs is indeed considering to attract financing for further growth from reputable international funds and have had private discussions about that,” Filatov told CoinDesk.    A meeting in London    A document named “PX5 KPCB Redacted,” which contains the acronym for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers' fund name (“PX5” is the number of an attachment), contains a declaration of the former partner at a California-based venture fund that invested $30 million in TON during the first round of the token sale, getting an allocation of about 70.5 million grams in return.      Hyman's correspondence also contains the mention of Kleiner Perkins investing $30 million. According to the declaration in the case, the fund was first offered a $15 million allocation but convinced Telegram to increase the sum to $30 million.      The witness said he met Durov, Hyman and Hyman’s former coworker at Morgan Stanley, Jonathan Lourie, over dinner in London on Jan. 9, 2018. According to Durov’s emails submitted to the court earlier, that day he and Hyman met in London with Kleiner Perkins partners Mamoon Hamid and Mood Rowghani.      Rowghani joined Kleiner Perkins as a partner in 2014 and left for Bond Capital in September 2018 – the same timeline is described in the declaration, although the funds' names are redacted. Kleiner Perkins didn’t answer CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      Telegram is scheduled to meet the SEC in court on Feb. 18.",NEUTRAL,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/27/court-documents-reveal-more-possible-investors-in-telegrams-17b-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8aede30803d7547629c267e62db113a17d5ca2f3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdguC2,1580124029,Bitcoin Eyes $8.8K After Largely Erasing Last Week's Dip,"View  Bitcoin's four-hour chart indicates the recent pullback has ended and the bulls have regained control. The weekly chart is also aligned in favor of the bulls.  A retest of key resistance near $8,800 looks likely. A violation there would expose the 200-day average currently near $9,000.  The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under the resistance-turned-support of $8,530.    Bitcoin has erased much of the losses seen in the second half of the last week and looks set to revisit resistance near $8,800.      The number one cryptocurrency found bids near $8,270 during the Asian trading hours on Sunday and rose as high as $8,677 around 01:00 UTC Monday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      With the $400 recovery, bitcoin has retraced 80 percent of the drop from $8,793 to $8,213 observed during the three days to Jan. 25.      Some analysts believe the overnight price rise has marked an end of the corrective pullback from the Jan. 19 high of $9,188 and has put the bulls back in the driver's seat.      The argument has merit, as the correction had taken the shape of a typically bullish falling-wedge pattern, which was breached to the higher side 24 hours ago.      As a result, bitcoin looks set to challenge higher resistance levels. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands near $8,610, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin activated twin bullish cues on Sunday: the move above $8,350 confirming a wedge breakout, and the break above $8,530 confirming a double-bottom breakout.      The latter has been reinforced by dip demand near $8,530, as highlighted by the long tail attached to the current four-hour candle.      The falling-wedge breakout indicates the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,850 has resumed, while the double bottom breakout has opened the doors for $8,800 (target as per the measured move method). That roughly coincides with Wednesday's high of $8,793, the level at which bitcoin started to fall.      A break above $8,793 would expose the 200-day average lined up near $9,000. If that hurdle is crossed, the recent high of $9,188 would come into play.      However, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time forcing a break above $8,793 if trading volumes continue to remain weak.      As can be seen on the above chart, volumes haven't picked up post-breakout. Green bars, representing buying volumes, have been smaller than the red bars (selling) observed throughout the pullback from $9,200.    Weekly chart    The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, has crossed above zero, signaling a bullish reversal on the weekly chart for the first time since August.      With the shift, the bullish signal provided by the falling channel breakout witnessed earlier this month has gained credence.      The immediate bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under $8,530. In that case, sellers may test dip demand by pushing prices to last week's low of $8,200.

Occurring Thursday, according to tweets from the bitcoin gold team, two deep blockchain reorganizations (or reorgs) resulted in double spends of 1,900 BTG and 5,267 BTG, respectively. The losses amount to around $87,500 at current prices.      ""We do not know if they successfully extracted any value from an exchange. Advanced risk control systems in exchanges make it likely one or both attacks failed,"" they wrote.      ""Evidence"" suggests the attacks used mining power obtained through mining power marketplace NiceHash, according to the team.      A 51 percent attack is conducted by actors who are able mine a blockchain network with more than half its hashing power, hence the name. This enables transactions to be rewritten, potentially diverting previously spent funds to a different address, as was the case here.      Writing on GitHub over the weekend, James Lovejoy, lead maintainer of the vertcoin cryptocurrency and a researcher at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, said the attacker mined blocks with an address that can be seen here.      In another tweet, the bitcoin gold team said: ""We are in contact with exchanges to offer security help and got positive feedback from them. The targeted exchange(s) have already taken effective measures.""      While the exchanges were not named, Lovejoy said Binance has increased its withdrawal requirement for BTG to 20 confirmations from 12 since the attack.      Based on NiceHash data, the estimate cost to the attacker of each reorg was roughly 0.2 bitcoin (around $1,700), he added – around the amount that would have been given out in block rewards. As such, even if exchanges manage to block the double-spent coins, the attack would have broken even.      The is not the first time bitcoin gold has seen such an attack. In May 2018 around $18 million in the cryptocurrency was reportedly double spent.      Interestingly, bitcoin gold's value has risen since news of the attack broke.

42403854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgtuK,1580119200,Bitcoin's Halving Captures Growing Interest – Among Google Searchers,"Bitcoin traders are split on whether the cryptocurrency’s once-every-four-years “halving” will jolt prices toward 2017’s all-time-high near $20,000 or multiples of that.      What’s clear is interest in the topic is surging on Google, according to a report from the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research.      The search engine’s Google Trends feature shows queries on the term “bitcoin halving” have doubled this month from December levels to the highest since the last such event in 2016.      According to Arcane Research, the increasing number of Google searches is a sign the halving might be capturing greater public interest as a potential catalyst for higher prices in 2020.      ""The bitcoin halving is gaining more traction,” Arcane said Friday in the report. “There is now a clear indication that awareness of the concept is spreading to new people.”      Google Trends doesn’t disclose the actual number of searches on “bitcoin halving” but does publish data showing the search term registered a reading of 35 during the week ended Jan. 19, up from an average 15 during the month of December. The scale is normalized so that a reading of 100 represents the peak of a particular search term's popularity.      For ""bitcoin halving,"" that happened in 2016, when the last such event occurred. Bitcoin prices doubled that year and surged by 13 times in 2017.      The halving was codified into bitcoin’s underlying software code when the cryptocurrency was launched just over a decade ago. Every four years, the bitcoin network undergoes a 50 percent reduction in its ""mining rewards"" - essentially the number of new units of the cryptocurrency issued as rewards to computer operators that are working to confirm data on the underlying blockchain network.      Some crypto investors say the event could boost bitcoin’s price because the pace of new issuance will decrease at a time when more investors are considering getting into, or increasing their allocations of, the cryptocurrency. As an investment, bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets like equities, with a price jump of 94 percent in 2019 that was roughly triple last year’s gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.    Analysts for the German bank BayernLB predicted last yearhttps://www.bayernlb.com/internet/media/ir/downloads_1/bayernlb_research/megatrend_publikationen/megatrend_bitcoins2f_20190930_EN.pdf the halving could send bitcoin to a new record around $90,000, but some investors maintain that the event is so well telegraphed and understood that it’s likely already reflected in the market price, currently around $8,500.    Within the crypto industry, the halving is highly anticipated. Some enthusiasts have even created a dedicated website to count down the remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds until it happens. According to the site, bitcoinblockhalf.com, the event will take place on or around May 12 - now just 108 days away.      But while it appears more are interested in what the term signifies, Arcane Research noted “bitcoin halving” still garners far fewer searches than just “bitcoin.” According to Google Trends, “bitcoin” by itself garnered at least 30 times more searches than “bitcoin halving.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/27/bitcoins-halving-captures-growing-interest-among-google-searchers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e73e5c58eb32c6be3b735d8bcc8a9b7a0c0035b-677x512.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgu2C,1580115600,How Coronavirus Outbreak in China Could Weigh on Crypto Prices,"Jason Wu had to cancel a dozen meetings with his crypto clients in China after the coronavirus epidemic broke out this month.      “We planned a 10-city tour to talk with potential clients in China,” Wu, the CEO and founder of non-custodial crypto lender DeFiner, said. “Nobody wants to attend any crypto-related conferences or any meetings at all because of the virus. We have to rearrange everything.”      Since the first patient was identified on Dec. 8 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, the virus has claimed 80 lives. There were nearly 2,000 confirmed cases as well as 10 cases abroad, including five in the U.S. as of Sunday evening.      Given China’s status as a crypto investment hub – it has the most exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region, which in turn has 40 percent of the world’s top 50, according to research firm Chainalysis – professionals like Wu are concerned, to varying degrees, about coronavirus' potential disruption of business and the impact on prices.      Wu said marketing events are crucial for underground crypto investment firms in China to raise money and invest in digital assets, and they are likely to slow down due to the virus.      “The market might take a heavy blow if the money stops flowing into these crypto asset classes as it usually did before,” Wu said.      While Wu could not estimate how much money Chinese investment has brought into the crypto market, he cited PlusToken, one of the largest illicit crypto firms, as an example.      The defunct company gained its notoriety among Chinese crypto holders by raising over $3 billion through a Ponzi scheme. It attracted 789,000 ether, 26 million EOS and 200,000 bitcoins, which is equal to one percent of the outstanding supply. It was shut down by the Chinese government in June 2019.      Besides the virus outbreak, the crypto market could be hit with a double whammy with the Chinese New Year, according to Wu. Many Chinese crypto retailers tend to cash in on cryptocurrencies right before the holiday and reinvest in the market in the next year.      The Chinese New Year fell on Jan. 25 this year.      “The outbreak happens to be at the end of that cycle,” Wu said. “We are not sure when and how much of the money would come back after the holiday.”    Murky market    While Chinese crypto investors are a considerable market force, it is statistically difficult to conclude a one-to-one correlation between the outbreak and moves in the crypto market, said Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at Trade Terminal, a Silicon Valley-based crypto hedge fund.      “It is really hard to single out one reason that affects crypto trading volumes and market prices, given the data is not always available and transparent in the first place,” Yang said.      Furthermore, the whole market cap of cryptocurrencies is small compared to the stock market, which means many factors could make an impact on the market.      However, Yang described a few traits of Asian crypto investors that could make the coronavirus a significant factor to influence the market.      Most crypto investors from Asia tend to be retail investors, and historically they became more active around major holidays such as the Chinese New Year, Yang said.      “We can’t predict the market prices, but based on our past experiences it tended to get more volatile around those times,” Yang said. “I can see the virus outbreak could potentially lead to more crypto trading for retail investors since they would just stay at home and have even more time to check the market.”      It is also difficult to predict market prices as digital assets like bitcoin have a unique set of return drivers, said Kostya Etus, a senior portfolio manager at money management firm CLS Investments.      ""Bitcoin isn’t really viewed as a safe-haven asset like gold or cash and it doesn’t have much in common with risk-on assets like stocks either,"" Etus said. ""While most assets are specific to risk-on and risk-off environments, in which you could predict price reactions to certain events, bitcoin is not one of those assets.""    Fluid situation    Since crypto is highly speculative, the coronavirus could conceivably have a significant impact on the global market, according to Samuel Lee, a financial advisor at Chicago-based SVRN Asset Management.      “The crypto market might overreact to the outbreak since it tends to be irrational compared to the traditional financial market,” he said.      On the other hand, Lee said the outbreak is more likely to have a limited effect.      “We have seen bitcoin as an asset class went up at the same time when there was the possibility of a war between Iran and the U.S.,” Lee said. “However, the coronavirus might not be that big of a geopolitical influence.”      The World Health Organization (WHO) is still debating whether to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency as of the time of writing.      “Chinese residents are not scared enough that they want to flee the country,” Lee said.      The S&P 500 turned positive even after WHO summoned an emergency meeting on how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, although Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index and Shanghai A Shares Index have experienced sizable dips recently.      ""Most previous regional epidemics appear to have had very limited impact on the equity market, except for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),"" said Wilfred Daye, a senior advisor to boutique investment bank Bardi Co. SARS is an aggressive viral respiratory illness caused by a similar strain of the new coronavirus.      ""When prolonged epidemics become a market driving factor, the cryptocurrency market will react more sharply,"" said Daye, who also worked as the former head of financial markets at OkCoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/27/how-coronavirus-outbreak-in-china-could-weigh-on-crypto-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f70b77ecd569244379f025a7b556c89d6b648137-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgu77,1580092221,"Former Employees Sue Justin Sun and Tron Foundation, Alleging Workplace Hostilities","A lawsuit accuses the frontman of the Tron cryptocurrency and his business associate of harassing and firing two employees, allegedly as payback for the employees’ objections to management practices and applications of the technology they were developing.      In a 70-page document filed in October in the California Superior Court for San Francisco County, Richard Hall, 50, and Lukasz Juraszek, 28, said they put up with escalating hostilities on the job that culminated in their termination last summer from BitTorrent, a file-sharing service that combined with the Tron Foundation in a $120 million sale two years ago.       The Tron Foundation is the main sponsor of the Tron cryptocurrency. Justin Sun, Tron Foundation’s 29-year-old founder and CEO, and Cong Li, 37, the head of engineering, are named together with the companies as defendants in the lawsuit, made public last week.      According to the lawsuit, Sun berated Hall with derogatory exclamations to pressure him into fast-tracking BitTorrent software releases. On other occasions, Juraszek claimed, Sun slapped Li and was never disciplined for it, and Li appeared to have physically hit a manager whom he allegedly had a pattern of verbally attacking in person and in group chats.      “Lukasz Juraszek saw two sets of shoes under the conference room door,” the lawsuit said, referring to Li and the manager, “and then heard a loud commotion coming from the room and then what seemed like a punch, slap or a strike of a hand.” After Li opened the door to leave the room, Juraszek saw the manager’s “face was red, his eyes glossy.”      The lawsuit also highlights the ethical dilemmas confronting cryptocurrency professionals working on technology touted as value-neutral that can be used to break laws. Hall said he flagged the risks of third parties hosting copyright-infringing content and child pornography, but Sun and Li cared little about his proposal to retain lawyers to review the Tron Foundation’s BitTorrent updates.      “Cong Li summarily dismissed these concerns, stated that he had discussed these concerns with Justin Sun, and that no legal review would be done,” the lawsuit said.      The lawsuit is pursuing $15 million in damages and government action against claims of labor law violations, on grounds of wrongful termination, discrimination, emotional distress and hostile work conditions. A response submitted to the court in December by the Tron Foundation, BitTorrent, Sun and Li contested the charges’ motivations, jurisdiction and factual substance.      In a statement from a spokesperson, Sun and Li said: “Tron is not able to speak on the details of pending litigation, but what we can tell you is that our customers, employees and the Tron community are extremely important to us.”    'Impossibly high standards'    After the conference room incident, the manager informed Juraszek that Li schemed to “hold him to impossibly high engineering standards” and boot him from the company for reporting what he observed to human resources, the lawsuit said. Then, Juraszek claimed, unknown users logged in under his work computer’s ID from another location and his emails disappeared.      Hall, who said sabotage also extended to him, claimed Li threatened to fire him if he took a vacation that had already been approved in writing under company policy, instead of canceling the travel without seeking a contractually guaranteed reimbursement.      Choosing to go on vacation anyway, Hall upon his return was demoted by Li, who tried to deter him from documenting their verbal conversations in emails, making such threats as, “If you go tighter with me, I will go tighter with you,” “things will end badly for you,” and “I cannot protect you,” according to the lawsuit.      Their eventual firings, they argued, amounted to cases of retaliation and discrimination. The lawsuit, and the complaints to a California employment board that greenlighted it, said the plaintiffs never fared poorly on job evaluations — Juraszek claimed he was even promoted at a higher salary prior to the conflicts — and that mainland Chinese hires came to replace them and other domestic employees. Sun and Li are Chinese nationals.      To Hall and Juraszek, the new recruits from China seemed prone to being steered into behaving less responsively toward American laws and customs than they would have, giving Sun the upper hand to enforce a “9-9-6” Chinese office schedule — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week — and brush off unlawful BitTorrent material, the lawsuit said.      Juraszek’s own investigation surfaced pirated movies on a BitTorrent website, said the lawsuit, which recalled that even when told about the risks, Sun pushed forward to keep up with deadlines, and that the manager told Juraszek that Li lied to his team about obtaining go-ahead from corporate counsel.      BitTorrent has dealt with recurring copyright lawsuits and law enforcement investigations since it opened at the turn of the century as an environment to freely download books, music, television shows and movies.      Hall, a product director, lasted seven months until June at the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent. Juraszek, a software engineer, started in February and ended in August.      Neither Juraszek nor the lawyers for either side answered requests for comment by press time. Hall declined to comment.    Controversial chief    The court case throws Sun deeper into the fray of mounting scrutiny over his cryptocurrency businesses.      Well in advance of the Tron cryptocurrency’s circulation, traders uncovered paragraphs in the Tron white paper — a document laying out its blockchain model — that had been lifted verbatim from other cryptocurrency white papers. Sun chalked it up to unknowing volunteers with purported translation difficulties.      Zhiqiang Chen, Tron Foundation’s first CTO, who left to spin up a Tron competitor, would find himself in May denying Sun’s accusations he had been fired for embezzlement, bribery, non-disclosure violations and trade theft. Sparking the fight was Chen’s now-deleted blog post communicating worries that Sun and the Tron Foundation could override the Tron blockchain.      In the aftermath of the Tron Foundation’s takeover a year earlier, BitTorrent was plagued with resignations by employees who echoed that Sun exaggerated their technology’s promise and accessed too many Tron nodes, points of power in the Tron blockchain that affect its cryptocurrencies’ prices. Winners of Tron contests and sweepstakes have also faulted Sun for discrepancies in how prizes have been advertised and received.      Jared Tate, the creator of the Digibyte virtual currency, also known as DGB, blamed related broadsides he personally lobbed at the Tron Foundation in December as the reason for his token’s delisting on Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange Sun bought with a group of investors in the fall.      Most conspicuously, amid reports the Chinese government had placed him on a travel ban on suspicions of illegal financial dealings, Sun took to Chinese social media network Weibo in July to publicly apologize to Chinese state officials for flaunting his winning $4.6 million bid on a charity lunch with Warren Buffett.      Sun postponed the lunch but was spotted at a Tron event on the same day. The Tron Foundation, whose official Weibo account was suspended in November during a government crackdown on cryptocurrencies, had claimed he needed to recover from a bout of kidney stones.      Staffed in Beijing and San Francisco, the Tron Foundation is a Singapore non-profit that supports the development of the Tron blockchain and its add-on features: a digital platform for mobile and web utilities such as entertainment, gambling and gaming that are available in Samsung’s blockchain store, and a network for different cryptocurrencies including bitcoin-dollar peg Tether and TRX, the Tron cryptocurrency.      BitTorrent under Tron’s management facilitates BitTorrent token, BTT, payments to send and receive files or buy faster download times. TRX, traded between less than one cent and 20 cents over the past three years, has fallen from a peak market capitalization of $13 billion to $1 billion today.
