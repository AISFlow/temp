42377548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7239h,1408825655,Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Bitcoin's Revolution Moves Beyond Currency,"Just when people were getting used to the idea that bitcoin might not be a boom-and-bust fad destined for failure, entirely new applications of the technology have joined digital currency on stage.  Crypto 2.0 – also know as cryptography 2.0, decentralized applications, or, popularly, as bitcoin 2.0 – is the application of block chain or distributed ledger technology to things other than digital currency. The block chain offers the ability to facilitate decentralized ownership and store, transfer and process information in a decentralized, programmable way. Many consider that innovation to be the true value of this technology.  In May, New York-based investment firm Ledra Capital took to Twitter to crowdsource a list of what kinds of information the block chain could be used for. Currency transactions, of course, topped the list. But, it was followed by things like stocks, bonds, mortgages, land titles, gun permits, contracts, votes, bets, trademarks, data storage, domain names, proof of authorship and much, much more.  As Robby Dermody, co-founder of Counterparty, told CoinDesk:  “Bitcoin can be used to pay for things like a cup of coffee, but that’s not bitcoin’s ‘killer app’. To the average customer it’s just as easy to pay with their credit card. A killer app would need to offer massive advantages in another area.""  A community of developers and entrepreneurs recognize this notion and have been busy building out many crypto 2.0 concepts. Dominik Zynis, the former head of business development at Mastercoin, commented on the significance of this movement to CoinDesk, saying:  “We ought to be paying very close attention to crypto 2.0 because bitcoin has redefined how we launch web services.”  Zynis believes crypto 2.0 companies are laying the foundation for a new generation of “secure and scalable Internet applications” that will be more resilient to hacking, fraud, scalability and privacy problems.  Bitcoin’s role as a digital currency is still a work in progress, both at the code and implementation level, as well as on the consumer and institutional adoption side. Still, the wider impact of distributed ledger technology is beginning to rapidly take shape. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, illustrated the movement's broader vision to CoinDesk, adding:  “I think now might be the time when we have just enough cryptographic, crypto-economic building blocks to finally make a proper shot at advancing a radically different vision for Internet architecture and society.""  Rise of the decentralized exchange  A year ago it might have been hard to believe that in just 12 month's time, a publicly traded company would be openly exploring the possibility of launching a cryptosecurity on a decentralized asset exchange.  Overstock.com  CEO Patrick Byrne has been outspoken in his support of digital currency, and he recently told CoinDesk that Overstock intends to figure out how to launch a cryptosecurity so other companies can use their system to raise funds. Overstock published a wiki on 29th July that currently details 12 organizations that have either launched decentralized exchanges or are building them.  Among them, Counterparty, NXT and BitShares have exchanges that are operational right now. Counterparty has been live since January and NXT’s Asset Exchange since May, while BitShare's platform is only a few weeks old. Each exchange’s implementation differs in various ways, but they all share common features, namely the ability to create and trade user-defined assets without the need for a centralized third party.  Company shares are an obvious application of these platforms. On NXT’s Asset Exchange, for instance, where more than 220 user-defined assets have already been created, digital currency exchange service Coinomat has issued a cryptoasset that offers shareholders a 1.5% dividend of the company’s weekly profits. This is really an example of a smart contract that is automatically confirmed and processed over a block chain.  Other current examples of block chain implementations include the Digital Tangible Trust, which offers a tradable gold-backed cryptoasset. Non-traditional assets are also emerging, like those being created by MyPowers, whose digital tokens allow people to buy and trade brand equity in artists and organizations. Other projects are moving beyond assets, like Pavilion, which is planning to utilize block chain technology to sign and publicly publish contracts.  Future goals for cryptoassets include smart property linked to physical assets; imagine a rental car whose key was tradable as a token on a decentralized exchange and downloadable to a fob that would unlock the vehicle. There are also plans to launch what are called decentralized autonomous companies (DACs) – namely by projects like BitShares – which operate autonomously on top of a block chain and earn profit for shareholders.  Decentralized applications will hide the block chain  Beyond assets, there have been efforts to utilize the block chain as a way to store data. Namecoin, an attempt to create a decentralized domain name registry outside the control of ICANN, was arguably the second implementation of block chain technology after digital cash transactions. More recently, efforts like MaidSafe and Storj have completed fundraising rounds.  MaidSafe  is attempting to use the bitcoin block chain to create a fully decentralized internet by sharing processing and memory power across a distributed network. Its April crypto-crowdsale notably raised $7m in five hours, although, due to the poor liquidity of the Mastercoin it received, it soon revised that number to $5.5m.  Storj  completed its crypto-crowdsale on 20th August, raising 910 BTC. The Storj platform offers online storage similar to Dropbox or Google Drive, but does so over a distributed network. Utilizing the bitcoin block chain, Storj allows users to buy available disk space on the network, and in addition, allows users with free storage space to sell it to those in need.  Shawn Wilkinson, founder of Storj and a bitcoin developer, noted the value of expanded applications of the block chain, saying:  “Essentially you can take the technology from bitcoin, which is a $5bn–$6bn industry, and apply it to an existing area like cloud storage, which is a $150bn dollar industry.”  With applications like Storj, Wilkinson pointed out, you move past things like regulation, public perception, price volatility and the complexity of the underlying technology. Decentralized applications provide a user interface whose back-end could be a traditional network but happens to be a distributed one.  Sidechains, treechains and a question of blockchains  One important point of contention within the crytpo 2.0 space is what block chain this next generation of implementations should be built on top of. In one camp are the organizations like Ethereum and BitShares that are building their own, entirely new block chains on top of which their platforms will operate.  In June, bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen addressed the Ethereum project in a blog post and suggested that Ethereum’s intentions to create a new proof of work system and currency seemed extraneous at first blush.  He wrote:  “Bitcoin already provides a global currency and distributed ledger – there is no need to reinvent those wheels. Combining real-world information with bitcoin is where things start to get really interesting.""  Alternatively, BitShares uses a mechanism called delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS), where stakeholders delegate their voting power to 101 delegates that take turns updating BitShares block chain. Distributed proof-of- helps prevent known risks of proof-of-work, including risk of a 51% attack.  Other crypto 2.0 initiative are seeking to adapt the bitcoin block chain to scale more effectively, be less decentralized and allow for permissionless development. One such effort is through bitcoin core developer Peter Todd’s treechain concept, which Todd is developing while working at crypto 2.0 start-up Viacoin. Side chains are another potential implementation that will allow new features to be added to the existing bitcoin block chain through new block chains that interact with it.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that BitShares' block chain is powered by proof of work, not distributed proof of work.  Stay tuned for tomorrow’s Crypto 2.0 news round-up to learn about the most recent updates in the space.

42377562,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723Tp,1408808750,Transport and Velocity: Could Bitcoin be a Replacement for Gold?,"Gold has been used as a store of value for eons, thanks to its beauty and almost magical ability to never tarnish. Furthermore, despite radical shifts in human values over the past 100 years, its worth still has not diminished – even soaring to over $1,000 an ounce in recent times.  Now, though, there is a new, digital challenger on the scene that, when its price chart is compared with that of gold, bears some striking similarities  It's no wonder, then, that companies like Netagio now allow people to trade bitcoin for precious metals like gold – it is a sign that investors want the ability to trade BTC seamlessly with other investment vehicles.  In a sense, bitcoin could be considered an upgrade from gold. Some even consider it as gold with transformational, information-like properties.  Digital gold with a twist  George Gilder  , author of the forthcoming book Bitcoin and Gold: The Information Theory of Money, is impressed with bitcoin and has developed a well-thought argument for bitcoin as a sort of 'next-generation gold'.  That's because bitcoin builds upon the properties of gold and has spawned an information-based variation, he said.  Gilder told CoinDesk:  “Satoshi [Nakamoto] was right with bitcoin. That’s what amazes me. Satoshi arrived at a foundation for the value of bitcoin that’s valid.”  Gilder sees economic uncertainty as advantageous to bitcoin, a fact evidenced by the increasing interest in bitcoin observed in Argentina and other countries hampered by volatile fiat currencies.  As an example, Gilder believes that increased government control of money, such as capital controls or quantitative easing, means more uneasiness in terms of economic sentiment.  “The more money [governments] print, the more uncertain the people become,” said Gilder. “Bitcoin is based on the understanding that the money supply doesn’t really matter.”  Adrian Ash, the head of research at BullionVault, a gold storage company, pointed out:  “Digital gold currencies have been tried and failed many times in the last 20 years. They came to nothing thanks both to state resistance, but also to lack of adoption.”  However, it's safe to say that bitcoin has progressed further than its failed predecessors. That may be, though, because previous electronic money alternatives like E-gold were backed by gold, and not by cryptographic keys. As a result, bitcoin might be the first to offer a substantial alternative that would appeal to gold enthusiasts.  Role as a currency  Another characteristic of bitcoin that makes it seem like an upgrade over gold is its protocol that allows value to be moved quickly around the globe. Regardless of how supportive gold enthusiasts are of their favorite store of value, there's no denying it has limited appeal to mainstream consumers.  Bitcoin adoption by the average person remains a hurdle to overcome to ensure success, but the digital currency's combination of novel innovations might allow it to complement existing methods of exchange.  “[The] chicken-and-egg situation [of adoption] might be resolved by bitcoin's most exciting aspect – zero-cost exchange of value,” said Ash.  Along with adoption as a means of exchange, bitcoin could become a very useful currency, commodity and recording mechanism via its block chain. According to Gilder, the problem of velocity, or how much people spend a thing of value, is what will ultimately make bitcoin a success. Or a failure.  Gilder said:  “Velocity is what determines value. Not just printing money. Satoshi [Nakamoto] has an absolute 21 million bitcoin limit. Bitcoin is determined by velocity, by turnover rate governed by the people holding the coins.”  Bitcoin might be an iteration of gold – a 2.0 version. People can hold stores of it, as well as spend it – a property that gold cannot compete with.  “It's important to note that gold isn't used as currency anywhere today,” said Ash.  Given that even Ash concedes this point, bitcoin's long-term success may lie in adoption. In other words, whether bitcoin is able to triumph and replace gold will lie with its peer-to-peer network, and just how large this base of bitcoin believers becomes in the years ahead.  Bitcoin believers  It's hard to tell how many bitcoin users there really are. New bitcoin products and services are seemingly announced every day, and Mary Meeker's presentation of bitcoin's growth via the use of a chart showing the number of wallets in use (see below) shows there is traction.  While wallet use is growing, it's not a one-to-one correlation – or even if many of the newly created wallets actually have bitcoin in them. It does show increased awareness overall, however.  However, it can be argued that gold investors will have to see the promise of bitcoin over the precious metal not only as a store of value, but also as a spending and transactional innovation.  The rise of consumer services continues, and energy focused on that particular sector of the bitcoin economy is notable.  For instance, in Canada, there are a number of options for people to buy or sell bitcoin. Not only do residents of Canada have access to an established exchange for the Canadian dollar, there are storefronts and even bitcoin ATMs available in most major cities.  Access to bitcoin for gold investors is the best way to prove the value of bitcoin to this subset of the market, and this is especially true in the US market.  In a poll conducted by Harris Interactive in December 2013, when bitcoin prices were at their all-time pinnacle, the majority of people still didn't even know what bitcoin was. And, likely because of this, they indicated that they would much rather invest in gold over bitcoin.  The key to bitcoin as a new form of gold is to improve upon the precious metal. And that means making the most of its transport and currency capabilities.  For this to happen, an increase in awareness is needed – and some proponents of gold already understand this fact.  Companies like the UK's GoldMoney have been offering bitcoin as a storage option along with gold for some time. Furthermore. investment broker and author Peter Schiff, while making waves about his insistence that bitcoin could become worthless, is still nevertheless accepting it at his company, Euro Pacific Precious Metals – a fact that should make gold investors take the digital currency a little more seriously.

42377577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723Q3,1408800620,6 Things Bitcoin Has Made Possible for the First Time,"It may be cliché, but perhaps no single word sums up bitcoin quite as well as “disruptive”.  Computer scientists have been trying to create secure and sustainable digital cash since the earliest days of the Internet, and until Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper introducing bitcoin was published in 2008, their efforts were in vain.  While the public may still be polarized by the digital currency, most people who take the time to learn about bitcoin and the block chain come to realize the significance of a decentralized, trustless network and the impacts it could potentially have in many areas of everyday life.  The use cases of such a technology are only beginning to be explored, but the bitcoin protocol has already proven to be a game-changer, allowing its users to do things that had previously been thought impractical or even impossible.  Here are six things bitcoin has made possible for the first time:  1. A currency that exists solely in digital space  Yes, it’s obvious, but it’s also perhaps bitcoin’s killer app.  Previous forays into online-based currencies have resulted in failures like e-Gold or centralized currencies often found in gaming communities, but bitcoin is the first digital-only currency that is completely decentralized to gain significant traction.  There are many implications of this, but one key value of a decentralized digital currency is that anyone can create a bitcoin wallet to hold their money, without needing to rely on a bank’s approval or their government’s issued currency.  It’s no secret that money transfer services like Western Union and Moneygram are flawed. These companies often take days to transfer money across the globe, and they charge a hefty service fee for their work.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, allows anybody with Internet access to send any amount of money anywhere in the world, have their transaction complete in minutes, and be charged only a small fraction of the aforementioned companies’ cost in transaction fees.  3. Decentralized smart contracts  The notion of smart contracts—contracts that can be digitally created and verified—has been around for years, but is now being approached in a whole new light in the face of bitcoin.  Projects like Ripple Lab’s Codius and Ethereum have brought decentralized smart contracts to center stage in the digital currency industry, and the future looks promising for “smart” asset management using block chain technology.  4. Decentralized domain name registration  A novel subset of smart contracts that is already providing value through the block chain is the ability to register domain names outside of the jurisdiction of the centralized group Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  Namecoin  has been the leader in this space, allowing users to register .bit domain names that are not subject to regulations and that centralized domain names may face. The major value in decentralized domain names, then, lies in their immunity to Internet censorship.  Just as some of the Internet’s first uses were for taboo purposes, someone along the way realized that bitcoin could be used to anonymously (or, more accurately, pseudonymously) transfer money online.  One result was a now-defunct robust marketplace called the Silk Road. When the FBI shut down the online black market, they seized (and subsequently auctioned) 27,000 BTC worth more than $14m at the time of writing.  6. Micropayments that make sense  Of course micropayments existed before bitcoin, but the idea of sending amounts less than $1 over the Internet was never taken too seriously, as credit card companies and services like Paypal often charge transaction fees that make micropayments inefficient.  While some of the kinks of transaction fees for bitcoin are still being worked out, there’s hope that a truly digital currency will allow people in the publishing industry and beyond to accept micropayments (or donations) for their services.  The Chicago Sun Times recently experimented with a paywall that accepted bitcoin micropayments in exchange for access to their website’s content, which led to more than 700 donations in a 24-hour period.  Society has seen many of our traditional institutions and operations move from analog to digital, and this shift shows no signs of slowing down.  As more innovators continue to explore all of the use cases of the bitcoin protocol, there’s no doubt that we can expect the list of things made possible by the digital currency to expand.

42377560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723RJ,1408790758,Mining Roundup: Rigs for Home Heating and a Bitcoin Backbone,"What’s happening in the world of mining? As recent coverage suggests, the network is beginning to see a steadily rising hashrate as mines around the world get started and begin generating bitcoins.  It’s not just the big companies – small operations using state-of-the-art chips in super-efficient data centers are also moving to mine their share of bitcoins. And between all that activity, the bitcoin mining community continues to develop, grow and discuss the issues of the day.  Gavin Andresen talks bitcoin “backbone” project  In a new post on the Bitcoin Foundationhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/08/a-bitcoin-backbone/ blog, chief scientist Gavin Andresen discussed the recent work of bitcoin core developer Matt Corallo.  Corallo’s new project, which Andresen called a “bitcoin backbone project”, involves the construction of a global network of servers aimed at providing miners with a quick, low-latency means of connecting with one another.  Andresen said that the initiative hopes to improve connection speeds for both solo miners and pool owners, writing in the blog post:  “If you own a mining pool or are a solo miner, you should connect to Matt’s backbone network; your blocks will propagate faster to the rest so you are less likely to lose block races. And you are more likely to hear about new blocks sooner, so you waste less time building on an old block.”  He added that network participants outside of those demographics have little to gain from syncing with Corallo’s network, saying that it would result in higher bandwidth consumption.  Beyond the infrastructure build-out, Corallo has also developed a block relaying tool that, according to Andresen, helps streamline the amount of data sent for each transaction. The solution reduces the amount of old data sent in new blocks by 95%, which helps alleviate a key problem in the bitcoin network: information bloat.  At the end of his article, Andresen addressed the criticism that approaches like Corallo’s encourage centralization. To that point he said:  “Anybody can do what Matt has done, and I encourage anybody concerned about centralization to create an even higher-performance backbone network and software.”  CoinTerra launches sub-$1 mining contracts  Competition among mining contract firms worldwide has resulted in what some may call a price war, with companies vying for market share in an increasingly crowded ecosystem.  Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer CoinTerra, which began offering contracts worth up to 1 PH/s earlier this year, has hit the market with a new offer that is notable for its low cost: a $0.99-per-gigahash contract.  In order to receive this deal, you have to sign up for a 12-month, 1 PH/s contract that clocks in at just under $1m. As costly as this may seem in the bigger picture, it reflects the growing bidding war for miner-customers who may be shifting away from home rigs to hosted solutions.  In a statement, the company said that the new contract offers are tied to its next-generation mining products, which are set to hit the market in the next few months. With Q4 expected to be a busy time for bitcoin hardware manufacturer, CoinTerra’s new miners will be one of several entrants vying for market share.  CoinTerra noted that the company has been seeking to push down internal prices in the past year, saying:  “When we were developing the TerraMiner IV last year $3/GH was our target for standalone hardware. Now, just one year later we are able to offer fully hosted mining contracts at a fraction of that price.”  Other companies in the space, including PeerNova, BitFury and Hashplex have been seeking to make inroads with cloud-based mining solutions. As the bitcoin network’s resource demands grow and more large-scale miners shift to data center spaces, contracts like these become attractive to some in the community.  Cloud mining isn’t without controversy, however. In a recent Reddit post, Gavin Andresen said that many companies in that space could prove to be Ponzi schemes rather than legitimate businesses.  Spondoolies Tech moving next-gen miner to market in October  Like many other companies in the hardware space, Spondoolies Tech is looking to position itself as the go-to solution for data center-level mining equipment. The Israel-based company is moving aggressively to capture market share in this high-value space, leveraging its near-term success on the SP31 Yukon.  Offering 5.5 TH/s in hashing capacity, the Yukon sports 30 ASIC chips in a slimline design. Power-wise, the Yukon draws approximately 1,500 watts at the wall, cementing this product’s status as equipment meant for the seasoned miner.  Expected to ship in the second half of October, the self-style mining “beast” will no doubt be put to the test once deliveries begin. In a recent statement, Spondoolies CEO Guy Corem remarked that shipments of the company’s existing product line are on schedule.  He noted on the company’s official blog:  “For customers who have already placed orders and are awaiting delivery, our priority is to ensure on-time delivery of your machines so you can immediately start seeing ROI. I am therefore very pleased to report that we will meet our original delivery schedule and provide all customers with on-time delivery.”  Heating your home... for bitcoins?  Given the fact that some miners in the community have been operating since digital currency’s infancy, there have been pieces of equipment that, along the way, have stopped being useful for the purpose of generating bitcoins. A recent thread on Bitcoin Talk posed the simple question: what else can your miner be used for? The answers ranged from the pessimistic to the humorous, sparking an interesting conversation about finding uses for then-expensive technology.  The immediate reaction for some, as one can imagine, is to use old hardware as a doorstop. Yet others suggested that using a mining rig as a stand-in for a space heater is a great approach to keeping a warm room. While it may not be the most efficient way to provide heat, you can’t deny that generating some bitcoins at the same time isn’t a bad proposition.  As one BTCTalk forum member noted:  “If you normally have electric heating in your home, you might as well use bitcoin miners instead. All power used by these things ends up as heat, so in that sense they're just as efficient as a regular heater that uses the same amount of power. Except you also get bitcoins.”  Another user concurred on this particular utilization, saying that “I was in a sauna, making BTC and LTC.”  Perhaps the most humorous response came from one forum member who plans to keep his or her miners intact for the long term, joking that they might become artifacts of study for future generations:  “Maybe thousands of years from now some archaeologist will uncover them and wonder what the hell they were for.”    Got a cryptocurrency mining tip for future roundups? Contact us.
