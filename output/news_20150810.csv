42398557,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaD7w,1439245188,Tech Interest Groups At Odds Over California Bitcoin Regulation,"A bitcoin industry think tank continues to be at odds with digital advocacy groups over their stance on pending legislation in California that seeks to regulate digital currencies.  On Friday, Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito sought to distance his organization from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Copia Institute, which are opposing the law, AB-1326, on the grounds that it will harm innovation in current form. The bill, introduced in February, most recently passed the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee in July.  The EFF and Copia first made their opposition of the law clear shortly thereafter through a formal filing with the Senate Committee on Banking and Financial Institutions. Since then, the EFF has also gone public with its stance on the legislation, advising those concerned about the law to reach out directly to California officials.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh elaborated on the budding debate between the groups, suggesting that while Coin Center supports the EFF's efforts on a philosophical level, its opposition isn't practical given the potential risks that would come should no law pass at all.  Van Valkenburgh said:  ""They're asking that a bill doesn't pass and praying that the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) doesn't apply money transmission laws. The EFF has done amazing work with free speech, but they've never worked in financial law. I just think they missed this.""  Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the EFF, admitted he wasn't a ""money specialist"", but suggested he believes there is an overemphasis on the application of the law in this field, and that the regulation proposed perhaps doesn't apply as broadly to the industry as perceived.  ""If you're a developer of code, you're not likely within the scope of money transmission. In our talks with other companies in the space, many of them are sitting on the sidelines because they're not within the scope,"" he said.  Founded in 2014  , Coin Center is funded by donations as well as venture capital from Andreessen Horowitz, RRE Ventures and VC-backed bitcoin industry startups including BitGo, BitPay and Xapo. The EFF, by comparison, is a donor-funded nonprofit that seeks to safeguard civil liberties through its work in advocating for technology.  Question of time  In conversation, Tien emphasized the EFF's position that there is another component to the legislative process that it hopes will positively influence the bill, time.  Tien suggested it's possible that AB-1326 could be debated into January 2016, and that it is unlikely to be killed outright even if it faces significant opposition.  Still, he said the EFF remains sensitive to the idea that there is a risk that if the bill is not passed, the more rigid laws applying to financial intermediaries would be enforced against the still-nascent industry.  ""If your fear is that the DBO or some other agency is just going to walk all over this territory in the interim, they don't work that fast,"" he said. ""It's not all-in or all-out, we can work together and do a better job if the executive branch is going to wait for legislation.""  Tien made the case that added time would be beneficial for lawmakers, as they would have the opportunity to understand why certain definitions or requirements could be improved from their current form. For example, he cited how traditional definitions of custodianship don't apply to bitcoin funds, which can be controlled by multiple parties through multisignature wallets.  ""We have time to do better, and we should take time to do better,"" he continued. ""Educating legislators, regulators and staff on tech issues is a marathon, not a sprint.""  Limiting harm  In his remarks, Van Valkenburgh was keen to stress his general alignment with the EFF, suggesting that should the debate be about the merits licensing, he's not sure Coin Center would support such a strategy toward regulating the industry.  In particular, he argued that he believes most states already have the authority to regulate certain digital currency companies that act similarly to financial institutions.  ""There are other ways to deal with a nascent industry,"" he said. ""That's not the world that we're in because the MSB statute in California, just as in 48 of the 50 states and in DC, covers bitcoin companies, so that means we're already in a world where regulators can demand business get a license.""  Van Valkenburgh sought to categorize AB-1326 as beneficial given that any action from regulators is effectively being tabled while the legislation is being debated.  Further, he argued there are strong benefits to the law, such as language that includes an onramp for startups and the ability for industry businesses to keep permissible investments in digital currency.  Overall, both groups expressed the desire to work together, with the spirit best summed up by Tien, who added:  ""I think of this as a disagreement among folks who want the same.""

42398558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaD8v,1439233981,US Bank Regulator Calls for Balanced Bitcoin Oversight,"The head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has called for a balanced approach to regulation governing financial technology development in the United States, citing bitcoin as one such example.  Months  after calling digital currencies ""potentially revolutionary"", OCC Comptroller Thomas Curry highlighted bitcoin during a recent speech as he called for regulators to avoid crafting overly burdensome rules that could stifle otherwise productive work on financial technology.  He stated:  ""As the industry continues to innovate, it’s important that regulators strike the right balance between encouraging responsible innovation and managing risk. Virtual currency, like bitcoin provides a good example.""  Curry said the agency has put together a working group that will ""develop a framework to evaluate new and innovative financial products and services"".  ""We have a team with representatives from across the agency – policy experts, examiners, lawyers, and others – considering this question,"" he said. ""We’re still early in the process, so I can’t tell you exactly where we’ll end up.""  Curry added one result could be the creation of an office dedicated to financial innovation.  Moving away from the banking sector  Notably, Curry acknowledged during his speech that financial technology is largely being developed outside regulated entities like banks.  He said:  ""There are a number of reasons why that’s so, but the one that’s of most concern to me is the perception that it’s too difficult to get new ideas through the regulatory approval process.""  The working group, he said, was launched ""to address that perception – and any reality that might lie behind it"". He also called on regulators to ""view new ideas with an open mind and not dismiss them as either sorcery or voodoo"".  Curry noted in his speech that he sees a ""transformation"" continuing to take place outside the banking sector that could lead to new products and services, particularly those geared toward the underbanked.  ""I’m betting that much of that transformation will take place inside the traditional banking system, and I want the OCC to be ready to deal with it,"" he said.  The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaD40,1439220130,Deutsche Bank: Blockchain Can Help Banks Defend Business Models,"Banks should seek to leverage blockchain technologies as part of a bid to defend their business models from disruption, Deutsche Bank Research suggested in a recent post online.  Entitled ""Blockchain – attack is probably the best form of defence"", the post discusses bitcoin and blockchain and its implications for major banks broadly, calling the technology ""one of the first truly disruptive ideas from the FinTech sector"".  Author Thomas Dapp goes on to discuss his view that the true power behind bitcoin and the blockchain lies in its application of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to the financial sector, calling this a potential ""paradigm shift"" that could render business divisions of major banks redundant.  Dapp writes:  ""Financial services and products that can be offered virtually in real time around the globe in future while at the same time reducing costs could catapult the traditional banks back to top spot in the race to devise financial innovations.""  Dapp indicates that financial entities including stock exchanges, credit card firms and clearing houses are all trying to leverage blockchain technology to assess whether it is a threat or potential benefit to their operations.  Deutsche Bank Research  is the macroeconomic analysis division of the Germany-based banking and financial services giant, responsible for tracking trends that represent risks and opportunities to its operations.  The publication comes on the heels of Deutsche Bank's new filings with European regulators, in which the company boasted that it is currently analyzing applications for blockchains and distributed ledgers.  Foregoing P2P  Dapp writes that a viable strategy for banks would be to use ""certain parts"" of the blockchain for their own purposes, a decision he said would necessitate removing the P2P nature of the technology in its current form.  ""It is entirely conceivable that banks could ... set up a new digital booking and clearing system amongst themselves enabling them to offer client transactions featuring the benefits of the blockchain, such as speed, efficiency, internationality and cost savings,"" he wrote.  Such systems, he infers, could perhaps be built on permissioned blockchains that enable the efficiencies of blockchain-based consensus without relying on bitcoin mining, which he described as ""energy hungry"" due to its reliance on a distributed base of computers.  Dapp notably made no mention of alternative networks that could support these goals, however, noting only the limitations of current technologies.  He said:  ""Moreover, banks could configure their system in a user-friendlier fashion for less tech-savvy customers and enhance their offer with extra personalised financial services, which the blockchain cannot do as things stand today.""  Invoking trust  The author framed consumer trust as the biggest advantage banks have over more industry-specific startups seeking to build on and popularize the technology.  Dapp argued banks could position themselves as the trusted holder of the cryptographic keys necessary to secure funds on a blockchain.  The post framed regulation as a potential roadblock to a pure P2P financial ecosystem, another advantage for banks, he said, given that the change would require ""considerable discussion"" and lead to ""huge protests"".  Still, he encouraged banks to follow the lead of bitcoin and blockchain industry companies by investigating the potential of the technology further despite a lack of clarity.  ""Traditional banks should not rely on the regulator now,"" he continued, ""but instead actively experiment with the new technologies in their labs and collaborate without prejudice in order to create their own digital ecosystem in the medium run.""

42398565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaD5y,1439210146,What the New Australian Senate Report Means for Bitcoin,"Reuben Bramanathan is associate counsel at Coinbase and Lecturer of Digital Currency Regulation at the University of Nicosia. He was involved with a number of submissions to the Australian Senate inquiry. Here, he explains the importance of the Senate Economics References Committee Report on Digital Currencies and what it means for bitcoin.  The release of the Senate Economics References Committee Report on Digital Currencies marks the start of the next phase for bitcoin in Australia.  The 74-page report, which is the result of 10 months of hearings, submissions and research by the committee, will serve as the roadmap for regulation of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia.  It is the first comprehensive analysis of digital currencies in the context of the Australian legal and financial system, and it indicates the government is focused on the huge potential impact of cryptocurrencies.  Top five things you need to know about the report  It is a committee report, which contains a number of recommendations, but it has not been adopted by the government, and there are no changes to laws or regulations yet.    There is a clear statement of intent to fix the Goods and Services Tax (GST) problem for bitcoin, but the process it will take some time.      Exchanging bitcoin for fiat or other digital currencies does not require any license in Australia, and nor does holding bitcoin on behalf of others. However, providing payment processing or remittance services using digital currency may require an Australian Financial Services Licence.      Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws currently do not apply to digital currencies, but this is likely to change as part of an ongoing review of AML/CTF laws.      Overall, the report recommends a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, notes the importance of balanced regulation and encourages self-regulation in the meantime.    Taxation of bitcoin in Australia  By far the most important aspect of the report is the committee’s recommendation that the GST law should be changed to include digital currencies within the definitions of ‘money’ and ‘financial supply’. This would mean that GST would not apply to bitcoin exchange transactions, and it would only apply once when bitcoin is used to pay for goods or services.  However, this type of change to the GST law would need to be approved by each state, in addition to being legislated by the Federal Parliament. This is a lengthy and political process, and bitcoin is not currently a high priority for federal or state governments. One beacon of hope is the ongoing review of the federal tax system, which may result in broader changes to the GST, and the recommended bitcoin changes could be pushed through together with those changes.  However, this means Australian bitcoin businesses are stuck with the current double-GST problem for the immediate future.  Another unresolved problem is Fringe Benefits Tax, which applies to an employer who pays their employees in bitcoin. This remains a problem for bitcoin startups and their employees who want to avoid the friction of multiple bitcoin/AUD conversions. Addressing this issue needs to be a priority to promote growth of the bitcoin ecosystem in Australia.  Licensing requirements  Australia’s corporate and securities regulator, ASIC, has issued a clear statement that bitcoin is not considered a financial product, which means that no licence is required to exchange bitcoin, or hold bitcoin on behalf of others. The report supports this view and recommends that further research should be undertaken before any changes are made in this area.  However, the areas of payments processing and remittance are less clear. A business operating a payments or remittance service involving bitcoin could be regulated as a ‘non-cash payment facility’, which requires an Australian Financial Services License, or needs to rely on a low-value exemption.  The report endorses industry self-regulation, to develop best practice guidelines and standards for digital currency businesses in Australia. It will be important that these are developed in consultation with the entire industry to provide appropriate guidelines for the different types of business models.  AML and KYC requirements  Currently, bitcoin is not subject to AML/CTF laws in Australia, including know-your-customer (KYC) checks and transaction monitoring and reporting.  The report recommends that the ongoing review of Australia’s AML/CTF laws should consider whether to broaden the laws to include activities involving bitcoin and other digital currencies. The most likely outcome is that, consistent with the approach from around the world (most recently announced in the UK and Singapore) the AML/CTF laws will be expanded to digital currency exchanges.  Although KYC checks are not required at this stage, the report also notes a problem for bitcoin startups which want to voluntarily conduct KYC (for example to prevent fraud and to help strengthen their banking relationships) – they cannot access the Document Verification Service and have to rely on other sources for KYC.  The report notes the difficulty Australian bitcoin businesses are experiencing in establishing and maintaining banking relationships, but, apart from bringing bitcoin businesses under the AML/CTF laws, does not make any real recommendations about how this problem could be addressed.  Overall good news for bitcoin in Australia  The report is a strong endorsement of the potential of digital currency in Australia. Although the GST issue remains a problem, many bitcoin businesses have already adopted business models which do not attract GST.  Importantly, there is no risk of a BitLicense-type regulation in Australia anytime soon.  With a generally tech- and mobile-savvy population and a strong banking system, Australia is becoming an attractive target market for global bitcoin businesses.
