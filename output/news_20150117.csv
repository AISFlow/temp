42377933,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVdh,1421521943,IBM Reveals Proof of Concept for Blockchain-Powered Internet of Things,"IBM has unveiled its proof of concept for ADEPT, a system developed in partnership with Samsung that uses elements of bitcoin’s underlying design to build a distributed network of devices – a decentralized Internet of Things.  The ADEPT concept, or Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, taps blockchains to provide the backbone of the system, utilizing a mix of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to secure transactions.  IBM and Samsung chose three protocols – BitTorrent (file sharing), Ethereum (smart contracts) and TeleHash (peer-to-peer messaging) – to underpin the ADEPT concept. ADEPT was formally unveiled at CES 2015 in Las Vegas.  According to the draft paper, blockchains deployed within the ADEPT system would serve as a ledger of existence for billions of devices that would autonomously broadcast transactions between peers in a three-tier system of peer devices and architecture. By using an implementation of the bitcoin protocol, ADEPT could serve as a bridge between many devices at low cost.  The paper adds:  “Applying the blockchain concept to the world of [Internet of Things] offers fascinating possibilities. Right from the time a product completes final assembly, it can be registered by the manufacturer into a universal blockchain representing its beginning of life. Once sold, a dealer or end customer can register it to a regional blockchain (a community, city or state).""  The draft paper outlines a number of use cases, including several based in domestic settings. When CoinDesk spoke with chief architect Paul Brody in October, he noted that IBM was looking at how, in theory, implementations of the bitcoin protocol could change the way people live, in both big and small ways.  Blockchains in the home  IBM and Samsung envision networks of devices that are capable of autonomously maintaining themselves. In theory, the paper states, appliances in the home would be able to signal operational problems and retrieve software updates on their own. Devices could also use ADEPT to communicate with other nearby devices in order to facilitate power bartering and energy efficiency.  The authors explain:  “We demonstrate how, using ADEPT, a humble washer can become a semi-autonomous device capable of managing its own consumables supply, performing self-service and maintenance, and even negotiating with other peer devices both in the home and outside to optimize its environment.”  “All this is achieved without a central controller orchestrating or mediating between these devices,” the paper adds.  According to the paper, a Samsung W9000 washing machine reconfigured to work within the ADEPT system uses smart contracts to issue commands to a detergent retailer in order to receive new supplies. These contracts give the device the ability to pay for the order itself and later receive word from the retailer that the detergent has been paid for and shipped.  This information would be broadcast to the smartphone of the washer’s owner, a device that would also be connected to that home’s network.  Challenges remain  Certain issues, including scalability and the nature of cryptocurrency development today, are cited as potential challenges for ADEPT should the concept ever be applied on a grander scale.  The ADEPT team addresses the issue of network scalability within the context of a distributed Internet of Things, and according to the authors, there are no clear paths forward to scale the system as-is to incorporate billions of devices, but that work in this area is promising.  They explain:  “Multiple efforts like sidechains, treechains, and mini-blockchains are ongoing to address this problem. While each approach has its merits and demerits we are yet to see consensus on a common approach across the board. A blockchain to cater to hundreds of billions of devices needs to be scalable.”  The paper notes that challenges associated with Ethereum’s existing design as it relates to ADEPT’s proposed infrastructure could pose problems, saying that those concerns “are being addressed” as Ethereum moves toward its planned launch sometime this year. The authors also cited ongoing developments around anonymizing technology for cryptocurrency as potential areas where ADEPT could be impacted.

42377942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVrX,1421517728,11 Top Responses from Andreas Antonopoulos' Reddit AMA,"It’s no secret that social networking website Reddit is a hub for many in the bitcoin community.  While some bitcoiners may stick strictly to the r/bitcoin subreddit, there’s another part of Reddit that has become famous in its own right: ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMA) threads.  AMAs are great opportunities for anyone with an interesting story – ranging from Barack Obama to Bill Gates – to field questions from the community of redditors and provide candid responses that often can’t be found in the traditional press release culture of mainstream media.  A number of prominent figures in the bitcoin industry have already done AMAs: Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Patrick Murck, and now another big name can be added to that list – Andreas Antonopoulos.  Antonopoulos is widely regarded as a trusted voice in the industry, and as such he recently authored a new book ‘Mastering Bitcoin,’ which was published last month by O’Reilly Media.  To promote the book, Antonopoulos took to Reddit as the latest influencer in bitcoin to host an AMA. Here are the top 11 responses:  On bitcoin's scalability:  On favoring bitcoin over altcoins:  On the cause of bitcoin's recent price drop:  On why 'average' people should use bitcoin:  On where he sees bitcoin in one year:  On the centralization of mining:  On non-user friendly bitcoin addresses:  On non-reversible charges:  On bitcoin's volatility:  On VC investments in bitcoin in 2015:  On the first (and last) thing he bought with bitcoin:  Featured image via Tom Sharkey for CoinDesk; Screenshots via Reddit",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | SPONSORED | TRADING,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/17/11-top-responses-from-andreas-antonopoulos-reddit-ama,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b6c0c695902d7e3d8ff101dc23e2c63a4c6bae0-1456x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVbB,1421508770,Tapeke Aims to Be a Dashboard for All Your Bitcoin Transactions,"Having trouble keeping track of your bitcoin transactions? A new service called Tapeke aims to help you keep them organised, across all of your wallets and exchange accounts.  Tapeke  was conceived by Nicolò Maria Lazzarin, one of the original user interface developers for the Hive wallet. Like a Mint.com for cryptocurrency users, it enables users to track bitcoin transactions in various ways – tracking multiple wallets in one interface and allowing them to assign metadata to their bitcoin addresses and transactions.  Users can tag transactions with category tags that they define, for example, and can then graph these categories, so that you could see how much you’ve spent on a particular area over a period of time. You can also tie contacts to particular bitcoin addresses, so that you can see how much you’ve sent over time to Bob, for example.  Courting a mainstream user base  Will Pangman, a bitcoin community organiser and company spokesperson, said that services like Tapeke would appeal to a broader bitcoin user base.  “The user base is definitely there. People are only using bitcoin less than they want to because the tools aren’t there for the masses,” he said, adding:  “Things like the basic conveniences of financial management for a person with bitcoin certainly didn’t exist at all a year ago, and lately they’re getting a bit better, but it still has a long way to go.”  Tapeke isn’t a wallet, but it hopes to complement wallets by providing a dashboard for financial information. One of the areas where Pangman thinks this could be helpful is in monitoring bitcoin ownership for tax purposes, for example.  Several jurisdictions, including the US, have decided to impose capital gains tax on any value accrued on bitcoins in between acquisition and sale. That’s a big administrative overhead for the average user. A tool like this would provide a way of monitoring those changes in value, and it’s a business opportunity that others have already identified.  Third-party integration  To do this effectively, though, the service will have to integrate with many other services.  Mint.com’s developers made significant efforts to court financial institutions for online data feeds. Tapeke will need to interface with several stakeholders, including bitcoin exchanges and wallets. That’s still a work in progress, Pangman conceded.  “In the future, we will have integration with HD wallets and off-chain services, like Circle, Coinbase, and exchange accounts,” he said. “We are limiting ourselves to create occurrences. It could be a platform where any service could be pulled in and managed or analysed by the user with the confidence that they have a secure environment.”  Even Hive Wallet, the founder of which is listed as an adviser to the company, hasn’t undertaken any third-party integration with the service. That's unsurprising, as Hive is a hierarchical deterministic wallet, which is a category of product that Pangman admits that Tapeke hasn't yet figured out integrations for.  Tapeke clearly has some way to go before it achieves the ubiquitous integration that Pangman is hoping for, but he claims that the nascent service is already getting lots of interest.  “We have discussions with companies in the bitcoin space for integrating with us,” he said, adding that the ultimate goal is to give people a single point of access for multiple services, so that they don’t have to handle multiple logins for different cryptocurrency sites.  Expansion plans  Security has been a big concern for the development team, said Pangman. The site comes with three levels of security (basic, medium and advanced), with the top two encrypting user data.  The user data doesn’t include private keys, however, because the service doesn’t use those – storing only public keys in order to watch addresses, not make transactions. The encrypted data in question is the metadata, such as categories and contacts.  This is all part of a bigger plan for the bootstrapped firm, which was formed 12 months ago. In the longer term, it wants to go beyond exchange and wallet integration with an API for third party apps to integrate with. The idea is to create an app store with add-ons that will enhance the service, using events within Tapeke to trigger external actions.  “If I build out the Tapeke account with some app integration, I can set some preferences so that certain activities I perform are triggering certain things that I want,” Pangman said.  He explained:  “So I could set up my Tapeke account to let me know if there’s a 5% slide in the bitcoin price because I want to hedge, and then I could use this or that service.”  The system would also be able to suggest particular services to users based on such events, in the same way that Mint.com can, which is where its profit model comes in, said Pangman.  In the future, the company hopes to expand the service still further, covering altcoins, and perhaps even venturing into applications with custom tokens, should there be the demand.  “We aren’t limiting ourselves to cryptocurrencies. It could be a service where any platform could be pulled in and managed or analysed by the user with the confidence that they will secure this environment,” he said.  First thing’s first, though – Tapeke has to get some funding to start building out these additions to the service, which only went into beta on 1st January. Then, it will be able to put more weight behind a desktop app, which Pangman said is already in the works.
