42383035,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkmF,1574370000,Blockchain Sleuthing Firm Chainalysis Slashes 20% of Workforce,"Chainalysis laid off 39 employees Thursday, about 20 percent of its workforce, as the startup prioritizes turning a profit and bringing products to market.      These across-the-board cuts eliminated positions in nearly every corner of the blockchain analysis firm, said Maddie Kennedy, Chainalysis’ director of communications. The research and development team saw the most cuts. The company's total headcount is now 155.      The downsizing will help put the five-year-old Chainalysis on the “path to profitability,” Kennedy said, allowing the company to shift resources into product teams and a go-to-market strategy.      It's one of the largest layoffs in the industry since the so-called crypto winter of 2018 ended and bitcoin's price, a market bellwether, began climbing earlier this year. Circle let go of 30 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce, in May, and more recently Israeli startup Colu fired 13 people, or 30 percent of its staff.      Chainalysis’ mass layoffs follow a string of seemingly positive announcements for the company, which inspects public cryptocurrency data for clues of illicit activity. One of the most well-known such sleuthing services, it is a longtime stalwart in the U.S. government's crypto investigations.      The U.S. Department of Justice used Chainalysis software to take down the world's largest child pornography site last month, leading to hundreds of arrests and the rescue of 23 children.      Last week the firm held its first industry conference in midtown Manhattan; a week prior it unveiled a new crypto data tool for institutional investors; and in April it closed a Series B funding round with $36 million from backers including Accel and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s largest bank.      Chainalysis has raised $53.6 million total in the years since Jonathan Levin and Michael Gronager started the company in 2014. And it funneled that capital into an aggressive expansion plan that included a research and development office in London – which will remain open – and more hires.      Alongside former government recruits, including a former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) official, hired in June, and three executive-level hires earlier this month, Chainalysis boasted more than 25 open positions when it opened Series B in February.      By its own count, over 140 companies (ranging from crypto exchanges to traditional banks) and 20 governments now use Chainalysis products.      But market conditions necessitated early action, Kennedy said. The layoffs are a preemptive measure, meant to stave off the unexpected, including the possibility of an economic downturn, she said.      “We think that acting now is best for the long-term health of the business,” Kennedy said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/21/blockchain-sleuthing-firm-chainalysis-slashes-20-of-workforce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22aaaa13d87f710420f7ecc8c7dd0916b983bc7c-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkxZ,1574358609,Global Protests Reveal Bitcoin's Limitations,"The Takeaway  Protests in Hong Kong, Lebanon and Iran have forced cypherpunks to test censorship-resistant technologies in the wild.  But protesters on the ground found they lack internet access during times of civil unrest.  Bitcoin has mainly proven useful for receiving value from abroad to hold and privately store.  Sources in Lebanon and Iran said there is scant liquidity, and since they are cut off from global exchange platforms, digital assets are rarely useful as currency.    In the face of censorship and isolation from their countries’ financial and communication systems, protesters across the globe are testing out bitcoin and other decentralized technologies – then promptly discovering their limitations.      Take Hong Hong, for example, where protests began six months ago against China’s infringements on civil liberties and ramped up on Monday at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as police detained 1,000 protesters.      The former British colony would seem the perfect test case for an open-access financial system resistant to government interference. But that may not yet bet the case.      Take for example, HSBC Holdings reportedly shutting down the bank account of Spark Alliance HK, a local nonprofit focused on civic engagement, because it was associated with protests and the bank was allegedly pressured by Beijing. The move reminded protesters and donors of the need to transact privately, one protestor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk. Nonprofits like HKMap Live and Hong Kong Free Press already accept bitcoin donations.      However, the Hong Kong protester added, “there is no [internet] connection in the protest area, no matter which service provider you used,” and protesters are generally not clear on how bitcoin would be used by individuals during a time of civil unrest. It is mostly useful for receiving donations from abroad that don’t require prompt liquidity.      Plus, he said protesters who tried mesh-network devices, which basically bounce a message or transaction across a web of devices until it finds a device with internet access, found they were “not useful for a confrontational situation.” Although many protesters use Telegram because it allows chatting without revealing the users’ phone numbers, he said tools that rely on mobile data providers offer limited functionality in times of turmoil.      As with protests in the Middle East, sources in Hong Kong said bitcoin and related technologies are not ready for usage in chaotic environments because the movement is still nascent and money generally relies on network effects. At this point, censorship-resistant technology can still be censored as long as it remains too niche.      “People are moving their money abroad more,” said one Chinese bitcoiner with family in Hong Kong, who asked that her name be withheld for safety. “But it’s from bank to bank, like Hong Kong accounts to Singapore.”      She added it’s harder to get goods and services, including food imported from mainland China and physical cash, in part because 19 percent of Hong Kong bank branches were closed this week due to the chaos.      Further complicating matters, online discourse in general has been further restricted as the protests rage on.      Hong Kong’s High Court issued an interim injunction in October forbidding people from publishing or circulating information that promotes “the use or threat of violence … on any internet-based platform or medium.” Then on Monday, China’s mainland firewall banned the web browser Kuniao, which was often used to access global social media platforms.    Tehran    Meanwhile in Iran, Revolutionary Guard crackdowns on nationwide protests against rising gas prices and political corruption reportedly left 200 civilians dead and thousands injured.      The Iranian government shut down global internet access for nearly five days (locally hosted websites and services are still operational), and only started to establish limited connectivity again on Thursday.      One Tehran-based bitcoiner, who requested anonymity for safety, was arrested at a protest for taking photos then promptly released. Police searched his phone, including social chats, apps and photos, he said. So he now routinely deletes Twitter direct messages from other bitcoiners.      This bitcoiner has a personal server abroad, and was able to jerry-rig limited internet access through it. According to Bitnodes, there are just six bitcoin nodes operating in Iran.      “I made a secure encryption protocol between data centers and a mobile network,” he said. “I bypassed several servers and networks to reach the edge servers. … Now I have a 100Mbps connection.”      Despite regaining some level of connectivity, he said his bitcoin wallet apps and mobile apps like Telegram are still blocked. It’s especially difficult for Iranians to access foreign servers and infrastructure because many companies ban Iranians for fear of U.S. sanctions.      “We're locked up in a prison that the U.S. and Iranian governments have built for us,” he said, adding the Blockstream bitcoin satellite and mesh network technologies aren’t useful when you’re in a massive internet desert. “In situations where we don't have physical connection none of these fucking technologies help us,” he said.      After all, even if he got a transaction through, there are too few tech-savvy recipients to make digital transactions a worthwhile use of his time.      “We need a simple way to connect our devices together,” the anonymous protester said. “We need secure and accessible communication for people.”      This point highlights yet another lesson learned by protestors in Lebanon: Black markets are vulnerable to infiltration from within.    Beirut    On Tuesday, Lebanese protesters took over Beirut's Nejmeh Square and stopped parliament from meeting, spurred by a local banking crisis and government corruption.      Lebanese bitcoin trades, predominantly facilitated through WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook, continue normally with a slight premium. Trading is hampered, according to such group chats, by limited cash access from local banks and financial institutions.      After a week of shuttering branches, the banks reopened this week with a $1,000 withdrawal limit. On Thursday, protesters reportedly entered the central bank to demonstrate that these measures are perceived as the government doing too little, too late to quell the currency crisis.      As one anonymous bitcoin trader said: “There’s no access to liquidity.”    Two weeks ago, a few bitcoin traders found hackers had accessed their mobile phones and stolen cryptocurrency. Local social groups brimmed with concerns about which anonymous trader accounts could be trusted. As reported by the local outlet VDL Newshttps://www.vdlnews.com/lebanon-news/private-vdl/2019-10-23-14-51-38, the alleged hacker may have knowledge of the victims’ location and access to a network run by the telecommunications company Touch, because the hack involved intercepting messages at the service level. (Two exchanges associated with the alleged victims denied any hack to their systems on this date.)    “They can hijack WhatsApp, Telegram [accounts],” one alleged hacking victim said. “That means you can’t trust your mobile identity. … They [hackers] can create trouble between parties, fake accounts and impersonation.”      So this hack served as a wake-up call to the local community. In short, there is no substitute for in-person networking and long-standing relationships. Without them, the privacy created by avatars is also a liability.    Impractical anarchists    In all three contexts, current bitcoin infrastructure was found to be insufficient.      While this may be expected of a nascent technology, across user groups the common need was for accessibility.      Both the Chinese and Iranian bitcoiners who spoke to CoinDesk pointed out that most people don’t have the skills, nor the desire, to go “the anarchist route,” as the Chinese bitcoiner put it. The Hong Kong protester added that “most protesters don’t know how to make use of bitcoin in this [activist] context.”      When it’s available, Hong Kong civilians still rely on traditional financial institutions, the Chinese bitcoiner said. LocalBitcoins data on peer-to-peer bitcoin trades in Hong Kong and Iran don’t show any relative spikes, reflecting the same narrative from over-the-counter Lebansese traders. Many bitcoiners prefer to stay deep underground these days, another Tehran-based bitcoiner said, fearful of attracting the attention of authorities on the hunt for people to suspect and arrest.      Scattered and fragmented communities offer scant liquidity on the ground. Broader adoption leads to better usability and privacy, even if only by helping bitcoiners get lost in the crowd.      After all, if bitcoin were more popular in Tehran then users might not fear that usage would attract attention. A third anonymous Iranian source, currently abroad yet deeply involved with the Tehran bitcoin community, said there is a significant legal threat to locals helping neighbors bypass internet censorship.      “People who have servers (hosting websites, etc) in Iran have received SMS mentioning that hosting, selling or distributing any VPN service or proxy in order to access filtered websites (such as Telegram) is illegal … encouraging them to tell on those that are doing so,” he said. “BTS tower SMS-CB technology has been used to send SMS to people in certain areas to leave.”      In these cases, bitcoin has proven most useful to store wealth or receive funds from abroad. Transacting locally is risky. One Lebanses bitcoiner who thwarted a hacker said that luckily he stores half of his savings in a bitcoin hardware wallet, which kept it safe.      “I find it ironic that the first world talks about how bitcoin is freedom to the unbanked, but the unbanked have no way to get bitcoin,” he said. “Bitcoin feels like a novelty at times, or a privilege.”      In fact, Lebanese entrepreneur Dany Moussa told CoinDesk his homeland is predominantly a cash society, so even credit and debit cards might have a learning curve for some. It should also be noted that chatter in Lebanese groups shows hardware wallets don’t always work as designed, so users often need to help each other fix them.      “I think we are still far from serious adoption of crypto in Lebanon for many reasons,” Moussa said. “Lebanese [people] do not have access to exchanges due to restrictions adopted by [Lebanon’s central bank] and lack of coverage from [outside] exchanges.”      When global crypto exchanges and service providers ban a population due to sanctions or compliance concerns, as they have with Iranians and Lebanese people to some extent, ties to global communities can provide a lifeline. Across the board, sources said that connectivity and accessibility on the ground were the two fundamental challenges.      Money is, after all, primarily a social construct. The dream of a lone anarchist striking out only works if his goal is to flee, not stay.      “Consider two or three people who can communicate with the Blockstream satellites, what would be the benefit [of using bitcoin]?” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “Not all people are hackers and network experts. … When we talk about a payment network it must have a significant number of members.”      Hong Kong protest image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/21/global-protests-reveal-bitcoins-limitations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/140ca30b0c9ad84d7f0bc7534245fd367d02f823-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tktn,1574346633,Orchid's Decentralized VPN Network Set for Early-December Launch,"A token-powered internet privacy project is launching in a matter of weeks.      Decentralized virtual private network (VPN) provider Orchid will debut its app, network and token (OXT) during the first week of December.      “The thing we’re most excited about now is to be launching one of the first really consumer-facing experiences where the use of this native token is essential for the operation of the application,” Orchid CEO Steven ""Seven"" Waterhouse said in an interview.      Users pay node operators for bandwidth using OXT tokens, which will be generated at launch. Additionally, the system relies on a staking model.      “Orchid is a bandwidth market where node providers stake tokens to advertise their services using the Ethereum blockchain,” the company wrote in a new white paper published this week.      Waterhouse said Orchid will have between five and 10 node providers at launch, including players from both the traditional VPN world and “new entrants from the crypto space.”      “Our intention with this initial group was to bootstrap the beginnings of the system,” Waterhouse said.      VPNs are used by millions worldwide to browse the internet anonymously and circumvent state controls over which sites can be accessed. The VPN space itself offers a stark reminder of the ills of centralized authority in the 21st century.      Orchid raised at least $48 million through a series of investment rounds and SAFT deals dating back to 2017. Major investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital and VC giant Sequoia.      “We have known the Orchid team since 2014, and were a few of the earliest investors and advisors since the beginning of 2017,” Blockchain Capital managing partner Brad Stephens told CoinDesk. “Orchid has always been a stand-out project that perfectly illustrates the importance of decentralization. The areas of VPNs and secure communications need to be decentralized, thus supra-sovereign, in order to guarantee privacy from nation-state surveillance or interference.”      But challenges remain in driving wholesale adoption of token-based platforms.      A source in the investment community without any stake in Orchid told CoinDesk, “One of the major lessons learned from 2017-2019 was that utility tokens and proprietary payment tokens, like Orchid's OXT, don't provide a strong incentive to pull in millions of users, and without those users, they have a hard time capturing meaningful value.”      For his part, Waterhouse says the Orchid team has been building with real-world people in mind from Day 1.      “From the very beginning, we were focused on how do we build this consumer experience in the Web3 world,” he said.      The goal, he added, is to “build user experiences that are going to delight and give people an easy and understandable way to control their privacy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/21/orchids-decentralized-vpn-network-set-for-early-december-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf9b13a7ce025c6ff440baa3ea466392166bad70-1962x1105.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383046,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkwJ,1574344800,Maker of Wasabi Bitcoin Wallet Valued at $7.5M in First Equity Round,"The privacy-centric bitcoin wallet Wasabi, launched by zkSNACKs Ltd. in 2018, just raised its first equity investment from Cypherpunk Holdings, a publicly-traded Canadian firm.      Cypherpunk Holdings CEO Dominic Frisby said the firm invested $337,500 in exchange for a 4.5 percent stake, valuing the wallet startup at $7.5 million.      “It’s extraordinary for a tech company, this early in its evolution, to have the revenues that Wasabi already has,” Frisby said. “It’s one of the only forms of a crypto wallet that have a revenue model.”      Although the zkSNACKs team didn’t respond to requests for comment, co-founder Adam Fiscor previously told CoinDesk the company’s mixer transaction fees earned 14 bitcoin in July 2019 alone (roughly $112,000 by current prices). It appears Wasabi Wallet processed at least 5,373 mixed CoinJoins in July, August and early September. If that trend continued for 12 months, it would put revenues at over $1 million.      This newest addition rounds out Cypherpunk’s holdings, which include roughly 2,000 monero and 180 bitcoin, Frisby said, in addition to equity in the rival privacy project Samourai Wallet (valued at $6.6 million, based on Cypherpunk’s $100,000 investment for 1.5 percent equity) and the blockchain startup Chia, founded by cypherpunk legend Bram Cohen.      “Both wallets, and privacy-enabling services, have very impressive network effects in that the more participants there are, the more private each participant is,” Cypherpunk’s CIO Moe Adham said. “Wasabi is well-positioned to capture much of that market … not only for personal use but also for enterprises.""      Frisby said the fund was initially focused on providing exposure to privacy coins, but found scant traction among assets like zcash and quickly pivoted to projects that boost privacy for the bitcoin network.      “We want to make two or three more privacy-tech investments, looking at things like VPNs, messaging systems, that type of thing,” he said, adding the firm is looking to deploy a large chunk of its $1.4 million in fiat holdings by mid-2020.      In a press release, zkSNACKs CEO Bálint Harmat said these new shareholders as strategic partners helping “make Bitcoin fungible.”      All things considered, this round proves an open-source product can go from a bootstrapped volunteer project that paid contributors with donated and earned bitcoin, all the way to VC-backed startup in roughly two years, pioneering a bitcoin-centric business model.      “You just can’t underestimate the network effect of bitcoin,” Frisby said.

The companies announced Thursday that Curv would be responsible for helping Franklin Templeton build the transaction signing and management system for its fund. Curv, which developed a series of multi-party computation protocols, seeks to remove the need for private keys, which it calls a ""single point of failure"" on a blockchain platform, according to a press release.      Itay Malinger, Curv CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk that his company's software solution would also help the company scale its system.      ""[Franklin Templeton] needs an infrastructure stack that will first of all secure the assets right, because it's a public blockchain, and also be able to manage a scale of tens or hundreds of thousands of addresses,"" he said.      These addresses will either be associated with an end customer or with a processing point.      Franklin Templeton first revealed in September that it planned to track the shares of its fund using the Stellar blockchain, though there are no plans to actually invest in any cryptocurrencies.      Malinger said the firm is one of the first to tokenize its shares directly on a public blockchain.    Maintaining security    Curv's tools will be able to be able to communicate with the Stellar network, on top of its security features. The issue for financial institutions is that they need a platform that can manage the accounting and other regulatory requirements, Malinger said.      These regulatory issues stretch across different jurisdictions as well, he said.      ""If I'm a traditional finance player and I want to enter this thing called blockchain, I want to start either creating bitcoin or I want to be able to tokenize this security,"" he said.      In a statement, Franklin Templeton executive vice president Roger Bayston said another concern for his firm was maintaining clients' trust.      ""We expect blockchain to play a big part of business going forward and we need partners that enable and build trust to grow investor adoption of digital assets,"" he said.      Curv's software solution best met the firm's security and scaling needs, according to the statement.      “In comparison to traditional tech stacks evaluated, Curv’s cryptography changes what is possible in digital asset custody, delivering to our clients instant availability and total autonomy over their investments,"" Bayston said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | XLM,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/21/franklin-templeton-taps-wallet-service-provider-to-support-tokenized-shares,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/376527c9299b7892c019d4aa0e66d579c33d0650-1272x818.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkol,1574335862,"Bitcoin Slips to One-Month Price Lows Below $8,000","View  Bitcoin's drop to four-week lows has confirmed a bearish continuation pattern on the hourly chart.  Indicators on the three-day chart are calling a deeper drop to key average support at $7,714.  A high-volume bounce from the $7,751–$7,714 support range would neutralize the immediate bearish setup.  A violation of the lower-highs setup with a move above $8,631 is needed to confirm a bull reversal.    Having dropped to one-month lows below $8,000, bitcoin is now eyeing the first test of a key average support, now at $7,714, since April.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell more than 2.4 percent in the 60 minutes to 08:00 UTC today to hit a low of $7,875 – a level last seen on Oct. 25, according to Bitstamp data. The drop marked a downside break of a 48-hour narrowing price range seen above $8,000.      Notably, with a slide to levels below $7,900, bitcoin has erased 80 percent of the rally from $7,293 to $10,350 seen in the second half of October.      On a month-to-date basis, he cryptocurrency is now reporting a loss of over 13 percent. Further, the cryptocurrency is trading in the red for the fourth straight week.      The dismal performance contradicts the positive seasonality factor: bitcoin has put on a good show in November in six out of the last eight years. Notably, prices gained for six straight years in November, starting from 2012 to 2017, before falling hard in November 2018.      The hefty month-to-date losses also contradict historical data which show bitcoin picks up a strong bid six months ahead of the miners' reward halving, a supply cut next scheduled for May 2020.      That said, the repeated failure to hold above a descending (bearish) 5-month MA in the first eight days of the month had raised the possibility of a drop to $8,000.      The technical charts are now calling further decline to support at $7,714 – the 100-candle moving average on the three day chart. That would be the first test of the crucial average support since the end of April.      As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,920 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.30 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.    Hourly and 3-day charts    The contracting triangle breakdown seen on the hourly chart is backed by a solid rise in trading volumes and indicates a resumption of the downtrend.      The MACD histogram on the three-day chart, an indicator used to identify trend changes and strength, has dropped below zero, confirming a bearish bias. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading.      BTC, therefore, looks set to test the three-day 100-candle MA at $7,714. Note that the ascending (bullish) 10-month MA is also located at $7,751.      As a result, $7,751–$7,714 is the key support range for BTC. A strong bounce from there to levels above $8,000 would neutralize the immediate bearish view.    8-hour chart    The series of lower highs and lower lows seen on the 8-hour chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.      A short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if and when prices rise above the Nov. 17 high of $8,631, invalidating the bearish lower-highs setup.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/21/bitcoin-slips-to-one-month-price-lows-below-8000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94a6ed61c1909794c84c918ca921e0177d350523-1500x945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkcB,1574330400,Silvergate Bank CEO Bets on Higher Crypto Price Volatility After $40M IPO,"Crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank is spending cash from its initial public offering this month to expand its offerings, anticipating higher cryptocurrency price volatility will fuel rising trading volumes and deposits.      In an interview, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said the IPO is providing fresh capital for new products to meet the rising demand from institutions for full cryptocurrency lending and deposit solutions.      Lane said that greater price volatility could bring more price differentials and profit opportunities to crypto markets. That would lead traders to increase dollar deposits with Silvergate.      “We don't predict when it will happen but we know that there might be an additional period where the volatility drives up volumes, and want to make sure that we can help our customers when that happens,” he said.      One potential catalyst could be the bitcoin block reward getting cut in half in the next year, Lane said, with the idea that a decrease of new supply could boost the price. Other events might include regulatory approval of exchange-traded funds for crypto, hard forks that create new breakaway currencies such as bitcoin cash, or high-profile hacks of crypto exchanges that affect sentiment.      “In our experience, it's not so much about the absolute price of the asset, but rather the volatility in the price where we actually see potential changes in the behavior of some of our customers,” Lane said.    Expanding product line    The California-based commercial bank plans to launch a cryptocurrency lending product in the fourth quarter and settlement and custody services for fiat currencies and digital assets by June 2020 at the latest.      Two of its biggest profit generators are transaction fees from trading and yields on the investments it makes using client deposits, Lane said, with the fresh capital offsetting its investment in new products for those areas.      The new lending product, set to be launched in fourth quarter 2019, would be part of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) – a payment system designed for crypto exchanges and their big clients to transfer funds in the network.      It would enable clients to borrow fiat currencies from the bank using bitcoin holdings as collateral, according to Lane.      The bank decided to add the settlement and custody services within six months after launching the lending product because of the growing demand from its client base, he said.      “We've already been working with the New York DFS, and submitted an application with them to form a New York licensed trust company for our settlement and custody services,” Lane said. Other New York-chartered trust companies in the crypto market include Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Asset Services.      Overall, Silvergate is among a very short list of U.S. financial institutions that are banking crypto institutions. They include Metropolitan Commercial Bank, Signature Bank, and Cross River Bank.      Silvergate’s clientele is approximately 60 percent U.S. and 40 percent international entities, Lane said.    Banking basics    Silvergate Bank was formed as a traditional commercial bank in Southern California in 1988, but started pivoting in 2013 to serve crypto exchanges, startups and institutional investors.      Lane said that the decision to enter the crypto market was simple: “Our loans were growing faster than our deposits, we were just looking for other sources of deposits.”      He said that today its balance sheet is still deep enough to support much more loan volume from crypto customers.      The bank doubled deposits in 2017 and more than tripled the client base since it started banking crypto-related businesses, according to its IPO filing.      Prior to the IPO, Silvergate had raised $114 million through a private placement in February 2018. Nine months later, Silvergate agreed to sell its San Marcos, CA, retail branch and its business lending team to Seattle-based commercial bank HomeStreet.      That sale, completed in March 2019, included the reduction of $115.4 million in loans and $74.5 million in deposits, but resulted in a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million, according to the IPO filing.      Lane said the deal was part of the bank’s effort to shift more toward its crypto businesses, as well as pay for investments to bolster that side.      “We’re essentially bringing the legacy banking system that only operates 40 hours a week during business hours into the 24/7 crypto markets that never sleep,” he said.    IPO    Silvergate Bank listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SI, via a $40 million initial public offering on Nov. 7.      The bank completed its IPO on Nov. 12, raising approximately $10 million from issuing 824,605 common shares, while existing shareholders reaped $30 million from selling 2.5 million of their shares.      The shareholders, which include Bankcap Partners, a Dallas, TX,-based private equity firm and Park West Asset Management, may exercise a greenshoe option to sell up to 499,999 additional shares in November, according to the IPO filing.      Silvergate Bank’s shares debuted at $12 on the NYSE and were trading at $16.35 on Wednesday, valuing the company at $319 million.      “We know that the last time there was a big bull market in crypto, our deposits surged and that's part of the reason to go public, in case we have another big growth spurt and we need capital,” Lane said. “Now that we're public, we have more efficient access to capital to support our growth.""",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/21/silvergate-bank-ceo-bets-on-higher-crypto-price-volatility-after-40m-ipo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3896ee7d0f100ad863524781dc363b0d33add388-1500x851.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkhD,1574326800,The Surprising Reason Why Blockstack May File for an IPO,"Blockchain startup Blockstack is currently evaluating how to issue new tokens for general miners.      “The issuance of new tokens is the main issue here,” Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk. “Because within the U.S. we’re treating STX [tokens] as securities, if new tokens are being minted by the protocol and they’re being released in the ecosystem, we need a legal framework for them.”      That framework could include an initial public offering (IPO), he said.      In September, Blockstack became the first blockchain startup in the U.S. to raise money through a token offering approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Planning to activate the process of “mining” on the Blockstack blockchain early next year, Ali explained there are a few different ways new tokens could be issued to miners in a similarly legally-compliant and regulated way.      First, the company could issue stacks (STX) tokens to miners under a Regulation S offering. Under Regulation S, Blockstack would be free to mint new STX on the blockchain and issue STX to active miners on the platform without needing to receive approval from the SEC.      Granted, this also means mining on Blockstack would be restricted to non-U.S. persons and most likely locked for a period of a year and a day.      “That’s one way of starting mining [on Blockstack], which won’t be ideal in the sense that we don’t want to exclude U.S. people from it,” Ali said.      According to the blockchain attorney that represented Blockstack for its 2019 token offering, Robert H. Rosenblum of law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, there is the possibility of offering newly issued tokens to miners in the U.S. under an alternative category called Regulation D.      However, all miners under Regulation D must be accredited investors. What’s more, these investors would not be able to receive STX through mining for at least a year and a day.      To avoid such complications and open up miner participation to all interested persons in the U.S., Blockstack could host a second Regulation A token offering. While this would open up miner participation to both accredited and non-accredited investors in the U.S., Blockstack would be restricted to an issuance cap.      “The big problem with a Reg A offering is that you can’t sell more than $50 million worth of assets in any 12-month period,” said Rosenblum.      Once the process of mining launches on the Blockstack blockchain next year, the issuance of new STX tokens could exceed the $50 million limit, which is why Ali told CoinDesk he is considering a fourth option.      That is, taking the company public.    Going public    The fourth alternative is to file a Form S-1 with the SEC.      This would be equivalent to conducting an IPO for the company (as several other cryptocurrency startups have attempted in the last two months.)      Blockstack stated as much in its offering circular filed to the SEC in July:    “We currently anticipate registering the initial distributions of mined Stacks Tokens under the Securities Act using Form S-1, with the tokens initially being delivered to a wallet that we own so that we can require miners to make appropriate securities laws representations before they receive the mined tokens, as well as ensure our compliance with anti-money laundering laws and know-your-customer requirements.”    While registering STX as publicly-traded shares in the U.S. does open up participation for general mining to U.S. persons, Ali said going through with an IPO requires “a lot more work” than the other options.      For starters, even with the SEC’s approval to conduct an IPO, Blockstack would likely need to receive additional state-by-state approval to issue newly mined STX tokens.      While this is not a requirement of traditional securities, cryptocurrencies according to Rosenblum fall into “a strange category” of securities law requiring the approval of state securities regulators as well as federal.      “It will be expensive but no one knows for sure how much it’s going to cost to deal with various states,” Rosenblum said. “No one knows for sure if every state is even going to give their approval. It’s possible that if you did a registered offering for Form S-1, you would be approved to sell in some but not every state.”      Even so, Rosenblum views the approval of an S-1 for a blockchain startup as simply a matter of time given the continuous growth of the industry. Whether Blockstack will be the first U.S.-based blockchain startup to go public is an unanswered question. (Note: The INX crypto exchange filed to go public in August but its IPO has yet to be declared effective. The U.S. IPO for Chinese bitcoin miner maker Canaan was deemed effective by the SEC on Wednesday.)      “I would say we are far from deciding on any option right now,” said Ali.    Playing the long game    Outside of Regulations S, D, A and taking the company public, blockchain attorney Matthew E. Kohen said there is a possibility in the long-term of U.S. regulators deeming Blockstack’s STX token as no longer a security.      “At which point, a lot of these ongoing requirements Blockstack has to deal with disappear,” said Kohen.      Blockstack states as much in its initial offering circular by disclosing that the company itself could determine that STX “are no longer securities for purposes of federal securities laws.”      “We anticipate [this] to occur sometime in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021, within a year following the introduction of mining to the Blockstack network,” the offering circular states.      How Blockstack would go about making this determination and which U.S. regulators would bless such a decision is presently unclear, Kohen said.      At the same time, issuance of tokens through mining is a murky subject matter altogether, according to Rosenblum, who sees “a massive gulf” between what the SEC has said and what they’ve actually done in terms of enforcement.      “It’s difficult to understand and reconcile that the SEC views most or virtually all tokens – other than bitcoin, ether, possibly EOS and a few others – as securities with their absolute reluctance and failure to take any action on all sorts of cryptocurrency issuers that do pay miners [in the U.S.] currently but have not registered those tokens,” Rosenblum said. “Where is the SEC in all of this? What are they doing?”      Still, in light of what the SEC has previously done and stated especially on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, the possibility remains for STX to one day be categorized as a commodity asset rather than a security.      Even so, Ali explained that Blockstack will only activate mining under a clear legal framework in order to avoid regulatory uncertainty.      “What we solved for with the Reg A was how to do an offering where the general public can participate. Turning mining on has related issues but it’s not the same problem. It’s a different problem,” Ali said. “The end framework [for mining] might end up looking different.”      Update (Nov. 21, 16:02 UTC): The U.S. IPO for Chinese bitcoin miner maker Canaan opened Wednesday as this story was being prepared for publication.
