42381590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nRzB,1550781018,"Don't Expect Bitcoin's Supply to Change, Says Core Maintainer Wlad van der Laan","Wladimir van der Laan, the lead maintainer of bitcoin's most widely used software, has harsh words for those engaged in an ongoing debate about whether the cryptocurrency's finite supply will ever be increased.  A soft-spoken developer from The Netherlands, van der Laan is usually hesitant to enter the fray. Yet, he responded fiercely to the idea on Twitter last week. Specifically responding to allegations that bitcoin's developer team was planning to increase the supply, he declared: ""This is bullshit. It's sad that this needs to be said, but no one in their right mind proposes changing bitcoin's monetary policy.""  Despite the fact that the software is programmed to issue 21 million bitcoins, an aspect of the code that would require everyone running the bitcoin software update to change, that hasn't stopped speculation over the years that an adjustment might be needed. Most recently, developer Matt Huong floated the idea of increasing the supply of bitcoins in circulation – very informally – just as a possible way to reduce future fees.  The comments were later inflamed by a misunderstanding, sparked by a single social media post from bitcoin's annual Satoshi Roundtable event, an invite-only conference where CEOs, socialites and developers gather and discuss the future of the cryptocurrency.  Adding to the confusion, Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of bitcoin mining pool BTC.TOP, inaccurately argued on Chinese microblogging site Weibo that developers have long been planning to increase the supply.  Given the nature of the debate – a key part of bitcoin's value proposition has been derived from the fact that it's a scarce asset – all of the incidents above have inflamed Twitter conversations.  Now, in an interview with CoinDesk, van der Laan is speaking out anew about the issue, telling CoinDesk:  ""[Raising the supply] is anti-economic, [and it] goes against human psychology. I don't think people will generally choose to deliberately devaluate something they own. Let alone when the price is already at a low.""  An important figure most visible to bitcoin's open-source developer community, van der Laan leads a weekly meeting over the chat program IRC to discuss the project's technical roadmap. Further, he and the other maintainers Jonas Schnelli and Marco Falke are the last line of defense when checking new changes added to bitcoin's code.  Undermining utility  Still, van der Laan sees such a stance as one that advocates for diminishing not just bitcoin's value, but one of its core features setting it apart from other digital projects. ""Scarcity is not a natural thing in the digital realm. Copying is natural,"" he said.  As an example, he pointed to digital rights management (DRM), where companies employ technologies to try to stop users from copying digital files by adding technology to the files to track them or make the files hard to copy. But these schemes are often broken over time, giving people the ability to copy files all over again.  As van der Laan put it, trying to keep files scarce ""fails again and again.""  That's why bitcoin's unique, he said. Bitcoins are scarce, unlike so many other digital things.  He continued:  ""Bitcoin is an interesting experiment in that it does try to assert digital scarcity, by *making everyone check* that there is no cheating — not by developers, not by miners, not even by the [National Security Agency].""  That's not to say there might not be problems with the rules bitcoin initially implemented.  ""One could argue [bitcoin creator] Satoshi's initial rules are more or less arbitrary, but as they're fixed and deterministic they're predictable and easy to project forward and price in,"" van der Laan said.  In his eyes, now that the rules on issuance are here, they're here to stay.  ""The challenge here is to keep scarcity, everything else is easy and automatic,"" he added.  Leaderless currency  But there's another key part of this whole discussion.  The key contention from Zhuoer was that bitcoin's developers agreed to increase the supply and were making plans to, as if changing this property of bitcoin was something they could do with a snap of their fingers.  That's a controversial proposition. Due to how bitcoin technology works – or is supposed to work – bitcoin doesn't have a set of leaders which can decide to change how the cryptocurrency works on a whim. It's leaderless and that's what sets it apart from other currencies. (Van der Laan's position is even described on the Bitcoin Core website as ""janitorial."")  Van der Laan argued that if the developers behind Bitcoin Core ever tried to push through such a thing, people shouldn't follow them.  ""If the software claiming to be 'Bitcoin Core' ever proposes this, I'd recommend you run software without this change as it's been compromised,"" he said in his initial tweet.  When CoinDesk asked how much power the volunteer group of developers around the currency, Bitcoin Core, has - and if the developers could conceivably push through a supply increase if they decided to do so - he elaborated: ""I certainly *hope* that's not the case. I've always tried to prevent this.""  ""The moment one team of developers becomes immune to controversy (i.e. people will even follow them unquestionably through forks, even calling those 'upgrades') the system is essentially centralized,"" he argued, clearly alluding to other cryptocurrencies who have made sweeping changes to their code.  Ethereum has gone through several hard forks over the last couple of years. And the community looks at each of them as a suite of ""upgrades"" for improving the technology, rather than as possible points of centralization, as Van der Laan does.  Wladimir thinks bitcoin is more decentralized in this way.  He stated:  ""Given that even small consensus level change proposals can trigger huge discussions on Twitter [and] Reddit. I think bitcoin is in a better state than, say, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency in that regard.""

42381594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nS1h,1550773813,Digital Asset's Europe Head Is Latest to Leave Enterprise Blockchain Startup,"The upheaval continues at enterprise blockchain company Digital Asset (DA), with the news that Gavin Wells will step down from his role as head of Europe next month.  Oliver Hugh-Jones, head of business development for Europe, will assume all of Wells' client-facing responsibilities, a spokeswoman for DA confirmed to CoinDesk Thursday. Wells' departure was reported earlier by Risk, a financial industry publication.  “I joined Digital Asset to learn about the technology, but I stayed because of the people I met there,” Wells told the magazine.  It is not clear where he will go. Before joining the company, Wells had senior foreign exchange positions at British clearing house LCH and global megabank Citigroup.  Key departures  Just over a week ago CoinDesk revealed that James Powell, CIO and CTO of engineering at Digital Asset, had left the software company. Powell’s responsibilities at DA were assumed by Shaul Kfir, the CTO of architecture and a member of the founding team.   These moves came in the wake of CEO Blythe Masters stepping down in December. Her departure surprised many in the enterprise blockchain industry, since the Wall Street veteran was considered the very personification of DA, and, to some degree, of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) space itself.  DA is seen as something of a bellwether for industrial-grade DLT upgrades and integration thanks to its undertaking to replace the Australian Stock Exchange’s (ASX) CHESS clearing and settlement system. Although the deadline for that project has been pushed back to early 2021, ASX told CoinDesk in an interview last year that Masters’ departure would not impact its timeline.  The 175-employee DA has also been hiring. Zohar Hod, a trading technology veteran, was brought in as its chief strategy officer, coinciding with Powell’s departure. Hod reports to co-founder and chief operating officer Yuval Rooz.

42381588,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nRwf,1550768557,AngelList Spin-Off CoinList Announces First Token Sale of 2019,"Token launch platform CoinList is rolling out its first offering of 2019.  Announced Thursday, Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data-sharing protocol, is aiming to raise $8 million at 25 cents a token through the CoinList platform. The sale starts March 1 and is open to accredited U.S. investors and international buyers.  It’s the first token sale on CoinList since July 2018, when Origin Protocol set out to raise $6.6 million. CoinList, an AngelList spin-off that claims to offer an SEC-compliant issuing platform, says regulatory jitters in the marketplace have contributed to a token-sale slowdown.  “Some sales happened on our platform in the middle of last year, and then we found that effectively no high-quality potential clients wanted to run public sales at the end of 2018,” CoinList co-founder and president Andy Bromberg told CoinDesk. “What we're seeing now is an array of great issuers looking to do sales in early 2019.”  CoinList has always maintained there is a compliant way to run token sales in the U.S., a point it reasserted with a blog post following SEC actions against Airfox and Paragon last November. According to the company, 50 teams have already used the platform to raise $450 million.  For its part, Ocean’s ambition is to democratize access to artificial intelligence and the datasets that make it powerful.  ""The time is right to kick start a new data economy,” Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol’s founder, said in a statement, adding:  “Our token launch sets us in the right direction to continue to build so that more people can unlock the value of data, continuously expanding the effect of the data economy.""  The protocol is supported by a Singapore-based non-profit that raised 16 million euros in a pre-launch token sale in March 2018. Pon told CoinDesk the token wasn't released at the time so as to comply with U.S securities laws.  ""We can only release the token (OCEAN) when there is utility value – which happens to be now,"" Pon said. ""The old token ticker OCN got taken by a different project so we went with OCEAN instead.""  CoinList’s Bromberg expects token sales on the site to ramp up significantly in 2019. “Now that the market has calmed down, top teams are ready to begin distributing their token and raising money from a broader audience,” he told CoinDesk.

In an announcement Thursday, Banco BTG Pactual said it will back its blockchain-based token with distressed Brazilian real estate assets, with the expectation of raising up to $15 million. It will also establish a secondary market following the sale in order to provide liquidity to the tokens.    The offering will allow investors to invest in the Brazilian real estate market and, based on the performance of the tied assets, receive periodic profits. International investors will be able to purchase the token, called ReitBZ (RBZ), through a ""low-cost, tax-efficient structure,"" said the bank.      BTG Pactual CEO, Roberto Sallouti, said:      ""The technology associated with this offering allows us to be a pioneer in providing access to asset classes that have historically been difficult for global retail investors to access. We are constantly exploring innovative ways to promote, democratize and encourage the development of financial and capital markets.”            For the sale, BTG Pactual is partnering with the Winklevoss-founded Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini) to utilize its regulated U.S.-dollar backed stablecoin, the Gemini dollar, to receive investment capital and distribute dividends over the ethereum blockchain.  “The tokenization of real assets is a major step forward in the evolution of the crypto economy. ... Working with BTG Pactual to leverage the Gemini dollar as the stablecoin for ReitBZ helps move the industry in the right direction,"" said Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss.    The token's portfolio will comprise town properties in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The bank aims to include properties that have been ""impacted"" by the economic recession in Brazil and now offer ""potentially significant economic upside,"" according to the announcement.      The bank said it will comply with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Residents of Brazil, the U.S. and possibly other countries will not be able to invest through the offering.    The news come just days after JPMorgan it is launching its own digital currency called JPM Coin. The token was developed in-house and is moving to real-world trials in coming months.  For the trial, JPM Coin will be used to settle a small portion of its $6 trillion daily transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business in real time.  JPM Coin will initially run on top of Quorum, the private version of ethereum the bank developed in conjunction with EthLab, but could later extended to other blockchain networks, the bank said at the time.

Wilsons Auctions announced Monday that it has signed an agreement with the federal government of Belgium to hold an auction of the crypto funds with no reserve, including 104.99 each of bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin gold (BTG).  The total market value of the cryptocurrencies is around $431,660 at the time of writing.  “The bitcoins were seized by the Belgium police as a result of a drug trafficking case in which the criminals used the DarkNet to sell drugs,” Wilsons Auctions said.  The international auction will start at 12 noon (GMT) on March 1, with the cryptocurrencies divided into lots, the release states. The bitcoin will be sold in 0.5–4 BTC lots, while the BCH and BTG will be offered in larger lots.  This is not the first time Wilsons has held an auction of cryptocurrencies. Last month, it sold off 167.7 monero (XMR) tokens, which had been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act by a U.K. law enforcement agency.  Aidan Larkin, Wilsons’ head of asset recovery, said at the time that the monero auction received interest from 69 countries and that “following over 700 bids from registered participants, the final value realized was above the market value of monero for that day.”  The U.S. Marshals Service has also previously held several major crypto auctions.

42381595,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nS4D,1550754654,QuadrigaCX Has Sent All Its Bitcoin and Ether to 'Big Four' Auditor EY,"QuadrigaCX's online wallets for bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have nearly been emptied and the funds sent to the failed cryptocurrency exchange's court-appointed monitor, Ernst & Young (EY).  In its second report on the case, published Thursday, EY confirmed that, as expected, it had taken control of the funds by transferring the crypto from QuadrigaCX's accounts to the professional services firm’s own cold wallet, stored offline.  ""On February 14, 2019, after testing the transfer arrangements, the Applicants successfully transferred the following cryptocurrency to the Monitor,"" EY said.  In total, 51 bitcoin (roughly $185,500 at that time), 951 ether ($116,000), 33 bitcoin cash, 2,000 bitcoin gold, and 822 litecoin were transferred.  ""The Monitor will hold the cryptocurrency in cold storage pending further order of the Court,"" the report added.  Even before the report, blockchain watchers suspected these transfers had taken place since they observed amounts of bitcoin and ether matching the balances EY had previously said it found in the exchange's wallets leaving addresses identified earlier as belonging to the Canadian exchange in transactions on the public ledger. The addresses that received the bitcoin and ether were freshly created, another hint that EY had taken control of the funds.  Test transactions  Each of the QuadrigaCX wallets appears to have sent a test transaction before transferring over the bulk of its funds on Feb. 14, analysis of public blockchain data reveals.  For example, the ethereum address that was listed in the court filing as the exchange's hot wallet for that cryptocurrency first sent 0.01 ETH to EY's wallet, before sending a further 960 ETH two hours later.  Similarly, the group of bitcoin addresses that eagle-eyed blockchain watchers had previously identified as belonging to QuadrigaCX sent 0.01 BTC to the monitor. Two hours later, another 52.6 BTC were sent to this new address that saw no other transactions.  Some of those sending addresses were earlier involved in a costly blunder: the accidental transfer of 104 BTC ($500,000 CAD) on Feb. 6 to QuadrigaCX's cold wallets, which the company claims are inaccessible because only its late founder, Gerald Cotten, controlled the private keys.  In its report Thursday, EY addressed this transfer, saying it ""occurred due to a platform setting error by the Applicants that resulted in bitcoin being automatically transferred to the Quadriga cold wallets.""  Further, EY says it has looked at the cold wallets, and ""confirmed ... that the Quadriga cold wallets continue to hold approximately 104 bitcoins as of the date of the Second Report.""  Now, after that six-figure mistake and the subsequent intentional transfer of 52 BTC to a new address, the hot wallet group is holding altogether less than 0.5 BTC.  Fiat holdings  EY's report also provided updates on its quest to secure the exchange's fiat holdings as well, noting that there are three main sources: Costodian, a payment processor that held some $25 million CAD in bank drafts, another set of bank drafts in possession of Stewart McKelvey totaling $5.8 million CAD and various amounts held by other third-party processors.  Costodian, which is owned and operated by Jose Reyes, who also owns and operates another processor named Billerfy, has so far transferred some $20 million CAD to EY, but is holding onto another $5 million CAD and $70,000 USD which it claims belong to Reyes.  The processor is also looking to recoup $778,000 CAD that it says Quadriga owes it in processing fees.  Until these funds can be transferred to EY, ""the Applicants currently have no accessible funds to fund the CCAA proceedings, other than the interim financing provided by [Jennifer] Robertson which will be exhausted in the near term,"" the report said.  In safer hands  QuadrigaCX, previously the largest Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, went offline in January, following prolonged issues with banking, stalled customer withdrawals and the reported death of its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten in December.  The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia then granted QuadrigaCX creditor protection, issuing a 30-day stay of proceedings.  Cotten's widow Jennifer Robertson said in her affidavit to the court that he had single-handedly managed transfers between the exchange's wallets and that after his death the access to cold wallets was lost.  Even before the 104-bitcoin mishap, Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge Michael Wood suggested that the hot wallet funds be sent to the safety of new cold wallets maintained by EY.

Called the AR Authentication App, the new product uses multi-factor authentication and will not verify a product if one of the factors cannot be authenticated by the system.  If the product is proven to be genuine, the app plays exclusive video messages from the LA Kings members, including its president and Hockey ""Hall of Famer"" Luc Robitaille or head equipment manager Darren Granger.  Jonathan Lowe, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Brand Strategy, said:  ""This utilization of AR and Blockchain in the sports memorabilia realm is truly a first of its kind but - more importantly - also adds extra layers of authentication and security to the many fans who have become customers of our Game-Used product.""  Once a customer has downloaded the app, they must first verify their identity, after which they can scan a product's certificate of authenticity (CoA) sticker using their smartphone.  Customers will still receive a hard-copy certificate even if using the app, the team said, and can also transfer merchandise ownership with the app.  LA Kings image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | AR,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/21/la-kings-now-let-fans-verify-merchandise-using-a-blockchain-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78db2de3845dda9d9a1c8b9dc10374784859fc17-1500x922.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nSFX,1550746822,Bitcoin Price 'Bull Cross' Points to Positive Market Shift,"View  Bitcoin's three-day chart is showing a bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages for the first time since July. The crossover looks decisive as both EMAs are now trending north, validating the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the high-volume triangle breakout seen on the 3-day chart.  The cryptocurrency could test December highs above $4,200 in the near term.  A minor pullback to $3,800 may be seen in the next 24 hours, as signs of bullish exhaustion have emerged on the hourly and 4-hour charts.  The bullish case would weaken if BTC finds acceptance below $3,614 (the low of the previous three-day candle), but that currently looks unlikely.  A much-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in seven months, indicating a trend change in the market.  On the three-day chart, the 5-candle exponential moving average (EMA) has crossed the 10-candle EMA from below – the first decisive bullish crossover since July 17, 2018.  Back then, BTC was trading above $7,300 and the crossover was followed by a rally to highs above $8,400 on July 24.  Moving average crossovers help identify shifts in momentum. A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when a short-term moving average crosses through a long-term average from below.  Many would argue that EMA crossovers are lagging indicators. While that is true, crossovers between the short duration averages help traders distinguish between bullish and bearish scenarios. The long-term MA crossovers like the ""golden cross"" (bullish crossover of the 50-and 200-day MAs) often work as contrary indicators.  The latest positive crossover seen in the three-day chart validates the bullish break above $3,800 witnessed earlier this week. As a result, December highs above $4,200 could soon be put to the test.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,894 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $3,990 earlier today.  3-day chart  As seen above (left), the 5- and 10-day EMAs have produced a decisive bullish crossover, i.e. the averages are trending north following the bull cross. The chart to the right shows July's bullish cross. After a brief rally following the cross, the averages became flat-lined in the three months up to Nov. 14, offering little directional bias.  In the current scenario, BTC’s last three-day candle closed at $3,936, confirming a triangle breakout, which also indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Further, the candle closed well above $3,711, validating the bullish outside reversal created in the three days to Feb. 15.  Even so, December highs above $4,200 may not come into play immediately, as the short duration charts have turned bearish.  4-hour and hourly chart  The long upper shadows attached to multiple candles on the 4-hour chart signal bullish exhaustion near $4,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has also rolled over from the overbought territory and is pointing southwards. Meanwhile, the RSI on the hourly chart has turned bearish below 50.00.  As a result, BTC could revisit $3,800, before resuming the rally toward $4,236 (Dec. 24 high), as suggested by the three-day chart.

42381603,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nSD1,1550743219,Pantera Has Already Raised $125 Million for Its Third Crypto Fund,"Crypto-focused venture firm Pantera Capital has secured the bulk of its new $175 million fund ahead of an expected March closing, CoinDesk has learned.  According to a slide deck obtained by CoinDesk, $125 million is currently committed to the fund, which will be the firm's third. However, only $25 million has been secured since last August, when Pantera told CNBC that $100 million had already been raised.  ""We're in a bear market and fundraising has slowed for the entire industry, whether you're an entrepreneur or a fund,"" Pantera partner Paul Veradittikit told CoinDesk. He said Pantera's initial fundraising had come from high net-worth individuals, family offices and others that could money move quickly.  Still, Veradittikit is optimistic about the closing. Pantera, he said, is ""taking a lot of meetings"" with a new category of funders: institutional investors, such as endowments and even pension funds. He expects larger checks ahead, though ones that take longer to secure than those from the firm's traditional supporters.  The new fund will ""invest in later stage rounds to support the more mature companies"" than past startup funds from the firm, according to the slide deck.  Veradittakit says that approach will allow the firm to take a more active role in growing companies, including taking board seats. ""That's kind of where we want to fit in,"" he said.  Half the capital in the fund will be reserved for follow-on funding, with the goal of making investments of $3 million to $8 million for equity stakes of as much as 15 percent. At the seed stage, the fund will target investments of $1 million to $3 million for equity stakes of 10–20 percent.  Pantera’s prior two funds have invested in 44 companies so far. The new fund is projected to support 30 to 50 companies, according to the Pantera pitch deck.  Pantera also expects to do much more equity or equity-token hybrid rounds. ""There's a huge shift to equity,"" Veradittikit said. The slide deck lists six areas the VC firm is exploring: custody, commercial exchanges, asset management, institutional tools, infrastructure and marketplaces.  Recent investments from Pantera include Synthetic Minds, an automated code checker; Staked, a service for contributing to proof-of-stake protocols; and Origin, a peer-to-peer marketplace protocol.  Pantera made an initial close on the fund last June, in order to make its investment in Bakkt, the regulated exchange currently being built by the owners of the New York Stock Exchange. The slides indicate that Pantera expects to finalize the fund in March.  ""It's a great time to be investing,"" Veradittikit said.

The County Auditors’ Association of Ohio (CAAO) announced Wednesday that it has formed a working group to determine how blockchain tech can be implemented at the county level to “more effectively"" transfer real-estate deeds between parties.  The technical partner for the project is SafeChain, an Ohio-based startup that puts real-estate transactions and land titles on a blockchain. The firm has been tasked with reviewing and demonstrating ongoing current projects in the state to the county auditors' group.  According to SafeChain's website, using blockchain can speed up property transactions, which can be frustratingly slow for buyers and sellers, and offers more security by verifying the involved parties' identities and bank accounts.  The CAAO consists of total 13 county auditors from across Ohio and is chaired by Matt Nolan, auditor of Warren County. George Kaitsa, auditor of Delaware County and Matthew Livengood, auditor-elect of Washington County, are also part of the group.  CAAO president and Stark county auditor Alan Harold said in a statement:  “The goal of this working group is to consider how County Auditors can be forward thinking to improve the taxpayer experience in conveying and transferring real property.”  Ohio has already made several legislative initiatives to give aspects of blockchain technology legal status.  It became the first U.S. state to allow companies to pay taxes with bitcoin in November.

If the direction of the trend is to be sustained the target for the bulls in the short-term would rest along Jan. 5's peak high of $160.62, previously rejected by the 200-day MA.    Daily chart (ETH/BTC)    On the other hand, ETH's bitcoin denomination has performed exceptionally well so far in the month of Feb. and has crossed over the 200-day moving average (marked blue) for the first time since May 22, 2018, roughly 8 months ago.  ETH/BTC is considered a fairly decent barometer on gauging the strength of the alt-coin market and has spurred on further gains across the board.  ERC-20 tokens that leverage off and operate within the ethereum ecosystem such as Maker (MKR) and Binance (BNB) are currently up 70 and 61.88 percent respectively in Feb. a sign that investors are re-entering the ether markets at an exponential rate.  Other notable tokens such as Holo (HOT) and ChainLink (LINK) are up between 12.96 and 10 percent in Feb. so far and are profiting from ether's good fortune.    Developments Affecting Price    The Constantinople hard fork could also be affecting investor sentiment and thereby ether’s price action.  The upgrade intends to change the amount a miner is rewarded from 3 ETH per block reward to 2 ETH, which will in effect reduce the total supply of new ETH by around one-third.  The hard fork activation has been set for block number 7,280,000, landing on the date of Feb. 27th, according to developer Péter Szilágyi.  Further, ErisX, a US-based digital asset exchange, filed a letter on Feb. 15 to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in response to questions regarding current ether market conditions that suggested regulated ETH futures as a means to tame chaotic price fluctuations and manipulation:  “There is a lack of institutional-grade trading and post-trade technical infrastructure and operational capabilities, transparent and regulated operations, secure and compliant custody options, fragmented liquidity, and lack of effective hedging options for commercial actors as well as financial intermediaries”.  They note the lack of security and assurances from regulatory bodies as the potential reason institutional investors have yet to move money into crypto.

42381587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nRvP,1550725222,Overstock CEO Electrifies at Investment Bank Oppenheimer's Blockchain Event,"""Warning! This is all risky, it may all fail.""  That was how Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock, concluded his keynote about investing in blockchain at a Wednesday event in New York hosted by investment bank and brokerage Oppenheimer & Co.  Unusually formal in a suit and tie, Byrne electrified what had until that point been a fairly low-key crowd with his well-honed stump speech for blockchain's transformative potential.  Oppenheimer clients filled more nearly 150 seats and were enthusiastically taking pictures of Byrne’s slides illustrating his vision of the most promising applications of blockchain.  He opened his presentation by providing a brief overview of traditional securities trading and its pitfalls – highlighting, as he has been wont to do for years, the fact that due to the arcane structure of today’s market, the ownership of stocks is indirect and somehow dubious.  In one of many lines to draw laughs from the crowd, he said:  ""All the corporate shares in America are owned by the company called Cede & Co, and what you actually have is a contractual claim against a corporation, that has a contractual claim against another corporation, that has a contractual claim against DTCC, that has a contractual claim against Cede & Co. What can go wrong?""  Byrne went on to proclaim that blockchain, by improving transparency and minimizing the need for trust, can bring capital markets to the state where ""all kinds of systemic risks go away,"" as people cannot meddle with the process or act dishonestly.  ""Imagine we have a magic ledger which is cryptographically protected, public and transparent – no way to cheat,"" he mused, provoking a few more chuckles in the room.  'SEC-conscious'  Reiterating his estimation that in the course of the next decade all types of securities can be tokenized, bringing a potential value of new blockchain securities of $914.4 billion, Byrne turned to Overstock’s favorite child: the security token trading platform tZERO, which officially launched this year (though trading there so far has been slow and limited to Wall Street hours.)  The market structure concerns mentioned are what led to the development of tZERO over the past four years, he said, noting that despite these issues, the company was still developed in accordance with U.S. regulations.  Overstock’s team – and that of Medici Ventures, Overstock’s venture arm – has always been cautious and ""SEC-conscious"" developing tZERO, Byrne emphasized, and the startup even ""bought a piece of Wall Street"" in the form of fintech company SpeedRoute, which was acquired in 2015.  The process has been slow, though steady.  ""In December 2015, we applied to issue a public blockchain security — it took one year and $10 million of legal wranglings [but] we issued it,"" he said.  Moreover, he wants to continue to focus on building tZERO out without violating either these regulations or otherwise harming his potential users, Byrne said, concluding:  ""We’re not going to Mt Gox things.""
