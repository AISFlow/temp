42399026,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Te,1462916471,Mystery of Cryptsy's Collapse Grows as CEO's Whereabouts Unknown,"One month after a Florida court first appointed a receiver in charge of troubled digital currency exchange Cryptsy, the representative has filed a report detailing efforts to retain information about the whereabouts of Cryptsy assets, as well as CEO Paul Vernon.  Entered by receiver James Sallah, the filing comes months after users first began voicing concerns about their inability to withdraw funds from the exchange or receive clarity from its management on the status of such services.  Back in January, two Florida law firms filed suit against Project Investors, the company that oversaw the exchange's operation, just prior to the emergence of claims that Cryptsy had been hacked and robbed nearly a year and a half prior. At the time, Cryptsy claimed that it owed its customers millions in various digital currencies, denominated primarily in bitcoin.  Claims about the hack, widely disputed by both customers and critics, were kept hidden at the time to avoid a panic, Vernon told CoinDesk in January, but that dwindling income brought the extent of the exchange’s insolvency to the fore.  Court documents  later revealed that the exchange’s failure was predicted weeks before its insolvency was publicly revealed. Vernon is currently believed to be residing in China, and according to recent reports, played a role in the creation of an altcoin exchange in that region.  In the wake of that collapse, according to the receiver’s report, is a lack of clarity regarding the location of customer funds – though some former users have been tracing transactions tied to Cryptsy and Vernon – as well as an apparent lack of communication or cooperation between Vernon and plaintiffs in the class action.  The report states:  ""As of this First Report, I have not received any cooperation from Mr Vernon, so my job has been made much more difficult regarding every issue involving Cryptsy, especially wallet and investor information. From my investigation, accessing the servers will be critical to determine current and past account, wallet, investor and financial information and records.""  Vernon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cryptsy is currently offline.  Investigation details  Despite the reported lack of cooperation between the two sides, court documents suggest that the plaintiffs have been pursuing avenues of restitution for former customers involved in an ongoing class action.  Notably, the report asserts that a Florida residential property tied to a recent divorce case involving Vernon was indeed purchased with funds tied to Cryptsy. Lori Ann Nettles, Vernon’s former spouse, was also named as a defendant in the class action lawsuit.  ""I have also confirmed that the million-dollar plus property currently in Ms Nettles’ name ... was derived from Cryptsy and should be receivership property,"" the report states, going on to say that the house is currently on the market.  Sallah further indicated that he could file a separate lawsuit seeking possession of the home.  The report includes details on the exchange’s financial infrastructure, supported by bank accounts provided by TD Bank and SunTrust Bank, as well as digital currency accounts held by Coinbase and Bittrex, both of which have reportedly frozen funds tied to Cryptsy. Bittrex, for example, is said to have frozen an amount worth at least $100,000.  Sallah also detailed efforts to secure access to the Cryptsy servers, said to be hosted by a company called Vault Networks in Miami. According to the report, following court action Sallah was able to obtain a commitment to secure access as of last Friday.  Uncertain road ahead  As the report asserts, outstanding questions about the contents of the Cryptsy web servers and the extent to which funds left the exchange prior to its collapse remain unanswered.  ""My overall investigation is still in its infancy and will be ongoing,"" Sallah wrote. ""I will continue to search for and attempt to secur[e] funds, cryptocurrencies, accounts and wallets in Cryptsy’s name or derived from Cryptsy.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, attorney David Silver of the Silver Law Group reiterated a past call for Vernon to cooperate with plaintiffs and said that efforts to gain control of assets and client funds remain ongoing.  “While we are trying to do everything we can to protect our clients’ interests, we are limited in what we can do,” he said. “Members of the Cryptsy community have been actively following this case, and any help or information they can provide is much appreciated.

42399031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Xa,1462909052,How Fidor Bank is Using Ethereum to Rethink Banking,"One of the first banks to become involved in the blockchain space, German online bank Fidor has long been quiet about the shifts in its tech strategy even as more financial incumbents have followed in its footsteps through investments and partnerships.  Just how early was Fidor? While many banks continue to investigate the technology through proofs-of-concept and consortium efforts, Fidor integrated Ripple during the bitcoin craze of early 2014, even going so far as to attempt to build a bitcoin bank with exchange partner Kraken that never materialized.  Despite these investigations, the online bank has largely remained absent from major consortium efforts, choosing instead to focus on development.  ""We’re more hands-on and we like to develop something and see how it works ... We're interested but we're just not interested in sitting down and talking,"" Patrick Gruban, CIO of Fidor TecS, told CoinDesk.  The interview found Gruban opening up about the company’s evolving blockchain strategy, and how Fidor TecS, its digital banking division, is experimenting with blockchain services. In particular, Gruban honed in on a recent project in which Fidor sought to replicate the core banking services its customers use today.  Gruban told CoinDesk:  ""We have a lot of examples out there of people doing payments on the blockchain, of people doing exchanges and markets, but customers still come to us saying we have a fast software but I still need a traditional core banking system. The idea was to ask, 'Is it possible to use these ledger systems in that way?'""  Gruban said he foresees permissioned blockchain-based systems replacing traditional low-level banking services, given that current systems cost banks in the tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain.  Distributed ledgers, he suggested, could come to oversee customer accounts, loans and certificates of deposit, with different banks, data centers and regulators sharing information as part of a drive to reduce costs and boost security.  ""It’s not about reducing costs by 10%, it’s about reducing costs by a factor of hundred. That’s what gets me excited, because that is something that is not on the radar,"" Gruban said.  As for how integral the project is to Fidor, Gruban hinted that this particular one may not be moving forward, but that it’s indicative of the efforts his innovation team is making to investigate how blockchain could offer broader benefits.  The prototype  As explained by Gruban, the banking services prototype began as an attempt to replicate basic customer accounts in an Ethereum-based blockchain system.  Accounts were built to store balances, overdrafts and account holds, and owners passed know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks. When bank users wanted to exchange funds in the test, accounts would query the ledger and make the exchange.  The ledger would hold all account information and ensure users have the necessary funds to execute transactions, but not hold funds directly, with users and administrators connected to the network through APIs.  ""It’s using the best of both systems, not trying to do everything on the blockchain, but those transactions and those steps that have to be validated and distributed and secured,"" he said.  Nodes on the network would then be able to post interest payments to accounts, add or remove holds on accounts and perform functions such as calculating loan amounts and executing basic loans, controlling factors such as the amount, duration and interest.  Even while the specific trial is not moving forward, Gruban still suggested he sees similar systems being more widely used as blockchain tech becomes more widely adopted  ""This is where we think it really makes sense from the financial companies,"" he said.  Ethereum interest  Gruban said Ethereum's technology fit the project as Fidor wanted to explore use cases that went beyond simple asset exchange, such as providing customers loans.  ""Using Ethereum it was a very easy thing to do, it was 200 lines of code in Solidity to write a model where it can really load up an account with fiat currency and send money between accounts,"" Gruban explained.  Notably, Gruban said Ethereum is attractive as a platform because of its public nature, even though Fidor or another bank might seek to use a private version of the platform.  Gruban noted that transaction security in such systems will be paramount, and that public blockchains are rigorously tested just by being active in the market.  ""Ethereum is out there being used by a lot of people,"" he said. ""We’ll be coming to a point soon where we can say this has been tested more than any core banking system.""  Gruban also said that Fidor has leveraged Microsoft Azure’s Blockchain-as-a-Service platform, and that the ability to spin up a prototype via its BlockApps helped move the project ahead quickly.  This fast-moving approach to innovation, Gruban indicated is indicative of Fidor's style, which he contrasted to efforts like the Linux-led Hyperledger project. However, he noted that the available technology offered by tech giants is helping to speed up Fidor's investigations.  ""We’re doing many PoCs, [but] we don’t publish because it would be easy for others to copy. We're just waiting and communicating only to certain customers,"" he continued, adding:  ""What I’m showing here, the Ethereum project is something I did in a few days while doing other projects. We move pretty fast.""

42399029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Vc,1462901013,"Bitcoin Market OpenBazaar Unveils Plans for Tor Support, Mobile App","The distributed bitcoin-powered marketplace OpenBazaar has published a long-term roadmap in a bid to become a global leader in censorship-resistant trade.  Since launch, OpenBazaar has seen a wide variety of vendors sign up to sell goods including caramel waffles, chili peppers and cannabis seeds. The project grew out of an earlier effort, dubbed DarkMarket, that sought to build a marketplace that, through its distributed nature, could not be completely shut down.  Now, the team behind OpenBazaar, according to the new roadmap, is expected to seek expansive growth in the months ahead.  Plans include the deployment of private listings, job postings, a built-in social network, and integrations with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the anonymizing Tor network. The team is also planning to release a mobile app.  The roadmap  explains:  ""OpenBazaar is and always was a mammoth project with an ambitious goal to become the backbone of global commerce. Every marathon begins with the first step.""  Formally launched in April of this year, the distributed marketplace quickly found supporters, with developers stating at the time that the software had been downloaded 25,000 times its first day in business.  By the time the app and its parent company, OB1, had swept the Blockchain Awards earlier this month at ConDesk's Consensus 2016 blockchain conference, it was downloaded more than 110,000 times.  Function, content plans ahead  Immediate goals, according to the roadmap, focus on improving the customer experience of the app as well as onboarding other types of purchasable content.  The next three months will see the addition of “advanced digital goods” including music. Additionally, OpenBazaar plans to add support for registering a blockchain ID within the application.  Other features planned for the coming three months include email notifications, webhooks, cloud-storage backups, enhanced order and inventory management, a more intuitive user-interface, and an improved sales control center.  On the one-year timeline, OpenBazaar’s open-source contributors have planned several “big ticket items” that stand out as potential news-makers in their own right.  The contributors plan to build the InterPlanetary File System as an “extension” of the existing network. Allowing functionality similar to BitTorrent, the IPFS integration will let visitors to a store download and seed its data for other users.  Possible benefits include increased censorship resistance, and more persistent content even if the vendor closes the application.  ""This means that the more people who visit your store, the more your data will be replicated across the network,"" according to the post.  Support for Tor, mobile  To provide enhanced privacy for OpenBazaar shoppers, the contributors also plan to integrate with the Tor network, designed to facilitate anonymous online browsing by routing data through a web of computers worldwide.  While details of the process are vague, the likeliest route to early integration is the creation of “onion only” nodes that operate as hidden services available exclusively to other Tor nodes, according to the developers.  Though the roadmap acknowledges the solution isn’t ideal because it will result in a segregated Tor network, a time-table for a “dual stack” configuration has yet to be offered.  One of the more complicated features OpenBazaar expects to roll-out over the next year is a mobile application integrated with third-party messaging bots, including Slack, WeChat, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Kik and others designed to relay messages from “remote” nodes.  ""We aim to develop a client-only mobile application, which would empower users to fully manage their node remotely and securely,"" the post explains.  In the long-term, the OpenBazaar team says it wants to improve the existing reputation system, add more functionality to the marketplace shopping cart, and create a plug-in system to allow third-party development on top of the base infrastructure.  The team also pointed to plans to develop an in-house contracting system.  “Contract flexibility will allow for an expansion of OpenBazaar to facilitate any type of complex transaction,” the post states.

42399024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Oj,1462897312,NATO Innovation Contest Seeks Military Blockchain Applications,"The communications arm of the intergovernmental military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is ending a submission period for an innovation contest in which it called on applicants to submit ideas for blockchain applications.  Announced in late April, NATO's Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) is hosting the 2016 Innovation Challenge in a bid to develop ""state-of-the-art technology solutions"", according to the group. The deadline for submissions is today, with the winners expected to be notified by 20th May.  Among the solutions NATO requested were military-grade blockchain applications, though in its public call the organization left the requirements somewhat open-ended. Specifically, the organization called for blockchain applications related to ""military logistics"", ""procurement and finance"" as well as ""other applications of interest to the military"".  What those proposals might look like remains to be seen, and it’s unclear to what degree NATO will make submissions public – though the organization does intend to showcase the top submissions at a conference in Estonia next month.  At least one NATO member, the US, has shown an interest in battlefield applications of the blockchain. Last month, the US Department of Defense, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), issued a call for a secure messaging system concept that employs a distributed ledger.  It's possible that the distributed data-sharing nature of a blockchain could find its way into a NATO-oriented logistics application, whereas the technology could be applied for payments for military goods and services.  The contest is also seeking submissions focused on connected devices, so it’s possible that uses of blockchain could be proposed in that area as well.

42399013,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Gr,1462890612,10 Quotes That Defined Consensus 2016,"Held one week ago in New York City, CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 blockchain conference brought together speakers from all over the world to unveil new products, discuss the major issues of the day and begin to help plotting a course forward for the future of the industry.  The biggest moments? From Delaware Governor Jack Markell's announcement that his state is to seek a legal classification for blockchain shares to 21 Inc CEO Balaji Srinivasan’s unveiling of a major software suite aimed at creating a bitcoin-based economy, Consensus 2016 saw its fair share of big ideas – and those pitching them.  But with so many leaders in the same place, not every quotable moment happened on the main stage.  Below are just a few of the memorable moments when panelists and speakers went on to steal the show in some very unexpected ways.  1. ""Distributed ledger shares hold the promise of immediate clearance, immediate settlement and bring about dramatic increase in efficiency and speed and an increase in commercial transactions of which Delaware is known.""    During his keynote address, Governor Markell spoke about his plans to make the state – already known for being friendly to those looking to incorporate – into a blockchain-friendly state, too.      Telling attendees that the state had no current plans to pursue a licensure scheme for digital currency companies akin to New York's BitLicense, he added that the government would push for the creation of a new type of corporate shares, dubbed ""distributed ledger shares"", to help promote adoption of the technology as a tool for securities settlement.    2. ""Standardization is one of those things that people, and business people especially, like to talk about. It's a bit removed from the standardization needs of developers. I sometimes think, 'Okay, where do we even start? How do you even know what kind of standardization are people looking for?'""    Speaking during a workshop about blockchain standardization, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin distinguished between the needs of business executives and managers and the potential standards needs of developers actually working on technology applications.      Ultimately, participants in that workshop pushed for a ground-up approach, with the industry setting the kinds of standards they say are needed to promote further blockchain applications.    3. ""That kind of situation is something where you can only expand a private blockchain so much until you start getting into things that are in Russia or in China or in Iran or some region that is really not fully a trusted party.""    In response to a question from the Wall Street Journal's Paul Vigna, 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan was speaking about what he believes are the limits of permissioned or closed distributed ledgers. The answer came during a panel appearance alongside David Rutter, founder and CEO of bank blockchain consortium R3CEV.      In response, Rutter argued that banks don’t need a trustless network like the one advocated by Srinivasan in his work with bitcoin because there is already a layer of trust between those institutions.    4. ""Is the blockchain technology going to be fundamental? I think the answer is overwhelmingly likely to be yes. Is bitcoin going to be a valuable store of value, the same way as people use gold? I don’t know, but I think that certainly the answer is 'no' doesn’t seem like the right position to take.""    US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers gave his thoughts on bitcoin and blockchain during an in-depth question and answer session on the second day of Consensus 2016.      In conversation, Summers projected that there would likely be three scenarios stemming from the growth of distributed ledgers. He argued that blockchains will either co-exist with traditional fiat currencies, will be enabled by bitcoin directly; or will eventually interact with new kinds of digital currencies, but not bitcoin.    5. ""What is important to note is we’re not like eBay or Etsy where we have control of the full stack. We’re a software development team who built an open source project. We created a tool. We encourage positive use, but it’s really up to the actors in the network to determine how it is used.""    On the topic of illicit activity, OpenBazaar co-founder Brian Hoffman sought to explain why platforms such as his own are beneficial despite the possibility that illicit transactors might use the open-source software.      The early discussion had to do with OB1, the startup behind the decentralized, bitcoin-based marketplace. Hoffman also claimed during the panel that, since launch, there had been over 110,000 downloads from users in 130 different countries.    6. ""If you think about a transfer from the US to Senegal, you want to know what the transfer rate will be. They’ll let you know in 14 days.""    These remarks came from Elizabeth Rossiello of bitcoin payments startup BitPesa, who spoke during a panel about the question of building a better payment rail.      During her appearance, Rossiello gave an impassioned defense of bitcoin and spoke to the idea that payments between developed and developing nations could be enhanced through decentralized technologies.    7. ""Blockchain, combined with identity, is a two-edged sword. The best, we can hold the powerful accountable for their actions. Transparency, all the different types of things that happened in the 2008 crash, all of that can be avoided with identity and identity services on the blockchain. The worst is we weaponize identity for the powerless.""    Christopher Allen, the principal architect at the startup Blockstream, warned against the potentially harmful side effects of more trustworthy method of identification. Though he highlighted how the technology could have helped boost transparency during the financial panic in 2008, Allen reminded attendees about the dangerous aspects of the concept.      For example, he noted how the advanced Dutch system of identification during World War II made it easier to carry out genocidal activiites during the Holocaust.    8. “Until you solve decentralized identity, you can’t really build other services off of that. This is the first problem that needs to get addressed. But doing a simulation or a proof of concept is very different from running a production system.""    During the same panel with Allen, Blockstack Labs co-founder Muneeb Ali explained the technical limitations of building an identity platform on the blockchain, using firsthand experience from the creation of Onename.      Ali added that developers shouldn’t think of blockchain as a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather one that should only be applied thoughtfully as part of a larger plan. He warned that not all blockchains provide equal identity control and should be selected carefully.    9. ""Disconnected from the digital currency, blockchain exists more like an intranet. Intranet was quite important, but the transformative value was only when all those intranets were connected into an Internet.""    Silver Lake co-founder and Federal Reserve Bank of New York board member Glenn Hutchins explained to the audience why he thinks an interconnected web of blockchains might actually be more powerful than a single blockchain, or just a few blockchains that dominate.      Continuing with an other metaphor, Hutchins said that bitcoins might someday be thought of as the ""boxcars"" of finance, with distributed ledgers serving as the new ""railroads"" of economic development.    10. ""We don’t look for use-cases that are just using a small part of the blockchain.""    During a panel discussion with Microsoft, IBM, and CME Group, founder and CEO of bitcoin blockchain startup Blockstream Austin Hill expressed a lack of interest in firms that use only a portion of blockchain’s potential.      Hill’s company has joined with IBM and more than 30 other companies to help develop the Hyperledger Project, an open-source effort to create a distributed ledger platform.

42399018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Kn,1462884298,Supply Chain Startup Fluent Raises $1.65 Million in Seed Funding,"A blockchain startup dedicated to supply chain applications has raised $1.65m in new seed funding.  Fluent, which last year raised roughly $850k from a group of investors that included mass media corporation Thomson Reuters and Silicon Valley VC fund Draper Associates, is one of several startups in the blockchain space today working on supply chain applications.  The round was led by ff Venture Capital, a New York-based venture firm with a portfolio that also includes Indiegogo. Crosscut Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Draper Associates, Fenbushi Capital, Lindbergh Tech Fund and the St. Louis Arch Angels also participated in the round.  In interview, CEO Lamar Wilson told CoinDesk that the startup plans to use the new funding in part to attract new participants to its platform, as well as expand its existing team over the course of the year.  The startup is also unveiling its first partner, Kansas City-based Commerce Bancshares, which in the months ahead will use the platform to experiment with the technology from several different angles, including its use for business-to-business (B2B) payments as well as a test of peer-to-peer capital generation and deployment.  The concept of using a blockchain as part of the commerce supply chain is one of several to have gathered traction, particularly as it relates to using a distributed ledger to timestamp steps in the production process.  The idea is that supply chains can be improved by ensuring the validity of products, thereby reducing the risk that counterfeit or low-quality ones enter the market at all. A distributed record of those steps, the thinking goes, would keep supply chain members more honest.  According to Wilson, Fluent is aiming to capitalize on interest among major financials in the use of blockchains for supply chain management. Its partnership with Commerce Bancshares is just the first step in a plan to develop a working group dedicated to these applications.  “We are dead-set focused on the financial supply chain, and we completely focus all of our efforts toward that,” he said.  The bank said in a statement that it sees the new investment through the lens of its existing customer services.  “Commerce is keenly focused on innovation in the payment space and has for some time now provided customers with a comprehensive suite of highly competitive and often industry-tailored products and technologies,” said Chris Wiedenmann, vice president of commercial systems and product innovation for Commerce Bancshares.  It’s this area of interest, the company’s new backers say as well, that ultimately drew their support. John Frankel, a partner at ff Venture Capital, told CoinDesk:  “This is a space we have been interested in for some time and are excited to see such a talented team take a novel approach to reducing friction in global supply chain commerce.”  Image via Shutterstock  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/05/10/supply-chain-startup-fluent-raises-165-million-in-seed-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd2e9e8fe2249e66bc4dc90fefa407acef40721d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
