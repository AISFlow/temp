42378614,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqFd,1455833452,ISITC: Blockchain Investment Impact 12 to 18 Months Away,"Trade processing was historically an inefficient process that involved sending documents between firms via fax and Telex, and manual re-keying of data as it passed from one proprietary trading system to another.  Then, in 1991, a group of financial industry leaders and competitors created an advanced standard electronic message format with which to trade mortgage securities. That format is now known as straight-through processing (STP) and the group that created it still exists as the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC).  The association continues to work to promote operational efficiency in the global securities trading industry, and boasts hundreds of companies from around the globe as members, including BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.  Technology never sits still, however, and once again a new disruptor has arrived that promises to bring further improvements to securities trading – blockchains, also called distributed ledgers.  ""Today Blockchain is potentially a new paradigm requiring initially an educational angle for operational and technical teams across the ISITC Membership,"" Nigel Solkhon, CEO of the association’s European arm, told CoinDesk.  Solkhon, who is also director, regional product head of execution 2 custody for Citi in London, added:  ""The nature of the new technology, the interest from participants and the introduction of new players will create a new landscape for ISITC Europe members to adapt to.""  While ISITC believes that blockchain is in its infancy in the securities market, it is accelerating extremely fast, according to Solkhon.  ""Should you reflect back to the early 2000s, this was also the challenge perceived for the introduction of the Internet and how long it took for companies and models to be defined and become successful,"" he said.  He pointed to the ""enormous"" amount of investment in research and development of blockchain, adding that, though the evolution of the technology may not be not clear today, it will likely become visible in the next 12-18 months.  Technology neutral  With blockchains being such a new technology, Solkhon framed ISITC Europe’s early role as an educator that will facilitate communication between regulators, partner forums and experts.  To that end, he said that the association had already funded London Metropolitan University as an association member – creating a ""pilot link"" between the securities industry and academia.  As the level of awareness of the technology, infrastructure and regulatory guidance matures, Solkhon predicted, ISITC Europe will move further into examining at the impact of the resulting technology shift on standards and the supply and value chain, as well as the integration of today’s ""complex industry modus operandi"".  On whether or not blockchain technology is a good thing for the securities industry, he explained that the vendor- and member-neutral association is unlikely to propose one technical solution over another, adding:  ""I believe that by the end of Q2 we will have a better view of the challenges and changes faced by each of the industry segments.""  Advocating and making predictions are not the aim, though. From an ISITC perspective as an industry forum, the key hope is that the industry will collaborate and define a common solution, he said.  Last week, ISITC Europe held its inaugural meeting on blockchain technology in London. At the event, a new blockchain working group was created and a commitment made to collaborate with other groups engaged in discussions on the technology – specifically when related to operational and technical definitions.  For now, ISITC Europe plans to adapt to the new financial work on several levels represented by other new working groups covering regulation, technology and industry players.

42378629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqVz,1455823514,Prosecutors Set to Indict Suspect in Bitcoin Mine Stabbing,"A Swedish man arrested last week in connection with a stabbing at a data center used by bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner has confessed to the deadly assault and awaits formal indictment, according to regional authorities.  Local news agency NSD reported on 16th February that the incident took place in a server hall at a data center space in Boden, Sweden, used by KnCMiner. The incident reportedly resulted in serious stab wounds against one individual by another.  According to NSD, the victim is in his 20s and, as of that report, may have incurred life-threatening injuries. The incident reportedly resulted in more than 15 people involved in a ""scuffle"", although the suspect was said to have surrendered without incident.  When reached for comment, local prosecutor Lindha Strömberg told CoinDesk:  ""The person who committed the crime is a 36-year-old male who has confessed to the crime. He is suspected of attempted murder. He is currently in detention in Luleå and the indictment period is the 29th of February 2016.”  According to local news source Breakit, the suspect is disputing the suspected murder charge.  KnCMiner told CoinDesk that the individuals were both employed by a labor contractor, but were not directly employed by the firm.  CEO Sam Cole said that the firm is cooperating with the investigation.

42378597,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inUX,1455819024,The Fifth Amendment and Bitcoin: Why the Battle is About to Begin,"Brian Klein is a partner at the litigation boutique Baker Marquart LLP and an advisor to BlockSeer, a blockchain analytics company.  Klein's practice focuses on criminal and regulatory defense and civil litigation, and he represents numerous clients involved with digital currency and blockchain technology.      The fight over digital privacy and security waged between governments and their citizens and companies is getting more contentious and serious.  A recent development indirectly raises the significant issue of whether the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protects people from being forced to disclose their bitcoin private keys to law enforcement.  On 16th February, at the request of US federal prosecutors, a federal court issued an order requiring Apple to unlock an iPhone tied to the recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California.  The prosecutors sought this order so that law enforcement can create a ""backdoor"" allowing them to bypass the iPhone's built-in encryption technology. This order, which Apple plans to challenge, highlights ongoing and serious tensions over digital privacy and security, in particular encryption, and it is therefore likely to have broad implications for bitcoin, which is encryption-based.  To that end, one issue of great importance that the Apple order indirectly raises – it is attenuated from the main legal dispute as discussed below – is how much protection the Fifth Amendment offers a person who wants to keep a bitcoin private key just that, private (ie, not have to provide it to the government).  After all, like an iPhone’s locked screen passcode (or a password-protected laptop or computer file), a bitcoin private key, which is an un-guessable string of numbers and letters, gives the holder of it access to and control of the bitcoins.  As anyone who is familiar with bitcoin knows, you (or a proxy like a wallet service) need your bitcoins' private key or keys to move and use them.  The Fifth Amendment provides people with a number of rights, including the right against self-incrimination.  For all intents and purposes, only a person (not a company like Apple) can assert the right against self-incrimination, and he or she may make such an assertion in both criminal and civil cases.  Past precedent  That said, in seeking the order against Apple for ""passcode help,"" the federal prosecutors' motion relied, in part, on a 2012 federal case from Colorado where the court ordered a defendant to unencrypt a computer that was obtained through a search warrant by using a passcode known only to that defendant.  The court’s ruling in favor of the government was premised on the fact the government knew of the existence and location of the computer’s files it was seeking to decrypt, even though it did not know the specific content of those files.  The federal prosecutors squaring off against Apple, however, ignored a more recent federal case in Pennsylvania decided in late 2015, which is at odds with the Colorado decision. That case, for reasons that will be obvious, strengthens the argument that people can assert the Fifth Amendment in connection with their bitcoin private keys.  In the Pennsylvania case, the SEC sought personal passcodes for smartphones owned by a company that required its employees to keep the passcodes secret.  Unlike the Colorado case, the SEC had no evidence of what was on the smartphones.  The Pennsylvania court denied the SEC’s request, finding the defendants could invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, because the court believed the SEC was seeking the defendants' ""personal thought processes..."".  There are a small number of other federal cases, all with slightly varied fact patterns, dealing with passcodes and passwords and whether the Fifth Amendment is a barrier to law enforcement learning them.  Overall, they support the notion that the Fifth Amendment shields people from being compelled by the government to disclose their bitcoin private keys. This is because the courts have maintained that the Fifth Amendment prevents the government from forcing individuals to tell the government the passcode to the digital device, which should apply equally to private keys due to their inherent similarities.  Despite all that, in one prominent case, a court ruled that the defendant did not have to tell the government the passcode to unencrypt his computer, but he did have to provide the government with an unencrypted copy.  Bitcoin implications  Translated to bitcoin private keys, that could mean a person would have to transfer his or her bitcoins to where the government wanted them moved (eg, a government controlled bitcoin wallet) but not tell the government the private key used.  So far, no US court has ruled, at least publicly, on whether the Fifth Amendment protects a person from government compelled disclosure of his or her bitcoin private key or keys.  But from the current cases, we know the factors a court is likely to consider if confronted with this issue. Some of those key factors are:  Whether the private key is written down somewhere (likely less protection) or only in the person’s head (likely more protection)  Has the individual acknowledged control of the bitcoins seen (likely less protection) or kept quiet (likely more protection).  In the not too distant future, there can be no doubt that a US court will tackle the issue of the application of the Fifth Amendment to bitcoin private keys in a case that undoubtedly will be closely watched like the current Apple case.  And that court should uphold one of the Fifth Amendment’s most important protections and not compel disclosure, despite prosecutors urging otherwise.  The Fifth Amendment would be undermined if a court did anything else, and a defense attorney should vigorously contest any government attempt to seek such a court order.

42378608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7indL,1455816809,FTC Settles Charges Against Bitcoin Mining Firm Butterfly Labs,"UPDATE (18th February 19:28 BST):This report has been updated with comment from Butterfly Labs.      The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced that it has reached a settlement with bitcoin mining hardware maker Butterfly Labs after it sued the firm in 2014.  At the time, the FTC accused Butterfly Labs of deceptive business practices related to the development and sale of bitcoin mining equipment, as well as the receipt of customer funds for product preorders.  The agency said  today that it has settled charges filed against Butterfly Labs and two of its officers: vice president of product development Sonny Vleisides, who has an ownership stake in the firm, and general manager Darla Drake.  Butterfly Labs, Vleisides and Drake agreed to pay partially suspended monetary penalties, according to final court orders published by the FTC.  Of the $38,615,161 judgment ordered against Butterfly Labs and Vleisides, the defendants are required to pay $15,000 and $4,000, respectively, after which the remaining amount will be suspended. A judgment of $135,878 against Drake will be suspended following receipt of payment constituting “the cash value of all Bitcoins she obtained using company machines”.  According to the FTC, these suspensions are due to an inability on the part of the defendants to pay. Butterfly Labs, Fleisides and Drake would be required to pay the full amounts in the event the terms of the agreement are broken.  Further, defendants are prohibited from making false representations about their bitcoin mining products in the future, and cannot take preorder payments from customers “unless those products are available and will be delivered within 30 days”.  “Even in the fast-moving world of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, companies can’t deceive people about their products. These settlements will prevent the defendants from misleading consumers,” Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.  The settlement comes more than a year after the federal agency shuttered the company following an investigation into suspected fraud. That investigation was sparked by a wave of complaints submitted to the FTC by customers of the mining firm. Butterfly Labs later reopened following court approval.  In a statement, Butterfly Labs said that it continues to dispute the FTC's suit and is focusing its attention on processing customer refunds.  “BFL continues to believe that the FTC case had no merit, but agreed to settle for $15,000 to avoid ongoing litigation expenses and conserve remaining assets for payment of refunds to consumers,"" the firm said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/18/ftc-settles-charges-against-bitcoin-mining-firm-butterfly-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c70031aa222d80eaccd8f43d4b34c2e94a87138-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7innP,1455810099,Meet Boost VC's Newest Bitcoin and Blockchain Startups,"Boost VC, the San Mateo-based startup incubator led by CEO Adam Draper, announced 'Tribe 7' yesterday, its latest group of 20 early-stage startups.  With its latest batch, Boost's portfolio currently stands at 138 companies – 55 working on blockchain products and 34 on virtual reality.  The incubator now claims to be the most active investor in both of those sectors, adding that a total of over $125m that has been raised by its startups to date.  Notably, while Tribe 5 was dominated by bitcoin and blockchain startups – accounting for 90% of the 25 firms – last year's Tribe 6 and now Tribe 7 have seen those numbers drop, first to five and now to four, as Boost increases its focus on virtual reality.  Here are the four blockchain startups joining its latest class:  1. Stampery  Stampery  , according to its website, leverages the bitcoin blockchain to generate an immutable record of existence, integrity and ownership of all its users' files and emails.  What that means is users wanting prove a document existed at a certain point in time, that they are the original owner or that it has not been altered, can use Stampery to create a record on the blockchain.  The California-based startup, which has a seven-person team headed by CEO Daniele Levi, says all files are stored encrypted for security, and that all certificates are 100% counterfeit-proof and verifiable by independent third parties.  It further adds that the service is legally binding, since it leverages the global blockchain database, every certification it creates cannot ever be changed, forged or deleted.  However, legal precedence has yet to be set for the use of blockchain evidence in courts. That is surely just a matter of time.  2. Mailman  Mailman  describes itself as a service which increases the importance of emails by providing incentives ""with the power of blockchain"".  Effectively, the email sender pays a small bitcoin reward, which Mailman passes to the receiver when they reply to the message.  Mailman notifies the reciever of an email and handles the transactions by using ""cutting-edge open-source technologies"".  Mailman is a Pakistan-based firm run by CEO Amin Shah Gilani and CTO Rana Waleed Asmat. It works using services by exchange and wallet provider Coinbase and email automation firm Mailgun.  3. Magic. in Bits  This three-person Israeli startup, headed by CEO Eli Ben Nun, offers a variety of services under the tag line ""Intelligent security for the blockchain"".  From an ""intelligent co-signer"" using multi-sig technology for cryptocurrency storage, to supply chain protection, to security audits and compliance checks for blockchain systems, Magic. in Bits is covering a host of blockchain services under a broad security umbrella.  The firm describes itself on CrunchBase as ""the 'credit score' for digital currencies with an active layer of defence"", adding:  ""We provide a co-signer powered by an analysis engine as a layer that shields transactions from theft and fraud.""  4. Ownership Technology  ""We are a global industry pioneer with a mission: We want to help both individuals and enterprises to protect their precious intellectual properties. We are the superhero of ownership at this digital age,"" says the team at Ownership.  Under the guidance of co-founder and CEO Keda Che, the six-person team offers anti-counterfeiting IT solutions to enterprises around the world, relying on blockchain technology to prevent unauthorized use of both digital and physical properties.  Users can either register ownership of a property or transfer its ownership to others through the company, which records the details on the blockchain.

42378625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iniN,1455805113,HashFast's $1 Million Question: Is Bitcoin a Currency or Commodity?,"Although multiple regulators and judges have attempted to legally classify bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco has an opportunity to determine whether bitcoin should be treated like a commodity or like US currency.  In HashFast Technologies LLC v Lowe, the Bankruptcy Court is being asked to determine whether the recipient of a transfer of bitcoins has to return (a) the actual bitcoins transferred or their current value (treat them as property), or (b) the value of the bitcoins on the day they were transferred (treat them as currency).  In HashFast, the debtor, Hashfast Technologies LLC, transferred to Lowe 3,000 BTC, which were worth $363,861.43 at the time. Today, they are worth approximately $1.3m. The Trustee for the debtor sued to “clawback” the transfer into the bankruptcy estate (either as an avoidable preference or fraudulent transfer), based on claims that the transfer was fraudulent or unauthorized.  Using 11 U.S.C. §550(a), the bankruptcy trustee seek to may recover the transfers for the benefit of the creditors of the bankruptcy estate.  The Trustee and Lowe, the recipient of the transfer, are arguing over the classification of the bitcoin because, if the bitcoins are a commodity, then the Trustee is entitled to the return of 3,000 BTC or the current value of $1.3m; if the bitcoins are US currency then the Trustee is only entitled to the return of $363,861.43.  Arguments heard  The Trustee has argued that bitcoin should be treated as a commodity based on guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treating bitcoin as property, and based on rulings from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which also treat bitcoin as a commodity, claiming that the Bankruptcy Court should order the return of the transferred bitcoins themselves or their current value (which has appreciated since the transfer to Lowe.)  Lowe argues that the transfer at issue was always discussed in terms of fiat currency, and that the Trustee should only be able to recover the value of the bitcoins at the time of the transfer.  Lowe’s position is based on interpretations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he contends, as well as multiple case opinions whereby judges determined that bitcoin is a form of currency. He further claims that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) considers bitcoin to be form of currency, and that the Bankruptcy Court should view bitcoin as a currency and limit the Trustee’s recovery to the value at the time of transfer.  Lowe claims that the Trustee is unfairly seeking to recover a windfall because the fiat value of bitcoins transferred has risen since the transfer to Lowe, and that if bitcoin’s value had fallen, the Trustee would take a contrary position.  The relevant bankruptcy statute, 11 USC §550(a), states:  “…the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property.”  Defining value  Although the purpose of section 550 is to recover from the correct party and to restore the estate to the financial condition that would have existed had the transfer never occurred, § 550(a) does not define “value,” nor indicate at what time “value” is to be determined.  A bankruptcy court has discretion on how to value the property so as to put the estate in its pre-transfer position, and is empowered to award the greater of the sums to the trustee (Sanders v Hang (In re: Hang), 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 2836 (Bankr. E.D. Cal. Aug 16, 2007).  Cases in which the value of transferred property appreciated after the transfer are uncommon. In those rare circumstances, courts will make determinations based upon the circumstances of each individual case.  In those rare cases, courts ordered the return of the appreciated asset because the focus “is not on what the transferee gained by the transaction but rather on what the bankruptcy estate lost as a result of the transfer.” (In re: Gardner, 2007 WL 2915847, at *3 (Bankr. D. Utah Feb. 23, 2007).  Implications for HashFast  The same outcome would occur if a foreign currency is substituted for bitcoins. If the debtor transferred €500, and those euros appreciated over the course of the case, then the trustee should be entitled to recover the €500, even though at the time of recovery it would take more dollars to buy the same number of euros.  Lowe argues that the bankruptcy estate should not be returned to its condition prior to transferring the bitcoins to Lowe, and instead should only receive the value at the time of the transfer, even though the law allows the court to award the property transferred to the Trustee.  The true issue is not whether bitcoin is a currency or commodity, but rather whether bitcoin is US currency or not.  Once the Bankruptcy Court determines that it is not US currency, the issue will probably be resolved, and bitcoin will be viewed like a non-US currency and treated like a commodity (i.e. similar to gold) under the applicable statute. Accordingly, even if the Bankruptcy Court rules in favor of the Trustee, the resulting opinion will do little to settle the currency versus commodity debate.
