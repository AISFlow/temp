42376465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai0Z,1368913692,"How to buy Bitcoin 2013 stuff ... with bitcoins, of course #Bitcoin2013","During the lunch hour at Bitcoin 2013, Tony Rousmaniere of Fairbanks, Alaska, walked up to the BitPay booth and asked to buy a few copies of Bitcoin Magazine.  ""We only take bitcoin,"" warned BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi.  The transaction's first hurdle had arisen: Rousmaniere keeps his bitcoins on a USB drive, not in an online account that could be easily accessed with his smartphone. He considers going to the ATM being demo'd at the show to change dollars into bitcoins. Instead, a friend offers to pay for the magazine with his Coinbase account, telling Rousmaniere he can pay him back later.  Bryan Krohn, BitPay's chief financial officer, pulls up the transaction on his laptop: three magazines at $8.88 each, or 0.2164 bitcoins total. Rousmaniere's friend needs to scan the QR code with the Coinbase app on his phone. He tries, but can't make it scan. Maybe the app is looking for a bar code, not a QR code, he speculates.  The two friends head over to the Coinbase booth to find out what the problem is. After Coinbase reps show them the app really can scan QR codes, they return to the BitPay booth to try again. This time, the scan works on the first try. On his phone screen, Rousmaniere's friend confirms the amount he wants to spend. Moments later, Krohn receives confirmation that the 0.2164 bitcoins has arrived, and hands over the magazines.  Rousmaniere, who notes that the total price changed by about three cents -- thanks to fluctuations in bitcoin values -- from transaction start to finish, nevertheless thinks the whole thing is pretty cool.  ""It's really fascinating how to watch all these really smart people try to figure out how this works,"" said Rousmaniere, who considers himself a futurist.  His friend notes with a laugh, ""I do think it would be handy if there was a Coinbase rep everywhere I go.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/18/how-to-buy-bitcoin-2013-stuff-with-bitcoins-of-course-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8272cdc896e4bd47d0a8d655030432090850ff1a-628x430.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376475,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiFf,1368909986,Regulatory compliance a high-stakes 'must' for bitcoin businesses #Bitcoin2013,"During a crowded session at the Bitcoin 2013 show in San Jose today, a panel of businesspeople and attorneys addressed the knotty challenges faced by bitcoin businesses trying to comply with regulatory guidance.  It's an issue that was lent new urgency this past week with the US government's seizure of assets connected with a subsidiary of Mt. Gox, the world's largest bitcoin exchange.  Bitcoin businesses have also been treading carefully in the wake of new guidance recently issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which spells out registration and reporting requirements for money services businesses (MSBs) using virtual currencies. Several bitcoin exchange closures have been linked to the guidance.  Bitcoin companies need to take regulations seriously and be aware they must comply from the first transaction they undertake, warned panel member J. Dax Hansen, a Seattle attorney with the law firm of Perkins Coie who specializes in payments, technology and international business.  ""These laws ... have civil penalties and criminal liability attached to them,"" Hansen noted. ""If you get it wrong, the stakes are very high and it's critical to figure out what your model is and make sure that you have your ducks in a row.""  Hansen advises companies that aren't sure about anything to submit all questions in writing to FinCen.  ""If you send them in, I think FinCEN has indicated that they're willing to figure out what the right answers are,"" he said.  Ryan Straus, an attorney who founded a specialist payments team at the Seattle law firm of Graham & Dunn, noted that, in the US, financial regulations have a different focus at the federal and the state level.  ""The federal government's worried about money transmission, about money laundering, anti-money laundering and terrorism financing ..., Straus said. ""On the state side, we're primarily concerned about consumer protection.""  On that front, the finality of bitcoin transactions -- as opposed to credit-card payments where unhappy customers can request chargebacks -- can be a thorny issue.  ""Finality is a hard thing to sell from a consumer protection standpoint,"" Straus said, adding that state regulations can be tough. ""I have yet to find a state that is more lenient than the federal government.""  Hansen agreed.  ""The states are the problem,"" Hansen said. ""The federal regime is manageable. You register ..., you keep records, you file suspicious activity reports.""  Meeting ""know-your-customer"" requirements can be especially difficult when dealing with bitcoins. And Hansen questions whether all bitcoin activities are actually money transferring and subject to those regulations.  ""Banks are not subject to state money transmitter laws,"" he said. ""You can talk about partnering with someone who has licenses in all the relevant states, or is exempt from these laws, and is willing to provide the services.""  One audience member asked whether bitcoin businesses could obtain provisional licensing while working toward full compliance with financial regulations.  ""There is no interim licensing,"" Straus said. ""The barrier to entry is a hard issue to absorb for money transmitters ... The alternative is to be a bank or other financial institution, and that's really expensive.""  Fulfilling all the necessary requirements can also be time-consuming, said Claire Sammon Roberts, senior vice president of operations and risk management for San Francisco-based ZipZap, which enables online cash transactions.  ""Prior to ZipZap and another company I worked for, we got money transmitter licenses in all states,"" Roberts said. ""It took 18 months"" ... and that was with a team of people working on it full time.  ""I had to be available whenever a regulator wanted to ask me questions,"" she said. ""A couple didn't want to give us licenses until they actually saw me ... so I went to visit them in their respective states.""  Taking the time to make sure everything is done right, though, is critical, noted Ryan Singer, president and chief operating officer of the US-based bitcoin exchange platform Tradehill.  ""You don't want to get denied, because if you get denied by one, you have to go back and report to everyone that you got denied by someone and that's an ugly place to be,"" Singer said.  Like it or not, bitcoin-based businesses will face special regulatory and legal challenges.  ""I feel a little bit like the undertaker at a birthday party,"" siad Brian Klein, partner at the law firm Baker Marquart and a former federal prosecutor. ""I can feel the enthusiasm for Bitcoin and what's happening here, and when you start putting lawyers on panels, it's like brakes on a car.""  Klein continued, ""Just by its very nature, Bitcoin is going to get a lot of scrutiny.""  He pointed to last week's US actions against Mt. Gox and said the possibility of criminal prosecutions is more a matter of ""when"" rather than ""if"".  ""If you look at what the basis for those warrants are, it was lying on bank forms,"" Klein said. ""You can't lie on bank forms, that's a federal crime.""  Straus asked how a company should respond on a form when it's not sure if it qualifies as a ""money transmitter"". Klein advised having the company lawyer write a letter explaining exactly why the company did or didn't check that box on the form.  ""You can't just hide behind the attorneys,"" Klein said. ""It's important to operate in good faith and be honest.""  That's especially true when you consider the federal prosecutors' point of view, Klein noted, which is ""Bitcoin's being used by drug lords, it's being used to launder money, it's being used by terrorist organizations. We can't trace this, we're suspicious. When you're under that level of scrutiny you need to be really careful.""  Straus asked whether that meant a bitcoin transaction is inherently suspicious.  ""I don't know that inherently it meets that suspicious definition,"" Klein said, ""but there's a lot of red flags out there.""  While an oft-cited advantage of bitcoin transactions is the privacy they enable, bitcoin businesses still have an obligation to know certain things about their customers. Businesses outside the US, for example, must comply with US regulations if they have US-based customers.  ""You need to collect an address or a country"" when a customer signs up, Hansen said. ""If you're internationally based and don't want to deal with US laws, don't deal with U.S. customers.""  Roberts agreed.  ""If the money's coming to or from the United States, you shouldn't try to pretend that you don't have to abide by the law of the United States,"" she said. ""We've used IP blocking, identifying verification schemes, and all those kinds of things to verify that we know where our customers are and where they're coming from.""  ""Just being offshore isn't going to make you safe from the law,"" Klein added. ""When I was a prosecutor we would reach out and get people from all over the world. There's all sorts of extradition treaties ...

42376480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiLx,1368902948,"Roger Ver tells bitcoiners, 'Spread the word' #Bitcoin2013","Whenever he needs to pay for something, be it a stick of gum or a hotel room, investor and entrepreneur Roger Ver asks the same question: ""Do you accept bitcoin?""  In the brick and mortar world, the answer is usually no. But he says that merchants are open to the idea.  ""After they hear from me a couple of times, a lot of times they start accepting bitcoin,"" Ver said.  Speaking at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose today, Ver exhorted an audience of mostly young men to do the same, and to evangelize for the digital currency to help it achieve mainstream use.  ""The vast majority of people haven't even heard of Bitcoin yet,"" he said. ""If Bitcoin has this many people this excited now, wait till the rest of the world actually hears of it. That's our job, is to let people know ... how it can make their life better and easier. The world is just going to love it.""  Ver specifically addressed the advantages that business owners gain by accepting bitcoins. One major benefit, he noted, is cost savings.  While merchants pay credit-card companies 2 to 3 percent -- sometimes even as much as 9 percent -- to process payments, Ver said, ""with bitcoin, you can send and receive money anywhere in the world essentially for free.""  Merchants that don't want to hold bitcoins can convert payments into their local currency for a fee of about 1 percent, he added.  The other major advantage Bitcoin brings to businesses, Ver said, is helping them avoid the fraud and chargebacks that happen with credit card purchases.  Credit-card companies can force merchants to refund a buyer's money if the customer is not happy with a purchase. But with bitcoins, the funds are transferred for good. The only way for a refund to happen is if the merchant willingly pays the buyer back.  With his own e-tail business, Bitcoin Store, Ver said these savings allow him to undercut Amazon's prices. He sells electronics through a partnership with Ingram Micro, with no markup at all ... mainly as a way to pressure other retailers to accept bitcoins, he said.  ""If we make money we hope to do it by holding the bitcoin,"" Ver said, noting that he's bullish on the currency's future value.  Ver also holds investments in a number of Bitcoin-related companies, including Bitpay.  The privacy inherent in bitcoin transactions -- as with cash, no statement comes in the mail showing who you've paid for what -- can also make life easier for certain businesses, Ver said.  He shared an anecdote about a company selling adult services in Japan. Chargebacks are often a problem for such companies, when wives discover charges for racy services on credit-card bills and husbands deny having made them. If the wife calls the credit company to report the charge as fraud, the company often has to refund the money, Ver said.  Accepting bitcoins could make that whole scenario go away, leaving the companies, the clients and potentially even their spouses happier, Ver said. Men who want to keep their transactions private transactions could simply use cash to buy bitcoins without leaving a paper trail, he said, while ""The wife is glad because their credit card is no longer getting 'stolen'.""  For online companies, Ver continued, accepting bitcoins not only cuts fraud losses but can open up new markets where it would otherwise be too risky to accept credit cards.  ""You can't accept credit cards from certain countries,"" he said. ""If somebody wants to buy something from you from Indonesia with a credit card, almost certainly it's going to be credit-card fraud.""  With bitcoins, though, an online merchant can feel just as safe accepting a payment from Indonesia as from Indiana.  To be sure, there have been hackings and thefts of bitcoins, Ver noted. But these have revealed weaknesses in the security of the sites that were hacked, not in the currency itself, he said. A bitcoin heist is no more indicative of a problem with Bitcoin than a bank robbery in London means there is a problem with British pounds.  During Ver's talk, one audience member asked whether businesses should worry about a more systemic hack or technical problem that could cause the whole Bitcoin system to topple.  ""There is a risk of that,"" Ver acknowledged. ""But as every day goes by that there hasn't been a major catastrophe, (the risks) are lower and lower.""  Another audience member voiced concern that bitcoin transactions lack the consumer protections that credit cards offer -- like those chargebacks that merchants so dislike. For trusted merchants, such as Amazon, Ver said, this won't be a problem for most consumers.  For large transactions with unfamiliar merchants, however, Ver said buyers might want to turn to one of the new bitcoin escrow services ... or just choose to use a credit card instead. But as more and more applications and services spring up to fill both merchants' and shoppers' needs, Ver said he feels confident that the number of transactions where shoppers feel they need to use credit cards will become fewer and fewer.  ""The step from where we are today to getting widespread adoption is just making it easier to use,"" Ver said.  ""It's just a question of how soon we're going to see widespread adoption. It's not a question of 'if'.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/18/roger-ver-tells-bitcoiners-spread-the-word-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07e9ec9b4c7458638ea1e2e91c842656e67fc6dc-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
