42397579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5OB,1398463509,Bitcoin Foundation Election Deadline Extended Due to Voting 'Hiccups',"The Bitcoin Foundation has extended the deadline for voting in its ongoing special election to fill the two industry seats left vacant by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem.  Though voting was originally slated to end at midnight EST on 28th April, the deadline has been extended to Wednesday, 30th April.  Brian Goss, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's election committee, sent the message via email to eligible voters, notifying them of the change.  Wrote Goss:  ""On account [of] the hiccups we had getting the vote launched as well as the numerous reports of ballots getting stuck in spam folders, we will be extending the voting deadline to 11:59 PM US Eastern time on Wednesday, April 30th.""  The issues were previously reported and resolved on 22nd April, however, Goss has stated that the change was made to ensure that no votes were lost in the process.  Candidates for the open seats include Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham, BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee and BitcoinBlackFriday organizer Jon Holmquist.  For more details on the candidates and their respective platforms, visit the Bitcoin Foundation's official election forum.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42397589,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5X2,1398461423,Bitcoin Game Show Gives Away Nearly 20 BTC Since Launch,"Back in March, live streaming company Streamin’ Garage announced the world’s first bitcoin-only game show, ""Take My Bitcoins.""  Since then, the series has gone on to produce four episodes with between 18 and 19 BTC given away to participants to date.  ""Take My Bitcoins"" is sponsored by ButterflyLabs, and uses bitcoins generated by the show’s in-house mining rig for prizes. ButterflyLabs also contributes to each show’s prize purse, which averages 4 BTC per show.  Creator, host and executive producer Mike Rotman told CoinDesk that one of the major successes of the show has been the opportunity to educate those unfamiliar with bitcoin about the concept of digital currencies.  Said Rotman:  “It’s a great fan base that’s building, which is why I love the bitcoin community. You know, they’re really into it, they’re really supportive, they want to help they show [and] they want to win bitcoins each week.”  A game show for bitcoin  ""Take My Bitcoins"" leverages social media, particularly Twitter, as well as an online chat room, to pool contestants for the show. Social media is also used to field questions for certain segments, such as a game involving the use of hashtags to create jokes in a bid to win bitcoins.  Another segment called “This Or That” gives contestants the chance to accrue bitcoin winnings for correctly identifying which of two categories the given word or phrase belongs to - in the most recent episode, a contestant had to choose if a word was a dictator or a cookie.  Over the course of the week, ""Take My Bitcoins"" accepts guesses via Twitter for how many bitcoins the in-house mining rig can produce between episodes. Whoever comes closest wins a percentage of that week’s earnings.  Entertainment as an education tool  Rotman looks at the show as a vehicle for bringing information about bitcoin to who don’t know too much about it. Additionally, it’s an opportunity for people to learn how to use and spend bitcoins.  Rotman said:  “There’s no hardcore bitcoin questions - it’s not that kind of show. The whole point of the show is: give away bitcoin to everybody, and then explain what they can do with it.  The entertainment aspects of the show, he said, are a good way to get people more comfortable with the idea of bitcoin who might otherwise be daunted by the technological aspects of digital currency.  ""Take My Bitcoins"" can be seen on Thursdays at 8 p.m. PST on the program's official website.

42397580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5PA,1398457224,British Isle’s Plan to Mint Physical Bitcoins Loses Key Support,"The British Island of Alderney made headlines in the bitcoin world last November when it revealed detailed plans to use bitcoin as part of its financial infrastructure, stating that it would seek to mint physical bitcoins and launch financial service centres devoted to digital currency.  However, those plans are facing new setbacks according to a 25th April report from The Financial Times, which indicates that the UK's Royal Mint, a state-backed body that mints coins in the country, has discontinued discussions related to the project.  Alderney's finance committee chair Robert McDowall told FT that he was disappointed about the withdrawal, given that the decision came just ahead of when plans were scheduled to be finalized.  The island had planned to mint a commemorative bitcoin worth roughly £500 and to release the offering within the next few months.  The news notably follows the Isle of Man's plans to potentially open its doors to digital currency exchanges. The UK dependency is aiming to make only small changes to its statutory instruments to achieve regulation over such businesses.  The Royal Mint did not provide comment to the FT report.  Regulatory hurdles  The decision by Royal Mint to drop out of the discussions reportedly followed another issue with Alderney's larger neighbor Guernsey.  According to the report, Guernsey has told Alderney that it would not approve of Alderney's association with digital currencies due to fear of reputational risk.  The media outlet indicates that Alderney requires Guernsey's approval for such actions, potentially putting the plan in jeopardy.  Hopes remain  Still, while the prospect of Alderney minting physical bitcoins may be dwindling, McDowall is optimistic that digital currencies can become a part of the island's future.  McDowall told FT it is hopeful it will be able to launch an index to track the value of digital currencies, as well as a fund for such projects.  ""It would be wonderful to have such an index established in Alderney, however, the index could be sited in another jurisdiction that is more welcoming of financial innovation.""

42397592,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5ay,1398454217,All Things Alt: A Crypto Congress and a Birthday for Feathercoin,"Another week in the unpredictable world of alternative digital currencies has yielded some interesting developments. Read on for just a taste of the many things going on in the altcoin world today!  Happy birthday, feathercoin!  Feathercoin  turned one year old this past week. The scrypt-based proof-of-work coin debuted on 16th April 2013, and has long possessed a passionate and involved community.  In a messagehttps://forum.feathercoin.com/index.php?/topic/6960-happy-birthday-feathercoin/ posted on the official feathercoin forum, lead developer Bushtar thanked the community for its dedication and meditated on some of the events of the past year. At the same time, he acknowledged some of the challenges lying ahead for feathercoin.  CoinDesk has learned that an anniversary party will be held at The Oxford Blue in the UK on Saturday, 26th April.  The community has also raised 6,000 FTC, or about $900, to be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.  A new game for caishencoin  This week, Tiny Elementals - an animated racing game for the Android and iOS platforms - became available for download. The project was developed by members of the caishencoin community, and is aimed at providing not only a way for users to spend their caishencoins, but also return value to the community at large.  As developer Stuhlman told CoinDesk, users will be able to exchange their caishencoins for codes that can later be redeemed in-game for points. Points can be spent on abilities and powerups available in Tiny Elementals.  When asked about the team’s relationship with Apple, Stuhlman said that there has been no official communication with the company. Because no caishencoins actually pass through the game - codes are redeemed via a separate portal out-of-game, they say the concept does not run afoul of Apple’s scrutiny of digital currencies.  Said Stuhlman:  “We want to build Zynga in crypto, but at the same time not bring in too much burden on the devs, Apple have been very strict about using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies so we want to play by the rules for now.”  The community will also be holding weekly tournaments, with prizes being offered in caishencoins and other alts.  Mastercoin team looks to expand  The mastercoin development team announced on its official blog that it is seeking a new hiring manager.  Mastercoin’s team also posted other open positions, including product manager and web team lead, at the beginning of April.  In the blog post, team member Ripper234 laid out the qualifications perspective candidates need to present. The position is not full-time, but any applicants should have experience working as a tech hiring manager, possess developed communication skills and be ""superficially familiar with Bitcoin"".  More information about the position can be found here.  Strange alt of the week  This week’s Strange Alt of the Week award goes to houseofcoins (sign: HOC). Styled after the popular Netflix show starring Kevin Spacey, the coin is designed to create power institutions within its community based an owner’s accrued holdings.  HOC utilizes the scrypt proof-of-work algorithm and sports a 21 million coin supply limit. The coin will debut with a 50% premine to be distributed among participants in an initial public offering. The block time is two minutes, with a per-block reward of 50 houseofcoins per block and no reward halving scheduled.  Everyone who owns houseofcoins gets a proportional vote on decisions made by community, including funded projects. The person who owns the most houseofcoins is considered the President, with Vice President and Speaker of the House positions designated for the second- and third-largest wallet owners. All other coinholders are considered part of the House. While there are no limits on ownership, no single holder may have more than 10% voting power.  In a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum, developer BitOffer wrote that votes in the House will determine the majority of decisions. A later post proposed the concept of investing in mining hardware in order to generate revenue.  Unlike most new coins, the announcement suggested that listing houseofcoins on an exchange was not a primary goal and would be left to the community to decide.

42397593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5Z0,1398449711,Family: Ross Ulbricht Conviction Would 'Threaten Internet Freedom',"More than six months after the seizure and subsequent closure of the online black market Silk Road, the case against its alleged mastermind Ross Ulbricht presses on, most recently in the form of a 64-page court filing in which Ulbricht's attorneys elaborated on how they plan to defend against the laundry list of charges brought against their client.  However, while it may be easy for the bitcoin community to tune out the now regular developments in the case as a speed bump on the road to the technology's wider adoption, such an escape is not available to Kirk and Lyn Ulbricht, the mother and father of the man who authorities allege used the alias Dread Pirate Roberts to commit a litany of crimes, and who is currently serving time in New York's Metropolitan Detention Center as he awaits trial.  Speaking to CoinDesk about a range of topics related to their lives and the case, the Ulbrichts frequently use words like ""daunting"", ""difficult"" and ""discouraging"" to describe the challenge in balancing the needs of their personal lives, their Costa Rican vacation rental business, their son's case, and, perhaps their most high-profile endeavor in the bitcoin community, FreeRoss.org – the website that seeks monetary donations for Ross Ulbricht's defence.  After the wave of initial press coverage, the Ulbrichts are still searching for ways to raise awareness about their son's case and what they believe to be its larger ramifications for Internet commerce.  Said Lyn Ulbricht:  ""[What's interesting about] the indictment is how they're using the law. There's a big problem with it and the impact that it could have on Internet freedom and freedom of speech.""  According to Lyn and Kirk, the indictments against their son ""hold a grave danger"" for the Internet, one that could affect service providers and websites that host third parties, and by extension many of the major brands that rely on such laws to avoid substantial liabilities.  Added Lyn:  ""One of the things that we're really trying to emphasize right now is for people to realize that this case affects much more than just this one person, Ross Ulbricht.""  'Changed landscape'  Issued in late March, the most recent court filing by Ross Ulbricht's defence team notably used recent decisions from US regulatory bodies such as FinCEN and the IRS to argue that certain money-related criminal charges do not fit Ulbricht's crimes.  For the Ulbrichts, however, the most important takeaway is perhaps how their son's case could impact Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, though they maintain hope that the case will be thrown out altogether.  That 1996 ruling sought to shield Internet entrepreneurs from liability against the criminal actions of their users. Under this law, large online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay are treated as service providers, not publishers, and are therefore shielded from culpability should someone break a law when publishing via their service.  Reads the official motion to dismiss:  ""[Under Section 230] lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher’s traditional editorial functions – such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, postpone or alter content - are barred.""  The rationale was that such restrictions would encourage these providers to censor users for fear of costly legal retribution should their platforms be misused.  The motion continued to state why the defence believes the charges represent a new, and potentially worrying application of the law.  ""In fact, prior to this case, internet service providers, search engines, or browsers have never been charged criminally for permitting content or even hosting web sites that tolerate or even promote illegal activity – thereby providing those web sites and activities the very same 'platform' Mr. Ulbricht is alleged to have provided.""  Explained Kirk Ulbricht:  ""If Ross is convicted, then it will change the whole landscape of the Internet and it will mean that service providers, website operators, hosts, third parties will be criminally liable for criminal clients.""  As an example, the law has been used by online classifieds provider Craigslist, which in 2009 was not deemed liable for actions conducted by its users.  As such, Lyn and Kirk's comments suggest that their son's legal defence is seeking to put forth the claim that Silk Road was a service provider, and should be eligible for protection under this law.  It should be noted, though, that the prosecution must still prove that Ross Ulbricht was the user of the alias Dread Pirate Roberts and the administrator of the site, and that Section 230 does have an exception for federal criminal liability.  Donations update  To date, Lyn says that FreeRoss.org has not received ""a ton"" of donations, but that they typically come in waves when press coverage is more pronounced.  She stresses that, despite some claims, the family has not benefited from their son's substantial bitcoin holdings – the roughly 144,000 BTC now in custody of the government and the subject of its own ongoing legal dispute.  Said Lyn:  ""There is this perception that we have plenty of money because of bitcoin.""  Contrary to this claim, Lyn states that ""[donations] come to [the family] and basically go straight to the lawyer"". Further, she noted that the family currently owes a significant amount to lawyers and forensic experts.  As an example of the high cost of litigation, she noted that the US government has submitted 10 terabytes of digital evidence so far in the case - an amount some estimates suggest is roughly equivalent to all the printed material collection of the US Library of Congress – all of which needs to be explored.  Daily struggle  Lyn notes that ""everything has been hard"" since her son's arrest, but that she and her husband are preferring to take things day by day.  She described her current feelings toward her son's situation, stating:  ""It's a long haul, sometimes we're encouraged and sometimes it's just, you know, we see Ross every week and it's very difficult. [...] It can be frightening, then other times you try to take it one day at a time and do whatever we can to help him and also get the word out there.""  She also talked about her steep learning curve with all the aspects around the management of FreeRoss.org. Prior to launching the site, she says that she was not familiar with bitcoin, Facebook or many of the other tools she now uses regularly.  The family has received help from volunteers who have dedicated time to assisting their efforts, Lyn added.  Adjusting to prison life    Lyn also spoke about Ross's mental state while he is in prison awaiting trial. So far, she indicates that her son is trying his best to maintain his spirits, though she says he is without certain privileges. For instance, he has been restricted from accessing email.    She said:  ""He's giving a lot of heart to the people in there, it's just heartbreaking to see people with families – people who he feels shouldn't be there – so he's trying to do his best to be a positive force [...] while he's there.""  Ross's floor in the prison is one of the more ""mellow and peaceful ones"", Lyn said, adding that her son is doing his best to contribute to this environment:  If someone is agitated or angry or upset, he'll talk to them. He's trying to be a good influence, and that's just kind of who he is. He's trying to make the best of a very, very hard situation.""  Experience with bitcoin community  Lyn also told CoinDesk about her recent experience at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in March, which she described as positive:  ""They were just very happy to have me at the conference, most everyone I met was very gracious and supportive and [showed] a lot of compassion – really wonderful people.""  Still, she indicated her belief that the bitcoin and wider Internet community should be more aware of her son's court case:  ""I understand why people are like 'it's not my kid, why would I help him?' But, it's really the case itself, it looks to be that it's going to be precedent-setting and affect a lot of aspects of the Internet and Internet commerce.""  Lyn added: ""It's going to be quite a battle""; and her comments suggests it is one that she and her husband are seeking more support in fighting.

42397598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5bx,1398432860,How Kipochi is Taking Bitcoin into Africa,"Pelle Braendgaard is the co-founder of Kipochi, a UK-based, globally focused bitcoin wallet service started in March 2013.  Kipochi notably integrated with Kenya-based mobile payments provider M-Pesa in July 2013, allowing its users to send and receive bitcoins before converting them to local currency.  Braendgaard recently spoke at Inside Bitcoins NYC as part of the a keynote panel called ""Bitcoin, Remittances and the Developing World"". The panel included Epiphyte CEO Edan Yago and Let's Talk Bitcoin! co-host Stephanie Murphy, among others.  After the session, CoinDesk spoke to Braendgaard in a candid conversation about the challenges bitcoin faces in the developing world.  CoinDesk: Since Kipochi is mostly focused on developing markets, some readers may be unfamiliar with your service and its mission. Can you start by briefing us a bit on the big-picture vision for the company?  Pelle Braendgaard: What we're trying to do is, first of all, create a wallet that allows you to send and receive bitcoins. I think that most current wallets are just not very easy to use for your average user.  We do that by modeling it very much on how mobile money systems work in Africa. There, you can send money with your mobile number, if you send money to someone, a wallet gets created in the background and you can just access it. So, there's no sign-up.  You spoke at length today about the challenges bitcoin faces in the remittance market. Should consumers view Kipochi as a wallet provider or a remittance service?  Remittance is really an old-fashioned way of looking at it. You'd go into the Western Union office and send an amount of money to Senora Gonzalez, or whoever, in some country, and she could go to an office down there and pick it up. Yes, it's electronic, but the end user doesn't do anything electronic. They deal person-to-person.  So, that model doesn't really work with bitcoin. It could work with bitcoin as a back-end, but bitcoin itself doesn't have a way of providing an identifiable person behind it, so you need to send money to a bitcoin address somehow.  [With] that model, unless it's just Western Union and they change from using whatever electronic system they use now to use bitcoin as a back-end, things may be a little cheaper, but the savings is not really big.  I see remittances being more like mobile money, where you load money onto the phone and send it to someone, who can then go and cash that money out.  Given that the international market is so large, do you view Kipochi as a company that has competitors in the bitcoin wallet or remittance space?  Our primary competitors are existing remittance systems.  I mean, you could say that other bitcoin wallets like Blockchain are our competitors, but they're really only our competitors in the established technical user space. People will argue that non-technical users can use bitcoin and download an Android wallet, but most of them are really, really complicated.  Your average user starts getting scared if he sees all kinds of crazy code, which is what a bitcoin address is, it's just a bunch of letters and numbers and it freaks people out.  Maybe a phone number used to freak people out, but at least there was a period where you'd call your operator and say 'I'd like to call Mr Smith in number 12', they would do that. So, there was this period where people got used to the numbers.  I think it's actually the biggest stumbling block in the bitcoin community.  When you think of remittance providers, you think of companies that need licensing to operate in different countries. Do bitcoin wallets need licensing if they're used for international money sending?  No jurisdiction so far has not come out with any rules regarding wallets. The exchange is what you have to go in and license. The exchange is the equivalent of the Western Union office. Here in the US, at Coinbase, we can get money in and out using our bank accounts.  Developing countries and immigrants, they would prefer to go into an agent of some sort and do it in person. We're working with banks and operators to make an easy way for people to exchange bitcoin for Kenyan shilling in their bank account. It'll take time before that deal is confirmed, but we're working with them.  In the meantime, LocalBitcoins and similar kinds of services are where people are going to start using these systems. If you look at M-Pesa, you could go to a local agent and someone you trust, so they were able to grow quickly.  It will be very easy for those businesses to offer bitcoin services, so I see a lot of new business coming from there.  How does Kipochi plan to adapt its wallet offering to serve a remittance function?  The wallet doesn't handle the translation into the local currency [...] We'll be announcing a South African exchange soon – it will be the first one where you can move money between your Kipochi wallet and the exchange.  So, we're looking at it in a way where we are helping exchanges. Whether those exchanges are online or not, it's all the same for us, we provide an easy way for them to get money in and out of wallets so they can build their own business.  Given that you're casting such a wide net by focusing on the developing world, how differently are you approaching different markets?  Our base wallet is going to be the same, but each exchange will be determined by the regulatory culture of each country.  For example, in Kenya, people are a lot more used to dealing with mobile money, so I see Kenya being small agents first, then fairly quickly banks will offer a service where you can get money in and out of your wallet.  We're already talking with banks to do that down there. So, there will be a button where – I won't mention the banks that we're working with – but you'll be able to move money in and out of your bank account.  Let's talk about Kenya. Its consumers are the most experienced with digital money, and therefore it would seem, most likely to understand your solution. Are you worried about not being able to replace solutions like M-Pesa for this reason?  [Bitcoin]’s cheaper, it's international. The international part is the important part. For people sending money in Kenya, there's no way we can compete with M-Pesa within the next year or so, probably in the longer-term, yes.  But, there are a lot of problems with M-Pesa. They are very, very happy with themselves and trying to cut competitors out as much as possible.  One of the pain points that comes up when talking about international markets is that those who might benefit the most from solutions like bitcoin might not have the technical knowledge to understand them or be worried about its volatility. How big is this issue?  Initially it will be an issue, and for mass adoption it will need to be solved. But, there are enough people that can use the technology now. It won't reach the grandmas just yet, until that volatility issue is solved.  Education is a big issue. Most of our users are pretty much young well-educated tech-savvy guys in their twenties. I don't have definite numbers on that, but that's everyone I talk to.  This interview was edited for clarity.  Smartphone user image via Shutterstock.

42397590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5Y1,1398428054,France: Bitcoin Revenues Must be Declared to Tax Authorities,"The French Ministry of Economy and Finance has said that, while bitcoin is not officially recognized by the state, revenues generated from digital currency transactions are subject to taxation.  However, under French law, there exists a certain margin of tolerance for minor and irregular revenues for those who do not make their living from bitcoin trading, according to the ministry.  ""For the time being, there is no declarative obligation in what concerns bitcoin,” a spokesperson for the French ministry told local daily Le Monde, explaining:  ""All taxpayers are required to declare all their revenues, including those originating from abroad. This said, there is a certain tolerance [from the state authorities] regarding minor and irregular revenues, for instance from occasional sales.”  Disputed legal status of bitcoin  The unclear legal status of bitcoin in France makes imposing taxes on bitcoin-related revenues wired to personal bank accounts a controversial issue, according to the French Banking Federation (Fédération bancaire française or FBF):  ""The declaration is not related to bitcoin, which is not illegal. If your response does not allow [the tax authorities] to understand the operation, the bank could be forced to file a declaration to [the French anti-money laundering office] Tracfin accordingly with the law.”  In addition to this, the bank could also ask its clients whether bitcoin trading is their main professional activity, said the FBF.  The statement by the Ministry of Economy and Finance comes as a confirmation of the stance presented by the Bank of France in a paper published in December 2013.  In it the bank said:  ""Bitcoin cannot be considered as a currency, given that it is possible to refuse payment made in bitcoin without violating article R642-3 of the [French] Penal Code which sanctions refusal of banknotes and coins denominated in the euro.”  As previously reported, in late 2013, French central bankers joined their many international counterparts in issuing a warning against the risks of bitcoin trading. The bank warned that the price of bitcoin is inherently volatile, and that cryptocurrency users could have difficulties with converting their bitcoins into real money.  Moreover, the bank said that, under French law, bitcoin cannot be considered as a legal currency in line with the country’s monetary and financial code.  While the document recognizes electronic currency, it also specifies that all currency has to be fitted with a legal guarantee of reimbursement at its nominal value.

42397587,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5W3,1398422904,Bitcoin Price Drops $40 Following Reports of New PBOC Warnings,"The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has once again privately warned banks and payment companies to restrict customers' access to bitcoin exchanges, reports indicate.  The news is likely to have affected the international bitcoin price, which dropped by around $40 in the space of a few hours this morning.  CoinDesk sources said that PBOC officials held closed meetings this week with major banks and payment processors to reiterate their desire for all interaction with bitcoin companies to cease.  While there have been no big policy shifts since last December's initial statements, at various stages the PBOC has seemed more determined in its efforts to enforce that policy.  Recently, reports have mainly concerned deposits to bitcoin exchanges from banks and third-party processors, but this week's statements differed in that they involved several of China's major banks, and apparently included warnings to halt withdrawals and conversions from bitcoin to yuan (CNY) accounts as well.  As always, bitcoin exchanges in China say they have heard nothing directly from the PBOC, but are receiving the news via their financial partners.  The timing may be an attempt to curb enthusiasm for digital currencies just before China's Global Bitcoin Summit, due to take place in Beijing from 10-11th May.  Voucher block  News started to seep through today when Alipay, sometimes referred to as 'China's PayPal', issued a statement saying it would no longer support any payments related to bitcoin or litecoin.  Alipay was included in the clampdown on third-party payment companies funding bitcoin exchanges that came into force earlier this year, but today's statement suggests it needed to reaffirm its position.  The exchange's statement said:    ""To protect the property rights of the general public, support the renminbi's [yuan] place as the legal fiat currency, prevent money laundering risks: From today onwards, no individual nor entity may use any kind of our company's payment services for bitcoin, litecoin etc.      Transactions for deposits, withdrawals, purchases or sales of related vouchers and other such activities, and cannot use our company's services to transfer any funds related to such transactions. If discovered, our company has the right to immediately terminate such services.""    The company then asked for anyone who discovered such activities taking place to report it.  ""Related vouchers"" is perhaps the most noteworthy phrase in the statement, since Chinese exchanges had been using rechargeable funding codes (or vouchers) to deposit money into their accounts after banking partners limited operations.  Searching on China's Taobao marketplace now produces similarly negative results:  ""Due to relevant legal regulations and policies, we cannot display goods related to 'bitcoin'.""  Unofficial policy?  In what may or may not be a strategy to discourage bitcoin businesses, authorities in China have alternately issued verbal warnings in closed meetings to various companies that do business with bitcoin exchanges, while publicly denying any attempt to explicitly 'ban bitcoin'.  Exchange Huobi recently halted its voucher payment system, while others, such as BTC China, initially reported their financial partners had heard nothing at all despite a (once again unofficial) 'deadline' for banks to suspend deposits to bitcoin exchanges by 15th April.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story, and will update if new information becomes available.

42397597,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5ft,1398419571,Why Bitcoin Should Be Broken into 'Bits',"Any form of money needs to be easily broken down into sub-units to allow an equal exchange for goods or services. And bitcoin is wonderfully divisible, with its smallest unit being the tiny 0.00000001 of a bitcoin – a unit known as a 'satoshi'.  However, such divisibility does come with one disadvantage. The Bitcoin Wiki, a source of BTC-related knowledge, has a lengthy chart spelling out the large number of different bitcoin sub-units: including mBTC, μBTC and cBTC, and many more. But do you know what they stand for?  Thankfully, there may be a better solution.  Down to bits  A proposal floated on reddit has called for bitcoin to be broken down into just one smaller unit. That would mean that a single bitcoin would be divided into 1,000,000 individual units – or 'bits'.  So, one bit would be worth 0.000001 BTC, which at recent prices would roughly amount to $.0004. One hundred bits would be $.04.  This division of a bitcoin may seem infinitesimal now, but, given that the price of bitcoin is up about four times what it was just a year ago, and may one day be worth thousands of dollars, it makes sense.  Understanding the current units  Right now, breaking down bitcoin below the very understandable price-per-coin concept isn't easy to understand.  From memory, is it easy to recall what a μBTC (microbitcoin) is? Or that a mBTC (millibitcoin) is 0.001 of a bitcoin? Do we really need a bunch of different hard-to-remember names and acronyms?  There is a logic within the system, but such scientific nomenclature is anything but user-friendly.  Bitcoin is digital, so computers can divide it very simply, but it's not so easy for the average human brain, especially when looking at the smaller units, therefore a simpler system may be needed to help take bitcoin into the mainstream.  Travis Skweres, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMKT, said:  ""Bitcoin is capped. It's limited. Which means it needs to be chopped up into bits. [And] we need to make it easy to understand how much each of those bits are worth.""  Bitcoin's marketing problem  People roughly have a better idea of what they are getting in terms of dogecoin because it isn't worth nearly as much as bitcoin.  One thousand DOGE has a value of around $0.60. It fluctuates here and there, but 1,000 is a rounded number that most can relate to. That's one reason why dogecoin is now increasingly popular in transactions, especially in tipping.  Bitcoin seems to continue to have a marketing problem. The logo for bitcoin is another example of where important, final decisions have yet to be made, resulting in more confusing concepts about how bitcoin should be visually represented.  Skweres, who concedes that bitcoin isn't quite ready for the mainstream, believes that these sorts of issues need to be addressed so that the average person doesn't become overly confused:  ""It's all about marketing, how can you make it as easy as possible for the general public to understand?""  Size matters  No one knows how high (or low) bitcoin's price will be in the future. Because of this, careful considerations must be put in place to make sure that the bit – or whatever the community decides a bitcoin's unit of account should be – is neither too large nor too small.  The wavering value of bitcoin might be why there hasn't been a consensus decision yet.  However, the rise of venture capital investment in bitcoin, and especially in consumer-oriented BTC companies, means that leaders in the space need to make a decision on proper units of account for bitcoin soon.  This would avoid baffling potential customers with different terminology based on the whims of individual companies calculating bitcoin values for users.  Dan Held, the Director of Product at Blockchain, agrees with the bit concept, but that caution should be exercised when making a final decision on the subject of bitcoin's units below the level of 1 BTC:  ""We should have a maximum of one sub-unit for bitcoin. [But] the size of sub-unit should be chosen carefully as that one sub-unit will need to have lasting understandable value.""
