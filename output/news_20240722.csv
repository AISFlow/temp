31394123,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630889,1721689239,Solana Cooling Off After 16% Surge? TD Sell Signal Goes Off,"An analyst has pointed out how Solana is forming a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential sell signal on three of its charts, which could lead to a cooldown for the asset. Solana Has Just Witnessed A Sell Signal On Three Timeframes In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed the TD Sequential signals Solana is currently observing. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator in technical analysis generally used for locating probable reversal positions in any asset’s price. This indicator has two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of this setup, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. When the ninth candle is reached, the TD Sequential indicates that the price has reached a potential reversal point. Related Reading: XRP Adoption & Activity Spike: What This Means For Its Price Naturally, the indicator would give a sell signal if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion had been green. Similarly, the red nine candles would suggest a bottom for the asset. The second phase, the countdown, kicks off as soon as the setup finishes. This phase works in the same way, except for the fact that candles here are counted up to thirteen instead of nine. Once these thirteen candles are also in, the price could be assumed to have reached another turnaround position. Now, here are the charts shared by Ali, that show the completion of a TD Sequential phase of the former type for Solana on three different timeframes: As the graphs show, Solana has formed a TD Sequential setup with an uptrend on all three daily, four-hour, and hourly timeframes. This would mean that the coin has potentially hit the top. The sell signal has come for the cryptocurrency after it has witnessed a rally of more than 18% over the past week. The pattern doesn’t have to necessarily imply an end of this bullish momentum for the long term, but it could suggest that a cooldown may be coming shortly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming A Signal That’s Usually “Very Bullish,” Analyst Says In some other news, a massive transaction has been spotted on the SOL network during the past day, as cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert has revealed. In this transfer, a Solana whale transferred 19,068 SOL (equivalent to over $35.1 million when the transaction was executed) from an unknown wallet, likely to be the investor’s self-custodial address, to the Binance exchange. Holders generally transfer to these platforms when they want to use one of the services they offer, which can include selling. Thus, it’s possible that the whale made the move to cash in on the surge that the asset has recently witnessed. SOL Price Solana had surged to the $185 mark yesterday, but has since declined to the $180 level, a potential sign that the TD Sequential setup may be in effect.

42407812,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5rvn,1721685140,U.S. House Passes Crypto Illicit Finance Bill That's Likely to be Rebuffed in Senate,"A narrow bill to create a U.S. working group to dig into crypto use in terrorism and money laundering passed the U.S. House of Representatives in a routine vote.  The legislation isn't likely to get any further without a Senate counterpart, but it marks another congressional approval of a crypto measure.  While Congress considered this latest crypto bill, industry representatives were reaching out to Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday and encouraging her to embrace cryptocurrency as a presidential candidate.  The U.S. House of Representatives has approved another piece of cryptocurrency legislation with a routine voicevote, though the bill to set up a government working group to assess how to keep bad actors from using digital assets isn't likely to become a law as-is.  The brief bill sponsored by Rep. Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) was among crypto provisions that had previously cleared the House Financial Services Committee, but despite the bipartisan progress for sector-friendly legislation in the House – such as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) – the Senate hasn't yet matched the House's crypto embrace.  Nunn's effort, which was approved unanimously in the committee last year, would establish a temporary working group under the Treasury Department to dig into the use of digital assets in terrorism and money laundering and make recommendations on how to address it. The group would include figures from the industry, including members from ""blockchain intelligence companies.""  In a speech on the House floor, Nunn called the legislation ""crucial in strengthening America's national security, protecting our digital assets and ensuring the next generation of financial and internet technology is built right here in America.""  Jaret Seiberg, a TD Cowen analyst, suggested this bill was primarily a political exercise.  ""For crypto critics, this is a way to register their demands for money laundering crackdowns,"" he said in a client note on Monday. ""And for crypto advocates, this gives them political cover from attacks that their support for digital assets facilitates money laundering and criminal activity.""  Though crypto has risen to occupy a spot as a prominent political topic in the 2024 presidential contest, the likelihood that a narrowly divided Congress will agree on a long-awaited regulatory approach to the industry remains thin. To that end, crypto insiders are keeping a close watch on a few relevant provisions being considered for the National Defense Authorization Act – the annual bill setting the nation's defense priorities.  Also on Monday, the Digital Chamber sent a letter to Vice President Kamala Harris – now being positioned by the party as the leading candidate to take the place of President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for president. The letter asked Harris to ""take a forward-looking approach on digital assets and blockchain technology"" by adding a positive crypto position to the party's official platform and picking a running mate ""with a proven track record of engaging with digital asset technology and proposing pro-innovation policies.""  The letter echoed a number of other prominent industry participants, who similarly called for the potential Democratic leader to take a more crypto-friendly approach.

31390777,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630898,1721683855,"Polygon Network Active Addresses Just Hit A New Yearly High, But Why Is MATIC Price Down?","Polygon (MATIC) appears to be underperforming compared to the broader market, where most of the attention is directed toward other major cryptocurrencies with larger market caps. Despite this subdued price movement, the Polygon network recently experienced a significant surge in activity, reaching its highest levels in over a year. This notable increase in activity is largely attributed to recent announcements concerning the migration of Polygon’s MATIC token to the new POL tokens. Polygon Network Activity Hits Yearly High According to on-chain data from Santiment, the participation of addresses on the Polygon network surged dramatically following the announcement of the token migration. This increase was highlighted by Santiment’s Active Addresses 24-hour metric, which tracks the number of network addresses that either sent or received transactions within a 24-hour period. Remarkably, this spike in activity propelled the metric to exceed 4,200 addresses over the weekend. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says ‘Think Bigger’, Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $100,000 A deeper analysis of the on-chain data reveals that this surge represents a significant departure from the previous trend. Daily activity has been on a steady decline since March. In fact, the day before the spike, the Active Addresses metric recorded fewer than 1,500 active addresses. This sharp rise underscores the impact of the token migration news, indicating a renewed interest and engagement among some participants of the Polygon network, which contrasts sharply with the earlier downward trend in activity. MATIC Price Analysis At the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is trading at $0.534. The cryptocurrency is currently contending with a resistance level of around $0.55, a barrier that the bulls have been unable to overcome in the past 24 hours. This resistance emerged following a bullish price movement from a yearly low of $0.4313 that kickstarted on July 6, representing a 27.5% increase up to the $0.55 mark. Looking at a broader timeframe reveals that this price point has consistently posed a strong resistance level ranging up to $0.57. MATIC has made many attempts to break past this level since the last week of June. According to data from IntoTheBlock, there are currently 19,450 addresses holding a total of 454.38 million MATIC tokens at an average price of $0.57. This concentration of holdings around the $0.57 price level likely explains the resistance, as many addresses might be likely selling after moving into profitability, thereby exerting downward pressure on the price. Related Reading: Can Burns Send The Shiba Inu And LUNC Price To $0.01? Expert Chimes In MATIC’s profitability count is currently the lowest among major cryptocurrencies, with only 30,100 addresses in profit. This figure represents less than 5% of the total addresses holding MATIC. However, this could change very soon after the mainnet upgrade. The mainnet upgrade from MATIC to POL is slated to take place in September. The anticipation surrounding this event could generate significant buying pressure for MATIC, potentially improving holder profitability.

42407820,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5sIw,1721681531,"Ethereum ETFs Approved by SEC, Bringing Popular Funds to Second-Largest Cryptocurrency","U.S. regulators have given final approval for spot exchange-traded funds that hold Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, giving Americans access to a second major cryptocurrency via the easy-to-trade vehicles.  The decision caps a years-long process to get ether ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and follows the regulator's approval of bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs in January. Packaging ether in an ETF wrapper could make them more palatable to conventional investors since the funds can be bought and sold through traditional brokerage accounts. Since their debut in January, bitcoin ETFs have attracted tens of billions of dollars of investment.  Approval did not seem certain just weeks ago. But in late May, SEC officials abruptly began engaging with wannabe ETF issuers after a long silence. Then, on May 23, the regulator approved a key filing, opening up a pathway to full approval through the latest decision.  ""We've now fully entered the ETF era of crypto,"" Matt Hougan, chief investment office at Bitwise, said. ""Investors can now access more than 70% of the liquid crypto asset market through low-cost ETPs.""  ""Being the first to file for an Ethereum ETF back in 2021, we have long believed investors should have access to Ethereum exposure in a vehicle they find accessible and familiar,"" said Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck. ""If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum is the open-source App Store and the gateway for exposure to the thousands of applications that will utilize blockchain technology.""  Read more: Ethereum ETFs Could See Underwhelming Demand, Two Research Firms Predict  Impact on Ethereum's price  The approval and beginning of trading of the spot bitcoin ETFs in January, which became the most successful launch in the history of exchange-traded products in terms of the speed of money rushing into them, pushed the price of the largest cryptocurrency up to new all-time highs after surging more than 58% within just two months.  Some analysts predict that while a spot ETH ETF could move the price of ether up to $6,500, inflows into those funds won't be nearly as high as for their bitcoin-focused counterparts.

Ethereum doesn't have the ""first-mover advantage"" that bitcoin had and it lacks a strong narrative such as bitcoin's ""digital gold"" belief among many supporters, a report by the firm stated.

42407816,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5s91,1721679937,"Ethereum ETFs Could See Underwhelming Demand, Partly Due to Lack of Staking, Two Research Firms Predict","Initial demand for the spot ether ETFs could be less than anticipated in part because the funds cannot stake their ETH, Wintermute and Kaiko predict.  Wintermute sees roughly 62% less inflows over the next year than bitcoin ETFs have received in six months.  A couple of prominent crypto firms see a relatively muted debut from exchange-traded funds that hold Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}.  Wintermute, a major market maker, sees ether ETFs collecting $4 billion, at most, of inflows from investors over the next year. That's below the $4.5 billion to $6.5 billion expected by most analysts – and that latter number is already roughly 62% less than the $17 billion that bitcoin ETFs have so far collected since they began trading in the U.S. six months ago.  Wintermute does, however, see ether's price gaining as much as 24% over the next 12 months, driven by those inflows.  The ETFs got regulators' final blessing Monday night, meaning issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, 21Shares and Invesco can start offering the funds and they can begin trading Tuesday.  Read more: Ethereum ETFs Approved by SEC, Bringing Popular Funds to Second-Largest Cryptocurrency  U.S. regulators balked at issuers' request to allow ether ETFs to stake the crypto they own, which would've generated income that could've been shared with investors. ""This loss reduces the competitiveness of ETH ETFs compared to direct holdings, where investors can still benefit from staking,"" Wintermute said in its report.  Research firm Kaiko shares a similar outlook based on previous Ethereum-focused launches.  ""The launch of the futures based ETH ETFs in the U.S. late last year was met with underwhelming demand,"" Will Cai, head of indices at Kaiko, said in a report. ""All eyes are on the spot ETFs' launch with high hopes on quick asset accumulation.""  He said that regardless of the long-term trend, the price of ether will likely be ""sensitive"" to inflow numbers in the first days of trading.  According to data tracked by Kaiko, ether implied volatility increased sharply over the weekend, with contracts nearest to expiry (July 26) jumping to 67% from 59%.  ""This suggests less conviction around the ETH launch, as traders are willing to pay higher premiums to hedge bets,"" the report said.  Issuers revealed their expected management fees in filings last week, clearing one of the last hurdles to getting final regulatory approval, with Grayscale's Ethereum Trust seeking to charge investors 2.5% while most other managers kept fees lower in the 0.15% to 0.25% range.

31387460,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630949,1721678409,"Ethereum Retraces: Here’s Why ETH Bulls Must Decisively Break Above $3,500","Ethereum is firm when writing, rapidly rising after slipping to around $2,800 earlier this month. As of writing, the second most valuable coin is up by over $24% and remains in an uptrend despite the scare of July 4 and 5. Ethereum Finds Strong Resistance At $3,500 Even as buyers expect ETH bulls to press on and push the coin above $3,700, a key resistance line, on-chain data shows that there is resistance. According to IntoTheBlock data on July 22, ETH has strong resistance at $3,500, which has been the case since July 16. Related Reading: Terra Classic Poised For 280% Rally On ‘Major Recovery Strength’ – Analyst At this level, 3.13 million unique addresses bought ETH at an average price of $3,547. Therefore, if prices trend below this level, these holders are in red and contemplating exiting at a loss. The fact that some addresses could be willing to dump and exit the market when prices fall makes the general environment fragile, a considerable hindrance to the upside. This makes the situation even dire, considering that ETH is not all that firm despite the expansion of July 15. From the daily chart, the uptrend remains, but there are pockets of weaknesses due to the sharpness of the July 4 and 5 dumps. The sell-off forced ETH towards the $2,800 level, reversing gains of May 20. For buyers to take over, reaffirming the uptrend of July 15, prices must zoom past $3,500 but, most importantly, $3,700. This reaction line is crucial and is the only local resistance buyers must overcome for ETH to float above $3,900 and $4,100. Millions Of ETH Pulled From Exchanges, Spot ETF Launch Fanning Demand For now, there is strength in reading from on-chain analysis. Though over three million users are in the red, more ETH continues to be moved from exchanges. On July 19, IntoTheBlock data revealed that $126 million worth of ETH was moved from leading exchanges. Notably, this development comes amid the expected approval of the first batch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. If the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlights these products this week, it would be a massive win for ETH. The regulatory clarity that comes with this move will be of importance. United States SEC officials have yet to clarify the status of ETH.

The report highlights notable achievements in Total Value Locked (TVL), transactions and the increasing number of projects being built on the network. Thriving Cardano Ecosystem Per the report, Cardano has reached a milestone of 94 million transactions, showcasing the network’s growing adoption ahead of scheduled upgrades later this year. The report also discloses a TVL of 548.4 million in ADA, further emphasizing the network’s growth. Data from DefiLlama confirms this, with on-chain data showing over 26,000 active addresses in the last 24 hours and a TVL in USD of $239 million. However, this is much lower than the annual high in TVL in USD terms of nearly $500 million recorded in March. Related Reading: US Spot Ethereum ETFs Poised To Draw $1.2 Billion Monthly: Research Firm IOG’s data also reveals that Cardano currently hosts over 1,300 projects and boasts over 10 million active tokens. Additionally, showcasing the network’s appeal, there are over 67,000 Plutus scripts, enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts within the Cardano ecosystem. Upcoming Releases And Updates The report also sheds light on the current focus of the ledger team as they await the Chang upgrade. Efforts have shifted toward “extensive testing,” including writing unit tests and conducting conformance testing. On the wallet and services front, the Lace team is preparing for the release of Lace v1.14 in the coming weeks, promising updates and improvements. The report notes that the Hydra team has progressed on incremental decommits, refining specifications and enhancing documentation. The Mithril team also released a new distribution with support for Cardano node v9.0.0 and continued working on certifying Cardano transactions within Mithril networks. Cardano’s progress extends to the Voltaire & Sanchonet domains with the release of Cardano node v9.0.0. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version in preparation for the Chang upgrade. Lastly, IOG disclosed that the Intersect team has been actively updating the community on the latest Cardano node release, the Chang timeline, and the Intersect’s constitutional council confirmation. ADA Trading Volume Surges At the time of writing, ADA is currently trading at $0.429 due to its continued growth over the past month and the market’s recovery over the same period. Additionally, CoinGecko data shows that the token has seen a spike in trading volume of $628 million over the past few days, representing a 154% increase in market activity for ADA. Related Reading: ‘Early Signs Of Breakout’ – Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst Further supporting the bullish sentiment and growth witnessed over the past month, ADA is currently trading above the key 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), following the 18% surge recorded over the past two weeks that saw it cross this key indicator at $0.423. Notably, this supported the price over the weekend, with successful tests for three consecutive days preventing another retracement. Conversely, the $0.459 level may be the next resistance in ADA’s growth path, preventing a rise towards the next resistance on the daily ADA/USDT chart at $0.483 before retesting the $0.500 level.

31384161,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630937,1721673004,"‘Early Signs Of Breakout’ – Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst","With audacious forecasts from experts predicting a significant price rise, Solana (SOL) is drawing interest from the cryptocurrency market. Solana, well-known for its scalable solutions and fast blockchain, is likely to have a breakthrough and maybe reach previously unheard-of levels. Related Reading: Terra Classic Poised For 280% Rally On ‘Major Recovery Strength’ – Analyst Pennant Pattern Signals Bullish Continuation Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency and blockchain expert, has spotted on Solana’s weekly chart a so-called bull pennant shape. Often linked to positive arcs, this trend suggests that SOL may be getting ready for a big move up. When trend lines come together to make a symmetrical triangle after a big price rise, the pattern shows a time of consolidation and investor uncertainty. Targeting the $1,000 threshold, Martinez’s examination indicates Solana may defy this trend. From its existing price of about $180, this would translate to a 900% increase. The creation of the bull pennant is crucial as it suggests that after the phase of consolidation ends, the uptrend might start once more. Recent price fluctuations reinforce this hope; SOL trading at $171 shows a 1.30% growth in the previous 24 hours, therefore bringing its market valuation to $79.82 billion. #Solana is eyeing $1,000! Early signs of a breakout from a bull pennant suggest a potential 900% rally ahead. pic.twitter.com/DuFJF4h9dX — Ali (@ali_charts) July 20, 2024 Technical Indicators The technical signs line up with Martinez’s optimistic view. Currently at $148, the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is rising and indicates good short-term momentum. With an RSI of 64.50, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects a healthy market vibe free of overbought behavior. These signals point to a favorable direction for Solana’s price movement—buying pressure seems to be exceeding selling pressure. Indices of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) help to further corroborate this optimistic mood. Strong rising momentum is shown by the MACD line above the signal line and by its positive histogram. Furthermore boosting investor confidence is the CMF value of 0.15, which indicates notable capital influx into Solana. SOL market cap currently at $83 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Price Movement And Market Sentiment Looking forward, Solana may reach $180 and target the crucial resistance at $210 if it keeps its optimistic trend. Reaching the ambitious $1,000 goal would depend on breaking past current levels, therefore reinforcing the positive trend. Still, failing to top the $175 mark might cause a drop towards the $160 support level. A further decline may threaten the vital $118 support area as, should this support be compromised, considerably lower levels could result. Solana is trading 14.20% below its expectation for the next month, according to current market forecast, which points to a short-term undervaluation. SOL is expected to rise modestly, by 4.89%, during the next three months, indicating a consistent rising trend as market circumstances stabilize, data from Coincheckup show.

Analyst Predicts $9.00 Breakout Strong market conditions and favorable investor sentiment should reflect a significant increase of 67.50% in six months. With a one-year prognosis of a 56.28% increase rate, long-term forecasts also show continuous appreciation. Technical signs and market mood pointing towards a possible breakout and significant price surge indicate Solana’s future is bright.

Due to daily rebalancing and high management fees, the fund will decay over time and ultimately underperform the 2x goal. Ethereum itself has a strong fundamental setup with a commanding share of market TVL, stablecoins, and settled value. The Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF ( ETHU ) is a newly launched leveraged product that aims to produce twice the daily returns of Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ). In this article, we'll go over the details of the fund, risks associated with leveraged products, the bull case for Ethereum, and whether buyers of the fund since inception have been better off holding the fund or Ethereum directly. ETHU Fund Details Details ETHU Inception 6/4/2024 AUM $111.1 million Net Expense Ratio 0.94% 30-Day SEC Yield N/A Source: Volatility Shares, *First Year Fee The fund was launched in early June with a 12-month expense ratio fee waiver. The gross expense ratio is actually 1.85%. This is slightly higher than the 1.33% gross expense ratio of the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF ( EETH ), but it should be noted that EETH isn't a leveraged fund. From a holdings standpoint, ETHU utilizes futures contracts rather than spot ETH: ETHU Holdings (Volatility Shares) Since the fund utilizes futures contracts rather than the underlying asset, the constant need to rollover contracts every month theoretically makes the fund more expensive than would otherwise be the case if the asset could be directly held and staked on-chain for passive yield. Risks with Leveraged ETFs I've covered a few leveraged ETFs for Seeking Alpha in the past. Most recently, the Direxion Daily S&P 500® Bear 3X Shares ETF ( SPXS ) in early July. The biggest risk with leveraged funds is the fact that they are rebalanced daily. In the instance of ETHU, which is a 2x long fund, when the underlying asset that the fund seeks to leverage is in a sustained uptrend, the leveraged fund shares can maximize gains very well. If the fund works as designed, on days when Ethereum increases by 1%, ETHU should increase by 2%. The opposite is also true to the downside. If the price of Ethereum goes down, ETHU shareholders will feel double the pain that is felt by EETH or Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) shareholders. Since funds like ETHU are rebalanced daily, long periods of market chop will also result in poor returns. Here's a visual that I've shared with a few of the other leveraged ETFs that I've covered in the past: Projected Returns (Author's Calculations) In the table above, I'm showing how quickly the fund underperforms versus its 2x goal if the market isn't in a clearly defined uptrend. After just twenty sessions, ETHU's leverage only produces a 70% additional return over ETH rather than the 100% goal. And this is if the trader who enters the position gets a gain on the first day after entry. Projected Returns (Author's Calculations) In the table above, I'm showing how the fund behaves with chop after a negative return on the first day following an opened position. Here we again see underperformance against the stated goal with ETHU returning more than 2x the negative return of ETH to the downside. Essentially, without daily gains ETHU will underperform both to the upside and to the downside over time. 2x Ether ETF Performance Of course, the tables in the section above are just hypothetical scenarios. Even though ETHU is still a new fund, we have more than a month of real sessions to gauge how the ticker has performed against the underlying asset: Data by YCharts Since the inception of ETHU in early June, Ethereum has returned negative 6.2% while the fund has returned negative 18.7%. This is partially because Ethereum can be traded during the weekend and ETHU can't, but the primary reason for the underperformance against the 2x goal is the decay from rebalancing. The Case for Ethereum None of this is to say investors shouldn't look to ETH itself as an investable idea. I shared some of the good and the bad about the current setup for Ethereum with Seeking Alpha readers recently : For long-term crypto investors, Ethereum is still a must. Despite the price of ETH lagging significant improvements in the usability of the EVM ecosystem, future growth in on-chain activity should propel ETH higher, as it is still the gas that keeps the engine going. Despite the proliferation of the layer 1 blockchain networks, ETH is still clearly the top dog in the decentralized finance landscape: Total Value Locked (DeFi Llama) On mainnet, Ethereum has a commanding share of the DeFi ecosystem at nearly 60% of the total. But this actually doesn't do Ethereum justice because when factoring in all of the networks that exist solely to scale Ethereum, that share of market TVL is even larger and closer to 70%. Stablecoin Share (DeFi Llama) Shifting to stablecoins, we can again see a large share of the total market going to Ethereum, though an admittedly smaller share at 48.5%. Ultimately, figures like TVL and stablecoin share are important things to have, but they only really matter if it leads to settlement on-chain. And this is where Ethereum really shines: Average Daily Settlement (Money-Movers) With $34.6 billion in daily settlement over the last 30 days, Ethereum is still the standout in settled value and by a wide margin compared with other networks. As the ""gas"" for all of this network activity, ETH has an organic bid provided the blockchain continues to have utility. Closing Thoughts If a prospective investor is bullish on Ethereum, the best way to express that idea is probably just longing for ETH directly. There is a time and a place for leveraged ETFs. ETHU can be a terrific vehicle for short-term speculations by experienced traders. However, as a long term investment, it will perform very poorly over time due to decay from management fees and daily rebalancing. Despite my thoughts on ETHU as a poor long term investment, I'm going to rate the fund a ""hold"" today because I believe ETH will appreciate between now and the end of the year. Depending on how high ETH goes, ETHU could certainly end the year higher than the current $12 per share. However, even if ETHU does appreciate between now and the end of 2024, the fund will likely lag the 2x goal over the long haul. In my view, if you like ETH, just buy ETH.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705548-avoid-investing-in-volatility-shares-2x-ether-etf-ethu?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31382670.jpeg

""Accordingly, Swan is pulling back from our accelerated spending plan for our core financial services business. Unfortunately, this includes staff cuts across many functions,"" he added.  The move comes at a time when the mining landscape has become more competitive after the recent Bitcoin halving, which cut the block rewards by half. The availability of spot bitcoin exchange traded-funds (ETFs) have also deterred many investors from the mining industry, shutting some doors to capital for miners. As a result, many miners are struggling to keep their business profitable by being pure-play mining operations and pivoting some of their infrastructure to serve artificial intelligence and cloud computing-related services.  Despite the Bitcoin halving making the mining ecosystem tougher and less profitable to navigate, several private miners are still vying to go public following bitcoin's record high earlier this year. Genesis Digital Assets, formerly backed by FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, and two of Northern Data's units were among other firms reportedly planning IPOs.  Earlier this year, Swan said it will go public within the next 12 months and the mining unit had 160 megawatts (MW), or 4.5 exahash per second (EH/s), worth of computing power up and running.  At the time, the firm also said that the mining business has been funded by institutional investors, with more than $100 million and hopes to raise more capital to expand its operations. Tether was among the backers of Swan's managed mining service, with as undisclosed amount of investment into its business.

Crypto analyst Capo of Crypto has provided further optimism, suggesting that these tokens will still make more massive moves to the upside. “The Best Is Yet To Come” For Bitcoin Capo of Crypto opined in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the “best is yet to come” for Bitcoin and altcoins. He noted that Bitcoin is pumping, having reclaimed the $60,000 range as support. The crypto analyst added that altcoins also seem to have found their local bottom, meaning they are well-primed for massive rallies to the upside. Related Reading: Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses? With Bitcoin also back above $65,000, it seems that it is just a matter of when and not if before the flagship crypto reclaims the $70,000 range. Capo had previously mentioned that reclaiming the $65,000 level would be the next bullish confirmation for the flagship crypto. The analyst added that the market should expect high prices once that happens. As to how Bitcoin could rise, Capo stated that the main target would be the liquidity zone between $74,000 and $76,000. Bitcoin rising to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared a similar sentiment with Capo, suggesting that Bitcoin’s successful retest of the $65,000 resistance level would send it back above $70,000. Bitcoin rising back above $70,000 is believed to be where the real fun begins, as crypto analysts like Michael van de Poppe had previously mentioned that the bull run will continue once the flagship crypto is back above this price level. Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo had also recently advised market participants not to get shaken out. He stated that the market is still heading “way higher” and that a little more patience is needed before the “fun really starts.” “Huge” Altcoin Season Is Brewing Crypto analyst Mkybull Crypto stated in an X post that a huge altcoin season is brewing. He claimed that this cycle might be similar to the explosive altcoin season rally in 2017, as altcoins’ current price action shares a similar price action to that period. Mikyull Crypto added that the fakeout made many believe the altcoin season for this cycle had been written off but suggested that isn’t the case, as something similar happened in the 2016 post-halving cycle.

Crypto analysts predict that these funds could spark a massive rally for Ethereum and altcoins, by extension, which could help usher in the altcoin season as they outperform Bitcoin.

Upcoming launches of Ethereum ETFs may temporarily increase the price of ETH and thus benefit ETHE as well. ETHE, however, may only be a good investment over time if bought at large discount to NAV, which recently no longer exists. Grayscale Ethereum Trust Overview Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) is an investment trust designed to hold Ether ( ETH-USD ). As such, it is distinctly not an ETF or other kind of open-end fund. It's more like Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) and uses a closed-end approach to invest its shareholders' capital. Crypto ETFs are a newer asset class, and the first Ethereum ETFs are set to launch this week on July 23. By taking an alternate route, Grayscale was ahead of the curve here, and it's interesting to consider just how the launch will affect them. For my part, I think it isn't much of a catalyst, and ETHE was a much better Buy when it had a large discount to NAV. Whatever temporary surge in ETH will occur here, I think it's better to treat ETHE as a Hold for now. Immediate Impact When an ETF launches, the open-end nature of the fund means that capital will flow into it. Since these ETFs are designed hold ETH for investors (bypassing the need to have crypto wallets), the first they will do is use the capital to buy ETH. Like any open-end fund, money flowing in will result in more purchases of its portfolio assets, and money flowing out will result in sales. These can have bullish and bearish impacts, respectively. I think it's therefore likely that the launches this week will result in an increase in the price of ETH and anything exposed to it, like ETHE for a short period of time. ETHE Price vs. NAV History (Grayscale Official Website) Throughout its life (since 2019), ETHE's price movements have followed those of ETH, albeit not perfectly. For nearly all of 2023 and much of this year, the shares have even traded at a discount to NAV. Still, a rise in ETH has usually been met with a rise in ETHE, so there is that potential here. Long-Term View What's more important for investors, those interested in the long-term view of their assets, is what happens if one invests in ETHE today with intention of holding on to it, and that in many ways is a judgment call about ETH and crypto broadly. Ether Why is Ether considered attractive enough to deserve its own ETFs and investment trusts like Grayscale's? Well, I think the big reason is that it's the #2 cryptocurrency after BTC. coinmarketcap.com There are not many other major contenders in the crypto space quite like them. Of course, for its own worth, one has to imagine that ETH will be used as a currency at some point. The choice between having one's wealth in USD or in ETH should really be the same as the choice of having one's wealth in USD or CAD. The primary risk ought to be some form of exchange rate risk. It comes down to what value we think we get by being in another currency. I have always said to folks who asked me that if you need a cryptocurrency to complete a transaction, then buy it, and maybe keep a certain cushion of it on hand if the need for another such transaction arises. By owning shares of ETHE, however, this advantage is lost, and this is something I dislike about funds that specifically orient themselves toward crypto. Moreover, as ETFs and similar investment funds buy and hold ETH, I think it becomes more likely that cryptocurrencies have a harder time truly taking off as currencies. After all, they aren't being used to facilitate transactions at that point. In their 2023 Form 10K , Grayscale reported having about 2.5% of all ETH in circulation. While some time has passed, one has to appreciate how large of a share that is for one entity. If too little ETH is ever used for transactions, I have a hard time seeing what kind of demand would exist to make something like ETHE a good investment to produce attractive, long-term returns. Demand isn't created by undersupply. Demand is created by people wanting and needing something, and the case that much more demand for ETH will exist in the future, to the benefit of ETHE, still needs to be made. Bitcoin Another factor worth considering is ETH's relationship to BTC. Just take a look at the three-year performance of each. ETH vs. BTC 3Y Performance (Seeking Alpha) While it's not perfect, we do see a very close relationship. As BTC's own halving this spring seemed to prompt a rally, ETH apparently followed suit. I think the best explanation for this is that crypto investors are often invested in both BTC and ETH, and they tend to add and trim positions concurrently as part of their diversification strategy. In the current environment, it's also likely that long-term movements in BTC will affect ETHE as well, perhaps less directly than ETH. As long as crypto investors believe in both as strongly as they do, I expect this to be the case. Good news for BTC could also spell good news for ETH. Discount To NAV The last thing to consider with an investment like ETHE is whether or not a discount to NAV exists. I think large discounts, which have happened before, represent the most compelling buy case, as essentially a form of arbitrage. Currently, the market price is almost exactly the NAV. This means that folks buying ETHE because of the launch of these ETFs will depend entirely on an attractive enough increase in ETH, something I consider to be risky. Not only do I think a discount is needed but a pretty large one at that because of the long-term friction caused by the trust's expenses, which are currently 2.5% of the fund's assets. That's a very significant drag over time, more than the typical rate of inflation, so essentially we have to hope that ETH beats inflation for ETHE to be breakeven over time. Otherwise, an investor has to manufacture that result with a better entry price and resisting temptation to get in when the discount narrows. Conclusion Whether it's crypto or funds that specifically invest in them, they are tricky because they are non-productive assets. Warren Buffett himself is long-quoted saying the following about gold as an investment asset: Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. Believers in gold naturally feel it is a hedge against inflation, but as Buffett pointed out, there's nothing to it that has a compounding effect, and cryptocurrencies are similar in this regard. Folks who buy crypto as an investment need a compelling reason to believe they can later sell it for a much better price. Owning ETH indirectly through a trust like ETHE comes with the same risks but none of the advantages of having a currency on hand to transact. There's also the 2.5% expense ratio. As such, the only buy case that exists is when ETHE, with its closed-end nature, trades substantially below NAV. At least then there is some intrinsic difference. That gap closed in recent months, and while we now have only just gotten confirmation that Ether ETFs will launch, we still need good prices to get good returns. Until a major discount to NAV appears again, I consider ETHE just be a Hold.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705528-grayscale-ethereum-trust-despite-etf-launches-nav-discount-is-gone?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31380177.jpeg

42407819,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5sCK,1721663819,Taking off: Rewarding Flight Trackers in the Age of Web3,"When I was in college, social networks were all the rage. Up until that point, the internet was read-only; you visited a web page and read someone else’s opinion on a topic. We wanted more: we wanted to post our own photos, express our own opinions, and share them with our friends. Those were amazing times; everyone loved the internet, and it was all for free! However, we slowly learned that if something is free, you’re the product. Or, better said, your data is the product.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  It was kind of fair, though. You got access to a platform that costs money to run; in return, you provide some data about yourself. They use this data to sell you relevant ads, ad companies reach the right audience, and everyone wins. As time passed, data collection became more advanced and intrusive, profits increased, while your side of the deal stayed the same. This model was so profitable that it ended up being implemented everywhere — from social media and online newspapers, to TVs that run ads in their menus. And, as it turns out, even in flight tracking. I will come back to this last one in a minute.  Web3 promised us the solution. Instead of giving away your data, what if you kept ownership over it? During the last bull market, everyone tried to find problems that Web3 could fix. Everything was tokenized: art, watches, carbon credits and random memes. It should have been the other way around: first identify the problem, then apply the solution.  Helium was doing just that. By using Web3 incentives, it built a decentralized network of hotspots that together provide connectivity to IoT sensors. It incentivized people who don't know each other to work together and create the largest telecom network in history by combining their home Wi-Fi networks. It did this successfully by proving that the problem was not in data ownership. Instead, it's in how the profit is distributed among the data providers or the ones that provide the infrastructure for the data to travel from one place to another. The value is in the network of people that generate the data — a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN).  So, what does any of this have to do with flight tracking? The flight enthusiasts' community is a small but global group that collects data from airplanes flying around them and sends it to a couple of large flight tracking networks. In return, they get full access to the platforms (sounds familiar?). Those networks then collect this data and sell it to all sorts of different companies operating in aviation, travel and logistics. This data is critical for aviation operations, yet it's being collected by enthusiasts using cheap Raspberry PIs. Flight tracking networks such as Flightradar24 and Flightaware are highly profitable, yet the people who provide the data that makes these networks possible do not get paid for their contributions.  By applying a DePIN model to flight tracking, Wingbits is building a much fairer and more performant network where the data providers will get a share of the profits that their data generates, based on their performance and uptime. While data providers for the other networks don’t have any incentive to maximize their coverage and uptime, the Wingbits rewards model makes sure that the best participants earn the most.  It's just the right thing to do and we can see the results. Since we launched our public beta in November 2023, the Wingbits community grew from 40 to over 1450 live antennas, growing in half a year more than Flightradar did in their first three years. We now have almost complete coverage over Europe and a large part of the US, tracking over 35000 flights daily.  I'm super excited about DePIN. It will create real-world value and give all of us an opportunity to monetize our data as we please. New projects will challenge existing business models and reignite the public perception that our data is valuable and we shouldn't just give it away.

Former President and current Republican nominee for this year’s presidential election Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville on Saturday and speculations are mounting that he will announce a plan to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset.  Thielen further noted that bitcoin is trading close to the previous bull market's all time high ($69,000), often touted by technicians as a ""line in the sand"" over which a possible ""parabolic move"" might occur if prices could successfully hold above that level.  Thielen is of the opinion that Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race has essentially sealed the deal for a Trump victory in November. Per Thielen, this likely means an early exit for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has earned a reputation as a foe of the crypto industry. While Gensler's term doesn't officially end until June 2026, Thielen expects him to resign around the time of a Trump inauguration in early 2025.

31377705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630913,1721662238,US Spot Ethereum ETFs Poised To Draw $1.2 Billion Monthly: Research Firm,"The US spot Ethereum ETFs are set to launch on Tuesday, July 23rd, with projections indicating potential monthly inflows of $1.2 billion. This forecast comes from ASXN, a research firm specializing in crypto finance analytics. US Spot Ethereum ETFs Could Surprise To The Upside At the core of ASXN’s analysis is the comparison between the newly introduced Ethereum ETFs and the previously launched Bitcoin ETFs. One of the critical differentiators highlighted in the report is the fee structure. The Ethereum ETFs, while mirroring the fee approach of Bitcoin ETFs, introduce a notably competitive twist with Grayscale’s new ‘mini trust’ Ethereum product. Initially disclosed at a 0.25% management fee, the fee was quickly adjusted to 0.15% after competitive pressures from other low-fee products like Blackrock’s ETHA ETF. Grayscale has strategically re-positioned 10% of its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) Assets Under Management (AUM) to this mini trust, offering ETHE holders an exchange to the new ETF at no tax liability—a move aimed at retaining capital within its ecosystem and providing a more attractive fee structure to fee-sensitive investors. “Grayscale’s strategic adjustment of its fee structure and the innovative mini trust offering are likely to redefine the competitive landscape of Ethereum ETFs,” an ASXN analyst commented in the report. “This could not only stem potential outflows but also attract a broader base of institutional investors due to the more favorable fee dynamics.” Related Reading: Here’s What To Know On Grayscale Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF Spinoffs – Details ASXN’s report also covers the potential market impact of the inflow of funds into Ethereum ETFs. Utilizing global data from existing crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), the research draws parallels and contrasts between the Ethereum and Bitcoin markets. Historically, ETPs have been overweight in Bitcoin relative to Ethereum based on AUM ratios compared to market cap ratios. This has shifted slightly with Ethereum gaining more traction and investment confidence. Referring to other research reports on potential ETF inflows, the report notes: “There have been many estimates for the ETF flows, some of which we have highlighted below. Taking the estimates and standardizing them yields an average estimate in the $1bn/month region. Standard Chartered Bank offers the highest estimate with $2bn/month, while JP Morgan is on the low end at $500m/month.” ASXN’s estimate lies at $800 to $1.2 billion per month. “This was calculated by taking a market cap weighted average of monthly Bitcoin inflows and scaling this by the market cap of ETH,” the firm notes. Furthermore, they backed their estimates with the global crypto ETP data and “are open to an upside surprise given the unique dynamics of ETHE trading at par prior to the launch and the introduction of the mini trust.” The Reflexivity Of ETH In terms of liquidity, the report suggests that Ethereum’s market dynamics are distinct from those of Bitcoin. Although Ethereum’s overall liquidity is slightly lower, the impact of new ETF inflows could be more pronounced due to Ethereum’s lower ‘float’—the amount of an asset readily available for trading. “Ethereum’s liquidity profile, compounded by its smaller float relative to Bitcoin, implies that inflows into the ETF could have a disproportionately positive effect on its price,” states the report. Related Reading: CBOE Global Markets Lists Spot Ethereum ETFs, Confirms Launch Date Moreover, ASXN’s analysis is devoted to the reflexivity inherent in Ethereum’s market. According to the report, inflows into Ethereum ETFs could lead to higher Ethereum prices, which in turn could increase activity and investments in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and other Ethereum-based applications. This feedback loop is supported by Ethereum’s tokenomics, specifically the EIP-1559 mechanism which burns a portion of transaction fees, effectively reducing the total supply of Ethereum over time. “The reflexivity of Ethereum’s market extends beyond simple supply and demand dynamics due to its integral role in DeFi and other blockchain-based applications,” ASXN explains and adds, “as the price of Ethereum increases, it could significantly enhance the underlying fundamentals of the DeFi platforms, driving further investments and creating a self-reinforcing cycle of value appreciation.” The report concludes with strategic insights for traditional finance (TradFi) institutions considering Ethereum investments. It argues that the narrative around Ethereum as a multi-faceted platform for decentralized applications provides a compelling value proposition beyond the “digital gold” narrative typically associated with Bitcoin. ASXN also speculates on the future potential for a staked ETH ETF, which could attract TradFi players with its yield-generating capabilities. “The possibility of a staked ETH ETF could become a game-changer, offering traditional finance a way to engage with crypto assets that not only appreciate in value but also generate yield,” the report suggests. At press time, ETH traded at $3,494.

42407810,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5rpB,1721662041,"Tokenized Asset Manager Superstate Debuts New Fund to Profit From Bitcoin, Ether 'Carry Trade'","Superstate's new tokenized fund will generate yield based on ""cash and carry"" investment strategy.  CEO Robert Leshner said the new fund is ""highly-regulated product"" for qualified investors.  Blockchain-based asset management firm Superstate has introduced a new tokenized fund that will provide yield based on the popular ""cash and carry"" investment strategy.  The USCC token, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, will generate yield for holders by buying spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} and taking an equal size of short positions of, or selling, BTC and ETH futures. The trade offers a delta-neutral position, profiting from the market without taking any directional bets on price changes. For example, several hedge funds pursue this strategy by buying spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares and selling bitcoin derivatives on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  Wrapping investment strategies like the carry trade into a digital token is a novel form of crypto's red-hot tokenization trend, which puts traditional investments like bonds, funds and credit on blockchain rails. Ethena Labs' ""synthetic dollar"" USDE token, which attracted more than $3 billion of deposits in the first half of the year, also provides yield to holders via the carry trade.  However, there are several differences between how Superstate's and Ethena's product are structured, Superstate CEO Robert Leshner told CoinDesk in an interview.  Ethena's token generates yield from perpetual futures' funding rates and passes on the income to those who lock-up or stake, the token. Meanwhile, Superstate sells futures with certain maturity dates providing a more predictable return, and distributes the yield to all token holders, Leshner said. USCC also targets qualified, whitelisted investors to comply with U.S. securities laws and operates as a series of a Delaware Trust, a bankruptcy-remote entity from Superstate, he added.  ""[USCC] is a highly-regulated product, with lower risks but offering lower returns,"" Leshner noted.  To execute the futures trades for the fund, Superstate has partnered with prime brokerage companies, while spot assets are held at custodial partner Anchorage Digital.  The asset manager's new offering comes after it rolled-out first tokenized fund, which holds short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The previous fund has gathered nearly $80 million of assets since debuting earlier this year, according to rwa.xyz data.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ENA,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/22/tokenized-asset-manager-superstate-debuts-new-fund-to-profit-from-bitcoin-ether-carry-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b52e14fa89033e9c27ab72803026198a70a844a-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417658,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMx3,1721659343,Biden's Exit Spurs Record $28M Daily Volume on Polymarket as Election Enters Uncharted Territory,"This week in prediction markets:  It's market mania as President Joe Biden declines to run for a second term.  One market went to the cats, as bettors debate the first billion-dollar cat-themed meme coin.  Everyone thought CrowdStrike's follies would be fixed in a day. They were wrong.  Joe Biden's decision not to seek re-election isn't completely unprecedented: U.S. presidents from James Polk to Lyndon B. Johnson also declined to serve another term for one reason or another.  But what is unique is how late Biden decided to throw in the towel, only a month before the Democratic National Convention (where the party officially decides who its presidential candidate is), and only days after he told party faithful that the ""elites"" wouldn't succeed in kicking him out.  The decision fueled a surge in bets on election-related contracts on the Polymarket prediction market, pushing volume to levels never seen in the platform's history.  According to a Dashboard powered by Dune Analytics, daily volume on the platform pushed past a record $28 million as bettors raced to take a position on a presidential race that's unlike any other in recent history.  In comparison, a month ago, the platform was doing $4 million to $5 million in average daily volume in the aftermath of the debate between Biden and Donald Trump, which is when calls for Biden to step down grew louder.  The number of daily active accounts, or wallets, has also more than doubled in the last month, up to nearly 6,000 from roughly 3,000 a month ago.  Bettors have also pooled well over $500 million on some of the largest political contracts on the site: The market for the U.S. presidential election winner has $319 million invested, one for the Democratic nominee is over $212 million (Vice President Kamala Harris is the overwhelming favorite), while another to decide who will be the Democratic candidate's vice presidential running mate has $10 million.  Read more: With Biden Out, Polymarket Favors Harris for Democratic Presidential Nominee  Right now, the number to beat is $744 million, which was how much was bet on Betfair, the U.K.'s largest betting platform, for the 2020 election.  But it's only July; there are still 3 1/2 months until the election. The question is, will Polymarket hit $1 billion?  A meme coin cat topped $1 billion  A Polymarket bet on market capitalizations for cat-themed tokens resolved late on Sunday, with the Solana-based pop cat (POPCAT) winning the race.  The Polymarket contract asked the burning question: Which cat-themed meme coin would be the first to hit a $1 billion market value?  In early April, POPCAT'sodds looked bleak at 2%, behind Keycat and Hobbes, two other cat-themed tokens.  The market racked up $4.6 million in trading volumes since going live in March.  In the running were tokens from several blockchains, such as Base, Ethereum and Solana.  The resolution drew some drama, however, after a single $630,000 buy of the token apparently caused a spike that helped push it over the $1 billion market cap threshold – with some arguing it was an act of market manipulation.  “Okay so this is interesting because that's clearly market manipulation, but technically it did cross $1 billion on 1 website. Someone here with a vested interest in Popcat has manipulated the market and pushed it over,” wrote Polymarket user @The_Guru55.  “Literally a 1 second pump with 1 order on 1 website is pretty questionable,” the person added.  Polymarket’s decision that POPCAT won remains in place and has not been disputed as of Monday, however.  The market thought the CrowdStrike Windows snafu would be an easy fix. It was wrong.  A faulty patch for security software CrowdStrike pushed out on Friday sparked chaos, as it bricked Windows computers around the world, first in Europe and Asia during their business days, then the United States, as the country woke up.  As Asia's business day concluded and Europe awoke to PCs frozen with blue screens of death, a Polymarket market was fairly certain this wouldn't be a huge deal and a fix would happen by Friday night, putting the odds at 89%.  But the market was wrong. As CrowdStrike engineers published instructions on how to do an initial fix – which required a significant amount of effort for each locked PC – the problems compounded. Over 2,500 flights were canceled and 8,000 delayed, with Delta Airlines still rebooking passengers as of Monday.  ""The scenario of any [anti-irus] software pushing an update that behaves like this has been a 'worst nightmare' for two decades,"" Steven Sinofsky, the former president of Microsoft's Windows division, posted on X.  The ""no"" side of the contract – those betting a resolution wouldn't come Friday – was lightly held, with only three bettors holding a collective 45 shares. In total, just over $90,000 was on the line.  Meanwhile, the largest holder of the ""yes"" side lost $2,800.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/22/polymarket-trading-explodes-as-2024-election-enters-uncharted-territory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/393e34c159abc92c7d78bb7921c585d0ec8b4df4-4057x2282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Famous crypto researcher Javon Marks thinks that the value of DOGE could go up by 378%, which could push the meme currency to an all-time high of $0.6533. If this prediction comes true, it will be a huge change for DOGE, whose road has always been like a roller coaster. Related Reading: ORDI Soars 26% On Solid 7-Day Run – Can It Climb Higher This Week? Dogecoin: The Bullish Outfit Javon Marks compares Dogecoin’s price fluctuation to a market shakeout, which entails a small decline to eliminate weaker investors before a big surge. DOGE breached a major resistance level after recovering from a severe fall, signalling a market turn towards optimism. Marks thinks this breakthrough might push DOGE to $0.6533, a 378% increase from its current price. $DOGE (Dogecoin) continues to recover here, making the recent pullback look more and more like a shakeout and these prices can be near ready for a massive continuation towards the $0.6533! This target ($0.6533) remains well in play due to prices of Dogecoin holding broken out of… https://t.co/KeX303xNlx pic.twitter.com/iCiRxK3hSD — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 20, 2024 Dogecoin is trading at $0.1316 at the time of writing, a little 3.50% rise in the past 24 hours. Supported by a notable 31% increase in trade volume, this upswing conforms with a short-term optimistic trend. The more people participating in the market, the more interest and expectation of further price changes implies. The Road To $0.6533 Marks underlines that the only obstacle on the way to get $0.6533 is time. Any pullbacks during this period, he says, are probably support levels that help to sustain the general advance. Having previously exceeded the vital 50-day EMA at $0.127, DOGE’s price is currently hanging at the 100-day EMA at $0.134. This support level has shown to be crucial as it shows great buying activity at this pricing range. Still, the path to $0.6533 is not without difficulties. At 59.69 right now, the RSI indicator points to the market reaching overbounded area. This suggests that, should the price keep rising without a time of stabilisation, the bulls may become tired even if there is still space for upward mobility. DOGE Price Forecast Though the general view is positive, short-term forecasts show DOGE’s price can decline. The present Dogecoin price forecast is that by August 21, 2024, the price of Dogecoin will drop by -14.25% to $0.118211. Combining a Fear & Greed Index with a score of 70 (Greed) with technical indicators reflecting the present market attitude—which is optimistic—this projection is formed. With 6.90% price volatility over the past 30 days, Dogecoin recorded 16/30 (53%) green days signaling that right now is a good time to buy it. Related Reading: Terra Classic Poised For 280% Rally On ‘Major Recovery Strength’ – Analyst The $1.25 Target Milestone Beyond the first target, Marks advises exceeding and maintaining over $0.6533 to release another 90% rise, therefore driving DOGE to a price of $1.25. For this meme coin, reaching this milestone would be a historic triumph raising its price to levels not seen in previous significant market boom. Such a climb would confirm DOGE’s place in the crypto market and maybe draw fresh investors, therefore greatly increasing its market valuation.

NPC Labs, a developer looking to build a GameFi ecosystem on the Base protocol, has closed an $18 million funding round led by Pantera Capital.  In an interview with CoinDesk, NPC Labs' co-founder Daryl Xu, explained that the company's mission is to scale gaming on Base by acting as a core contributor to B3.fun, a Base gaming ecosystem, and building GameFi products that are accessible to non-crypto native users.  ""Right now, everyone in crypto is building great applications, but they are primarily targeting crypto-native folks. There are a lot of crypto buzzwords like wallets and LPs being used,"" Xu said. ""For the average person – the 'Normie' we hope to onboard as the next million or billion users – they don't necessarily care about the technical details. They just want a fun and accessible experience.""  Xu said that NPC Labs plans to use the funds to kickstart the ecosystem, and part of that is building out more ways for non-Web3 users to discover crypto gaming. Part of that involves building out discovery portals such as Basement.fun, to help users get into these games.  ""[Basement.fun] is meant to be a discovery portal for games. Think of it like Miniclip or Addicting Games, those old HTML5 and Flash game websites,"" he said. ""That's what we're trying to build.

This crash saw $2,000 wiped off the Bitcoin price in mere minutes, bringing it back down below $66,000. While this decline did not last at the time, there were a few factors behind it, which inflicted worry in crypto investors across the space. Why Did The Bitcoin Price Fall? The Bitcoin price crash below $66,000 had one major factor behind it and that was the US President Joe Biden. For months now, the war between President Joe Biden and former US President Donald Trump had raged on, with the two being the leading candidates for the position. Related Reading: CBOE Global Markets Lists Spot Ethereum ETFs, Confirms Launch Date However, on Sunday, President Joe Biden made a shocking revelation, announcing that he was officially stepping down from the presidential race. In the announcement on X (formerly Twitter), which has so far garnered over 330 million views, Biden said that he was going to prioritize his duties as a president for the remainder of his current 4-year term, rejecting the Democratic Party nomination. In the same announcement, President Biden offered his support to Vice President Kamala Harris, to take on the presidential ticket for the Democratic Party. He also urged the party supporters to come together and beat Donald Trump, who is the strongest opponent so far. pic.twitter.com/RMIRvlSOYw — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 21, 2024 Following the announcement, the crypto market responded quickly, with the Bitcoin price plunging sharply. At the same time, coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu followed suit, dropping around 3% each in response to the announcement. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Refuse To Stay Down Just like the plunge in price, the Bitcoin recovery was just as swift, rising to new monthly highs. The price eventually crossed $68,000 on Sunday, taking the crypto market with it. In response, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu followed, notching notable gains from their lows. For Dogecoin, the price rose back above $0.14 after falling below $0.128. This saw its overall daily gains at the time shoot up above 4%, with its daily trading volume also seeing a significant climb above $20 billion in one day. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Rally As Expectations For A Break Above $200 Grow In the same vein, the Shiba Inu price also rose from its lows of $0.0000173 to rise above $0.0000184. However, unlike Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu daily trading volume remains muted, with around $383 million at the time. As for the Bitcoin price, it continues to lead market bullishness, still holding the $67,000 support following the recovery.

42417643,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMhZ,1721651245,Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer Technologies Could be a Potential Takeover Target: Benchmark,"Benchmark said Bitdeer could be a potential takeover target  The broker raised its price target for the bitcoin miner to $16 from $13.  Core Scientific’s deal with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave has helped drive a re-rating of the sector, the report said.  Bitcoin miner {{BTC}} Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR) has become an alluring takeover target, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Monday. Bitdeer's value has been bolstered by the growing interest in crypto miners’ energy assets from artificial intelligence (AI) and high performance computing (HPC) firms in recent months.  The broker raised its Bitdeer price target to $16 from $13 and reiterated its buy rating on the shares. The stock was changing hands at $11.10 in premarket trading.  Bitdeer shares have more than doubled in the last two months, the report noted, as the company has been recognized as one of the bitcoin miners with “ample existing and planned power capacity” that could be used for mining crypto or for powering AI and HPC projects.  Takeover activity in the sector has been heating up. Bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) recently rejected a $5.75 per share offer from cloud computing firm CoreWeave, saying it significantly undervalued the company.  Bitdeer is having early talks with several customers in the AI/HPC space and these discussions are expected to become more meaningful once management has finished site analysis to determine best use, the note said, citing a conversation with a company executive.  Benchmark raised its Bitdeer estimates to reflect the expected contribution of its ASIC chip and mining rig initiatives. It lifted its full year 2025 revenue estimate to $617.5 million from $497 million.  Bitcoin mining equity multiples have notably increased in recent months, with Core Scientific’s deal with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave helping to drive the re-rating of the sector, the report added.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) said the recent rally in the sector is an indication that the market thinks that the AI and HPC opportunity could offer alternative and more accretive use cases for bitcoin mining sites, the bank said in a report last week.

42417656,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMw1,1721650020,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Settles Above $67K After Biden Drops Out,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin settled above $67,000 following a brief surge above $68,000 on Sunday after President Biden said he would not seek reelection. BTC initially slumped after Biden's announcement before recovering to over $68,400 and was trading around $67,450 at the time of writing, 0.7% higher than 24 hours ago. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital asset market, rose 1.25%. SOL and DOGE led the gains with increases of around 4.3% and 5% respectively.  President Biden's withdrawal from the November election dropped pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump's probability of victory from 71% to 65% on Polymarket. Vice President Kamala Harris' odds almost doubled to 30% from 16%. While Biden's decision tempered Trump's White House prospects, the market's response was initially positive. ""Biden’s withdrawal has opened up a possibility where, regardless of who sits in the White House, the U.S. government may embrace a more constructive stance towards the digital asset industry after November,"" Singapore-based crypto research firm Presto wrote in a Monday note. ""Whether Harris or any other contenders will pursue such a path remains to be seen, but the optionality that hardly existed before is now there.""  Bitcoin's price is too high compared to its production cost of $43,000 and any increase is likely to be a short-term one, JPMorgan said in a report last week. BTC's volatility-adjustment comparison to gold was $53,000, further suggesting it is overpriced, the bank said. JPMorgan noted that momentum in bitcoin futures has been weak in recent weeks due to BTC liquidations by creditors of Gemini, Mt. Gox creditors and the German government. Liquidations are expected to subside this month and the bank continues to look for a rebound in Chicago Mercantile Exchange bitcoin futures positioning into August.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's Korea Premium Index, which measures the gap between South Korean and Western exchanges.  The index has dropped to nearly zero for the first time since November, a sign of decreased retail investor participation in the market.

42417655,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMtx,1721649865,"Solana ETF Hopes, Rising Fundamentals Are Driving SOL Prices Higher, Traders Say","Increased transactional activity on Solana-based applications and a surge in the total value locked (TVL) on the network have contributed to Solana's recent outperformance.  Expectations of a possible exchange-traded fund (ETF) product and easing regulatory policies under a potentially crypto-friendly Trump administration have further boosted Solana's appeal among investors.  Increased transactional activity and booming expectations of a possible exchange-traded fund (ETF) product may have contributed to Solana’s recent outperformance, several market observers told CoinDesk.  Solana’s SOL tokens have gained over 18% in the past week, outpacing larger cryptocurrencies bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}, to trade over $180 early Monday, setting a new three-month high.  Some market observers said SOL gained as trading activity on Solana-based applications grew in the past few weeks, boosting fundamentals.  “The Solana ecosystem is showing robust growth, evidenced by increased DEX activity, rising daily active users, and growing fee accrual to the network,” shared Pat Doyle,a blockchain researcher at Amberdata. “These strong fundamentals, coupled with the positive market sentiment, are pushing SOL forward.”  Data tracked by DefiLlama show that the total value locked (TVL) of tokens on Solana has increased over 25% in a month, crossing the $5.28 billion mark to levels last seen in April 2022. The network has made at least $1.5 million each day since June while netting over $2 billion in on-chain trading volumes each day for the past week.  Solana’s key appeal among traders is its fast settlement speeds and low fees. That's been the basis for meme coin trading frenzies several times in the past year.  In comparison, Ethereum, the world’s largest blockchain by TVL of $60 billion, recorded smaller volumes at $1.7 billion, but higher fees at $3 million because it's more expensive for users.  Easing regulatory policies are adding to SOL’s appeal among professional investors, said Rennick Palley, founding partner at crypto venture fund Stratos.  “The recent pump is due to overall market sentiment improving and increasing odds that it and its ecosystem tokens won't be viewed as securities by the Trump admin,” he said, referring to Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump’s apparent crypto-friendliness in pre-election speeches.  “The upcoming ETH ETF launch is helping as well – SOL appears poised to be the next token with an ETF, which, given its relatively small size and strong price performance, would be extremely bullish,” Palley added.  In early July, the Cboe submitted 19b-4 filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) asking to list VanEck's and 21Shares' potential spot Solana ETFs, which were initially filed in late June.  SOL trades at nearly $180 in European morning hours Monday with a 3.5% over the past 24 hours, beating the broad-based CoinDesk 20’s 1.3% rise.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/22/solana-etf-hopes-rising-fundamentals-are-driving-sol-prices-higher-traders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f527c4fc6504ab51ad52b48aea7834c76166d33f-3886x2186.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31366601,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630895,1721644242,"Bitcoin Price Retraces To $66,736: Can Bulls Stage A Recovery?","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has recently experienced a pullback, with its price heading for the $66,736 level. This dip follows a period of significant bullish activity that had previously pushed BTC’s price above this mark. As the price of the crypto asset approaches this critical level, the key question is whether the bulls can regain strength and drive BTC back into an upward trajectory. In this analysis, we will examine Bitcoin’s recent price movement with the help of technical indicators and explore the possibility of a bullish recovery at the $66,736 mark. With a market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion and a trading volume of over $29 billion, BTC’s price was up 0.62% at around $67,238 as of the time of writing. Within the previous day, there has been a rise in BTC’s market value of 0.68% and 64.24% in its trading volume. BTC’s Price Action And Technical Indicators: What Are They Signaling? Currently, on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has formed two bearish momentum candlesticks moving toward the $66,736 level. Although BTC is still trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the price may drop to the $66,736 mark before beginning to ascend again. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that BTC’s price may maintain its bearish trajectory toward the $66,736 mark, as the signal line has crossed below the SMA of the indicator, and both lines are currently attempting to move out of the overbought zone. On the 1-day chart, after successfully breaking above the $66,736 resistance level, Bitcoin is attempting a retest with a bearish move back to this level. It is also notable that since rising above the 100-day SMA, the crypto asset has maintained strong bullish momentum, suggesting that this current pullback may halt at the $66,736 mark. Finally, the 1-day composite trend oscillator indicates that BTC’s price remains bullish, as both the signal line and SMA of the indicator are attempting to rise above the zero line. BTC is also trading above the 1-day SMA, and based on these indicators, it can be suggested that the current pullback may be short-term. Potential Scenarios: Bullish Rebound Or Further Decline For Bitcoin? Based on current price actions and technical indicators, the price of Bitcoin may drop to the $66,736 mark. If Bitcoin’s price drops to this level and then rebounds, it will begin to ascend toward the $71,909 resistance level. Should the price break above this resistance, it may continue to rise, testing the $73,811 level and potentially moving further to create a new all-time high. However, if BTC’s price drops to the $66,736 mark and closes below, it will continue to drop toward the $64,616 support level. When Bitcoin breaks below this level, it will decline further to test the $60,152 support range and possibly other lower levels.

Helium Network is a strong example of a real-world use for blockchain technology, according to one observer.  Helium Network's HNT token has chalked out a market-beating rally amid the growing adoption of the wireless phone service Helium Mobile.  HNT's price has surged over 40% to $5 in seven days, placing it at the No. 2 spot on the list of the biggest gainers among the top 100 coins by market value, just behind the meme coin dogwifhat (WIF), according to data source Coingecko. Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose 7%, as did the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index, a broad-market gauge.  Helium Network is a decentralized blockchain network for the internet of things (IoT), enabling devices to communicate and share data through small devices called hotspots. These hotspots serve as wireless gateways, incentivizing owners with HNT tokens for providing network coverage and verifying connectivity.  Helium Mobile uses the Helium network by connecting to hotspots, allowing data sharing, communication and tracking without relying on traditional centralized cellular networks or Wi-Fi networks.  The number of Helium Mobile subscribers, or entities using mobile devices or sensors that communicate over the Helium Network, exceeded 100,000 early this month. The tally has increased over 300-fold in one year, according to Helium Mobile data.  The phone service published its roadmap progress report on July 12, revealing a pilot program with major U.S. telcos to transfer data to the Helium Network.  The report also announced a licensing program to increase compatibility with third-party hardware manufacturers and OpenRoaming compatibility to broaden data transfer options for hotspot owners. This will enable connectivity for Helium users and subscribers of any service provider that supports OpenRoaming.  According to Delphi Ventures founder Tom Shaughnessy Jr, Helium is a strong example of blockchain technology solving real-world issues.  ""Their 5G offers better consumer pricing to retail since reselling home internet offers a cheaper per mobile price vs a mobile plan directly with a carrier,"" Shaughnessy wrote on X. ""A home internet service costs $50-$100/month once and you can resell that to many users for less each ($20/mo helium plans), vs each person paying $50-$100 for their own mobile plan. 100,000 subscribers and counting is incredible,""  12:12 UTC: Corrects title to ""Helium Mobile's Subscriber Count"" from Helium's Mobile Subscriber Count.

Meme coins popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) surged over the weekend, driven by the cat-themed narrative and their usage as beta bets by some traders.

JPMorgan said the bitcoin price was still too high relative to its production cost and versus gold.  Bitcoin and gold are both expected to benefit from the higher likelihood of a Trump election win, the report said.  Any rebound in cryptocurrency markets in the near term is likely to be tactical in nature and not the beginning of a new long term bullish uptrend, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report last week.  The bank said this was because the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} is currently too high versus its production cost of $43,000, and relative to its volatility-adjusted comparison to gold, which is $53,000. Bitcoin was trading around $67,220 at publication time.  JPMorgan notes that momentum in bitcoin futures has been weak in recent weeks due to BTC liquidations by creditors of Gemini, Mt. Gox creditors and the German government.  Liquidations are expected to subside this month and the bank continues to look for a rebound in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures positioning into August.  Bitcoin and gold are both expected to benefit from the higher likelihood of a Trump election win, as a “second Trump presidency is seen by some investors as more friendly towards crypto companies and towards crypto regulations, in contrast to the current Biden administration,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  There is speculation that Trump could announce bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the Nashville Bitcoin conference later this week, and this “could trigger a parabolic rise in bitcoin’s price,” according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research.

42417642,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMib,1721641290,India Unlikely to See Crypto Tax Reduction in Tuesday's Budget,"While some policy officials hold out hope for a reduction in the crypto tax, most experts don't expect any changes.  The industry's primary desire is to see the 1% tax deducted at source reduced to 0.01%.  India is unlikely to change its controversial tax-deducted-at-source (TDS) policy on crypto transactions when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reveals her full budget for 2024-2025 on Tuesday, experts said.  The budget is the first since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected for a third straight term. What's different this time is Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unexpectedly failed to secure a majority, needing to form a coalition government. The budget is likely to take account of his alliance partners, who have already demanded in excess of $15 billion over the next few years.  For the crypto industry, the TDS is a standout issue. The Bharat Web3 Association (BWA) has asked for the tax to be cut to 0.01% from 1% ever since it was announced two years ago. The industry body has presented data from multiple sources, including a think tank study that provided evidence to support a reduction. Among other arguments, it says lowering the rate will retain more transactions onshore, leading to higher revenue for the government.  ""I don't foresee the 1% TDS being reduced in the near term, despite it being necessary,"" said Punit Agarwal, founder of crypto taxation platform KoinX. ""The current rate leads to capital flight to international exchanges and DEXs, ultimately causing a loss to the government.""  Other demands include establishing progressive taxes on gains instead of the flat 30% rate, and allowing losses to offset gains. They have also pushed for multi-agency regulation.  Despite the surprise election result introducing the need to satisfy coalition partners and last week's $230 million hack of crypto exchange WazirX, which may have pushed crypto down the list of priorities, BWA officials said they are hopeful that at least one of their three requests would receive favor.  The BWA is also looking for some ""direction in terms of regulation."" India does not have a comprehensive crypto regulation, though senior Finance Ministry officials have said they intend to submit draft legislation to parliament.  What's giving them hope is that the association was invited for talks with the ministry as part of the pre-budget consultations, unlike in 2023 before February's interim budget. However, ministry officials ""did not give us any sense or comment at all,"" said R Venkat, a Bharat Web3 Association member who attended the meeting. The Finance Ministry declined to comment.  ""High TDS may have driven retail investors to offshore exchanges, but the government's focus on stringent regulation suggests that a rate reduction is unlikely,"" said Rajat Mittal, a Supreme Court crypto tax counsel. ""The need for robust oversight in the digital asset space is viewed as more critical than alleviating industry concerns.""

An asset’s price opposing a technical indicator suggests positive divergence, which often signals a further rebound.

Based on recommendations 12098 and 12114 passed by the community, these improvements show the active and involved character of the Terra Classic environment. The community is nevertheless hopeful about the advantages these improvements will offer even if small delays resulting from block speed modifications exist. Looking Ahead Technical analysis, market mood, and continuous ecosystem improvements taken together give Terra Classic a bright future. Currently at 70 (Greed), the Fear & Greed Index points to a positive market scenario. With a price volatility of 9.07%, Terra Classic has shown 16 out of 30 green days during the last 30 days.

31360337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630868,1721634000,"Expert Claims Bitcoin Could ‘Go Vertical With A $100,000 Candle’: Here’s The Trigger","As the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville draws near, scheduled for July 25-27, the BTC community braces for what could be a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The event is attracting unprecedented attention, possibly set to surpass the landmark announcement in 2021 by Jack Mallers that El Salvador would adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The anticipation around the conference has been significantly amplified by the scheduled appearance of Donald Trump, the leading US presidential candidate. Rumors that began circulating last week have suggested that Trump might endorse Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset should he win the presidential election in November. These speculations were further fueled by Dennis Porter, founder of the regulatory advocacy group Satoshi Act Fund, who posted on social media platform X about an unconfirmed leak claiming that Trump plans to “announce a USA bitcoin strategic reserve in Nashville,” citing sources wishing to remain anonymous. Bitcoin Could See A “$100,000 Trinity Candle” Amidst this backdrop, Dan Ripoll, a former managing director at financial service company Swan and now a professional trader, outlined a bold scenario that could potentially more than double Bitcoin’s price instantly if Trump’s plans come to fruition. Speaking on X, Ripoll described the possibility as “one of the most gangster moves” Trump could make. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin, Analyst Says His hypothetical involves Trump announcing at the conference that he has significantly invested in Bitcoin and plans to integrate it into the US Strategic Reserve. “Get balls long BTC (as in thousands of coins) going into the Bitcoin Conference next week. Announce plans to put BTC in the US Strategic Reserve. BTC goes vertical with a $100,000 Trinity Candle. Trump quintuples his net worth overnight. He never sells,” Ripoll theorized. According to him, such an action would not only enhance Trump’s net worth but also be positive for BTC hodlers if he keeps his promise. “Then, he should actually follow through with that promise and start accumulating BTC once in office. Everyone wins. Gensler comes after Trump for market manipulation. Trump to Gensler: “You’re Fired”, Ripoll added. Ripoll also suggested that the Democratic Party could potentially undercut Trump’s impact by adopting a pro-Bitcoin stance before the elections, though he expressed skepticism about their willingness to make such a move. Ripoll stated: “The Democrats could steal his thunder by coming out in favor of BTC before the election. But they won’t do it. It makes one question, how badly to the Dems want to win this thing?” Reactions From The BTC Community The reactions within the Bitcoin community to this speculative scenario has been mixed. Eugene Gant expressed skepticism about the broader implications of linking Bitcoin with potential political maneuvers, questioning the ethicality of leveraging a public position for personal financial gain through cryptocurrency. Ripoll responded by emphasizing the broader benefits if America adopts Bitcoin as a reserve asset, suggesting that tying the dollar to “hard money” could stabilize the currency and benefit holders of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Option Traders Are Betting On A Price Breakout Ahead Of US Elections: QCP Capital Another community member, Steve, voiced concerns that Trump’s history of promoting and then divesting personal ventures could indicate a similar strategy with Bitcoin—buying low, pumping the price, and then selling high. Ripoll countered by noting the common trajectory from skepticism to support within the Bitcoin community, suggesting it wouldn’t be surprising if Trump had genuinely shifted his stance. The expert concluded: “Everyone who is a bitcoin maximalist started off as a bitcoin skeptic. Every single one of us. It would not be surprising to see that he actually learned about it and changed his tune. That is the path.” The anticipation for the Bitcoin 2024 conference featuring Trump is clearly visible in the BTC price action over the past days.

42417652,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZMrt,1721632069,Bitcoin Traders Brace for 'Fat Tails' as Focus Shifts to Trump's Nashville Bitcoin Conference Speech,"BTC's options market shows increased expectations for fat tails or outliers impacting returns.  Speculation is rife that Trump may announce a bigger role for BTC in the U.S. financial system, according to one observer.  Donald Trump's impending appearance at the Nashville Bitcoin conference has traders preparing for fat-tails – extreme or unusual price movements in the leading cryptocurrency.  Activity in the options market listed on Deribit and tracked by Amberdata shows a noticeable increase in the ""butterfly index,"" which measures the volatility of the out-of-the-money (OTM) 25-delta (∆25) call and put options listed at a distance from the going market price of bitcoin {{BTC}] relative to at-the-money (ATM) options closer the spot price. The spike in the index indicates expectations for more extreme market movements.  ""This week we’re going to hear Trump speak at the Nashville Bitcoin conference. As long as Trump remains a front-runner, this is a potential catalyst for 'something to happen' this week. The derivative markets seem to agree, and we’re seeing pricing support the 'something is about to happen' narrative."" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email.  ""Something we don’t often talk about, but merits a shoutout this week, is the spike higher in 25-delta wings versus ATM volatility. This type of activity in the options market reflects the anticipation for higher return distribution Kurtosis or fat tails,"" Magadini added.  Options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from bullish or bearish price movements. A call offers protection from bullish moves, while a put is insurance against price slides. Calls at strikes above BTC's going market rate are said to be OTM, while puts below the going rate are said to be OTM. Traders typically buy OTM options when preparing for unexpected market movements, pushing the butterfly index higher.  Hence, trading desks typically use the term ""butterfly"" to indicate the extent of change in the volatility smile or the volatility profile of options at various strike levels and expiration dates. When butterflies become costly, it suggests that the volatility smile has steepened, a sign of the potential for extreme or unexpected events to affect market outcomes.  Trump is scheduled to speak at the Nashville conference on July 27, despite the recent assassination attempt that boosted his chances of winning the Nov. 4 Presidential elections. The grapevine is that Trump might announce a more significant role for BTC in the U.S. financial system.  ""Speculation is high that he will announce bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, which could trigger a parabolic rise in bitcoin's price,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in Monday's edition of the newsletter. ""Taking profit, or even shorting bitcoin ahead of Trump’s Nashville speech, could turn out to be an expensive exercise.""  Additional factors, such as the expected debut of spot ether ETFs in the U.S., also explain the rise in the butterfly index.  ""Traders and market makers are worried about tail risks from the FOMC on July 31 and the upcoming spot ETFs, which has pushed up the pricing for BTC's tail risks [butterfly index],"" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, told CoinDesk.  Tail risk refers to the risk of unexpected events that occur outside the normal distribution of returns.  This week, traders will also receive advance estimates of the U.S. GDP growth for the June quarter of 2024, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, and the core PCE prices, durable goods, and retail sales for June.

It's basically giving you that ultimate flexibility to the user to get yield on USDC with maximum safety.”  Woo X’s innovation partner on the project OpenTrade has links to Center, the now-dissolved collaboration between USDC issuer Circle and Coinbase, and, going further back, the Marco Polo enterprise blockchain project.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/22/crypto-exchange-woo-x-allows-daily-interest-withdrawals-from-t-bill-backed-earn-vaults,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d31629581c4d4f8d6cc95d29632609547664c3a2-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nearly $80 million was in play across six bets related to President Joe Biden's status as the Democrat's nominee, according to Polymarket data, excluding specific bets related to the presidency.  The market with the largest pool asked bettors to pick the Democratic nominee. This process of officially picking a nominee begins for the party on August 19 at its convention, but the specifics are now up in the air with Biden's resignation.  In total, $51.5 million was bet directly on, or against, Biden in a pool of $205 million.  At the end of June, the market as to whether Biden would be the nominee was trading at 90 cents, representing a 90% chance he would be the Democrat's candidate. While there was a considerable amount of volatility throughout the first weeks of July as calls for Biden to drop out amplified – met with a resolute insistence on Biden saying he was staying in – as of July 17, it was back up to 80 cents.  One trader by the name of AnonBidenBull lost nearly $1.8 million on this contract, and over $2 million in total with their other related Biden bets.  Meanwhile, markets that asked bettors to speculate on some variation of the question as to whether Biden would resign pooled a total of $27.5 million.  The largest of these markets, with $21 million at stake, asked if Biden would drop out of the race. Other markets asked for a specific date of his resignation, or if he'd be on specific state ballots for the Presidential ticket.  One user by the name of 'therealbatman' lost nearly $647,500 on this specific bet, and around $1 million in total on his Biden-related punts as they projected Biden to win the popular vote.  On Twitter, Polymarket pointed out that traders had given a significant edge to Biden dropping out in the days before the announcement was made, with the market shooting up to 100% in the moments prior to media coverage of the announcement (Polymarket initially claimed it was hours before, but a community note on X said that because of the difference in time zones it was only minutes).
