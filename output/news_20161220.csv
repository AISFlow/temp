42379111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz2R,1482263331,Global Banks Pilot Blockchain-based Gold Settlement Platform,"A group of global banks and financial institutions has completed the first pilot of a new blockchain-based gold trading platform.  In total, 600 test bullion trades were settled on a platform being developed by Euroclear in partnership with blockchain startup Paxos. The group of financial institutions included Société Générale, Citi, Scotiabank, among other banks.  Transaction settlement service Euroclear first disclosed that it was working on the initiative earlier this year. The project is aimed at providing faster settlement and cheaper services for unallocated gold on the London bullion market.  Announcing the test's completion earlier this week, Scott, Euroclear director of product strategy and innovation, said in a statement:  ""This is a real first step in bringing a new settlement capability to the London bullion market that will help lower risk and simplify the post-trade process.""  In the months ahead, Euroclear and Paxos said they plan to solicit feedback from other stakeholders in London's bullion market and further hone the in-development platform.  The trial continues the trend of efforts by both established market players and new startups to apply the tech to the gold market. As far as London is concerned, there's significant trade volume up for grabs – last year, 17.9m ounces of gold (worth $20.7bn) were cleared each month, according to statistics published by The London Bullion Market Association.  Earlier this year IEX – the stock exchange that inspired the book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis – raised $9m to launch its Tradewind Market, a blockchain-based market also looking to bring increased transparency to precious metals.  Most recently, The UK Royal Mint announced it would soon launch its own blockchain-based gold trading platform.

42379108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mx1t,1482253579,From Brexit to Bitfinex: What Shaped Bitcoin's Price in 2016,"For the price of bitcoin, 2016 might have been one for the books.  Bitcoin prices surged more than 80% over the course of the year, with these gains resulting from a handful of sharp price fluctuations combined with a general, upward trend. Bitcoin prices have risen from roughly $430 at the beginning of the year to around $790 at press time.  These price gyrations took place as markets and those trading within them responded to a series of major global developments, including the decision by UK voters to exit the European Union, the hack of bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, and the halving of bitcoin’s mining reward, which reduced the number of new bitcoins produced in each transaction block from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.  While bitcoin prices rose steadily in the months leading up to the halving, markets experienced more abrupt changes in response to Brexit and the Bitfinex hack.  As a result, the cryptocurrency's 30-day BTC/USD volatility fluctuated quite a bit in 2016, falling below 1% in both April and October and then surging above 5% in July, according to data from The Bitcoin Volatility Index.  The Brexit  It was the vote that stunned Europe.  As reported at the time, 52% of UK voters opted to leave the European Union, an outcome that shocked pollsters and set the economic bloc on an uncertain path ahead.  Bitcoin's price surged leading up to the Brexit vote, climbing roughly 47% between 1st and 18th June, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. Momentum drove the digital currency's price, pushing it above $780 to a 28-month high on 18th June.  However, bitcoin prices went on to lose some of these gains, plunging more than 10% on 21st June after a poll conducted by market research firm Survation showed 45% of voters wanted the UK to remain in the EU, compared to 42% who wanted to stick with the economic bloc.  Bitcoin prices extended these losses on 23rd June, falling 15% to $551 early in the session as sources pointed to greater odds that the UK would stay in the EU. Against the predictions of many, the Brexit effort prevailed, and bitcoin prices opened 24th June at $625.49.  Several analysts, including Joe Lee, founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, emphasized bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset to explain the significant volatility the cryptocurrency experienced before and after the Brexit referendum.  “Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class and a valuable hedging mechanism,"" Lee told CoinDesk. ""In an investor portfolio where there is macroeconomic uncertainty fueled by local politics, diversifying outside of the geographical boundary becomes imperative.""  The halving  The halving, on the other hand, was a more muted affair.  Bitcoin's underlying code includes several scheduled reward reductions, causing the amount of new bitcoins produced with each block to decline over time. The halving on 9th July was preceded by speculation that the event would drive the price of bitcoin to new heights.  The digital currency's price fluctuated in early July, rising to as much as $704.42 on the 3rd of that month and then closing at $664.74 on the 8th, the day before the halving.  Once this much-anticipated event took place, bitcoin prices traded largely within a reasonably tight range between $625 and $675, additional BPI figures show.  Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, commented on how this event affected market participants.  “Yes, the halving was probably the most impactful event this year. In the months leading up to the halving, price surged as traders and new money anticipated a decrease in supply production,"" he said. ""The mere idea of more scarcity was enough to pump price to newer highs.”  However, not everyone seemed as convinced about the impact that the halving had on traders.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged trading platform BitMEX, seemed a bit skeptical about the event’s importance.  “Prices roughly doubled from January to July when the halving occurred,"" he told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin prices did enjoy some notable gains during the first half of 2016, rising upwards of 20% in February and May and surging 26.5% in June, BPI figures reveal. These monthly increases contributed to the cryptocurrency spiking more than 56% gain during the first six months of the year, causing bitcoin to rise from roughly $430 to $672.48 in that time.  Hayes commented on this relative calm, telling CoinDesk:  ""After the event, the price remained stable and barely moved.""  Bitfinex hack  No 2016 report on bitcoin’s price developments would be complete without covering the 2nd August hack of Bitfinex, which resulted in the loss of nearly 120,000 BTC.  In the wake of the hack, the exchange temporarily stopped trading after the security breach was confirmed. Bitcoin prices cratered in response, declining roughly 20% during the session from $607.37 to $480.  Over the next few days, the digital currency recovered, reaching $580 on 4th August.  Markets observers were split on the long-term impact of the Bitfinex hack, arguably the most impactful of 2016.  “The hack killed the positive momentum building in bitcoin,” said Hayes. “It renewed doubts as to the viability of startups handling vast sums of client money. It also made many newcomers think twice before sending fiat or bitcoin to any exchange.  He went on to say:  ""Although the price recovered and surpassed its levels pre-hack, I believe current trading volumes would be higher if Bitfinex had not been hacked.""  However, others downplayed the importance of the incident.  “The Bitfinex hack was a pseudo-event in that it managed to shake out weak hands while smart money swooped in to take advantage of the fear and uncertainty,” said Zivkovski.  Bitfinex is a “small player,” he went on to assert, adding that this event was “very unlikely to change the course of bitcoin's underlying value”.  The Trump effect  After the dust of the Bitfinex hack settled, bitcoin prices enjoyed a steady, upward climb, rising from roughly $580 in early August to linger near $790 at the time of report, representing a 36% increase overall.  During that time, controversial business tycoon Donald Trump won the 8th November presidential election, defeating former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  The price had experienced swings in the days leading up to the US vote. The price had gone as high as $744.28 on 3rd November, according to BPI data, only to tumble below the $680 mark later that day.  In the aftermath of the win, bitcoin prices popped amid a broad decline in stock markets worldwide. Bitcoin prices rose more than 4% on 9th November, climbing from $709 to as much as roughly $739. While Trump’s victory was a shock to some, the resulting bitcoin price rally was not surprising to some observers.  Following this event, the price of bitcoin fell back before continuing its slow, upward trajectory, leading them to the price of roughly $790 at press time.

42379100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwqZ,1482238854,Blockchain in Finance: From Buzzword to Watchword in 2016,"Farzam Ehsani is the leader of the Blockchain Initiative for the FirstRand Group (Africa’s largest bank by market cap).  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Ehsani looks back at the evolution of blockchain development – and nomenclature – in the finance space over the course of 2016. Further, he anticipates the introduction of central bank-issued cryptocurrencies that will truly usher in the age of the blockchain.  If 2015 was the year when many first heard about blockchain, 2016 was the year when many pretended to understand what it was – it was just too embarrassing to admit ignorance of a term that had become such a buzzword.  After all, everyone else seemed to know what it was. “It’s a distributed ledger!” became the battle cry to fend off those that came close to uncovering our lack of understanding.  Yet, the truth is that we’re all learning. Whether it is figuring out what a “node” is or understanding the intricacies of homomorphic encryption and zk-SNARKs, we are all witnessing the unfoldment of this beautiful technology and its implications for the world.  I like to compare blockchain to an extraordinary vehicle that we’ve heard can travel from Cape Town to Cairo in a matter of seconds.  As news spreads of the discovery of this amazing vehicle, more and more people imagine new possibilities, and announcements proliferate: the vehicle will be used to transport maize, coal, sunflowers and more. But when asked what this vehicle looks like – whether it has wings or wheels, belts or brakes – few can offer satisfactory answers.  Such has been the state of blockchain in 2016: a magnificent technology has been discovered, and numerous use cases abound, however, much work needs to be done to better understand and build the underlying platform or “vehicle”.  Protocol growth  While we fell in love with bitcoin and the genius of Satoshi, we also realized that the bitcoin vehicle wasn’t designed for all terrains.  The financial services industry requires a multi-asset platform which is not what bitcoin was designed for. Furthermore, in a regulated environment, actors are known to one another and a breach of trust has punitive consequences. As such, a consensus algorithm such as proof-of-work, intended for trustless participants, serves little purpose except to increase costs and transaction times in a permissioned network.  With this recognition, 2016 saw the emergence of several open-source platforms for the financial services industry, from Hyperledger to Chain Core to Corda (adding to other open-source platforms such as ethereum and Monax released in previous years).  Several more platforms exist in the proprietary space, and many of these will head into open-source territory in 2017. I believe their proprietors will come to acknowledge that any chance of long-term success at the protocol level lies in the network effect, which is hindered by any attempts of monetization.  After all, no one makes money from TCP/IP or HTTP.  Use case among use cases  As vehicle designs (permissioned blockchain protocols) emerged this year, the proclamation of use cases grew louder. One use case in particular will allow all others to reach their highest potential: money.  Moving the most common asset in our economies – fiat currency – onto a blockchain is currently the most significant use case of all. This is because nearly all transactions in our economies involve two parts, one of which is virtually always money.  Money is the lubricant of our economies and its value is in being the most frictionless asset of all (currently, it is not). Unregulated cryptocurrencies have outperformed fiat currency in this regard and the financial world has woken up to this.  Central banks from Canada to China, England to Europe, Sweden to Singapore, USA to the RSA, and many more, are researching, testing, or actively pursuing the establishment of a central bank issued cryptocurrency* (CBCC).  The issuance of CBCC on a sovereign blockchain will allow other financial instruments such as bonds, equities, derivatives, and even land and car registries, to be migrated to the same blockchain and permit a plethora of use cases to come to full fruition.  Without CBCC on a sovereign blockchain, most use cases are stymied. For example, reducing the settlement time of equities to zero isn’t very helpful if the money used to buy those equities still takes a day or two to settle.  Catalyst for the future  The issuance of CBCC on a sovereign blockchain would not only catalyse other use cases, it would also transform the very nature of the banking industry itself.  In the paper “The Advent of Crypto Banking”, I describe a future in which banks might not be deposit-taking institutions, in which bank runs could not exist, and in which banking systems could be more stable and inclusive. The case for fiat currency on a blockchain is indisputable for central banks and regulators.  As we move into 2017, we will see the transformation of blockchain from a buzzword to a watchword. We will see the custodians of our fiat currencies, central banks, move closer to harnessing the power of blockchain technology for the benefit of entire economies.  The amazing blockchain vehicle that once only existed in Satoshi’s imagination will soon benefit the lives of all. Humanity awaits.

42379102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwt5,1482231993,How Savvy Marketing Can Burst the 'Blockchain Bubble',"Jeremy Epstein is the CEO of Never Stop Marketing, a strategic marketing and consulting firm that focuses exclusively on helping blockchain-based technologies bring solutions to market faster and with less risk.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Epstein discusses the challengers marketers – and the broader blockchain technology community – continue to face when attempting to win new enthusiasts with their messaging.  If you are reading this, there’s a good chance you are living in a ""blockchain bubble"".  You're tech savvy, an early adopter and a forward thinker. Odds are, you know a lot of people like yourself.  And, by now, you've realized that most people – at least when it comes to technology – aren’t like you.  So, if you are building a blockchain-based protocol, product or solution… or you just want the industry to thrive, this article is for you.  After 20 years working as a marketer helping disruptive technologies come to the mainstream, I like to say: ""We're all in marketing, it's just that some of us know it.""  I can also tell you the following:  One of the biggest challenges that marketers have is recognizing and admitting that most people aren't like them  Any marketer who says, ""Well, I would (or wouldn't) do that,"" isn’t a good marketer  Marketing is about understanding and empathizing with how other people, unlike you, think.  The blockchain industry (if we can call it that) is moving into its eighth year. The passionate believers, the curious, crypto-anarchists and libertarians have all pretty much shown up. Now, we have to get the rest of the world interested and excited.  The good news is that many industry leaders are starting to recognize this.  The recent e-book, ""Blockchains in the Mainstream: When Will Everyone Else Know?"" offers thoughts from people such as Roger Ver, Jeff Garzik, Erik Voorhees, Primavera De Filippi and 28 others about the obstacles they see to this process.  The challenge for blockchain-based solutions is familiar. As Geoffrey Moore demonstrated in his seminal work, ""Crossing the Chasm,"" the types of customers who spur the very early adoption of a technology are vastly different than those who help push it into the mainstream.  Or, as my friend John used to opine, ""What got us here, won’t get us there.""  You and I know that a blockchain-centric world is, as Kevin Kelly might say, ""inevitable"". But that doesn’t mean everyone else does, and it doesn’t mean it will happen as soon as we all want it to.  It's a paradigm shift  In most marketing, you're saying, ""Here’s why my product is better.”  ""Toyota is better than Honda because…""  ""Apple is better than Microsoft because…""  ""Citibank is better than Chase because…""  In our world, however, we’re saying, ""your phone is better than Citibank or Chase or anyone else"" – to which most people are going to say, ""What?!""  They are naturally going to be resistant because the solution we are offering (at least, initially) is so radically outside their comfort zone.  And, unlike you, most people don’t enjoy being removed from their comfort zones.  Let people stay in their comfort zone  What's true about relationships is true about marketing your product or platform: it's a heck of a lot easier to change yourself than to change others.  Legendary marketer Seth Godin wrote, that when it comes to a person’s worldview, ""People don't believe what you tell them. They rarely believe what you show them. They often believe what their friends tell them. They always believe what they tell themselves.""  To help take your blockchain vision to the mainstream, you'll want to align your story with the story that people are already telling themselves.  Figuring your customer's self story out and then telling yours to align to that – now that is a skill. (For an example, see how Colgate tells a story quickly, effectively, and visually here).  What needs to change for blockchain  The next phase of adoption is going to come from people who aren’t enthusiasts or driven by ideology. It’s going to come from people who can clearly understand the WIIFM (what's in it for me?).  1. Engineering sexiness is cool, but no one else really cares  If you can’t answer the question of what the other person gets out of your product or vision quickly and easily without 20 steps of effort, you may have a challenge.  So, what is your customer’s worldview and how does your product fit into that vision?  2. Total marketing clarity  Which brings us to clarity. You'll notice that I wrote ""clearly understand"" above.  You and I know that decentralized systems are going to make the world a safer, more censorship-resistant, more private, more friction-free, more efficient place – but that's because we’ve spent the time reading white papers and figuring out Merkle trees.  Everyone else lives in an ""attention economy"", where they are constantly being bombarded by messages (whether it is 5,000 or more or less per day doesn’t really matter). So, if you're not able to explain your idea in eight seconds, you’re fighting an uphill battle.  But it all starts with your objective. Once you understand your target customer, you need to settle on what you want to do. Not 20 things, not 10 things.  Then, that objective (ie: “be the premier search engine in the world”) becomes the rallying cry for everything you do, including (and, perhaps, most importantly) how you build your product or protocol.  3. Marketing discipline    I often compare marketing to a wedding cake.  Most people see the icing and decoration on a cake and are impressed. That’s the equivalent to the flashy ad of the slick images.  Great marketers know that you can't have a successful campaign without a solid foundation of daily rigor and execution. Instead, the great ones ""never stop marketing"" and focus on being able to just consistently, day-in and day-out bake a solid cake that will not collapse.  If they do that, they know the marketing cake will look beautiful. If they cannot do that, they know that no amount of icing or decorations will make it look good. It will just be a huge pile of mess…like most marketing out there.  To put it simply, focus on your objective, build a plan to achieve it, and don’t deviate.  What can you do today?  When I engage with potential clients, one of the things we do first is go through a 'marketing discovery questionnaire'. You are welcome to give it a look and answer the questions.  Here are some of them:  Audience/customers: Based on what you know, why do your customers/users 'buy'? (Keep in mind that 'buy' doesn’t necessarily mean money. People pay with attention and time, as well).  Competitive differentiation: In the mind of your customers (not your own mind), what other companies do what you do?  Messaging: From your customer's perspective, what is the story they tell themselves about the benefit they get from using your product?  Brand: Does every employee, partner or investor understand what your brand stands for?  Awareness: How would you characterize your market awareness now?  Perception: How does the market perceive you now?  This is just part of it, but you get the gist.  The next step, of course, is: ""Where do you want to be in 12 or 24 months?"" After you’ve gone through the process of clarifying what you stand for and more, you can build the vision and the plan to get there.  It’s not easy, but it is critical and non-negotiable for those committed to winning.  No predictions  I despise predictions for the upcoming year. Most of them are just link bait, with no accountability.  That’s why this isn’t a prediction, it’s a statement of fact.  In 2017, there will be an emerging group of blockchain-centric companies that:  Put Marketing (that's with a capital 'M') at the center of their business  Put the customer first and the customer experience first  Will be able to clearly articulate their value proposition  Have a messaging platform and clear brand purpose  Craft a crystal-clear marketing strategy statement  And, they will execute like crazy people.  And they will start separating themselves from those who can’t get out of their engineering heads.  I love the tech behind blockchains and decentralized systems as much as anyone. It’s wicked cool, and I get lit up when I talk about it. But, I’m not the market. Neither are you.  Remembering that will be key to your success – and the success of the entire blockchain industry overall-in 2017-and beyond.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?
