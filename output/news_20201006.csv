While the talk kicked off with Peirce’s letter of dissent against the recent SEC decision to levy a $6.1 million fine on Unikrn, the commissioner spoke about a range of topics including decentralized finance (DeFi), her safe harbor proposal for token issuers and whether token airdrops and DeFi governance tokens could run into securities regulations.      At the beginning of the talk, Peirce noted the views laid out in the chat were her own and in no way represent the SEC or her fellow commissioners.    Regarding the Unikrn settlement, Peirce said she felt it was a “rather heavy-handed” settlement over allegations of registration violation. “The message that we send with a case like that is one that is basically, if you want to do innovation go somewhere else to do it,” she said.   Addressing regulations around token airdrops, Peirce stressed that people should come talk to the SEC about how they intend to distribute tokens. While the SEC has previously indicated airdrops could be seen as security offerings, Pierce said giving something away was clearly distinct from selling something.   “But again, I caution people that I'm one person on the commission. There are other people on the commission who might look at the same facts and circumstances differently than I do,” said Peirce.   Speaking about whether governance tokens used by many DeFi platforms could be treated like a securities offering, Peirce said that even though the tokens carry some equity-like benefits, multiple questions regarding regulatory structure and how these tokens could affect corporate governance continue to linger.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/06/sec-commissioner-peirce-chats-about-defi-tokens-and-her-unikrn-dissent-at-la-blockchain-summit,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Speaking virtually at the Sibos 2020 conference on Monday, Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said the bank opened 113,300 consumer digital wallets and 8,859 corporate digital wallets for residents of Shenzhen, Suzhou and Xiong’an to pilot a digital yuan.      The digital wallets processed RMB 1.1 billion ($162 million) across 3.1 million digital yuan transactions between April and August when the pilots launched and ended, Fan said, making it the most widely used central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a commercial setting.      Hooked up to facial recognition, barcode scanning and tap and go payment technologies, the digital yuan transactions spanned over 6,700 types of use cases. These applications included retail, hospitality, transportation, utility payments, government services and electronic versions of red envelopes gifted to healthcare workers in Shenzhen’s Luohu district, Fan detailed.      Also known as DC/EP, an acronym that stands for digital currency/electronic payment, the digital yuan is a longstanding initiative by the Chinese government since 2014 – when it established a digital currency research institute – to use cryptocurrency-inspired technology to modernize payments, bypass international trade networks and exert geopolitical strength.      “To protect fiat currency from crypto assets and safeguard monetary sovereignty, it is necessary for the central banks to digitize bank notes through new technologies,” Fan stressed in his Sibos talk about the importance of a digital yuan.      The digital yuan’s use in tourism will also be explored in a forthcoming pilot at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in the nation’s capital of Beijing, the People’s Bank of China said in April, when it announced Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong’an and Chengdu were chosen as the first sites for trials.      The trials have expanded to Beijing, the Yangtze River Delta region, the provinces of Tianjin, Hebei and Guangdong, and the cities of Hong Kong and Macau, the country’s Commerce Ministry said in August, and they could roll out to central and western China in the future.

42432860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tTh,1602016808,CryptoPunk Bounties: Ark.Gallery Rolls Out Blind Bids on 8-Bit NFT Collectibles,"Regular art and digital art face a similar hurdle: insufficient liquidity.      A new contract rolled out by Ark.Gallery hopes to inject some fluid in the CryptoPunk market by letting people place blind bids backed by ether (ETH), called bounties, for the increasingly in-demand digital collectibles.      Launched Friday, the bounties give CryptoPunk owners the option to instantly cash out by accepting any of the live bids, as opposed to listing their product and waiting on bids in a marketplace. On the buyer side, instead of placing bids on multiple collectibles (thereby locking up more ETH) users can place a bounty on “any punk” and wait for an owner to accept it.      One of the first blockchain-enabled art projects, CryptoPunks were built by Larva Labs and debuted in June 2017. Each of the 10,000 punks are unique characters and are sorted by traits such as male, female, alien, spots/no spots, etc.      Some of these traits – like punks with beanies or zombie punks – are quite rare and tend to be more expensive.      Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained      The collection relies on Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but predates the ERC-721 token standard that most NFTs currently use, perhaps adding to the CryptoPunks allure.      While this was a hiccup encountered in listing the punks on third-party marketplaces, it changed when the “wrapped punks” smart contract was launched by Ark.Gallery, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for shared NFT ownership.      The smart contract lets owners “wrap” their punk tokens into the ERC-721 standard. Put simply, wrapping the punks makes them more easily swappable. This allows owners to officially list their punks on popular marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, which in turn has driven up prices.      So much so that Larva Labs tweeted a thread explaining sales of 1,100 ETH (approximately $387,451) during the second week of September.      On Saturday, a wrapped punk with rare traits (combination of zombie and beanie) sold for 185 ETH (roughly $65,062) on the Nifty marketplace.      Ark.Gallery charges a fee of 2.5% on every closed deal “so that the liquidity provider does not have to pay anything extra,” Roberto Ceresia, founder of Ark.Gallery, said in an email.      Read more: Yield Farming Expands From Finance to Digital Collectibles      The platform’s history of “bounties” shows that a total of 26 have been executed as of Tuesday afternoon, at an average price of 3.64 ETH ($1,238). According to Ceresia, the early numbers were encouraging and he expects them to grow as the platform adds bounties for other collections including Autoglyphs.      “I think that they do have a wall of liquidity that is there, ready to be spent. It’s a great solution for asset owners,” said Ceresia, referring to the bounties.      While currently under development, Ark.Gallery’s main platform is geared toward shared ownership of digital collectibles. The platform allows people to own a fraction of a token that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive for many users.      Fractional owners of the NFT also get voting rights on sale offers and, if successful, the proceeds are distributed proportionally.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/06/cryptopunk-bounties-arkgallery-rolls-out-blind-bids-on-8-bit-nft-collectibles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f82d42f335a1b9a7dc97cdc8c4106d49e202207c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432872,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tth,1602016225,"Bitcoin Trump-Dumps to $10,500; MetaMask Hits 1 Million Users","Bitcoin was able to hit $10,800 Tuesday before falling on U.S. Pres. Donald Trump's stimulus tweet. Meanwhile, the DeFi ecosystem’s most popular wallet hit 1 million users.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,555 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,528-$10,800  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was able to climb to $10,800 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase Tuesday before falling to as low as $10,528 immediately after President Trump tweeted his rejection of opposition lawmakers’ most recent economic stimulus proposal.      “One thing that is still hanging over this market is the stimulus,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “It may take until after the elections for them to reach an agreement, which would be really bad for a lot of Americans relying on government aid.”      Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairlead Strategies, says bitcoin has been above the key $10,000 price point for some time, which she considers bullish. “Bitcoin has been consolidating within its uptrend since discovering support near $10,000 a month ago,” Stockton said. The last time bitcoin traded below $10,000 was on Sept. 9.      Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, says the aftermath of the BitMEX news still has him optimistic.      Read More: BitMEX Ether Futures Trading Contracts Fall by Half in Wake of US Charges      ""It's bullish to see that bitcoin trading infrastructure is so strong given that the former largest bitcoin derivatives trading platform can lose 25% of [its] BTC open interest deposits overnight and the markets just shrug it off.” Koehler also noted that open interest in the bitcoin futures market overall is ticking up, hitting $3.8 billion on Monday.      One of the reasons for resilience may be bitcoin’s potential store-of-value properties, says Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter trader based in Sweden, who is bullish bitcoin but bearish almost everything else. “To me there’s no doubt we will see a housing crash, a stock crash and quite possibly tough deflation in the near future,” he said.      To accomplish this, Kugelberg says U.S. debt, which is already over 100% gross domestic product, will have to increase in order to stave off a traditional market crash. ”Those things will drive the need to increase the debt at the same pace for another year or maybe more,” Kugelberg added. “To me it seems like a point where turning to bitcoin is a good idea.”    MetaMask hits 1 million users    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday, trading around $341 and slipping 3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The MetaMask wallet, a browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum network and its multitude of smart contract-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, has hit 1 million users. It’s a fourfold increase for the wallet since 2019, with the United States, India, Nigeria and the Philippines as the top countries with highest MetaMask usage, according to its software developer, Consensys.      Chasing juicy returns in the DeFi space, which can often provide double- or triple-digit returns for lending crypto, is one of the reasons for MetaMask’s growth, said John Willock, CEO of Tritium Digital Assets, a crypto liquidity provider. “I think we can all recognize that a lot of the adoption of MetaMask is through the recent DeFi craze and interest in short-term returns that have been perceived to be out there to chase.”      Read More: MetaMask Gets Into the Decentralized Exchange Aggregation Business      However, that speculation is bringing real adoption, Willock added. “I look at the MetaMask numbers as the same sort of early adoption indicator the uptake of Netscape browser use was in the 1990s.

42432867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tlh,1602015741,How the Decentralized Web Transfers Wealth From Corporations to People,"The internet of today is broken. We can use the internet, but we don’t own anything we do. Companies control our domain names, the content we host on web servers and our access to the internet. Now that so much of our information is on social media, this problem is even worse. Our social media IDs, our chat messages, our videos and anything else we publish online is controlled by giant companies. They can seize your assets, spy on you, ban you and sell your most intimate details to the highest bidder.    Bradley Kam is the founder and head of business development of Unstoppable Domains. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series examining the future of our digital lives.  Not my domain    In the case of the domain name system (DNS), companies control domains, not users. Domains are frequently taken from users at the request of governments and other parties. France.com was seized from a man who had owned it since 1994 because the country of France believed it should be the owner. Owners of .com domains around the world are often surprised to discover that the U.S. government polices websites from all over the world by asking Verisign (owner of .com) to take away domains. The Libyan government seized vb.ly for violating Islamic law even though the website and its owner were not based in Libya. Anyone in the world with a .ly domain is subject to takedowns at the request of the Libyan government.    Content censorship    Hosting services suffer from a similar fate as DNS does. Companies and countries decide what can be published, not users. In Turkey, a law was passed that bans 150 words from being mentioned on any website in the country. One of these words is ""gay and another one is ""naked."" Hosting services are being used to censor content that disagrees with the religious beliefs of the government in power. In China, the problem is even more extreme. Anyone who wants to publish online must first obtain a license.      And hosting providers are central points of failure. Not long ago, AWS had an outage, which effectively turned off large portions of the internet. These problems all come back to this issue of companies owning user data versus users owning their own data.      See also: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser    It doesn’t have to be this way    All of this would change if users, not companies, controlled their digital assets and data. This is now possible for the first time in history with the creation of blockchain networks like Ethereum, Filecoin and others. By 2030, assuming decentralized networks succeed, the internet will undergo massive changes that are better for users and for freedom on the internet. We can have a user controlled internet that promotes freedom across the world.      So what will 2030 look like?    Crowd control    Websites are controlled by communities, not by any one person or company. The community votes on what articles are posted and what content is covered. I visit a popular news website that isn’t controlled by any particular person or group. The top news headlines are voted on by users. Even determining whether an article is truthful or overly biased is determined by the crowd.      After reading the news of the day, I decided to check on my favorite investment fund. This is also a community-owned project, where investment decisions are voted on and members can opt to participate in deals. I’m intrigued by the latest underwater robot tech and decide to put in a little bit of money. I click two buttons and the funds are sent.    User options    Instead of tech companies individually determining what information is okay to share online and what isn’t, users decide.      I open my browser and check out some of the latest content. I navigate to one in particular, but my browser offers a warning – this content is potentially violent and disturbing. Do I want to see it anyway? Something else I click on is blocked entirely because I’ve set my browser to filter out such content. I’ve chosen to use the American Civil Liberties Union’s list of filtered websites because I like its view on where the line is between free speech and hate speech.      Of course, if I disagree with ACLU's view, I simply set my browser to resolve all websites or I use an open-source browser that resolves every website available. Companies are now competing in an open market to deliver the best user protection from harmful content while still giving me the ultimate choice over what I view online.      See also: Steven McKie – Why the Decentralized Web’s Development Is Unstoppable    UI layers    Instead of social media companies owning user data, users store information on decentralized hosting networks and carry their data around with them on the internet. If an application wants access to a particular piece of data, users give that app permission. Often, that permission is to use a piece of data without the app’s creators being able to see the data or identify who I am.      I jump onto a social network that has a slick search function for finding info about my friends. I’m looking for friends who have traveled to a particular city in the past few months so I can get travel advice. Next, I want to read about the latest political discussions my friends are having. I jump onto another social network and my contacts, messages, comments and the rest of my info follow me as I move across these networks.      Each friend has just one username, not one per social media app. I am trying out a new social network I’ve never tried before. I don’t need to rebuild my social graph because my contacts and data come along with me. I just log in the first time and it works. I share some data with the app and I get paid. I then choose to watch an ad and get paid again.      As a superuser, I get a steady stream of revenue from one of my most important assets, my online data. New apps are popping up all of the time and companies are constantly competing to provide me the best user experience, which includes paying the highest price possible for my data and my attention.    Users profit, not (just) companies    By 2030, the transition from a corporate-controlled to a user-controlled internet has made everyone on the planet wealthier. Access to new services has reduced the costs for literally billions of people to borrow money, start businesses or invest in their education. Users and their data will be set free. Just as physical property rights ended indentured servitude and launched the industrial revolution, digital property rights have brought about a digital industrial revolution.      I have tens of thousands of dollars in digital value just from monetizing social media accounts. As much as 50% of my wealth is digital now instead of physical. The digital economy is booming and consumers are the primary beneficiaries.

42432858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tRh,1602014460,After BitMEX: Regulation Must Change for the Digital Age,"Being a policymaker or regulator these days is harder than ever. What policy objective to prioritize: digital innovation and economic growth or prudent operation of the existing markets? Privacy, confidentiality and other civil liberties, or the radical transparency that is required to aid in the prevention of financial crime and terrorism?      It is also hard being a disruptive financial services innovator in today's world. Do we just launch a global alternative financial system that is more secure, faster and cheaper, or do we first ask for permission to operate incrementally in each jurisdiction? The former gives us a shot at glory. The latter, follower status.    Juan Llanos is the founder and managing director of Juan Llanos Advisors and former FinTech and Regulatory Tech lead at ConsenSys.    Policy objectives are often like liquid flowing through communicating vessels: You need to trade off higher impact in one area for lower impact on another area. So are business objectives, as the recent shakedown of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX teaches.      BitMEX appears to have broken every possible applicable rule, allegedly, in both the financial crime and prudential domains. And all in plain sight. It’s rather unbelievable that such seemingly smart and tech-savvy innovators were so misguided as to completely ignore the regulatory compliance aspects.      Perhaps it was its high-risk appetite, but BitMEX should have known better that the U.S. has one of the most sophisticated regulatory apparatuses in the world, one of the heaviest-handed enforcement attitudes and the farthest-reaching jurisdictional reach.      There will, hopefully, be lots of lessons learned here. Not only by the market as to the regulatory obligations applicable to financial players, but by governments with respect to their long-term innovation policy objectives, too.      It’s not easy to balance prudence, control and market stability with innovation and progress. It’s actually really hard. But the emergence of blockchain technology and crypto networks has created a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for both industry and policymakers to jointly rethink and redefine, first, how financial services could be reinvented with these new technologies and, second, what regulatory safeguards should apply to financial services that run on these new technologies.      See also: William Mougayar – While We Wait for Laws, We Need Better Interpretations of Existing Regulation    But the fact is that all BitMEX seems to have done is operate out of compliance, not damage the market in any way. And for that it will pay a hefty price.    Take for example the regulatory framework for commodity derivatives, which is relevant to this case. This framework involves a highly prescriptive set of rules intended to mitigate the multiplicity of risks posed by the various specialized participants. These rules are tailored to the structure of the market as it has existed for decades.      With blockchain and crypto networks and other cutting-edge technologies, however, both the nature of the assets themselves and the market infrastructure are changing. It’s now possible to clear and settle a native digital asset simultaneously. That was impossible five years ago.      When innovating in the world of finance there are bound to be lots of technical violations of existing regulatory obligations, as seems to have been the case with BitMEX. The U.S. government regulators had a point when they explained they “can’t allow bad actors that break the law to gain an advantage over exchanges that are doing the right thing by complying with our rules.” But the fact is that all BitMEX seems to have done is operate out of compliance, not damage the market in any way. And for that it will pay a hefty price.      Honest question: While law enforcement and prudential regulators continue to do their jobs, is anybody redesigning regulation for the 21st century? Or is that too lofty a goal?      Some believe that by shooting down a trail-blazing innovator that was leveraging cutting-edge technologies to offer investment products under a new technological paradigm, the government has prioritized protecting the U.S. market. I don’t want to speculate on the potential geopolitics of such a move, but enforcement actions like this may have the unintended consequence of slowing down the pace of innovation both in the U.S. and around the world.      A design principle embraced by modern, nimble and resilient organizations is that in order to optimize the system we need to suboptimize the subsystems. Perhaps that is what governments and industry should be working together to accomplish in this increasingly fast and digital twenty-first century.      See also: More Than Half of Financial Advisors Want Better Regulation Before Investing in Crypto      We can continue applying the square peg of old regulation to the round hole of new assets and markets, or to rethink and reshape our regulatory frameworks to the new decentralized financial products and services that are rapidly emerging across the world.

42432865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tdh,1602013961,This Self-Sovereign ‘DocuSign’ Uses Bitcoin for Digital Proofs,"For years, developers have worked on expanding Bitcoin's use case beyond being a transaction ledger. What if, for instance, whenever you signed a contract – for starting a new job, for signing on to a service or for closing on a house – you could use the Bitcoin blockchain to publish legally binding, immutable proof of the contract and your signature to it?      Woleet is a French startup whose business model revolves around this very application. A DocuSign of sorts that uses Bitcoin, the project has been quietly building for four years. Woleet debuted a front end last month, having sold application programming interfaces (API) for its software for the past few years.      “With Woleet Sign we plan to demonstrate our ability to address electronic signatures with the same level of user experience as the traditional actors in this space. The software-as-a-service application will help us to promote our highly customizable API for signature workflows in various business applications,” Gilles Cadignan, the CEO of Woleet, told CoinDesk.    Woleet: Notary meets Bitcoin    Woleet provides a software suite that allows its clients to authenticate documents and signatures using Bitcoin’s blockchain. Anyone needing to authenticate this data can verify these proofs using hashes that correspond to the signatory and the document’s public key.      These proofs can be used as timestamps, electronic signatures, electronic seals and digital IDs.      Read more: Microsoft Releases Bitcoin-Based ID Tool as COVID-19 ‘Passports’ Draw Criticism      Woleet does not handle customer data; on the backend, it sends transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain to hash proofs for clients, but the documents never leave the client’s local computer or server storage unless it opts for cloud storage through a provider like Google.      This model is a notable exception to traditional e-signature services, which store documents and other data for their clients. With Woleet, clients can use its self-hosted ID server to manage digital identities and key pairs for their documents and signers.      According to its website, Woleet is compliant with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and its signatures are legally binding.      The service already has a growing list of clients including luxury goods company Kering, renewable energy providers EDF and Acciona and pharmaceutical lab Servier, among others.      “At first we were seen as an innovation startup only good for proof of concept, like all the other ‘enterprise blockchain’ technologies available.” Cadigan said. “Today, the fact that big companies trust us is helping a lot to sell to medium-sized companies with the same needs for certification and electronic signatures.”    Self-sovereign digital IDs on Bitcoin    With its launch, Woleet joins a class of Bitcoin startups working to bring self-sovereign digital identities to the fore of Bitcoin’s enterprise applications.      The Microsoft-incubated ION project, for instance, is creating a platform for issuing what it calls Decentralized Digital IDs (DDIDs) on Bitcoin.      The RGB protocol, which entered beta this summer, could also provide a platform to create similarly decentralized and digital IDs, among a slew of other applications.      Read more: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained      At their core, the difference between these identity systems and their legacy counterparts comes from their “sovereign” nature. Their users would store the data that is being authenticated themselves rather than relinquishing it to a third party.

42432870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tph,1602012528,These 3 Trends Are Driving Crypto Market Growth Now,"In such a fast-growing industry as crypto asset markets, it can be overwhelming to try to extract the main themes driving liquidity and investor interest. Yet, doing so helps to understand how relatively new markets evolve, and what the catalysts will be for the next big steps forward.      The latest CoinDesk Research Quarterly Review focuses on three features that have exhibited astonishing growth in Q3 and are playing a significant role in the evolving maturity of the digital asset markets.      In 24 charts, we look at stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) and derivatives, and tease out some intriguing findings.    Stablecoins    It is a common misconception that fiat-based stablecoin prices never vary relative to the underlying currency (usually the dollar). This is not true. They are pegged to a fixed unit, but in reality their market prices fluctuate around that level.      This allows for arbitrage opportunities in which investors can mint a stablecoin for $1 and sell it on the market for $1.0003, for example. Multiplied by millions, this can generate a handsome profit. Selling pressure will bring the stablecoin value down towards its pegged price.      Over Q3, the supply of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, grew much more than that of tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, even though the arbitrage opportunities (as measured by the standard deviation of the stablecoin prices) were greater with USDT. This hints at a growing demand for USDC from institutional investors and traders: USDC is run by licensed, U.S.-based firms and has taken a more regulatory-friendly approach.    DeFi    Ethereum’s market capitalization increased 60% in Q3 2020, growing from $25 billion to $40.5 billion by the end of September. The market capitalization of the top 10 DeFi coins by total value locked saw an even greater increase over the quarter, growing over 345% from $1.2 billion to $5.3 billion. Aggregated as one, the market capitalization of DeFi nows makes up roughly 12% of total market value on the blockchain, and has emerged as the driving narrative for the Ethereum ecosystem.      Ethereum emerged in 2014 with the aim of being the “world’s computer.” In the ICO boom of 2017, it became the “fundraising platform of the future.” Now, the role of Ethereum in the evolution of decentralized finance is yet again changing the blockchain’s narrative. This could impact not only the levels of interest from both retail and institutional investors; it could also influence technological considerations, especially at a time when the underlying technology is undergoing a profound transformation as the ecosystem migrates to Ethereum 2.0.    Derivatives    While the ether futures market is still a fraction of that of bitcoin, it is starting to exhibit some catch-up activity. Both daily transaction volume and aggregated open interest (OI) in ether futures set dramatic new records, reaching $14 billion on Aug. 2 and $1.7 billion on Aug. 15, respectively. In September, both have fallen back to an elevated “new normal.”      This shows the strong growth in the Ethereum ecosystem and hints at growing institutional acceptance of ether as an investment and trading asset. It also highlights the evolution of crypto markets as a whole – a pre-requisite for a mature market is a lively derivatives market. So far, the derivatives market has been dominated by bitcoin futures. Greater diversity will lead to a healthier market overall.

The hackers demanded crypto payments in exchange for returning account access, but cyber intelligence firm Pandora Security told Haaretz no payments appear to have been made.  It’s not clear who the hacker was or where he was based, but Pandora’s co-founder Tzahi Ganot said he suspects a criminal group with access to the SS7 network may have planned and mounted the attack from an unassigned switch, the matter is still under investigation.

Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us.      The Top Shelf news you subscribed to is down below.      Now, a few words from CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley.    Making consensus    Scaling for censorship-resistance The shakedown of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX last week is a healthy reminder of what motivates many DeFi developers: building censorship-resistant financial markets.      The meaningful comparison between BitMEX and decentralized finance, of course, is the self-executing nature of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain. Through bits and bytes, developers are working toward a future where U.S. regulators cannot take down financial markets – let alone any application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.      Still, while theoretically capable of supporting a new world of censorship-resistant finance, the Ethereum blockchain has hit the hard limits of its own infrastructure.      Ethereum isn’t ready for prime time performance. Its mainchain and many decentralized applications (dapp) can barely handle the economic strain users have put it under this summer, which saw fees shoot to record highs twice.      One of the most urgent and interesting questions in crypto is how to create a censorship-resistant economy that actually works. While there are no easy solutions to rising gas fees, it’s a topic drawing some of the most creative minds, all with their own ideas.      On Oct. 14, MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen and Near Protocol’s Illia Polosukhin will discuss the issue of gas fees at invest: ethereum economy. Others will focus on the future of Ethereum, and the long road it has taken towards scalability with Ethereum 2.0. While under development for years, this updated chain remains a gamble.      For instance, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 – the latter stages of Eth 2.0 that should theoretically push the blockchain to tens of thousands of transactions per second – have not been fully scoped out. Some aspects remain completely unknown. (Perhaps as it should be, given the fast pace of discovery in crypto land.)    But phase 0 is nearly upon us. Multiple testnets have led developers and stakers to the autumn’s main event: the release of a deposit contract for stakers expected this month. Once enough etherhttp://condesk.com/price/ethereum (ETH) is deposited in the contract, the new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain can begin to turn along.    Called the Beacon chain, the PoS blockchain will act as a spinal cord of sorts for Eth 2.0’s multi-blockchain settlement scheme. For now, the Beacon chain stands as a symbol of a censorship resistant future. A promise of technology, but one under development.      It’s a topic Vitalik Buterin will likely go into during his keynote speech at Invest. Others, like Alchemy’s Michael Garland and Anchorage’s Diogo Mónica, will go further into the weeds, discussing not only the mechanics behind this multi-year blockchain swap but also why it matters for people’s bottom line during “ETH Staking: The Service You'll Want to Buy.”      Join us for a day-long exploration of the ins and outs of the go-to platform for decentralized applications, its current setup and future roadmap.      - Will Foxley    Featured panel    Stake it or farm it? Ethereum has introduced new ways for people to get their money to work for them. Whether it's securing or participating in a network or creating other interest from your money, new rewards and incentives abound for those willing to engage. In a panel discussion, titled “Making Your Money Work for You,” Gauntlet’s Tarun Chitra, Stake’s Tim Ogilvie and Balancer Lab’s Fernando Martinelli will discuss how to manage risks, optimize rewards and build a portfolio using ether-based assets.      Tune in from 10:30 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. ET, Oct. 14.    Ethereum 101    Ethereum 2.0 represents the first time the cryptocurrency industry will see a blockchain of its size and value attempt to transition all users, as well as assets, to an entirely new decentralized network while keeping all operations on the old network active and running.      So what will happen to your ether and non-fungible tokens (NFT) once Ethereum 2.0 goes live? CoinDesk research analyst Christine Kim explains.      Ethereum 2.0 is coming The years-long upgrade – intended to radically transform the world’s largest smart-contract platform – is inching closer to deployment.      As of July 10, some developers, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, estimate the oft-delayed Eth 2.0 will launch by the end of this year.      When phase zero of Eth 2.0 does ship, little about Ethereum will change in the near term for users and dapp developers. This is because unlike all other system-wide upgrades in Ethereum history, the Eth 2.0 overhaul will primarily be happening on a different blockchain.      The first phase of development for Eth 2.0 is centered around the creation of a separate proof-of-stake blockchain network called the beacon chain. On this new network, ETH holders with a minimum of 32 ETH can earn rewards in the form of annualized interest on their wealth. To earn these rewards, ETH holders must have the appropriate hardware and software connecting to the beacon chain and a strong understanding of how the technology works.      Ethereum as we know it today will eventually be folded into the Eth 2.0 upgrade in its entirety. The report features commentary from Ethereum developers about what benefits – but also risks – this may bring.      The culmination of over five years of research and development, Ethereum 2.0 is a highly ambitious upgrade.      For an even deeper dive, CoinDesk Research published a 22-page report on “Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters.”      - Christine Kim    At stake    Osho Jha is an investor, data scientist and tech company executive who enjoys finding and analyzing unique data sets for investing in both public and private markets.      In this essay, published in early 2020, Jha details why the transition to a Proof-of-Stake chain will turn Ethereum into a functioning store of value.      Store of value Before diving into the impact that staking could have on ether (ETH), it is important to understand how the ETH “money supply” currently works. As we know, bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed supply of 21 million coins and the rate at which these coins are released into the money supply decreases over time. ETH does not have a fixed supply but, like BTC, it has a declining inflation rate.      There is a fixed issuance of new ETH annually. As the money supply grows, that fixed issuance becomes a smaller portion of the total money supply. As with BTC halvings, ETH over time has reduced the block reward for miners. The transition to Ethereum 2.0’s staking mechanism is set to reduce the inflation rate of ETH to 0.5%-2.0%, putting it in the same company as BTC and gold in terms of supply inflation.      I look at ETH as the fiat to BTC’s gold. Despite negative connotations in the crypto community, fiat currencies aren’t inherently bad and the main advantage of an unfixed total supply is flexibility to adjust supply during different economic climates. Central banks have taken this flexibility to an extreme in recent years, and, while ETH’s supply is not fixed, its projected long term inflation may be a happy middle ground between fixed supply and unbridled money printing.      Demand-side dynamics In many ways, ETH trades like a venture investment. Investors believe Ethereum will be the underlying technology for the future of decentralized apps and they buy ETH in the same way they would shares [of stock]. I find this troubling because, by its very nature, ETH is not a stock and these investors are taking on a bigger risk than they might think.      Staking is the key to making ETH function as a value store. At its core, staking incentivizes holding ETH in a node that can then be used by the network to verify transactions. The greater the number of nodes, the faster the network can function and the more secure it becomes. Staking is not new. Projects ranging from Hedera Hashgraph to Facebook Libra have some sort of staking mechanism built in. But they don’t have the advantage of being the de facto network decentralized app developers lean on.      For investors, there are incentives to staking tokens in a node, including rewards similar to earning interest on a bank deposit. While the staking rewards vary based on network performance and utilization, target returns are close to 10% annually. Though actual returns will vary as the network gets up and running, the possibility of earning returns on coins that would otherwise be in a wallet should entice ETH holders to stake.      In a global low-rate environment, these returns are certainly attractive. And staking may be the killer app that allows ETH to become a “positive carry asset.” In other words, it generates a positive return for holding it as opposed to, say, gold, which is negative-carry, as it incurs storage costs. Long term, positive carry stimulates demand and creates an incentive to borrow cash to purchase and earn yield. Overall, positive-carry assets increase stability of price movements by creating long term holders and widening the investor base.      Investors are becoming aware of this dynamic. To stake a node, there is a minimum required 32 ETH (thought staking pools can allow staking to be done with as little as 1 ETH).      ETH as a store of value Current events have forced us to adapt to a more digital life and also shown us the limitation of legacy banking systems. Even the distribution of stimulus checks became a nontrivial problem. With the market focused on bitcoin and its role in unstable economic times, the advances being set forth by Ethereum 2.0 have been largely overlooked. However, Ethereum 2.0 lays out a platform which can help create better digital experiences and ease the friction as individuals and institutions transition to a digital-first world.      As we mentioned earlier, staking will turn ETH into a positive carry asset, which in turn brings price stability and broadens the investor base. By staking accumulated tokens, investors will both earn yield and help scale the network in a secure way.      While ETH is being staked, there is demand for stablecoins and banking-esque services, which are being deployed and iterated on in the DeFi space as a whole. With this dynamic, transactions can be made using stablecoins while ETH itself is staked to generate interest income. This may sound foreign and futuristic but it’s not much different than when people keep savings in an interest-generating savings accounts, or investments, and keep day-to-day money in a checking account.      - Osho Jha    The ledger    Going back to Will Foxley’s introduction, Ethereum 2.0 promises to revolutionize finance and the crypto economy, but there are still a lot of open questions.  Last year, my former colleague Leigh Cuen wrote an article examining many of the most contentious issues surrounding the development and eventual deployment of Eth 2.0.  During the largest blockchain overhaul to date, many of the nuances being discussed are reduced to simple gut reactions: is what’s happening a “scam” or an iteration.      Iterative processes For Ethereum’s critics in the Bitcoin community, [September 2019] brought a “gotcha” moment.      Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, acknowledged onstage at Ethereal Tel Aviv that the network, in its original form, wasn’t built for mass adoption. “We knew it wasn’t going to be scalable for sure,” the ConsenSys CEO said.      Predictable cries of “scam” from ardent bitcoiners followed. But Lubin’s statement wasn’t scandalous in the least to the Ethereum fans at Devcon – the community’s largest and most influential annual gathering – where roughly 3,000 attendees gathered this week in Osaka, Japan.      Even those who knew the first version wasn’t scalable don’t see early marketing claims as misleading. They see iteration as an inherent process.      “Bitcoiners are kinda like hardcore fascist Catholics that just think everything else is wrong,” Dean Eigenmann, a researcher at the Ethereum startup Status, said [in 2019]. “I think [Ethereum] underdelivered on its promises, but it has delivered.”      The sanguine vibe at Devcon highlights the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, which has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with: Bitcoin is an individualistic monetary asset while Ethereum, convoluted as its path to mass adoption may be, is a communal promise to continue experimenting with smart contracts, together.      James Prestwich, one of the leaders of a project aiming to create cross-chain capital flows between Bitcoin and Ethereum, said at the time he believes all cryptocurrency narratives evolve. So even if a blockchain manifests something different than the original white paper, that doesn’t make it a scam.      So what have the Ethereum founders delivered since they sold more than 7 million tokens to retail investors to kickstart the network in 2014?      The original Ethereum platform inspired billions of dollars worth of economic activity, from token sales to DeFi loans, and influenced the way regulators view cryptocurrencies that “decentralize” after fundraising.      But the jury is still out as to whether that accrued value will translate to the next version of the smart contract platform.      ‘Lack of strategy’ Devcon attendees weren’t shy in discussing the road ahead, or who will fund this work.      According to Peter Mauric, Ethereum client Parity’s head of communications, the bulk of Ethereum-related funding programs will now prioritize creating a new blockchain, Eth 2. Sources with knowledge of such development plans estimated it would take at least two years to build this next version of Ethereum.      “No one really knows what Eth 1 will look like once Eth 2 exists,” Mauric said at the time. “There’s not a ton of new development going on in the current chain clients. Most of the ongoing work is maintenance.”      There’s no clear plan for how to migrate hundreds of Ethereum-based tokens and smart contracts, including DeFi projects, to the new chain in the foreseeable future, according to Buterin, Prestwich and Mike Porcaro, head of communications at the MakerDAO Foundation.      Developer Jamie Pitts, contracted by the Ethereum Foundation, kicked off the opening ceremony on Tuesday by sharing his concerns.      “I feel like there’s a lack of strategy,” Pitts said. “I think there’s a lot of teams working on their ideas, but there’s a lack of coordination.”      According to James Beck, communications lead at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based venture studio helmed by Lubin, there were in 2019 nine teams working on clients for the upcoming Eth 2 blockchain, including Prysmatic Labs, Chainsafe, Status and the ConsenSys-owned startup PegaSys.      However, according to several sources with knowledge of Ethereum infrastructure projects, the bulk of funds for Eth 1 and Eth 2 development still comes from either the Ethereum Foundation or ConsenSys, in addition to smaller funding mechanisms like the MolochDAO and the Meta Cartel, both of which also accept public donations. Pitts told CoinDesk this doesn’t concern him because these funders don’t control development choices.      While there are still many unanswered questions about how the project will diversify beyond reliance on funding from its founders, Josh Cincinnati, director of the Zcash Foundation, said Ethereum has achieved a significant level of decentralized participation from the bottom-up.      “Something Ethereum has proven to be really good at is making exotic financial contracts approachable for developers,” Cincinnati said.      Vitalik’s view From Buterin’s perspective, Eth 1 was a successful experiment that paved the way for Eth 2, which will require a focus on incentives, through Proof-of-Stake, before live transactions.      “I’d argue it has done a lot of good. The ICO boom has pretty much single-handedly funded research into all of these general cryptography things,” Buterin told CoinDesk.      As for layer-two solutions, which allow a high number of transactions to take place off-chain and reserve the ethereum ledger for final settlement, Buterin said some are proceeding “slower than expected. Raiden hasn’t gotten too far too fast and Plasma hasn’t gotten too far too fast. But people are still iterating and working on that.”      Buterin also mentioned pressure from businesspeople who discouraged him from speaking openly about these scaling challenges, which, as noted, many felt were obvious.      “You’re not supposed to say your own platform has limitations,” Buterin said.    Top shelf    McAfee arrested John McAfee, the 74-year-old software magnate turned crypto bull, was reportedly arrested in Spain on allegations of tax evasion, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. His extradition to the U.S. is pending. The announcement comes the same day the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued McAfee for allegedly pumping initial coin offerings (ICOs) without disclosing he was being paid to do so. McAfee is said to have received BTC and ETH worth more than $11.6 million for promoting seven ICOs in 2017 and 2018. He also allegedly received $11.5 million in the promoted tokens. The SEC does not name the projects in the suit.      Crypto crackdown The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published final rules banning the sale of derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that reference certain types of crypto assets to retail consumers. The U.K. financial regulator said it considers these products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. Specifically, the ban will affect “the sale, marketing and distribution” to retail investors of any derivatives contract or ETNs that are linked to “unregulated transferable crypto assets” issued by entities in or outside the U.K. The U.K. ban will come into effect on Jan. 6, 2021. Some U.K.-based crypto firms plan to dispute the ruling.      Buck up Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the greenback as a global reserve currency any time soon, according to one of the most highly regarded analysts in foreign exchange. “Backing the dollar is the world’s biggest, deepest and the most transparent government bond market,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of the book “Making Sense of the Dollar,” told CoinDesk in a recent video chat. “I just don’t know how bitcoin can replace the greenback from that viewpoint.” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports, before bitcoin can threaten the dollar’s hegemony, the crypto community’s focus needs to shift from playing for price rallies to building infrastructure that would accelerate adoption at the institutional level.      Ripple suit Ripple was only partially successful in its bid to have a class-action lawsuit over alleged securities fraud thrown out. In a court ruling filed last Friday, District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted with prejudice two parts of Ripple's motion to dismiss the 10 claims against it and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The accusations come as a consolidated action from a group of disgruntled investors who claim Ripple and Garlinghouse failed to register XRP as a security and made misleading statements about the cryptocurrency. Judge Hamilton ruled that some of the plaintiff’s claims were unsupported, though the case was not dismissed.      Going dark Popular privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency wallets and other technologies were named as “top threats” in Europol’s 2020 Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment published Monday. According to a report by the European Union’s law enforcement agency, “privacy-enhanced wallet services using coinjoin concepts (for example, Wasabi and Samurai [sic] wallets) have emerged as a top threat in addition to well established centralized mixers.” And, “Criminals have started to use other privacy-focused, decentralized marketplace platforms, such as OpenBazaar and Particl.io to sell their illegal goods,” the report says. According to the report, bitcoin remains the top currency on the darkweb, though privacy coins are seeing increased use.

42432863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tbh,1602000024,MetaMask Gets Into the Decentralized Exchange Aggregation Business With Token Swaps,"MetaMask announced a new feature Tuesday: token swaps directly within the popular Ethereum browser extension and mobile application.      MetaMask, a wholly owned product of Ethereum software company ConsenSys, is probably the most popular way for users to access the Ethereum blockchain. It functions much like a Bitcoin wallet, while also enabling users to sign in to decentralized applications and use them through a regular browser.      The token-swapping feature will release first on its Firefox browser extension, before adding extensions for other browsers and MetaMask mobile.      MetaMask also announced Monday it had reached 1 million monthly active users.      Jacob Cantele, product lead at MetaMask, wrote in a press release, “We believe bringing greater transparency and efficiency to DeFi on Ethereum will result in a better network experience for all.”      Up to now, to make a swap of tokens, an Ethereum user would need to go to the website of a specific decentralized exchange or exchange aggregator, sign in and run the swap. By building a token-swapping function into MetaMask itself, it should improve the user experience by automatically routing users to a service, cutting out a step.      MetaMask will seek the best exchange rate for any given trade, accessing all the best-known places to conduct an exchange. The MetaMask announcement lists services such as Uniswap, Kyber, ParaSwap, 1inch.exchange and dex.ag.      It should be noted this service really isn't any different than what existing decentralized exchange aggregators (like 1inch or ParaSwap) purport to do, but MetaMask has a big advantage. Odds are, most users of those aggregators already used MetaMask to access them, so if the same users can do the same thing directly in MetaMask, many likely will.      This new service is the latest step in monetizing MetaMask. ""There are dynamic fees that range from 0.3% to 0.875% based on order size,"" James Beck, a ConsenSys spokesperson, told CoinDesk in an email.      In late 2019, MetaMask began monetizing by charging a small fee on fiat to Ethereum exchanges facilitated over the application, according to Beck.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/06/metamask-gets-into-the-decentralized-exchange-aggregation-business-with-token-swaps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b55f6966837387b6ede76b6969954681703a138-2500x1406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At invest: ethereum economy on Oct. 14, we will address the ramifications for investors as decentralized finance takes the crypto world by storm.      In a run-up to the event, our two-part CoinDesk Live: Inside the Ethereum Economy virtual miniseries on Oct. 8 and Oct. 12 introduces trending narratives we will break down at the main event: Why all the hype behind yield farming and food-inspired tokens? Should investors take them seriously or are they a fading trend?    DeGeneration: How Ethereum Is Making Finance Weird    Get a LinkedIn reminder      Decentralized finance (DeFi) has made a pivot to what might be called Weird DeFi: a set of difficult-to-parse projects whose larger value to the ecosystem is suspect at best and whose community is at least 20% driven by inside jokes.      This created a new way to make money in crypto called yield farming. Then Yearn.Finance came along and dropped a smart-contract-governed robo-adviser for yield atop a lot of these projects, one that put users in control.      Imaginations then caught fire, leading to the oddly food-inspired birth of Weird DeFi, with its YAM, Spaghetti, Tendies and a side of Sushi.      CoinDesk senior business reporter Brady Dale hosts Priyanka Desai of Open Law, Mason Nystrom of Messari and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX to assess the newest crazes sweeping the DeFi landscape.    Bitcoin's $1 Billion Crop: Why Hodlers Are Harvesting Yield on Ethereum    Get a LinkedIn reminder      For decentralized finance (DeFi), as in the heady days of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, the numbers are only trending up, with some $2 billion in crypto assets locked into the market.      Crypto users are putting more value to work in DeFi applications, driven largely by the introduction of a whole new yield-generating pasture, Compound’s COMP governance token. Governance tokens are presenting fresh ways for DeFi founders to entice assets onto their platforms.      Whether it’s wBTC, renBTC or tBTC, tokenized bitcoin is the hottest thing on Ethereum right now. A phenomenon that hardly existed at the beginning of this year has pushed the total value locked in bitcoin past $1.3 billion.

The La Jolla, Calif.-based Silvergate Bank has seen a significant adoption of the payments platform, which is open 24/7 to offer fiat on-ramps for the crypto markets. For full-year 2019, the bank saw around $33 billion transacted on the network compared to $76 billion in the first nine months of this year, said Alan Lane, Silvergate’s CEO. (The bank did not track how much these volumes were affected by the average price of bitcoin each year.)      For the first and second quarters of 2020, Silvergate advertised that its activity on the SEN had outpaced the trading in the bitcoin markets. “A dollar going across the SEN was growing at an even faster rate than what we were seeing in terms of the transactions on the bitcoin blockchain,” Lane said.      In general the bank sees more SEN transactions when there is bitcoin volatility, but SEN transactions have increased while volatility has been down because of increased SEN adoption.    DeFi boost    Silvergate has also seen a correlation between SEN transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption as it’s the transactional bank for all of the U.S. regulated stablecoins such as USDC and PAX, Lane added.      The SEN has allowed Silvergate to be one of the few American banks to offer its customers a transaction API. Like whitelisted investors on Ethereum, customers who want to transact on the SEN have to be members of the network, allowing Silvergate to do due diligence screenings like know-your-customer (KYC) checks before offering an API that would automate transactions.

42432869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1thh,1601993700,Downvoted: Security Researchers Slam Voatz Over Stance on White-Hat Hackers,"A pending U.S. Supreme Court case has the potential to fundamentally change white-hat hacking. The case looks at the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and could determine whether good-faith security researchers, also known as white-hat hackers, could be subject to criminal penalties for researching vulnerabilities in systems.      If a broad interpretation of the CFAA is decided on, it would impact not just blockchain technology, exchanges, and crypto, but the field of security research as a whole.      And then blockchain voting company Voatz waded into the discourse.    Van Buren v. the United States    The Supreme Court is currently hearing Van Buren v. United States, in which a former Georgia police officer was convicted under the CFAA for looking up a license plate in a law enforcement database in exchange for money. The charge under the CFAA centered around the law’s definition of what ""exceeds authorized access,"" which is notoriously vague.      The CFAA is an anti-hacking law that went into effect in 1986. If the court sides with a broad interpretation of the law (as the government is arguing for) it could have a chilling effect on important security research, according to experts.      A broad interpretation would allow companies to lay out what “authorized access” means in their terms of service, rather than implementing a technical barrier (like a password) in a system that would alert security researchers when they’ve gone too far.    Enter Voatz    Voatz has repeatedly been the subject of critical security research, which CoinDesk has previously documented. In one instance, MIT students reverse-engineered the Voatz app and found security vulnerabilities. Voatz initially refuted these findings, though some of the issues were later confirmed by Trail of Bits, a security firm hired by Voatz. The company even went so far as to refer the student security researcher to state authorities for alleged “unauthorized activity” under the CFAA.      The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) criticized Voatz by name in a brief filed with the court, as an example of a company that takes an aggressive approach to good-faith security researchers. Voatz also reported a University of Michigan student to the Federal Bureau of Investigation “because the student conducted research into Voatz’s mobile voting app for an undergraduate election security course,” according to the brief.      Voatz has since filed an amicus brief in the Van Buren case (to which it is not a party) making the case for keeping the CFAA’s scope broad. It suggested that white-hat hackers should conduct their investigations into potential vulnerabilities only once they have alerted the company they are evaluating and received its blessing.      Such practices are not common in the security community, though white-hat hackers do alert companies to vulnerabilities if they’re found.    Security researchers clap back    In response to Voatz’s filing, a bevy of security researchers and organizations penned an open letter to publicly correct the record.      The letter was spearheaded by Jack Cable, one of the world’s top ethical hackers. Cable is also an undergraduate at Stanford University “doing incredible work” in the cybersecurity and elections space, according to Reed Loden, Chief Open Source Security Evangelist at HackerOne, a platform that previously cut ties with Voatz, and whose founder was a signatory to the letter. It was the first time HackerOne has removed a company who used it to host a bug-bounty program.      “We wanted to make it clear that Voatz’s position is not supported by the cybersecurity and security researcher community, emphasize that security researchers contribute greatly to the security of our digital society, and underscore that a broad interpretation of the CFAA, which is what Voatz is advocating for, threatens security research activities at a national level,” said Loden in an email.      The letter lays out the ways that Voatz’s filing was allegedly self-serving, and an indicator of how companies like Voatz might use a broad interpretation of the CFAA to further crack down on critical security researchers.      Voatz did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.    The extent of ‘authorized access’    The Center for Democracy and Technology’s (CDT) is one of the signatories to the open letter. Stan Adams, the CDT’s deputy general counsel and Open Internet counsel, broke the case down into two arguments in a phone call with CoinDesk.      According to Adams, if a broad ruling is made on the CFAA, security researchers would likely be discouraged from conducting research for fear of violating the “exceeds authorized access” part of the law.      A broad interpretation would allow companies to lay out what “authorized access” might mean in their terms of service, which can be easily changed and altered, putting security researchers at greater risk.      “Vague laws like the CFAA can kill security research,” said Adams. “The United States government wants access to be able to be limited by things like terms of use and other written expressions of access limitations, rather than what we would prefer, which is some sort of technical barrier.”      The idea is that a researcher, if governed by a technical barrier such as a password or encryption device, would know they’ve reached the limits of their authorized access. Laying out the limits of authorized access in a hard-to-find and even harder-to-read terms of service would leave security researchers guessing and create a chilling effect on research overall, he added.    A chilling effect on fintech and crypto researchers?    The impact on research doesn’t just apply to companies like Voatz, though one would be hard pressed to argue that a company engaging in digital voting doesn’t warrant intense scrutiny.      Tech across the board would be impacted. Matt Hill, CEO of open-source, privacy-tech startup Start9 Labs, said white-hat hacking is key for any kind of tech. Without it, simple software bugs could become systemic infections, ones that could be exploited by malicious actors. The cryptocurrency world has seen such actors empty exchanges and steal people’s cryptocurrencies.      “An honest organization determined to build secure products will encourage white-hat attacks, no matter how bad the results, because that is the only way for their system to become secure,” said Hill.      “An organization trying to sell a lump of clay packaged as security, also known as vaporware, or a scam, will do everything it can to prevent attacks – to maintain the internal delusion and external illusion for as long as possible.”    A white-hat safe harbor    Jason Gottlieb, a partner at Morrison Cohen LLP and Chair, White Collar and Regulatory Enforcement Practice Group, said that in his view, until Congress amends the CFAA to clarify what “unauthorized access” means, the CFAA should be interpreted in a way that provides a safe harbor for white-hat hacking.      To be clear though, he said the hacking must be truly white hat and the burden should lie with the white hats to demonstrate that their intentions were to help rather than harm.      “White-hat hacking is a key component of any data security program implementation, and has been for a very long time,” said Gottlieb. “Given the increasing importance of cybersecurity in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, we should be encouraging transparent white hat hacking as a way to make all systems better.”      Adams confirmed a broad ruling could encourage fintech companies and crypto exchanges to come down hard on white-hat hackers, given “they have strong incentives to not be perceived as flawed.” That being said, he also recognized that companies could also want to be secure, given it’s the public’s money on line at the end of the day.      “Regardless, security by obscurity is not the way forward,” said Adams. “The CFAA is a pretty heavy hammer to wield.”      Update: (October 7, 2020, 18:32 UTC)CEO and co-founder of Voatz, Nimit Sawhney, has responded, stating, ""We’re not advocating to limit anyone’s freedom – we’re saying it’s difficult to distinguish between good and bad faith attacks in the midst of a live election. For everyone’s sake, it’s better to work collaboratively with the organization as bad actors disguise themselves as good actors on a regular basis. All attempts to break into or tamper with an election system during a live election need to be treated as hostile unless prior authorization was specifically granted. Alternately, researchers can use our publicly available test systems which are true replicas of live systems in terms of functionality."" [emphasis his]      Sawhney also clarified that Voatz filed its amicus brief because it was ""falsely cited in previous filings from July 8."" He maintained that that Voatz made no report to the FBI or any other federal authority, and that ""no one who participated in our bug bounty programs has ever been reported or included in any client security bulletins.""      Sawhney also asserted that the University of Michigan student was not a participant in the Voatz bug bounty program; rather that his action was ""a failed attempt to tamper with a live system during an election.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/06/downvoted-security-researchers-slam-voatz-over-stance-on-white-hat-hackers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3a200119867ec46cc3930755a5ce46cc7bfb0a7-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a new analytical note published Monday, the BoC said the users of a central bank token would have a tendency to ""economize"" on security, as they may not bear the full cost of any losses.  The note raised the potential of users to lose the private keys to their addresses, or become victim to hacks or fraud through their own actions or bugs in the code of wallets, exchanges and other services.  These issues are generally not due to the protocols behind digital currencies, which the BoC says are normally ""extremely secure.""  If the central bank sets up liability rules for losses similar to those for cash and bank accounts, CBDC users may be incentivized to comply with stricter security standards.  Even so, it may be hard to enforce such rules as determining responsibility for losses of digital currencies can be ""difficult,"" according to the note.  A solution proposed for further investigation by the BoC would be to limit users to storing their CBDC holdings only at ""approved intermediaries.""  Another challenge to a CBDC issuance raised in the note is that digital currencies are aggregated in anonymous addresses on a large scale, beyond what is possible with cash.  This means there would be ""trade-offs"" between security and convenience that are not a factor in traditional banking, the central bank says.  Further, competition between providers of third party solutions and the use of different security protocols brings the risk that they may not interact securely.  The central bank therefore proposes that limiting user balances and enforcing security protocols on third-party providers could solve these potential problems.

Read More: Bitcoin Unlikely to Replace US Dollar as Global Reserve: Marc Chandler    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's price bounce from Friday's low of $10,380 looks to have stalled, and the cryptocurrency remains trapped in a contracting triangle or a narrowing price range.      Such low-volatility price consolidations often end with a violent move on either side.      Some investors may be anticipating a range breakdown, given the weekly chart MACD histogram has crossed below zero, a sign of a bearish shift in momentum.      The indicator, however, is based on backward-looking moving averages and lags prices. As such, its reliability is under question.      Besides, broader sentiment in the options market is bullish, according to three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls.      Further, on-chain data shows the market is currently witnessing a bigger influx of new investors than it did at the height of the bull market frenzy in late 2017. That is a major bullish sign, according to popular analyst Willy Woo.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin’s Options Market Retains Long-Term Bull Bias Despite Sluggish Price    Token Watch    Wrapped bitcoin (wBTC): Record $616M of wrapped bitcoin minted in September.

42432866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1tjh,1601985131,Bitcoin's Options Market Retains Long-Term Bull Bias Despite Sluggish Price,"Longer-term sentiment in bitcoin's (BTC) options market remains bullish even as the the cryptocurrency struggles to claw its way back to $11,000.    Bitcoin's six-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of put options (bearish bets) expiring in six months relative to calls (bullish bets), is currently seen at close to -11%, according to data source Skew.  In other words, demand for call options expiring in six months is outstripping demand for puts.  The three-month skew is also leaning bullish at -5%.  Since early September, skews for both these time frames have maintained a positive bias despite bitcoin's decline from $12,476 to $10,000 and more recent consolidation.  That consolidation is seeing bitcoin carve out a narrowing price range on the daily chart.  Triangles, or low-volatility price consolidations, usually end with a violent move on either side.  According to the three- and six-month skews, investors appear to be anticipating a breakout.  Prominent analysts like Willy Woo have also suggested the path of least resistance is on the higher side, with on-chain data showing spiking influx of new investors into the bitcoin market.  According to Bannockburn's chief market strategist, Marc Chandler, the U.S. dollar's long-term trend is bearish. As such, bitcoin and other dollar-denominated assets are unlikely to see big sell-offs.  Nevertheless, if the triangle pattern ends with a downside break, chart-driven selling may bring a re-test of September lows below $9,900.  Further, some investors appear to be hedging for a temporary price drop, a suggested by the positive 6.6% reading on the one-month put-call skew.

The U.K. financial regulator said it considers these products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose, asserting they cannot be reliably valued by retail consumers because of the:    Inherent nature of the underlying assets, which means they have no reliable basis for valuation  Prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market (e.g., cyber theft)  Extreme volatility in crypto asset price movements  Inadequate understanding of crypto assets by retail consumers  Lack of legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products.    Specifically, the ban will affect ""the sale, marketing and distribution"" to retail investors of any derivatives contract or ETNs that linked to ""unregulated transferable crypto assets"" issued by entities in or outside the U.K.      The FCA classifies unregulated transferable crypto assets as ""tokens that are not ‘specified investments’ or e-money, and can be traded."" The term incorporates major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and XRP.      The U.K. ban will come into effect on Jan. 6, 2021.      ""This ban reflects how seriously we view the potential harm to retail consumers in these products. Consumer protection is paramount here,"" said Sheldon Mills, interim executive director of Strategy & Competition at the FCA.      Mills said high price volatility and the difficulty of ""reliably"" valuing crypto assets brought high levels of risk for retail investors.      ""We have evidence of this happening on a significant scale,"" he said ""The ban provides an appropriate level of protection.""      The regulator suggested that retail consumers would save around £53 million from the ban on such derivative products.      The announcement comes as the latest setback for traders of crypto derivates, after the BitMEX exchange and its CEO Arthur Hayes were charged by U.S. authorities with allegedly facilitating unregistered trading and other violations.      The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Oct. 1 that the exchange had illegally provided U.S. traders with cryptocurrency derivatives trading, while the Department of Justice charged Hayes and others with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to violate the act.

In a court ruling filed last Friday, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton of the U.S. District Court of Northern California granted with prejudice two parts of Ripple's motion to dismiss the 10 claims against it and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse.  The accusations come as a consolidated action from a group of disgruntled investors who claim Ripple and Garlinghouse failed to register XRP as a security with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and made misleading statements about the cryptocurrency.  In the ruling, Judge Hamilton agreed that lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack had failed to support two claims relating to a series of allegedly fraudulent statements made by Ripple and Garlinghouse in 2017.  As such, Ripple's motion to dismiss the sixth claim over misleading XRP advertisements and a seventh alleging an illegal securities issuance.  However, Judge Hamilton also denied other portions of Ripple's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was amended at the end of February.  These include a fourth claim relating to the allegation that Garlinghouse ""misrepresented the status"" of his XRP investment.  At issue is the CEO's claim to have been ""very, very long XRP as a percentage of my personal balance sheet,"" when in fact he had sold off millions of dollars in the cryptocurrency.  However, Sostack may now proceed with four of the 10 claims only on the basis of Garlinhouse's alleged misrepresentations pertaining to the ""scope and character of his XRP holdings.""

42432851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1pzh,1601974800,Bitcoin Unlikely to Replace US Dollar as Global Reserve: Marc Chandler,"Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the greenback as a global reserve currency any time soon, according to one of the most highly regarded analysts in foreign exchange.      ""Backing the dollar is the world's biggest, deepest and the most transparent government bond market,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of the book ""Making Sense of the Dollar,"" told CoinDesk in a recent video chat. ""I just don't know how bitcoin can replace the greenback from that viewpoint.""      A global reserve currency is the one that facilitates cross-border trade, including investments and international debt obligations. Global central banks hold reserve currencies to help protect against major swings in foreign-exchange rates, as well as in the conduct of monetary policy.      The U.S. dollar has been the primary reserve currency since 1944, and investors tend to park funds in dollar-denominated assets or hold dollars during times of stress in the global economy. For instance, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against a basket of other major fiat currencies, rose from 94.65 to 103.00 in mid-March as global equity markets tanked on coronavirus-induced recession fears.      Some analysts, however, foresee markets losing confidence in the dollar over the next few years. That’s because the Federal Reserve has pumped trillions of dollars of liquidity into the financial system over the past decade and is likely to continue printing money at an elevated pace for some time.      The central bank's balance sheet has expanded from $905 million to over $7 trillion in the past nine years, according to the St. Louis Fed. It has grown by more than $4 trillion in the past five months, as the Fed rolled out emergency liquidity programs to counter the economic toll of the coronavirus, while ramping up monthly asset purchases in a process known as quantitative easing.      ""The U.S. dollar is on the brink of losing its position of world's global reserve as inflation concerns in the U.S. grows,"" Goldman Sachs said in July. While the investment bank speculates that gold could replace the dollar, the crypto community contends that bitcoin, with its deflationary monetary policy, is the best alternative to the dollar.      Bitcoin's pace of supply expansion is reduced by 50% every four years via a process called mining reward halving. At inception, each bitcoin block reward was worth 50 BTC. As of now, per block reward is 6.25 BTC – down from 12.5 BTC prior to May 12. Bitcoin’s tapering supply growth while the Fed has increased dollars is a large reason why many in the crypto markets have long been predicting the dollar's collapse and bitcoin's rise as a global reserve.      However, such predictions often neglect that countries do not just accumulate dollars but also buy U.S. government bonds. ""Central banks don't just hold dollars; they hold U.S. Treasuries. That's what corporations and large institutions do,"" Chandler said.    Why countries buy U.S. Treasury Bonds    As of June 2020, Japan held U.S. Treasury securities worth $1.26 trillion, and China held $1.07 trillion, according to data provider Statista. According to the Federal Reserve and U.S. Department of the Treasury, foreign countries held $7.04 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury securities as of June 2020.      The Chinese and Japanese purchases of Treasury bonds isn't a case of these nations' generosity, as is popularly perceived, but economic math. These nations run substantial current account surpluses (and capital account deficits) and invest their surplus forex reserves in the U.S. government bonds, given it is the deepest in the world. Also, investing in the U.S. Treasury helps Japan and China keep their currencies from appreciating and preserves current account surpluses.      As of Aug. 20, the size of the global sovereigns, supranational and agencies bond market was $87.5 trillion, of which the U.S. accounted for $22.4 trillion and China $19.8 trillion. While China is a close second, its currency, the yuan, has yet to achieve full capital account convertibility and there are transparency concerns regarding Chinese markets.      Put simply, no other bond market has the depth and transparency to absorb billions of dollars of demand other than the U.S. bond market. “No bond market can come close to Treasurys,"" Chandler said.      Meanwhile, no central bank has purchased bitcoin to date. While the institutional participation has increased this year, the cryptocurrency continues to behave like an investment asset rather than a safe haven or a future global reserve. Bitcoin fell during the March crash and has risen strongly over the past six months alongside the U.S dollar's sell-off.      Besides, price volatility is an issue. Bitcoin has moved at an average pace of 16% per month this year, substantially higher than a non-major currency like the Mexican peso, as noted by Chandler.      As such, the idea of bitcoin supplanting the U.S. dollar as the global reserve in the near term looks far-fetched.    Dollar has withered a bigger sell-off in the past    The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell by 10% to a 16-month low of 101.75 in the mid-March to mid-August period. The slide, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to adopt a more flexible approach to controlling inflation, has bolstered fears of the dollar’s collapse as a reserved currency.      However, the dollar has suffered bigger sell-offs in the past and still maintained its reserve status. For instance, the index, which rose sharply from 77 to 89 in the seven months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in August 2008, reversed gains and fell back to 72.70 by May 2011. That’s a nearly 20% decline in 12 months or so.      More important, when the DXY made a low near 72.70 in May 2011, EUR/USD was trading near $1.45, up 23% from the current rate of $1.1750. Meanwhile, GBP/USD was trading above $1.65 – 28% more than the current exchange rate of $1.29. The Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and other major currencies were also trading at significantly higher levels than seen today, as noted by Chandler.      Essentially, the U.S. dollar was aggressively sold on the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programs. Even so, it remained the dominant global reserve currency.      The dollar accounted for more than 60% of the global forex reserves in crisis and recovery years of 2009, 2010 and 2011, according to data source statista.com. The situation hasn’t changed much this year despite the coronavirus crisis. The greenback accounted for 61% of the global currency reserves in the second quarter, as per the International Monetary Fund.      Thus replacing the dollar is easier said than done. Bitcoin has to cover plenty of distance before it can threaten the dollar’s hegemony. For that to happen, the crypto community’s focus needs to shift from playing for price rallies to building infrastructure that would accelerate adoption at the institutional level.      Major central banks like the Fed and the People’s Bank of China are working on digital currencies. Chandler postulates that central bank digital currencies would pave the way for an alternative payment system.    Dollar sell-off likely to continue    The dollar bounced in September, ending a six-month losing trend even though the Fed adopted a more flexible approach to controlling inflation at the end of August.      According to Chandler, the dollar’s bounce has got more to do with technical factors. The currency looked oversold against majors and bullish positioning in EUR/USD had reached extremes in August. As a result, a minor bounce was overdue and was amplified by expectations for more monetary easing by the European Central Bank.      The Fed has created more room for itself to keep interest rates low for a longer period of time by signaling a willingness to tolerate above-target (2%) inflation for some time. As such, the path of least resistance for the dollar is to the downside, unless other central banks follow the Fed’s path.      With the dollar looking weaker, recent uptrends in bitcoin, gold and assets denominated in the greenback could soon resume. However, if Chandler is correct, the dollar is likely to prevail as the global reserve.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/06/bitcoin-unlikely-to-replace-us-dollar-as-global-reserve-marc-chandler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c168a6106a9590965fa8a45665798fcdcba673a6-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
