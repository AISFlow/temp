Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was so flat that crypto analysts had little to discuss besides the largest cryptocurrency's ultra-low volatility.  Insights: Solana faces a major challenge in convincing people to use its mobile phone.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Bitcoin (BTC) was holding steady around $19,000 – and analysts were remarking on just how much the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency's price has settled down. At least one technical indicator suggest that bitcoin might be undervalued, but the macroeconomic environment is still so sketchy that investors might not want to hop in just yet.  It's probably not a good sign that an asset considered one of the world's safest - the U.S. Treasury bond – is suddenly looking shaky. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 4.2%, a level not seen since 2008. Liquidity for the triple-A-rated government bonds has ""deteriorated amidst weak demand and investor risk aversion,"" Bank of America analysts warned in a research report. ""The U.S. Treasury market is fragile and vulnerable to shock.""  Axie Infinity, the ""play-to-earn"" crypto gaming platform that's already a big loser in digital-asset markets this year, faces additional selling pressure as a big ""unlock"" looms for millions of the native AXS tokens. The concern is that early investors who have been restricted from selling because of vesting periods might now choose to dump the token.

Anatoly Yakovenko seems to think so.  In June Solana announced that it is launching a Web3 phone, called the “Saga.” Yesterday at the TechCrunch Disrupt summit, Yakovenko was calling this an “opportunity” against Google and Apple, and a way for developers to bypass the “tax” these companies put on the sales via the app store.  “They’re built around a rent-seeking model where all the content is owned by the creator and you as a user rent it. When you buy a video from Amazon, you don’t actually own it; everyone realizes that you don’t own it,” TechCrunch quotes Yakovenko as saying. “I don’t know what’s going to have to change internally for them to give up the 30% tax on apps.”  Yakovenko’s solution is the Saga, which comes loaded with the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) software development kit for Web3.  The SMS is, according to Solana, a “framework for Android allowing developers to create rich mobile experiences for wallets and apps on Solana.”  The operative word here is Android, the operating system that powers around 70% of the mobile phones in existence. Anything that Solana develops you could simply install on your existing Android phone, too.  The Saga phone isn’t all that proprietary in the first place. Solana didn’t specifically develop it; rather, it has contracted Osom, made up of former smartphone engineers from Google and another boutique smartphone maker called Essential, to rebrand one of their phones and call it the Saga. In turn, Osom used an original design manufacturer – which builds white-label phones and allows others to brand them – to manufacture the handset. This practice isn’t controversial but is is common as only a handful of companies have the capability to mass produce a smartphone.  In some ways, the failed blockchain phones of yesteryear were more proprietary than Solana’s Saga. HTC’s crypto-themed Exodus 1 phone allowed users to store their private crypto keys in a walled garden of the phone’s processor, called the Trust Zone, which is where other encryption keys and biometric data are stored. Samsung also does this now via its Knox encryption app and made it first available on the Galaxy S10 in 2019. HTC’s Exodus has faded into obscurity, and no market data is available on how many people use the Galaxy’s Knox function.  So for Solana, it's going to be a major challenge to convince people to buy its phone to do things you can already do on existing phones. There are already alternative app stores that don’t have the “30% tax” Yakovenko complains about – but they don’t have the library of apps.  Maybe the market for the phone is not builders and power users but rather those who want to be a part of the tribe, showing off their status symbol of inclusion.

Today’s drama came from Axie Infinity, the “play-to-earn” gaming platform that has mostly been a disappointment this year. The platform’s once-hot AXS tokens fell 8%, one of day’s worst performers among digital assets, after a CoinDesk report that millions of the tokens are due to be unlocked – meaning that early investors who have been restricted from selling because of vesting periods might now choose to dump the token.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was relatively flat, down 0.6% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks rallied after better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings reports.  Investors across the board remain cautious, with the Federal Reserve’s next monetary-policy meeting less than two weeks away and steep interest-rate hikes expected.  “Bitcoin has been stuck in a consolidation pattern,” Edward Moya, senior markets analyst at Oanda, wrote in a daily update. “Seems like it will continue until investors can confidently believe the Fed will stop hiking.”  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 925.80 −1.3%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,043 −0.7%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,284 −0.7%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,665.78 −0.8%        ● Gold: $1,632 per troy ounce +0.3%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.23% +0.1        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  A bitcoin market indicator is signaling the asset is undervalued  Bitcoin is as undervalued as it has been since 2020, based on a key indicator that relies on data extracted from the blockchain.  The “MVRV Z-Score” is an analytical tool used to assess whether bitcoin (BTC) is looking cheap or expensive on a relative historical basis.  The metric measures the difference between an asset’s market capitalization – the number of tokens outstanding times the spot price – and its “realized cap” – the number of tokens times the price at which the bitcoin last moved over the blockchain.  That difference is then divided by the standard deviation of the asset’s market cap. Similar to other technical indicators, it theoretically highlights areas where an asset is overvalued or undervalued.

According to the federal regulator’s annual enforcement report published Thursday, the CFTC celebrated several of its big wins from the fiscal year, including filing charges against Tether and Bitfinex, which settled for a combined $42.5 million last October.  The CFTC’s report also highlights some of its other high-profile actions, many of which have not yet been resolved, including charges against decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange Digitex, which it has accused of operating an illegal futures market, and against anonymous members of Ooki DAO, who have been accused of offering illegal, off-exchange tokenized margin trading and lending services.

I personally thank the Enforcement Division’s hardworking and dedicated leadership team and staff,” he said.  Behnam has boasted that his agency – over the past decade – has brought in about $1.5 billion a year in fines from its enforcement actions, which he said was a pretty good ""return on investment"" for an average budget of about $240 million.

42393881,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbT1B,1666296189,"Bitcoin Undervalued by On-Chain Metric, Might Remain That Way: Technical Take","Bitcoin is as undervalued as it has been since 2020, based on a key indicator that relies on data extracted from the blockchain.  The “MVRV Z-Score” is an analytical tool used to assess whether bitcoin (BTC) is looking cheap or expensive on a relative historical basis.  The metric measures the difference between an asset’s market capitalization – the number of tokens outstanding times the spot price – and its “realized cap” – the number of tokens times the price at which the bitcoin last moved over the blockchain.  That difference is then divided by the standard deviation of the asset’s market cap. Similar to other technical indicators, it theoretically highlights areas where an asset is overvalued or undervalued.  If the past is a guide  Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-score now shows the cryptocurrency has been trading at historically undervalued levels since June. The last time BTC’s MVRV Z-Score reached this level was in March 2020. BTC price ultimately increased from $5,200 to $60,000 in February 2021, when the Z-Score indicated that it was overbought, or trading at a level above its intrinsic or fair value.  A similar thing occurred between November 2018 and April 2019, when bitcoin remained undervalued, and the price subsequently rose from $4,200 to $13,000 over the next two months.  One consideration when applying the analysis is just how different the current economic climate is from some of these prior undervalued periods. During the quarters from March 2020 to February 2021, U.S. GDP growth averaged 2.2%, even though the stretch was pocked by the deep dislocations of the on-again, off-again coronavirus pandemic-racked economy. The outliers of a 30% contraction and 35% expansion were clearly driven by the COVID-19 shutdowns.  Now, the economy experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. The consensus of forecasts is for positive 2% GDP growth in the third quarter – a report scheduled for release next week.  The comparison of past GDP to periods of BTC being undervalued is pertinent in determining whether prior increases in BTC are realistic in this economic environment.  The current level of U.S. government bond yield curves should be taken into consideration as well. Where the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasurys was positive during 2018 and 2019, it is substantially negative now and has been since July.  The yield-curve inversion, essentially implying that short-term debt is riskier than longer-term debt, has been a precursor for prior economic recessions.  Despite BTC’s MVRV Z-score indicating the asset is undervalued, macroeconomic overhangs indicate that it may stay this way for longer than in the past.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/20/bitcoin-undervalued-by-on-chain-metric-might-remain-that-way-technical-take,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edc48684762264ff8c01b31e3fb6cbf7b469f448-6016x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s data showed that bitcoin’s 30-day price volatility was at 31%, the lowest in almost two years.  At press time bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $19,000, little changed over the previous 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index rose 0.07%. Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory to BTC, down 0.8% to $1,280 as of press time.  The listlessness offered a contrast with U.S. stocks, which rallied after better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings reports. A drop in weekly jobless claims suggested a continued strong labor market.  “The crypto market has become less responsive to macroeconomic problems,” said Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of crypto exchange EXMO.  Bitcoin’s price has come under stiff pressure this year from Federal Reserve interest rate increases, which have buffeted prices for risky assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Investors across the board remain cautious, with Fed’s next monetary-policy meeting less than two weeks away.  “The bottom line here is that markets still do not have a solid handle on when the current rate cycle will end,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a Thursday note. “As long as that is the case, it is hard to see U.S./global equities staging a convincing rally.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/20/bitcoin-flat-as-volatility-hits-2-year-low-and-stocks-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92843c66062804cfb07f71f101dc284fe4749065-3130x2075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394181,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3Kh,1666290125,"In Defense of Aptos, Crypto's Punchline This Week","Aptos, the much-anticipated blockchain built by Silicon Valley wunderkinds, has become this week’s punchline in crypto. The project ain’t apt, people said following its rocky (and much criticized) debut Monday.  Its token, APT, dropped about 50% in its first 24 hours of trading and the crypto network that boasts a potential transaction count of 100,000 had only four per second at first. The project, which was valued at $2 billion in prelaunch private investment rounds, has a $959 million market cap as of this writing. Do you laugh or do you cringe at those data points? I guess it depends on the size of your bag.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In speaking to a few industry participants this week at CoinDesk’s first-ever I.D.E.A.S conference, I got the sense that people were rooting for the project’s failure. While Aptos may offer a few technological innovations worth putting to market, it also represents the insider-first approach to crypto development that’s anathema to crypto’s ideals.  See also: Not Everyone Can Afford to Be Satoshi | Opinion  Facebook roots  Aptos’ core team are primarily transplants from Facebook parent Meta Platforms’ failed Libra/Diem project, which itself was a controversy when first announced in late 2019. Libra, too, had a novel approach to crypto adoption: a stablecoin backed by cryptos, fiats and other assets that could have become a global reserve currency by leveraging Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram vast user bases. Meta owns those three social-media platforms.  Libra acquiesced to regulators’ demands immediately, and eventually, the original vision was so mangled that it become unrecognizable. In retrospect, Zuckbucks was dead on arrival because of people’s learned distrust of Meta after years of privacy abuses and other crimes against humanity.  But Facebook invested heavily in the project, and it developed interesting blockchain scaling products and a new programming language called Move. So when Aptos was announced, people got excited that something could be built without all of Diem’s baggage. After a launch that even co-founder Mo Shaikh admitted “could have gone better,” Aptos seems to have picked up some of crypto’s worst traits.  Cobie, a semi-pseudonymous market commentator who is something of crypto’s moral conscience, had serious apprehensions that basic facts about Aptos tokenization scheme – like the token supply and initial distribution – weren’t revealed before the APT token was listed on exchanges such as Binance, FTX and Coinbase.  Releasing those figures – less than a day before the token was available to trade – didn’t quell controversy. According to its blog post, 49% of Aptos’ 1 billion initial token supply will be going straight to “core contributors, investors and the foundation.”  Slightly more tokens are reserved for the “community,” and will presumably be granted to people willing to build apps and protocols on the blockchain. “Community” here, however, may be poorly defined: “a majority” (~41%) of APT will be disbursed to the Aptos Foundation and a “smaller portion” (10%) going to Aptos Labs, the blog states.  Insiders agreed to a one-year token lockup, meant to prevent venture capitalists and major holders from dumping on retail. About half of the total supply of those tokens, however, can also be staked to earn up to 7% in token rewards per day, and those emissions aren’t subject to the lockup (meaning they can be dumped).  See also: Is Crypto a Ponzi? Define 'Ponzi' | Opinion  It also appears that insiders were able to start staking on Oct. 12, five days before the mainnet launch. AkadoSang, a pseudonymous crypto analyst, called the scheme ""a sneaky way to get liquidity since backers usually hold [a] great deal of supply."" (FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto co-led a $150 million investment in July, and Coinbase and Binance both had “strategic investment rounds” in March and September, respectively.)  A quick defense  Despite all of the red flags here, I want to mount a quick defense of Aptos if only for the sake of balance. First, judging a just-launched blockchain for having dismal transactions-per-second counts seems like a low blow – nothing yet is built that anyone could transact with.  Second, Aptos’ tokenization scheme, far from being a fair launch, is in line with competitors like Solana, Near and Flow – all of which have since put their “community”-directed tokens to good work funding grants.  Lastly, while Coinbase and Binance’s “strategic” investments look shady, they seem to have just been buying tokens early so that people have something to exchange at or near launch. Aptos was highly anticipated, and they wanted to get into the market because traders wanted to get into the market.  None of this addresses a separate, important question of whether the world needs another layer 1 blockchain. Right now, every blockchain basically has spare capacity and block space – even Ethereum is cheap to use again. And in the last bull market, we saw most “scalable” blockchain, like Solana, run into processing issues because of scale – who knows if Aptos found the right solution there.  I’ll leave you with some words by gigabrain Haseeb Qureshi, who invested in Aptos through his venture fund Dragonfly Capital:  “Investing into a new Layer 1 is really about… building a more scalable operating system for blockchains. We're still at the beginning of this journey, right? Smart contract blockchains have existed since Ethereum, about seven years ago and we're clearly not done. These systems are so primitive, and we're learning so much in real time about how to make them faster and perform better.  See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Winter | Opinion  “I remember back when I first became a VC, people used to argue whether proof-of-stake was even possible,” Qureshi continues. “Now we’re in a world where the second largest blockchain has completed a transition to proof-of-stake. We've learned so many things about what's possible with respect to pipelining transactions, parallel execution of generalized computation – with what Solana has done, what NEAR has done, what Polygon and Avalanche have done right.  “A big part of the reason why we were excited to back Aptos is pretty clear: It's another step in blockchain evolution. Now, that doesn't mean that I know for certain that Aptos is [going to] win. But I can tell that what these guys are doing is important.”  UPDATE (OCT. 21, 2022 – 14:20 UTC): Corrects Jump Crypto's name.",NEGATIVE,APT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | APT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/20/in-defense-of-aptos-cryptos-punchline-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e35b9f35941bdc63edb232d6e6caec7dfcd1ea05-2048x1360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is Transforming the Original ‘Lord of the Rings’ Movie Into a Web3 Experience,"The “Lord of the Rings” film franchise is moving on-chain with the launch of a new Web3 movie experience.  Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, the production company behind the fantasy film series, is releasing a non-fungible token (NFT) collection tied to the original “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” movie. The interactive experience is currently available to preview and will be open for purchase beginning on Oct. 21.  In partnership with Eluvio, a utility-focused blockchain aimed at enabling the internet for video, the launch will encompass two NFT tiers – the “Premiere Mystery Edition,” which has 10,000 collectibles priced at $30 each, and the “Premier Epic Edition,” which has 999 collectibles priced at $100 each. Each NFT allows collectors to watch an extended version of the film, access special features and discover augmented reality (AR) collectibles.  This is the first drop on the new WB “Movieverse” marketplace and is a part of Warner Bros.’ larger effort to tokenize major motion pictures in its archives.  “This initiative has important implications as a potential new way to handle movie distribution directly to fans; engage those fans through communities and tradable marketplaces; and demonstrate the practical utility of Web3 and NFTs,” Jessica Schell, executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, told CoinDesk.  While Web3-native entertainment has been on the rise in projects such as Mila Kunis’ “The Gimmicks” or Kevin Smith’s upcoming film on the “Secret Network,” Warner Bros.’ latest initiative may re-engage a community of fans through new Web3 technologies. The entertainment company also recently partnered with pop culture retail brand Funko to offer a physical and digital comic book collectible.

The company's policy change is effective immediately.  “Users usually have to pay fees in the process of converting their local currency into USDC, and this is a barrier to broader international adoption,” the post read. “The way to correct this, and accelerate adoption of USDC internationally, is by establishing global parity for all users.”  Coinbase’s decision to promote USDC (which it issues as a co-founder of the Centre Consortium) comes at a time when inflation is on the rise globally, with consumers in rich countries and poor feeling the heat of rising prices. That has prompted some to move their volatile fiat currencies into stablecoins such as USDC, which is pegged in value to the U.S. dollar.

Given that the bear market has not been long in the making, it stands to reason that the bull market isn&apos;t here just yet. However, being able to pinpoint when the cryptocurrency has reached as low as it will go can help make smart investment choices and the previous bear trends can shine a light to how it might play out. Previous Bitcoin Bear Markets The most recent bitcoin bear markets point towards some important trends that may occur before a bitcoin bottom is established. The 2018 bear market and 2014 bear runs helped to shine a light on what to keep an eye on as the crypto winter rages on. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Ranges Just Above $8, Is It Time To Dump Those Airdrop Tokens? One of the very first things to look at is how long the previous bear markets had actually lasted.

Given this, it is possible to expect that the duration before the market bottom might be lower this time around but it also shows that the market is likely not there yet.

Notably, the platform has announced it is transitioning into an aggregated NFT marketplace, pulling Ethereum NFT listings from competitors like OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Sudoswap. The change will allow users to find the best price for an NFT listed in multiple locations before deciding to purchase, with no additional fees from Rarible.  The platform has also launched a new feature that allows users to add multiple NFTs to a ""shopping bag,"" which will allow them to purchase several digital assets in a single transaction, thereby minimizing associated transaction fees.  In addition, Rarible 2 offers new updates to the distribution of the RARI, the RARI DAO's governance token, and establishes the independent RARI Foundation, which is fully controlled and operated by RARI holders.  Read more: Rarible NFT Marketplace: How to Get Started  As part of this shift, the RARI DAO has also introduced RARI locking, which allows users to send RARI to a ""token-locking contract"" in exchange for rewards. This means that token holders can lock up their tokens and receive veRARI (vote-escrowed RARI tokens) to be used for voting rights and exclusive perks.  As an added bonus, a portion of RARI tokens will be retroactively airdropped to users that purchased more than three NFTs from both OpenSea and Rarible's order book on Rarible.com from July 1 to Sept. 30.

42415359,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJVb,1666282748,Bitcoin Miner Sphere3D Downsizes Deal for Machines With BitFuFu,"Bitcoin miner Sphere 3D (ANY) has downsized its purchase of mining machines from BitFuFu, the latest in a series of moves in an industry where companies are struggling to keep their balance sheets healthy.  Bitcoin miners have had a rough ride in recent months amid falling crypto prices and soaring energy costs. Many have started selling off assets such as mining machines and restructuring their debt. September had the first Chapter 11 bankruptcy from a major mining firm, Compute North.  Under the restructured deal, Sphere 3D has applied the $106.9 million in deposits it has already paid to BitFuFu to date toward receiving 1.7 exahash/second (EH/s) of machines in the near future, and is relieved of the obligation to buy another 3.9 EH/s of machines, according to a Thursday press release.  The original agreement, signed in September 2021, called for Sphere 3D to buy 60,000 Bitmain Antminer S19j Pros. Since then, however, the prices of mining machines have dropped by more than 70%, data compiled by mining services firm Luxor shows.  ""The contract with BitFuFu was signed in late 2021 at the height of the bitcoin market as a fixed price contract with no allowances for market price adjustments,"" and it was ""critical"" that the firm was extricated from the contract, said Patricia Trompeter, Sphere 3D's CEO, in the press release.  The delivery of the machines has been ""repeatedly delayed"" due to BitFuFu's operational issues, Sphere 3D said on Thursday. The restructuring accelerates the delivery timeline, with machines now set to be delivered in November and installed in December.  Sphere 3D stock was up around 5% on the Nasdaq on Thursday following the news.  Several large miners have recently renegotiated their contracts for mining rigs, including Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Core Scientific (CORZ).

42415367,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJhw,1666282396,Crypto Gaming Token AXS Under Pressure as $215M Unlock Looms for Axie,"Axie Infinity, which experienced a meteoric rise in popularity last year as one of the first crypto-focused computer games, could face significant selling pressure as $215 million worth of the project’s AXS tokens are unlocked in the coming days.  Players earn Axie’s in-game cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, which they can sell, trade or use to level up their characters.  Some 21.5 million tokens, almost 8% of the total supply, will be freed up when the vesting period expires Oct. 24, according to data site TokenUnlocks. Aleksander Larsen, chief operating officer of Axie developer Sky Mavis, told CoinDesk the unlock schedule is based on transaction block numbers, which he projected to take place on Oct 26.  A vesting period is when early investors and insiders are required to hold their investments for a minimum period of time, partly so they can’t cash out just as new investors arrive. When the vesting period expires, holdings become unlocked and investors can sell. In digital asset markets, the token’s price can sometimes face steep selling pressure during such times.  According to TokenUnlocks, almost half of the soon-to-be-unlocked AXS tokens will be directed to members of the developer team ($57 million), advisers ($25 million) and early investors in a private sale round ($20 million). These holders, in theory, may decide to realize profits and sell tokens.  The other half, some 11 million tokens, are dedicated towards future staking rewards, play-to-earn rewards and ecosystem funds, TokenUnlock shows. These tokens will not be issued to circulation immediately, according to Larsen.  Sky Mavis, the blockchain gaming studio that developed Axie, “recently staked 11 million AXS and will stake our upcoming token unlock as well,” Larsen told CoinDesk.  Selling pressure on AXS  The AXS price has dropped following prior unlocking dates, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain pointed out in a tweet.  Axie Infinity sold 10.5 million tokens to raise $864,000 in a private token sale in the middle of 2020, according to the project’s white paper. That math works out to an average price of 8 cents per token. AXS was trading at around $10 at the time of writing, so those who invested in the private offering are ostensibly sitting on hefty paper profits.  “Even if investors in the private sale dump AXS at $10, they're still making 125x. So selling after unlocking is very likely to happen,” Lookonchain said.  The list of investors in the private sale include crypto investment firms Arca, DeFiance Capital, Delphi Digital, Hashed and now-insolvent Three Arrows Capital, according to a press release by Axie at the time.  Prices skyrocketed on the game’s native token, AXS, rising 42-fold over just five months to as high as $169 in November, according to crypto price tracker CoinGecko.  The project’s popularity proved to be fleeting. The majority of players abandoned the game and in-game transactions cratered since then, data by DappRadar shows.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Stablecoin issuer Tether will make tether (USDT) available at 24,000 ATMs in Brazil starting Nov. 3, the firm said Thursday.  Tether will enable the conversion of USDT to Brazilian reals through an agreement with Brazilian crypto services provider SmartPay, which is integrated with TecBan, a local company that owns 24,000 ATMs under the brand name of Banco24Horas.  Users will be able to send USDT from any wallet – including exchanges – to an ATM, SmartPay CEO Rocelo Lopes told CoinDesk. Beginning in February, the company will allow users to deposit Brazilian reals at ATMs and receive USDT in their wallets.  “Adding tether tokens to ATMs across Brazil provides the opportunity to include more people in the financial system,” said Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino. “This will bring major changes not only to the payments industry but to the entire Brazilian financial ecosystem.”  Brazilians transacted 1.4 billion USDT in August across 79,836 operations, according to Tether.  In May, Tether launched its MXNT token pegged to Mexico’s peso as a “testing ground” in Latin America, the firm said at that time, adding that the initiative was intended to “pave the way” for more fiat-pegged tokens in the region.

Based on Chainalysis' global index score, crypto adoption slowed in the first two quarters of 2022 compared with the highs of the second and fourth quarters of 2021. Adoption remained higher, however, than the pre-bull market levels up to and including the first quarter of 2021.  Chainalysis' ""2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency"" report also found that 18 of the 20 countries where crypto adoption was at its highest were low- to middle-income countries, where cryptocurrency is used for sending remittances and protecting savings against high inflation.  By contrast, decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption is most prevalent in North America and Western Europe, where it accounted for 37% and 31%, respectively, of all crypto transaction volume.  This points to a trend where bitcoin is used as a primary entry point into crypto with people in low- and middle-income countries relying on it for basic day-to-day finances. Meanwhile, in more developed economies, DeFi is gathering speed both as a means of more sophisticated financial transacting and as an investment opportunity.

42394179,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3AR,1666278789,Nike’s Venture into Web3 Isn’t About Tech – It’s About Culture,"Nike is making waves in Web3 and the metaverse.  In November 2021, the athleisure icon unveiled a virtual experience in the online gaming platform Roblox. Since then the space – dubbed Nikeland – has attracted 6.7 million global visitors and over 21.6 million total visits. It’s not quite Vans’ 82 million visits, but Nike CEO John Donahue deemed the campaign successful enough to extend “the positive momentum and energy'' as part of the company’s digital strategy.  Jake Stott is the co-founder and CEO of Hype, a Web3 agency.  In December 2021, The Swoosh took a deep dive into Web3, acquiring non-fungible token (NFT) studio RTFKT. On the back of its new purchase, Nike launched a series of NFT drops in the following months, starting with its Cryptokicks – a collection of 20,000 sneaker NFTs, including one designed by artist Takashi Murakami that sold for an eye-watering $134,000. The company has since also toyed around with exclusive drops for NFT holders and other phygital (physical plus digital) items.  By the numbers  Nike’s Web3 play has paid off – big time.  Data shows The Swoosh has raked in almost $185 million in NFT sales revenue, lording over names including Adidas, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Tiffany & Co., which have collectively generated less than half of that revenue.  But this all comes with a massive asterisk.  Nike hasn’t disclosed the terms of the RTFKT acquisition, and its latest earnings call hasn’t offered any clarity into the operational costs of its Web3 venture. It’s impossible to say how much of a financial success – or failure – these campaigns have been. For reference, Nike’s projected annual revenue for 2022 is $46.7 billion.  See also: Can Starbucks Bring Web3 Into the Mainstream? | Opinion  One thing is for sure, though: Nike has quickly clinched a spot as one of the most beloved brands in the nascent Web3 space.  The numbers don’t lie, either. RTFKT’s Discord server currently boasts just under 232,000 members. By contrast, Adidas sits at almost 57,000 at the time of writing. Web3 natives like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club (both owned by Yuga Labs) are also trailing behind, with 71,000 and 172,000, respectively.  For the culture  Crypto Twitter has praised Nike for its community-building savvy. But more than a successful case study in community building, Nike’s Web3 move is a perfect example of tapping into emerging cultures to reach new audiences and get ahead of the competition.  Culture has been at the core of Nike’s strategy throughout the years. Branching out from sports performance, the brand has secured its status as a cultural icon in sports, music, lifestyle and art. It’s no surprise it’s taking the same approach in the budding Web3 and metaverse spaces.  In an earnings call in 2019, Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings dropped a poignant one-liner: “We compete (and lose to) Fortnite [an online video game] more than HBO,” he said. “I think of it as us winning time away – entertainment time – from other activities.”  See also: Reversibility on Ethereum: The Benefits and Pitfalls | Opinion  The race, in Hastings’ view, wasn’t the so-called streaming wars. As strong as Disney’s catalog was, he understood the real battle was for people’s attention – a big chunk of which was going to YouTube and gaming behemoths like Fortnite.  It seems Nike has had a similar realization about Web3 and the metaverse. The Swoosh isn’t simply in a sales contest with Adidas, Under Armour and other apparel giants. It’s fighting for cultural relevance with challenger esports brands and upcoming digital fashion houses, many of which are gaining momentum with Gen Z and gaming circles.  Although still far from Fortnite-tier mainstream penetration, digital fashion brands and gaming orgs have carved out a niche for themselves in internet culture and the digital economy, hawking skins, wearables and collectibles. Capitalizing on their mainstream popularity, some have even expanded into physical merchandise. The same is true for Web3 favorite Yuga Labs, which was recently valued at $4 billion.  FaZe Clan expected revenue of $50 million in 2021. This pales in comparison with Nike’s $12.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023 – and the sports giant wants to keep it this way.  By the time Netflix realized it was in a race with Fortnite, the contest had already heated up out of its control. The Swoosh doesn’t seem too keen on making the same mistake. Instead, Nike has embedded itself into the fabric of Web3 culture before the competition has even taken off.  That’s the brilliance of its Web3 play. Unlike other traditional brands looking at Web3 as a new technology, Nike has figured out that technology is only one facet of something much bigger: a new cultural movement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Jake Stott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/20/nikes-venture-into-web3-isnt-about-tech-its-about-culture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d58aa19e21e85a17cb1a44627b03074fa629f691-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S.-based Edge DeFi Fund LP has raised about $28 million from eight investors since sales opened on Feb. 1 of this year, according to the filing. The firm plans for the offering to last for more than one year for the fund. The other Cayman Islands-based Edge DeFi Offshore Fund has sold about $38.6 million to six investors since opening for sales at the start of October 2021.  The firm is likely planning to raise further for both funds as it didn’t set any limits for their targeted raise, according to the SEC filings.  Venture capital (VC) investments in crypto fell 26% year over year in the first half of 2022 as the bear market emerged. However, the number of deal sizes remained stable, suggesting smaller but steady investments are still being made amid the crypto winter. The shift also opened the door for smaller VCs and other investment firms to find their footing.  Read more: Crypto VC Investments Drop 26% in First Half of 2022  Edge Capital has a very small online presence through its website and lacks Ta witter presence. The firm plans to seek opportunities in digital assets, blockchain and DeFi, using macro-style investing, according to its website. Macro-investing refers to strategies that aim to profit from broader market swings caused by economic or political events. Edge Capital didn’t respond to requests for comments about the raises.  The firm was founded in early 2020 by Vadim Khramov and headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, according to LinkedIn and SEC filings. While Khramov refers to the firm as a hedge fund, the SEC filings don’t have that box checked, instead indicating “other” for the type of investment fund. Prior to Edge Capital, Khramov was active at various TradFi firms, including a macro hedge fund and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, according to his LinkedIn profile.  A February job listing for a DeFi analyst said Edge was interested in DeFi protocols that can deliver high returns in yield farming and macro strategies.  Khramov is the only executive or director listed in the U.S.-based DeFi fund.

42415357,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJSr,1666274438,"Stablecoins Could ‘Fundamentally Alter’ Banking System, Says US FDIC Chief","Stablecoins could have such a profound effect on the established banking system that U.S. regulators need to require the digital tokens fit in without disrupting it, said Martin Gruenberg, the acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), at a Brookings Institution event on Thursday.  Gruenberg’s agency is among the U.S. banking watchdogs that will have significant influence over how stablecoins are regulated. The FDIC has also had to weigh in with recent sanctions against firms – such as FTX US – that have made claims misrepresenting how FDIC deposit insurance backstops their operations.  As U.S. banks have increasingly sought to offer crypto services, including maintaining custody of customers' digital assets, Gruenberg said his agency has been cautious about allowing regulated lenders to engage.  The FDIC has also had some say over the federal government’s initial approach to stablecoins, which Gruenberg said will need to work in tandem with the Federal Reserve’s future FedNow real-time payments system set to launch next year. Stablecoins – tokens tied to steady assets such as the dollar that are used to trade in and out of more volatile cryptocurrencies – also need to complement “the potential future development” of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said.  “The development of a payment stablecoin could fundamentally alter the landscape of banking,” Gruenberg said. Payment stablecoins could change how credit is extended within banking, “possibly leading to forms of credit disintermediation that could harm the viability of many U.S. banks and potentially create a foundation for a new type of shadow banking.”  Gruenberg, who has been FDIC chairman in the past, is currently holding the seat on an interim basis because President Joe Biden hasn't named a permanent replacement. The White House last month nominated two people to join the board and is reportedly poised to also pick the next chairman. While he's there, Gruenberg has a role in cross-agency efforts, such as at the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to deal with crypto oversight. But he's been openly suspicious of crypto's usefulness.  ""Thus far we haven't seen much evidence of benefit,"" he said Thursday, arguing that the industry has been focused primarily on trading. ""It remains to be demonstrated whether there's some potential there.""  To deal with stablecoins, he said Congress likely needs to intervene with new laws because “there are clear limits to our authority, especially in certain areas of consumer protection as well as the provision of wallets and other related services by non-bank entities.”  Gruenberg offered three ways to make stablecoins sufficiently safe, in his view: Have them offered through bank subsidiaries, insist they be fully backed by short-term Treasury bonds and put them on ""permissioned ledger systems"" that comply with regulations.  ""The ability to know all the parties – including nodes and validators – that are engaging in payment stablecoin activities is critical to ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regulations, and deterring sanction evasion.""

42415351,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJKd,1666273391,Hodlonaut Wins Norwegian Lawsuit Against Self-Proclaimed ‘Satoshi’ Craig Wright,"Magnus Granath, known on Twitter as “Hodlonaut,” won a lawsuit against Craig Wright on Thursday, a judge in Norway ruled.  Granath sued Wright in Norway to try and preempt a defamation suit Wright planned to bring against Granath in the U.K., where defamation laws are heavily tipped in favor of the plaintiff and monetary damages can be enormous.  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out  At the center of both cases is a series of tweets, written by Granath in March 2019, in which he called Wright – who has long claimed and failed to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin – a “fraud” and a “scammer.” Granath asked the Norwegian court to rule that his tweets were protected by the freedom of speech, therefore preventing Wright from pursuing damages in relation to the tweets.  “The result was as expected,” Granath told CoinDesk. “I am very happy and thankful for all the support.”  Wright’s attorneys told CoinDesk he would appeal the ruling and warned that “anonymous online bullying” could have a “chilling effect” on public discourse.  Read the full ruling here.  Oslo trial  After a weekslong trial in Oslo in September, District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen found in favor of Granath, ordering him acquitted of all claims for compensation and not liable for damages relating to the tweets.  Wright has also been ordered to pay Granath’s legal fees in the amount of NOK 4,053,750 (approximately $383,000).  Judge Engebrigtsen ruled that Granath’s use of words such as “fraud” and “scammer” to describe Wright were fair.  “The court believes that ‘fraud’/’fraudulently’ in this context means “one who is something other than what he claims to be.’ ‘Fake’ has a similar meaning: ‘illegitimate,’ ‘false,’ ‘something other than what he pretends to be,” Engebrigtsen wrote. “‘Scammer’ must be understood the same way, in the sense of ‘swindler’ or ‘cheater.’”  Granath’s lawyer, Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, appeared positive about the outcome, though he said he would review it further.  “We note that the court has agreed with our arguments and our client’s position in the case, and we are of course happy with that,” Haukaas said in an emailed statement.  Flimsy evidence  Judge Engebrigtsen wrote that the evidence presented by Wright’s lawyers was “not suitable to change [the court’s] prevailing opinion that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.”  Read more: Craig Wright Won’t Give Cryptographic Proof He’s Satoshi, His Lawyers Say at Hodlonaut Trial  Wright’s lack of evidence that he is Satoshi has been an issue in his other trials, including a recent defamation case he brought against podcaster Peter McCormack in the U.K.. A judge found Wright to have submitted false evidence and awarded him a single pound in damages.  Forensic analysts hired by Granath pored over documents previously supplied by Wright which purported to prove he had been the author of the Bitcoin white paper – but which included discrepancies such as the inclusion of fonts not available at the time.  “Both KPMG (on behalf of Granath) and BDO (on behalf of Wright) have found that these documents contain at best unexplained changes which are likely to have been made after the date the documents are claimed to be from,” the judgment said.  Given the lack of cryptographic proof available at the time, “the court believes that Granath had sufficient factual grounds to claim that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2019,” Engebrigtsen said.  “Wright has come out with a controversial claim, and must withstand criticism from dissenters,” she added, concluding that Granath’s statements were lawful, not defamatory.  Engebrigtsen also appeared to take up the idea that Twitter is a naturally rough-and-tumble environment where users should have a thick skin, after Granath’s lawyers noted that Wright had also tweeted strong words such as “cuck” and “soy boy.”  “Wright himself uses coarse slang and derogatory references, and so, in the court's view, must accept that others use similar jargon against him,” the judgment said.  Read more: Crypto Twitter Took Center Stage During the First Day of Hodlonaut vs. Craig Wright  Halvor Manshaus, Wright’s lawyer, told CoinDesk that the legal team “[does] not agree with the court’s assessment” that Granath’s communications were not, in a legal sense, defamatory or privacy-breaching and said the Twitter user “breached the commonly accepted threshold of decency.”  “Private citizens should enjoy the same protection on Twitter as on other media platforms,” Manshaus said. “Anonymous online bullying and harassment risks having a chilling effect on meaningful debate and the civil exchange of views and opinions.

42394506,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96j3,1666272024,How to Start Investing in Crypto on Popular Exchanges,"If you’re looking to take the plunge into cryptocurrency investing or are perhaps keen to explore the possibilities of an all-crypto lifestyle, then your first port of call will likely be a crypto exchange.  While traditional payment apps like Venmo or Cash App offer the option to buy and sell cryptocurrency, the features can be limited compared to what centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) offer.  Today, there are many different crypto exchanges from which to choose, with each offering a wide range of assets and features. We will take a look at a few popular crypto exchanges and how to start trading on them.  How to Invest on Coinbase  Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam and has since become a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq and the largest crypto exchange in the United States by trading volume. Trading services on Coinbase are available throughout the United States (excluding Hawaii) and over 100 countries around the world.  Coinbase offers various methods for converting your fiat into cryptocurrency. Users can make deposits using their debit cards, linked bank accounts or through PayPal. Depending on which method you use, withdrawing fiat may be delayed until the transaction is cleared with Coinbase.  Additionally, Coinbase has a 3.99% fee for credit card purchases and a 1.49% fee for bank account purchases.  Once you have signed up and funded your account, buying, selling and trading cryptocurrency is straightforward.  The platform offers a simple user interface that gives users immediate access to over 100 different cryptocurrencies. Despite having higher fees compared with other platforms, Coinbase’s simple-to-use interface makes the platform a perfect place for beginners to buy their first crypto.  However, if you’re looking to access more advanced trading features, such as limit orders and buying on margin, this platform may not be for you.  Investing on Kraken  Kraken was founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell as a more secure crypto exchange alternative following the hack of Mt. Gox.  Unlike Coinbase, Kraken is almost entirely a web-based crypto exchange, with its app only available in a few countries. The web version of the crypto exchange, however, is available in the United States everywhere except New York and Washington, and offers its services in nearly 200 other countries.  Kraken offers the smallest selection of cryptocurrencies to trade with in comparison to other platforms, with just under 100 options. However, it does provide more fiat currency options compared to most platforms and contains more in-depth trading and graphing data through Kraken Pro.  To get started with your Kraken account, you need to sign up and verify your identity by following the know-your-customer (KYC) measures when prompted. Once registered, you can fund your account with debit or credit cards, bank transfers or crypto transfers – provided Kraken is available in your country.  Investing on Binance  Binance was founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao. While the company was originally based in China, the company relocated soon after due to increased crypto regulations in that country. Since then, Binance has launched several independent, affiliate exchanges as a way to expand internationally and stay within regulations.  Unlike other exchanges, Binance uses its own blockchain system, Binance Smart Chain, to facilitate trades on the exchange. It also has its own native utility tokens called Binance coin (BNB.) BNB can be used to purchase assets on the exchange (at a lower fee rate than using other trading pairs,) facilitate payment transactions, participate in initial exchange offerings (IEOs) and pay for gas fees.  Binance offers one of the widest selections of cryptocurrencies compared to the other popular exchanges, with over 500 cryptocurrencies available for trading. The exchange additionally has one of the lowest fees, with trading and purchasing fees ranging between 0.01% to 0.10%.  Further, Binance typically offers the widest range of features of any centralized exchange in the market. However, the availability of these features is largely dependent on location. Due to issues with crypto regulation across different countries, many Binance features may be disabled where you live. As a result, the exchange can be a bit fragmented and difficult to navigate.  If you are new to crypto, the overwhelming number of options available means Binance may not be the most beginner-friendly platform to use.  To start investing on the Binance platform, you will need to register for an account and select your country. If you are in the U.S., you will be required to register through Binance US.  Once your address is verified, you are ready to start trading on Binance.        Although there are many other options out there, these exchanges can be a good first step for new users looking to start trading cryptocurrency. That being said, users must be aware that keeping funds on any centralized exchange can lead to a loss of funds in the event of a security breach or fraud. For maximum security, it’s advisable to keep a majority of your assets in a cold wallet and only keep a portion of funds on an exchange for trading.

Mercury is using non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Flow blockchain as access passes to IRL experiences for college fan bases. But the back end should be irrelevant to Mercury’s end users, CEO Porter Grieve told CoinDesk. He does not want customers to think about the more technical part of the initiative.  “We want sports fans that don’t care about NFTs,” Grieve said.  Instead, Mercury wants to focus attention on the potential for creating hyperlocal fan clubs using the company’s digital collectibles. It is building platforms for the Clemson Tigers, the Villanova Wildcats and other NCAA Division I sports powerhouses to give fans access to memorable experiences, including interviews with players, and running down the field on game day.  Fans can only access these experiences by holding Mercury NFTs.  “My issue with the NFT space all along is there’s a distribution problem” when it comes to sports, Grieve said, explaining why Mercury’s catering to localized fan bases – colleges – creates an edge over better-known platforms.  One curveball: “Name, image, likeness.” The new NCAA rules enabling college athletes to monetize themselves means Mercury must sign each player individually to include them on the platform.

BNB price slightly corrected after going up by almost 4% following the latest burning of Binance tokens Binance established $260 as its support level The altcoin might fall to $250 before continuing its price rally With that, the total number of burned (destroyed) BNB tokens reached 2,065,152, which is worth over $563 million. Shortly after, Binance went up by 3.75% to trade at $274.6, confirming the asset&apos;s positive response to the burning mechanisms introduced to reduce the crypto&apos;s overall supply of 200 million by half. At press time, the altcoin is experiencing a slight price correction, changing hands at $272.93 according to tracking from Coincodex. However, thanks to a substantial increase in BNB&apos;s buying volume, a bullish rally could be on the horizon for the 4th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. Analyzing Price Movement Of Binance Coin Binance was not spared by the widespread price dip that continues to bother all of crypto space as it has spent many days in the red zone for the past two months just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token somehow managed to establish $260 level as its support zone, which means the asset&apos;s price won&apos;t go lower than that as long as the marker is maintained.

42394188,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3ub,1666269900,"Ecosystem Growth, Not Prices, Tells the Real Crypto Story","Amid the current crypto winter, I have called and chatted with participants in the digital assets industry and heard the same narratives scores of times:  More investors are interested in crypto than ever before.  Institutional interest in crypto continues to increase.  The tools and products to include digital assets into portfolios continue to proliferate.  Pending regulations will help create the kind of clarity that helps even more people become comfortable investing in crypto.  Yet the price of tokens like bitcoin and ether remain subdued – if there is all this momentum behind digital assets, it’s not showing up in the kind of price increases that signal investor enthusiasm.  Part of the reason for the stubbornly lower prices is an economic one – crypto did not show itself to be a hedge against inflation or equity volatility early in the market downturn, so investors haven’t seen digital assets as a haven while inflation remains high and interest rates climb.  New retail investor money has been slow to move back into the digital asset space because many of those investors are being squeezed by inflation. People who have been active in crypto investing are largely out of dry powder – and Wall Street investors have shifted towards a more risk-off posture.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Adoption becomes contagion  Another reason for lower prices is the contagion of failures in speculative assets.  ""It’s both the best time and the worst time in crypto,” said John Sarson, CEO of Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager and education resource for financial advisors. “Adoption was going gangbusters. Everyone with speculative assets was deploying them in crypto, and then they saw them evaporate over the course of failures at Iron Finance, Olympus DAO, Three Arrows Capital, LUNA and USDT, or found that capital trapped permanently in Celsius [Network] or Voyager [Digital].”  Even firms that were doing robust due diligence were impacted. Some of Sarson’s investors have found themselves down 75%-80%.  Read more: Crypto Failures Fueled Better Due Diligence  Good news turns sour  Let’s not ignore that there has been plenty of good news in the digital assets space.  For example, just this week Google and Coinbase signed an agreement to enable cloud payments with crypto. Also, BNY Mellon announced that it will custody crypto and Betterment announced that it will offer crypto allocations within its robo-advisor platform.  Yet, in the current environment even good news is met with pessimism.  Take Nova Labs, the company behind crypto-powered wireless network Helium, as an example. Nova Labs is creating a decentralized wireless network using blockchain technology. Earlier this year it had a successful fundraising round from the likes of Tiger Global and Andreessen Horowitz, and it recently announced a partnership with T-Mobile to handle the “last mile” of its communications network.  Read more: Nova Labs Inks Agreement With T-Mobile to Cover 5G Dead Spots in Helium Network  Despite a novel idea and a lot of promising news, Helium’s HNT token price has actually declined 90% from its peak.  “Everyone who would be allocating capital to these projects because they are in the know [don’t] have any cash to deploy,” Sarson said. “There’s no one left to speculate or recognize that some of these projects are making amazing achievements.”  So the big, “smart” money in the digital assets space is constrained and the market cannot find fair value in many tokens and projects.  Another example is Ethereum, which successfully merged to become a proof-of-stake blockchain last month, a move that should increase its energy efficiency by more than 99% and that gives ether holders the ability to stake their tokens in exchange for yield.  “The risk-reward profile for [ether] has improved, but the price is not going up,” Sarson said. “The market isn’t differentiating between the baby and the bathwater right now.”  What crypto needs to turn around  So when does the market turn the corner?  Increasing regulatory clarity may help to bring some institutional money from the sidelines, as would having capital locked up in the Celsius and Voyager bankruptcies released back to investors.  Otherwise, the next major shift could come when investors move more towards a risk-on stance.  “What advisors need to understand is that this year’s failures mainly negatively impacted crypto speculators,” Sarson said. “The people who really lost a lot of the money are the founders, early adopters and speculative investors who were driving the initial growth of this ecosystem. Without them, the ecosystem continues to grow at a rapid pace but asset prices are dislocated and by many measures remarkably low. It’s a fabulous opportunity.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/20/ecosystem-growth-not-prices-tells-the-real-crypto-story,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a2e8111c426b5d9e75d43629ad2cdc4c1979075-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Her short time in office was marked by controversies over her fiscal policy and the energy policy known as fracking, and her resignation leaves the fate of bills on stablecoins and crypto seizures hanging in the balance.  “I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss told reporters outside her office on Downing Street, saying a new leadership election will be completed within the next week. “I will remain as prime minister until a successor has been chosen.”  The government’s Financial Services and Markets Bill, which would offer much-needed regulations allowing crypto assets to be used as a means of payment, entered committee stage on Wednesday.  A parallel law allowing seizure of crypto assets in cases of crime and terrorism was also presented to lawmakers last week, but it was thrown into doubt after the resignation of Home Affairs Minister Suella Braverman on Wednesday.  It now remains to be seen whether fellow Conservative lawmakers can coalesce around a single candidate to replace her. If not, the selection will have to proceed to an election of Conservative Party members. Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party has called for a general election, which would see the party enter government with a significant majority, based on current polling.

42415369,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJjJ,1666264429,"A Year After Debut, ProShares Bitcoin ETF Has Underperformed Market by 1.8%","ProShares' bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded fund went live on the New York Stock Exchange a year ago, giving investors exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without them having to own the coin themselves.  Since its debut, the long BTC futures-based ETF has underperformed bitcoin by 1.79%, according to data tracked by Arcane Research. In other words, the ETF, trading under the ticker BITO, has bled slightly more than bitcoin, which has declined nearly 70% since the fund's launch date of Oct 18, 2021, according to CoinDesk data.  The ETF, however, has fared well compared with market expectations. After its inception, several observers were worried that BITO would underperform bitcoin by 10% to 13% because of ""contango bleed"" – the cost associated with rolling or moving the long (buy) position from an expiring contract to the next month's contract.  ""While bad, the underperformance was far lower than estimated based on 2021 data, forecasting 13% annualized rolling costs,"" Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde wrote in a note sent to clients early this week.  Explaining the contango bleed  Before diving into what helped BITO outperform market expectations, it's imperative to understand the inner workings of the fund that make it vulnerable to contango bleed.  BITO purchases bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rather than the actual cryptocurrency.  The futures market typically trades in contango – a situation where the futures price exceeds the spot price. As the expiration date nears, however, the contract due for settlement erases the premium and converges with the spot price, while the next month's contract continues to trade at a premium.  Therefore, when the fund rolls over long positions, it liquidates expiring contracts at a price lower than the cost at which the contacts were acquired and then purchases the following month's contract at a premium to the spot price. Essentially, the fund sells low and buys high on every expiration date, bleeding money and ultimately underperforming the underlying asset.  Perhaps holding the actual cryptocurrency is the best bet irrespective of market trends.  Bear market saved the day  The crypto bear market, which began late last year, reduced monthly rollover costs and likely helped the fund beat market expectations, according to Lunde.  The degree of the contango bleed depends on how steep the contango is. It's usually steeper during a bull market when an asset is expected to rise and flattens during bearish trends.  As bitcoin began to fall last December, the spread between prices in futures and spot markets collapsed. The annualized premium in three-month CME-listed futures slipped into single digits from nearly 20% in April 2021.  The premium fell as low as 3% in January this year and has remained mostly below 5% ever since, barring occasional backwardation – a situation where spot prices are greater than futures prices.  As such, monthly rollovers became cheaper, ensuring BITO bleeds less money than previously expected.  ""Due to a structural market shift as BTC brutally entered a prolonged bear market after the massive liquidation event on Dec. 4, 2021, CME’s futures have tended to trade in a flat structure with minimal contango and periodically in backwardation,"" Lunde noted.  ""Rolling dynamics have played in investors' favor in 2022,"" he added.  Record exposure  While the contango bleed makes futures-based ETFs look inferior to spot-based ETFs, investors seem to appreciate what they got. (U.S. regulators continue to reject spot-based ETFs.)  Early this week, ProShares held a long exposure on CME equivalent to 32,520 BTC ($620 million), matching the August peak. VanEck's and Valkyrie's funds, which went live after ProShares' debut, held a bullish exposure of 1,075 and 1,095 BTC, respectively.  According to Arcane Research, futures-based ETFs from ProShares, VanEck and Valkyrie account for half the open interest on the CME. Open interest refers to the dollar amount locked in the number of contracts open at a given time.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/20/a-year-after-debut-proshares-bitcoin-etf-has-underperformed-market-by-18,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d0f1d3ceffa1490c943e08cb10787869cd35dfb-1596x595.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415362,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdJb5,1666264059,Bernstein Still Sees Institutional Adoption Despite Crypto Winter,"Asset managers that were actively investing in cryptocurrency markets in the bull market of 2020/21 continue to invest in the sector and remained committed to digital assets, with some planning to allocate more capital to the industry, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  Private market investors continue to look for opportunities in the sector, although they are ""way more valuation sensitive,” the report said. Therefore, “crypto converts” remain active in the sector, but those investors who were ambivalent about digital assets in late 2021 have delayed their plans.  Bernstein says it is seeing select large asset managers continue to build out their digital-assets strategies and expects those initiatives will result in “actual direct digital assets allocations 12-18 months down the line.” It said it also continues to have active conversations with a number of investment managers at different stages of interest in the sector.  ""This is probably the most encouraging part of the institutional adoption cycle while recognizing that the actual impact on the market is probably 12 months away,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Crypto-native and venture-capital investors raised very large funds in 2021, with some in excess of $1 billion. In contrast, fundraising for “liquid crypto strategies” or tokens have been less than $100 million, the note said. There is intent to “deploy this dry powder in private rounds,” which means that private valuations aren't correcting as much as crypto valuations.  Most investors were surprised by the seamless transition of the Ethereum blockchain to proof-of-stake (Pos), a process known as the Merge, but they were equally surprised that it was a “sell-the-news” event, with weak ether (ETH) price action after the switch, the note added.  The Merge was the first of five software upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain and involved the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) method of validating transactions and securing the network to a more energy-efficient PoS consensus mechanism.

Popularity  The company is prevalent across the centralized crypto industry as a connector between popular exchanges and traders’ bank accounts, Meier said. Around 40% of his division’s business comes from crypto.  All those integrations mean opportunities to build customers’ perceived trust in Plaid, he said. Their familiarity with that company linking to their bank account can then spill over into crypto, where DeFi protocols are under increasing pressure to vet their clients.

Carolyn Wilkins is the latest in a line of regulators to cast doubt on governance structures within decentralized finance (DeFi) – noting that poor decision-making led to the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in the 2008 financial crisis.  “I think there are hard limits to how decentralized a system can become in practice,” said Wilkins, a research scholar at Princeton University who sits on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), in a speech published on Wednesday. The FPC was set up after the crisis to spot potential risks to the overall financial system.  “We live in an inherently uncertain world,” said Wilkins, previously at the Canadian central bank. “There can never be a set of smart contracts for every situation, and centralized decision making will always be needed when the unexpected happens.”  The invocation of emergency powers at protocols such as Solend has proved controversial, and Wilkins noted that DeFi structures can concentrate both knowledge and power in the hands of those with the most tokens or coding expertise.  But the possibility of using blockchain and other distributed technology for financial services such as lending has posed a quandary for regulators used to imposing rules on well-defined, centralized entities such as banks.  Late last year, researchers at the Bank for International Settlements called DeFi an “illusion.” Standard setters at the Financial Stability Board largely steered clear of the topic in an Oct. 11 report, despite calling for a “comprehensive” crypto rulebook.

42413803,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCKQo,1666258238,Binance Denies Allegations It Intends to Use Users' Uniswap Tokens for Voting,"Crypto exchange Binance denied allegations of misusing its users’ token holdings to exercise voting power on the Uniswap decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  “Binance doesn’t vote with user’s tokens. In this case, there has been a misunderstanding of what happened during the transfer of a large balance of UNI (around 4.6 million) between wallets,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk this morning.  “We’re currently in discussions to improve the process to prevent any further misunderstandings from happening again,” they added. Separately, Binance pointed out in a Thursday tweet that its wallet had never voted on any Uniswap governance proposal.  The statements were in response to Uniswap creator Hayden Adams claiming on Wednesday that Binance delegated some 13 million UNI, Uniswap’s native tokens, from its books, to become the second-largest UNI delegate.  A group of core developers maintains the Uniswap codebase, but key protocol decisions are governed by the Uniswap DAO, which grants users voting rights according to how many UNI tokens they hold.  Users may also “delegate” their tokens to other entities, thereby enabling those entities to vote on their behalf.  Binance currently retains 5.9% of the voting power on Uniswap, second only to venture capital giant a16z, which controls 6.7%, as reported.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | UNI | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/20/binance-denies-allegations-that-it-intends-to-use-users-uniswap-tokens-for-voting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bcc40caae9481c8ee1110e3bbe65b05cc25ff63-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413798,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCKN4,1666257772,Customers of Bankrupt Crypto Lender Voyager Could Recover 72% of Their Funds if FTX Sale Is Approved: Report,"Court documents show customers of bankrupt crypto lending platform Voyager Digital could recover 72% of their investments if a bid by FTX US to buy the lender goes through. But the sale won't close until a judge approves Voyager's payout plan, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.  The Toronto-based Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York back in July. At the time, it had around 100,000 creditors and between $1 billion to $10 billion in assets. The bankruptcy filing was followed by a bidding war to buy the embattled lender, which Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX winning the race in September.  In a letter to the court filed on Oct. 18, Voyager debtors said the sale to FTX US would allow customers to recover around 72% of the value of crypto held in their accounts on the platform, ""provides stakeholders with the best possible recovery and facilitates the most expedient resolution"" to the bankruptcy proceedings.  During a hearing on Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Michael E. Wiles approved an arrangement where Voyager can scrap the FTX deal if a better offer materializes that promises customers a chance to recover more of their funds, the report said. Wiles may consider approving Voyager's bankruptcy payout plan in December – a prerequisite for approving the sale.  The firm also requested Wiles' permission to send its payout plan to customers for a vote, Bloomberg reported. Even if creditors vote in favor, Wiles still has the final say on the sale.

42413794,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCKJK,1666254600,Online Bank N26 to Offer Crypto Through Bitpanda's Trading Product,"Digital bank N26 is entering the crypto world and will allow select customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its app.  The Berlin-headquartered N26 will leverage Austrian crypto exchange Bitpanda’s trading and custody platform to give some of the bank’s customers access to up to 200 cryptocurrencies for trading including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA and XRP.  The $9 billion European digital bank, which operates entirely online and doesn’t have traditional bank branches, hasn’t had the easiest couple of years despite its valuation, having failed to penetrate the U.K. and U.S. markets, and having to spend big on toughening anti-money laundering controls under pressure from regulators.  The bank is only offering crypto trading as a “wealth building feature” – meaning customers can buy and sell tokens, but cannot transfer the assets to other digital wallets, Gilles BianRosa, chief product officer at N26 said in an email to CoinDesk.  “This of course has a significant impact on security and fraud prevention,” BianRosa said, adding that the bank’s platform is a “non-anonymous crypto trading system” that has “strict eligibility criteria” on top of the bank’s existing know-your-customer requirements for onboarding customers.  To begin with, only N26 customers in Austria will be allowed to access crypto services. While the bank has plans to roll out the service to customers in other markets over the coming months, BianRosa did not specify which markets it will be expanding into.  “Right now, we are focused on rolling out the product in Austria, and will incorporate feedback from this for our gradual roll out to other markets,” BianRosa said.  The bank is using Bitpanda’s White Label product, which is already used by a financial service provider in Italy, and allows fintechs or banks to tap into Bitpanda’s 24/7 trading platform featuring hundreds of cryptocurrencies.  Earlier this month, reports surfaced that N26 was looking to buy Bitpanda in 2020, shortly before the startup was declared a fintech unicorn with a $4.1 billion valuation.

The DEX had earlier said that its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), entities that are owned and governed by their members without any central leadership, would vote on how to refund users.  ""The program for depositors to recover funds is in audit and should be ready to go by tomorrow morning. Much thanks to all the Mango contributors working tirelessly to make this happen,"" Mango Labs co-founder Daffy Durairaj said in a tweet.  A group of exploiters drained the marketplace of $114 million worth of crypto, by manipulating the price of the DEX's native token MNGO.  DEXs like Mango rely on smart contracts to match trades between users. Smart contracts are wholly decentralized and are not overseen by a centralized party – which means a rogue trader can deploy enough money to exploit loopholes in any protocol without the risk of anyone stepping in to stop the attack before it takes place.  One of the apparent exploiters, Avraham Eisenberg, came forward last week and said that the group had returned $67 million to the Solana-based exchange.

In the last 24 hours, ETH barely experienced price movement on its chart. Continued lateral trading will push Ethereum price to the $1,200 support level. Bitcoin also remained mundane over the last 24 hours, and most altcoins have acted the same way. The technical outlook of Ethereum signalled that the bulls are not in control of the market.

In case the price momentum doesn&apos;t pick up in the next trading sessions, ETH could even travel below the $1,200 support line.

Bitcoin Holds Over $19K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin and ether continued their recent stationary ways, albeit more to the red, while several decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens declined later in the day after rising early, as investors fretted anew over new housing data and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading just under $19,000, off 1.5% and just below the lower end of the $19,000 to $21,000 range that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has occupied for more than a month. Bitcoin continued to trail its 20-day moving average, clear evidence of the bear market’s resiliency.  Ether’s (ETH) was recently changing hands at $1,273, down 2.4% from Tuesday, same time, and beneath its $1,300 bottom support for much of the past month. Ether has also continued its recent trend of trading below its 20-day average.  Other altcoins were recently down with XRP, ADA and CRO all off well over 2% from a day earlier. Even UNI, which jumped 3.5% at one point and was up 9.5% over the past seven days, was in the red later in the day (U.S. ET).  On Oct. 13, Uniswap, the decentralized exchange behind the token, announced that it had raised $165 million in a Series B funding round led by Polychain Capital. ""The fresh round of funding will support expanding Uniswap's product lines, which might include NFT trading in the near future,"" noted Katie Talati, director of research at digital asset manager Arca, in an email.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was relatively flat, recently falling 1.6%.  Traditional financial markets declined on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 each falling by a few fractions of a percentage point.  In major macroeconomic data, U.S. housing starts plunged 8.1% to 1.439 million in September, falling slightly short of the consensus estimate but reflecting a sagging of the once-torrid housing market. However, September housing permits, an indicator of future construction, rose by 1.4% over August.  Global inflation continued to tick higher, with Great Britain (10.1%) and Canada (6.9%) each reporting higher increases in prices than expected. Both countries recently increased their key interest rates by 0.50% and 0.75%, respectively. Hotter-than-expected inflation increased the likelihood that both countries would raise interest rates aggressively, similar to the U.S., where the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is expected to approve a fourth consecutive 75 basis point rate hike in November.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, was recently trading slightly down but still hovering well over $90 per barrel, up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold declined 1.4%.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

Bridges, or blockchain-based tools that connect different networks, are essential for the movement of liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. Bridges allow users to transfer tokens and other digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), between various chains – solving what was previously a difficult problem.  But the security for bridges is still in developing mode. February saw Wormhole’s $375 million exploit, followed by a $625 million exploit of Ronin Bridge next month. Then in August, Nomad Bridge was attacked for $190 million.  But what makes bridge attacks so common?  Crypto developer Hart Lambur says that centralization and reliance on private key holders are to blame, rather than the inherent technology and logic behind the bridges themselves.  “Multisig exploits clearly demonstrate why it’s essential for the ecosystem to have decentralized bridges that rely not on keyholders, but instead on dispute resolution in which anyone can dispute data or behavior that appears to be incorrect or malicious,” Lambur, the co-founder and CEO of Risk Labs, the foundation and team behind UMA, told CoinDesk in a recent interview.  By controlling a majority of the votes, the attacker can approve any transfers. In the Ronin Network hack, for example, five of the bridge’s nine validators were compromised in this way.  Insisting on decentralized bridges  “It’s extremely dangerous to put control of those funds in the hands of a few people. Users should demand and insist on using decentralized bridges to protect their funds,” Lambur added.  “Decentralized bridges are few and far between, but we are making progress and developing optimistic design patterns in bridges that reduce the risk of exploits. An optimistic design pattern means that transactions can proceed ‘optimistically’ unless someone – anyone – disputes a transaction or piece of data.”  “Addressing the security of cross-chain bridges should also include regular tests or audits, due diligence on networks, and chain integrations,” Lambur said  Lambur and others say security should be a constant process, rather than a set-it-and-forget-it system.  “Builders should always take the time to consider edge cases where systems may fail, simulating and patching these issues to spot any weaknesses,” he explained. “Alongside this, you need robust systems in place for constant monitoring which ensures the team can act swiftly if needs be.”  “Audits that check contracts for complexities or vulnerabilities are imperative to ensure your bridge has been sufficiently stress-tested,” he further stated.

Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin fell by 1%, confirming sideways trading. In the last week, BTC has barely made any progress with its price. If the coin continues to stick around the same price level, it could soon be a free fall for the asset. The technical outlook points towards the weakness in buying power. Demand for the coin remains low as the asset fails to move up north. A fall from this price zone could even bring the Bitcoin price to as low as $18,000. At the moment, the $18,900 price level remains strong support for the coin. If the coin reaches the $18,000 support line, the next level stands at $17,400. Depreciation from the $17,000 level can even drag the price of the asset to $16,000. A push above the $20,000 mark could invalidate the bears for sometime, but demand for BTC has to shoot up over the immediate trading sessions. Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $19,200 at the time of writing. The coin has been rejected from the $19,600 price level in the past trading sessions. The immediate resistance mark is at $19,400, a move above that can push BTC to $19,600. For the bulls to take action, BTC has to topple above the $20,000 price level. On the flip side, the coin&apos;s support line was at $18,900. If the bears remain in control, the next stop would be at $18,000.
