42425468,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Olh,1392852722,Bitcoin ATM Gets Surprise Launch in Biggest Boston Train Station,"Though they missed becoming the first operational bitcoin ATM in the US by less than 24 hours, the entrepreneurs behind Liberty Teller caused quite a stir when they revealed that they would boot up their new Lamassu machine in Boston's busy South Station on 19th February.  The largest train station in the Boston metropolitan area, South Station holds 13 tracks and seven platforms as part of the city's public subway system, and is the last stop for New England commuters who take the public commuter rail. These additional lines provide extended service to nearby metros Providence and Worcester.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Liberty Teller founder Chris Yim said he couldn't have asked for a better location:  ""South Station gets 25 million travellers a year, and there's really nothing else like that. None of the other bitcoin ATM locations in the world come close to that.""  The United States was previously rumored to have its first bitcoin ATMs by the end of the month, but high-tech hubs Seattle and Austin were pegged as the frontrunners to take the technology to the public for the first time.  Timing the launch  A look at the group's Twitter account shows Liberty Teller founders Yim and Kyle Powers wasted no time after receiving their Lamassu brand ATM on 18th February. The former Wharton School classmates and long-time bitcoin enthusiasts posted pictures of their unwrapping of the unit, and just the next day, had tweeted pictures of their fully operational machine at South Station.    #first public #bitcoin #ATM #kiosk in the USA! http://t.co/xsrpLT3vga      — Liberty Teller (@libertyteller) February 19, 2014    Addressing the timing of the launch, Powers said that Liberty Teller was just ""in the right place, at the right time"" to be one of the first to market, and that the machine is really just part of their larger goal to help bitcoin buying become faster and more secure through the effective use of kiosks  When asked about the New Mexico ATM installed the day prior, Yim was quick to note that Liberty Teller had made an industry first with its installation.  ""It wasn't public,"" he added.  Customer response  While Yim and Powers did not provide exact figures for the number of visitors, they were enthusiastic about the attention the launch had received so far.  By lunch time, the ATM had attracted a sizable crowd of interested onlookers, with most asking Yim and Powers introductory questions about bitcoin and the machine.  Liberty Teller chose to give out a small amount of bitcoin to every person who stopped by. The bitcoin was handed out via a paper giveaway wallet that explained how the recipent could receive the bitcoin online. Yim and Powers are self-funding the ATMs, but are also calling for interested community members to donate to the machine as a way to spur adoption.  One enterprising user who made a purchase was Davis Foster, an app developer from Wellesely, Massachusetts, who was on his way to work when he noticed the machine.  A long-time bitcoin supporter, Foster said he was unaware of the ATM, and simply made a purchase to show his support.  What's next for Liberty Teller?  For now, Yim and Powers say their ATM will make its home in South Station. Liberty Teller is renting a corridor near one of the station's rear entrances, and is currently sharing its space with an apparell vending machine.  Liberty Teller hopes to build a broad network of ATMs that includes other retail spots, though its founders acknowledged they were likely to face competition.  Yim noted that the bitcoin-accepting merchants he spoke with see the appeal in hosting a machine that allows consumers to spend more bitcoin in store.  ""We're going to bring in a ton of traffic, and that's going to be attractive to businesses that want to present a high-tech focus, as well as one that's consumer friendly,"" Yim said.

42425453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OLh,1392849946,Winklevoss Twins Launch Price Index for Bitcoin Named the 'Winkdex',"The Winklevoss twins really do want to put their name into bitcoin - they have launched a blended bitcoin price index, the 'Winkdex' that they say reflects the true price of the digital currency. The index will be used to price the assets in the brothers' forthcoming bitcoin trust.  The Winkdex will be offered by Math-based Asset Index LLC, a company operated by the Winklevosses. It was announced today in the brothers' latest filing with the SEC, an amended version of its July filing describing the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.  ""We believe that we are establishing an accurate spot price that reflects the true value of a bitcoin and resolves the price confusion that exists due to the various exchanges,” said Cameron Winklevoss, who acts as CEO of MBAI.  The Winkdex uses the trading price in US dollars for the top three qualified bitcoin exchanges by volume across a two-hour period. It uses a volume-weighted moving average to set its price. It also weights the most recent transactions in the two-hour period greater than earlier transactions in the same window.  In time, the pair hope that the index will be used as a more general benchmark for the price of bitcoin, rather than purely as a way to determine the net asset value of the fund.  Price indices for bitcoin are becoming increasingly important given the volatile nature of the asset, and the delta that exists between various exchanges, which are themselves relatively young, and part of a still emerging market. The Winkdex's page, which shows six different exchange prices in addition to its own, is indicative of the large spread between different exchanges.  Average prices on LocalBTC (localbitcoins.com) were listed at around $760 on the site, for example, while pricing at troubled Mt Gox stood at just $262, at the time of writing. The Winkdex pegged bitcoin at $628.  The Winkdex joins CoinDesk's own Bitcoin Price Index, launched last September, which has a clearly defined set of rules outlining which exchanges it supports.  Like CoinDesk, MBAI has disqualified Mt. Gox from inclusion in its index. It attributed this to the recent freeze in bitcoin withdrawals, in addition to its backlog of US dollar withdrawals.  Along with today's amended SEC filing, the launch of the Winkdex is a signal that the Winklevoss brothers are moving closer to the launch of their ETF. The filing was expected, following an announcement by their lawyer last month. She predicted that the fund might be approved by the end of this year.  The latest version of the SEC filing referred to the Federal Senate hearings last year, in addition to the NYDFS hearings that took place in January. It highlighted the regulatory uncertainty that still exists around bitcoin. The Winklevoss twins will be particularly sensitive about this; they attended the hearings just days after the arrest of Charlie Shrem, the founder of now-defunct BitInstant which was one of their key investments. They distanced themselves from Shrem in a statement at the time.  The Winklevoss brothers claimed to hold 1% of all bitcoins when the initial ETF document was submitted last July.

42425464,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Ofh,1392837569,Inside London's First Bitcoin Voucher Shop,"A shop selling bitcoin vouchers has opened on the edge of London’s financial district. Called Azteco, the store allows customers to buy bitcoin with cash from an attendant.  Customers arrive, decide how much bitcoin they want to buy and hand the attendant cash. The attendant then prints out a voucher containing a code that can be redeemed at the Azteco website. A 3% commission is charged on each transaction. Conversion rates are taken from BitcoinCharts.com.  Azteco’s founder, Akin Fernandez, said his service is designed to make buying bitcoin as simple as possible for the general public.  “Everyone already understands how to use a voucher to top a mobile phone. I wanted to create a model that makes it as easy as possible for people to get bitcoin. And this is exactly what this does.”  Fernandez said he had performed a “handful” of transactions since the shop opened its doors on 17th February, and that his customers so far have been people with some knowledge of bitcoin but who didn't previously hold the cryptocurrency.  “Mostly they come in to chat. Demand is very small at the moment, so I don’t expect to have a line of people outside the shop,” he said.  Azteco's goals  The London shop is just the start of Azteco’s plans, Fernandez said. He describes the Azteco business model as a “virtual ATM” for bitcoin. He plans to market the service to real-world merchants who want to add the ability to sell bitcoin vouchers to existing services.  Merchants would sign up with Azteco, pay a security deposit and split the commission with the firm. Azteco would supply merchants with bitcoin. Several companies are vying to install London's first bitcoin ATM, with one planned for Shoreditch, just minutes from Azteco's shop.  “This is a virtual ATM [business]. The difference is, if somebody wants to buy one of those ATMs, they have to fork out 2,000 euros. Here, they just have to pay a security deposit. So this could spread very rapidly.""  Fernandez said he wrote Azteco’s software himself, and that his involvement in cryptocurrency dates back to the late 90s. He obtained his first bitcoin from Amir Taaki, a pioneering developer in the bitcoin space.  Azteco is run by Fernandez’s company Irdialini Ltd, which is mainly engaged in publishing work like The Conet Project, an acclaimed series of recordings of mysterious shortwave-radio stations.  About the store  The Azteco shop is located at 19, New Goulston St, plying its trade in digital currencies next to the historic Petticoat Lane market, where traders have been hawking their wares for more than 250 years. A stone’s throw away is the iconic ‘Gherkin’ skyscraper, which houses insurance giant Swiss Re.  Fernandez’s shop is sparsely furnished. The space contains just a desk, three fold-up chairs, a battered inkjet printer that produces the bitcoin vouchers and a titanium Apple Powerbook. Fernandez was browsing the latest story about his shop on the Daily Mail’s webiste when CoinDesk visited.  “I’ve been getting a lot of action on Twitter now that the press has picked this up,” he said approvingly.  Azteco’s neighbours are non-plussed about the new cryptocurrency arrival on the street. Next door at an computer and electronics parts wholesaler, questions about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies drew blank looks from staff.  A market trader who was packing up racks of clothing at the end of the trading day snorted when asked if he had ever heard about bitcoin:  “Digital money? I’m not interested.

42425465,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Ohh,1392831275,Estonian Police Target Bitcoin Trading Site BTC.ee,"As the Estonian authorities continue to tighten their grip on the digital currency trade, local bitcoin trading site BTC.ee (not to be confused with BTC-e) has announced via its website that it has “temporarily stopped trading due to threats issued by the Estonian police”.  The move follows a warning about bitcoin and other virtual currencies issued by a member of Estonia's central bank earlier this year, in which he called bitcoin a “problematic scheme” and said that “virtual currency schemes are an innovation that [deserve] some caution”.  Otto de Voogd, the site’s owner, told local broadcaster ERR he had received emails in which the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit of the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board said that, under the country’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, he is obliged to provide personal information on the platform’s users and written proof that the site was operated in compliance with Estonia’s regulation.  Money laundering and terrorist finance  The act (translated into English) regulates the activities of Estonia-based credit institutions, financial institutions, the Financial Intelligence Unit and other agencies and persons with the aim of preventing money laundering and financing of terrorist activities.  It applies to the economic or professional activities of a wide range of persons, including credit and financial institutions, organizers of games of chance, intermediaries in transactions with real property, traders in transactions involving more than €15,000 or its equivalent, pawnbrokers, precious metals and stones traders, auditors, providers of trust and company services, and non-profit associations and foundations.  Among other provisions, the act stipulates that, upon provision of currency exchange services, a provider of currency exchange services shall identify and verify all persons participating in the transaction if the amounts exchanged in cash either in a single transaction or related transactions exceed €6,400 or its amount in another currency.  In addition to this, the act includes an obligation to apply a range of due diligence measures if a situation involves a risk of money laundering or financing terrorist activities.  Should he fail to provide the requested information, including copies of clients’ IDs, to the authorities, he could be sentenced to three years of prison and imposed a fine of up to €32,000 ($44,000), de Voogd said.  Aivar Paul, the spokesperson for the Estonian Police, dismissed claims made by de Voogd that the emails were ""threats"", he told ERR:  ""We have simply noted in conversation with Mr de Voogd that without the registration required by the Money Laundering and Terrorism Prevention Act, offering financial service could be grounds for criminal proceedings for illegal economic activity.""  Lack of regulation  The available data suggests that to date, bitcoin has not gained prominence in Estonian retail. According to statistics released by Coinmap.org, there are currently only two outlets which accept payment in bitcoins in Estonia; a holiday location in Tallinn, the country’s capital; and car repair shop Kagu Auto in Võru, in Estonia’s south.  In comparison, the two neighbouring Baltic states, Lithuania and Latvia, host three and nine outlets which accept payment in the digital currency, respectively.  With 9,669 downloads of the bitcoin client and wallet to date, Estonia is ranked 56th worldwide. Lithuania is 45th, with 15,527 downloads, while Latvia lags behind its two neighbors at 59, with 7,918 downloads.  On his website, de Voogd said he offered transactions of between €50 ($69) and €500 ($690) worth of bitcoins:  ""[I aim to serve] people with a legitimate interest in using bitcoins, such as converting into euros a few bitcoins they've received or paying for an online service with bitcoins.""  According to the latest updated bitcoin exchange rates from 19th February, BTC.ee was selling at €474.40 ($652.3) and buying at €432.50 ($594.6) per bitcoin. According to data from 19th February, the website was not included on the list of bitcoin markets maintained by bitcoincharts.com.  De Voogd claims that BTC.ee did not allow third-parties to participate in the virtual currency trade, limiting the scope of the site to his personal dealings with the users. He also pointed to the lack of regulation on the use of bitcoins in financial transactions carried out in Estonia.  ""Promoting bitcoins is just a hobby for us, we do not wish to make a big operation out of this,"" the Estonian site says.

42422933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymlh,1392827289,Entrepreneur Interest in Bitcoin Projects Hit New High in January,"February has seen the release of new information that suggests venture capital (VC) firms remain enamoured with bitcoin and its long-term potential.  But, while it makes sense for larger VC firms to stay resilient in the face of bitcoin's more recent struggles, new data suggests interest in the virtual currency and its technology is just as high among generally more risk-averse small investors and startups.  Online graphic design specialist 99designs, which serves global entrepreneurs requiring logos and professional branding, has revealed new data that shows its marketplace has seen a marked increase in bitcoin interest among users in recent months.  Based in San Francisco, 99designs specializes in pairing businesses owners with designers, who compete to win a cash prize for their winning work.  Most notably, 99designs' data reveals that 49% of its design contests for bitcoin-related ventures have been started within the last 30 days, and 87% of its bitcoin contests have been held since last November.  Public relations manager Lauren Gard was inspired to assess her community's interest in bitcoin, as she was curious to see whether recent setbacks had adversely impacted entrepreneurs.  Gard said:  ""In the case of bitcoin, as we followed its rise and dive and the various related scandals in casual conversation, we became curious to know whether entrepreneurs were still seeing green.""  The data, however, shows that bitcoin enthusiasts remain undeterred.  How 99designs works  Billing itself as a marketplace for ""crowdsourced graphic design"", 99designs allows aspiring business owners to access the talent and ideas of graphic designers all over the world. As of November 2013, 28 million designs had been submitted to the website, with $63m paid out to designers.  After filling out an online brief, business owners choose the size of the prize that they'll provide to the winner and launch the contest. From there, they receive designs and give feedback to designers.  After seven days, a winner is chosen and the business owner can download their design to use however they see fit. A more detailed overview of the process shows how selecting a designer and finalizing the design can last for around one month.  More than 60 projects related to bitcoin have gone through this process to date.  Project details  A look at past and current contests on the site shows a wide range of bitcoin-related projects have been workshopped with the help of 99designs.  These include small projects, such as business logos, t-shirts and business card designs, as well as larger projects like bitcoin-related apps, bitcoin incubators and even a bitcoin-related restaurant directory.  One submission that called for designers to create a bitcoin bank website design had garnered 78 entries at press time, with the winning designer set to receive $2,119. Similarly, a bitcoin ATM and credit card query had received 79 responses for a $1,349 prize.  📷  Additional findings  Bitcoin is not the only virtual currency finding a home on the site, however. Gard mentioned that a number of other projects related to virtual currencies have been completed by users:  ""We’ve hosted contests for companies focusing on litecoin, peercoin and a few other creative new cryptocurrency concepts we can’t disclose.""  Furthermore, 99designs indicated projects are being launched all around the world in accordance with bitcoin's global goals. It noted that Canada, the UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Belgium, Israel, Hong Kong and Indonesia were among the countries represented in past projects.  It seems the site is increasingly attracting movers and shakers in the bitcoin industry, with a design for the next San Francisco Bitcoin Fair, to be held this March, submitted via the service.  As for its own bitcoin acceptance, 99designs was less clear:  ""The bitcoin movement is certainly an interesting one - and one we’ll continue to watch closely as 99designs continues to evolve and expand,"" said Gard.

42425450,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OFh,1392824804,"Forget Tulip Mania, the Netherlands is Leading Bitcoin Innovation","Hang around Imgur and reddit long enough and you will find photos of Dutch tulip fields popping up with clock-like regularity.    The country has long been famed for its flower industry, and the expansive fields of colourful flowers do create a mesmerizing spectacle.      When discussed in the same breath as bitcoin, however, Dutch tulips are an insult. ‘Tulip mania’, a phenomenon in the early 17th Century where tulips traded at extraordinarily high prices and then spectacularly crashed in value, is pointed to as a historical analogue of the current controversy surrounding bitcoin.    In December, the former president of the Dutch Central Bank, Nout Wellink, dismissed bitcoin in scathing terms, saying that the “façade” and hype around bitcoin would eventually die:  “This is worse than tulip mania. At least then you got a tulip [for your investment], now you get nothing.”  No doubt there are many that furiously disagree with his comments, but it’s ironic that a moment in Dutch history is being used to bash bitcoin, because today the country is a hub for bitcoin innovation.  Bitcoin boom  BitPay chose to locate its European headquarters there, you can now get home delivery from around 5,000 restaurants using bitcoin, and a bitcoin-specific point-of-sale system for bars and hospitality was launched by a Dutch company in October. It's also CoinDesk's fourth largest traffic source after the US, UK and Canada.  In the words of Moe Levin, organizer of Bitcoin Miami:  “I do a lot of travelling, and have seen what it’s like around the world to purchase and use coins, and here in Amsterdam, it’s one of the best.”  The first bitcoin company in the Netherlands was an exchange called Bitonic, which launched on 1st May 2012 by a trio of high-school friends, Jouke Hofman, Niels van Groningen and Robert de Waard, with a shared passion for programming and games development.  Bank gamble  Frustrated with trying to trade on international exchanges like Mt. Gox, they wanted to build a native, home-bred system. Bitonic now trades around 300 to 400 BTC per day.  Although their success was never assured, they had one extremely important factor in their favour: iDeal, a Dutch e-payment platform with a 50%+ market share in the country.  “iDeal has a fixed fee and zero chargebacks, so it’s perfect for automated bitcoin trading,” says Daan Kleiman, a spokesperson for Bitonic.  Bitonic’s first bank was ING, which took a punt on them when other banks were more sceptical about bitcoin. They now have accounts at three of the four big banks in the Netherlands: ABN Amro and SNS Bank, as well as the aforementioned ING, says Kleiman.  “They are very interested and open minded about bitcoin now, and we often give presentations and workshops at their various headquarters.”  Only Rabobank is still resistant to bitcoin businesses, with Kleiman calling it “very anti-bitcoin”. But generally, he says, things are much easier now:  “We had some ups and downs with banks, mainly downs in the beginning, but things are looking up now […] Late in 2012, we ran into trouble with banks when criminals discovered ways to plunder hacked bank accounts using iDeal and our service. We quickly had fraud-detection systems in place to stop most of the criminal activity, but it took us a while to get connected to the correct people at the different banks.”  Those comments will be familiar to anyone involved with a bitcoin business in many jurisdictions. Resistance to bitcoin, whether pragmatic or ideological, has only been half the story; getting the public to engage too, has been a problem, though one that is far smaller now than it has been in the past.  Big plans  For the future, Bitonic are hoping to launch a peer-to-peer trading platform, but are waiting for a license from the Dutch Central Bank. “It’s technically ready, but we won’t open it up for trading until our licence is approved,” says Kleiman.  They aren’t the only Dutch exchange with expansion plans. In January, Bitplaats announced that it was extending its service to Belgium.  So, the land of tulip mania is now home to another surging trade. If the bitcoin crash fantasies of some come to fruition, the Netherlands will be synonymous again with exuberant folly. However, the likelihood is that a crash will remain a fantasy, and perhaps bitcoin will come to be indebted to Dutch innovation.

42425461,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OZh,1392818073,Israeli Regulators Issue Joint Warning on Cryptocurrencies,"The Bank of Israel (BoI) and the Israeli Ministry of Finance have issued a joint statement calling on the public to exercise caution with regard to digital currencies.  The warning falls in line with what we’ve heard from regulators across the world over the past few months.  The Bank of Israel and the ministry stress that digital currencies are not legal tender, nor are they issued or backed by a central bank, which means there is not legal requirement for anyone to accept or exchange them.  The joint statement was issued following a meeting convened by the Governor of the Bank of Israel, with the participation of representatives from the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Department, the Israel Tax Authority, the Israel Securities Authority, and the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority.  The participants agreed to continue to examine various perspectives related to digital currencies.  Anonymous transfers, risk of fraud  Israeli regulators highlighted that digital currency transfers can be anonymous, which means they can be used to dodge taxes, launder money and finance terrorism.  Thus, financial institutions will need to take this fact into account in their risk management policies and keep the Israeli Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority in the loop.  Another problem is fraud: Israeli regulators warn that digital currencies are “fertile ground” for fraudulent activities, including Ponzi schemes. They can be used to devise innovative products and attract potential investors who don’t understand what they’re getting themselves into.  Transactions cannot be cancelled, so digital currencies offer limited recourse in case something goes wrong – a fact easily exploited by fraudsters.  Volatility and security  Unsurprisingly, volatility is also mentioned in the warning. Security is another problem addressed in the warning. Since transactions are processed using decentralised peer-to-peer networks, many of them remain anonymous and difficult to trace.  This makes digital currencies suitable for illegal activities and it also warrants attention from law enforcement authorities. Law enforcement could even close trading platforms and prevent the use of customer’s capital held by affected platforms, the regulators warn.  In addition, exchanges usually don’t operate under a license and they lack oversight. In several instances exchanges were successfully targeted by attackers and many proved unstable and prone to questionable business practices.  Theft is yet another possible problem. Since most digital currencies are stored on computers, they are susceptible to cyber attacks. In addition, the loss of a device holding the bitcoins or a wallet password can also lead to the loss of digital currencies.  Of course, experienced users know how to steer clear of such risks.  What next for Israeli users?  The warning is more or less standard, it echoes what we’ve been seeing from regulators across the world for months. Israel does not appear willing to introduce any new restrictions or prohibitions on digital currency, concluding:  “In light of the issues noted above, the Bank of Israel, the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Department, the Israel Tax Authority, the Israel Securities Authority, and the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority recommend to members of the public considering the use of decentralized virtual currencies to understand their characteristics, to be aware of the unique risks inherent in their use, and to display heightened awareness and caution. With this, the authorities in Israel join regulators in the US, Canada, the EU, and elsewhere, who have published similar warnings to the public.”  Earlier this year it emerged that Israeli regulators were taking a “wait and see” approach – they were waiting to see what the rest of the world would do about cryptocurrencies.  For all intents and purposes, the use of digital currencies in Israel remains legal and unregulated, despite this latest warning.

42422937,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymth,1392809042,Dubai Pizzeria Becomes First Merchant in the UAE to Accept Bitcoin,"Another milestone has just been passed in bitcoin’s bid for global domination. Notably, a restaurant in Dubai has become the first in the United Arab Emirates to accept payments in the digital currency.  In fact, The Pizza Guys, as the artisan pizzeria is called, is one of the very first merchants to offer a physical outlet for cryptocurrency in the whole of the Middle East. According to CoinMap, the restaurant was beaten to the number one slot by a grilled meat eatery in Israel.  Belief in bitcoin  The restaurant’s owners, husband and wife team Amber Haque and Rami Badawi, say they decided to enter the world of cryptocurrency partly to give customers more options for payment, partly to save on fees themselves, but also to participate in something new and interesting.  “We have been reading and thinking about bitcoin for some time,” said Haque.  “However, we decided to accept it as a form of payment for our business primarily because we believe in it. We want to participate and lend support to the movement.”  “For the restaurant, there are two main advantages,” she continued. “First, we are casting a wider net in terms of accepted forms of payment. Second, 20% to 30% of our revenue comes from credit card sales and carry a transaction cost of 2.25%. As our business grows, that 2.25% will become more significant to our bottom line.”  “Dubai is a city full of tourists, and for them, it is an even bigger advantage. They can pay in bitcoin without having to shoulder the associated foreign exchange fees.”  Taking risks  Compared with some other parts of the world, bitcoin is still not widely owned in the Middle East, so it’s hard to imagine too many customers turning up with bitcoin wallets on their phones. Could the restaurant's decision to accept payments in BTC be merely a PR stunt, or is it something more altruistic?  “We had no way of anticipating the response and interest this story has generated. We knew we were the first in the UAE – restaurant or otherwise – to accept bitcoin. We still have a hunch that we are the first in the Middle East.”  “We believe bitcoin can take off in the Middle East,” she said, “but like all decisions, this one will either blow up in our face or be the most forward thinking.”  Since the announcement a week ago, the restaurant has had three bitcoin transactions. However, among those who know about bitcoin, or even trade in it, “the response has been nothing short of triumphant”, said Haque.  She added: “In fact, this Thursday, a local bitcoin group will be having their meetup at The Pizza Guys.”  While the pizzeria may be the first to accept bitcoin in the Middle East, it should not come as a surprise: “The UAE, and Dubai in particular, is entrepreneurial at its core.”  Historic precedent  It’s worth noting that restaurant's move into the cryptocurrency arena echoes a rather important moment in bitcoin's short history.  One of the very first bitcoin transactions was the purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC back in 2010, a time when no one was taking bitcoin for anything and the value of a coin was down below one US cent.  At today’s rates, those bitcoins would be worth around $6.24m. Just imagine what the 0.034 bitcoin it costs for a vegetarian pizza at The Pizza Guys this week will be worth in another four years.

42425456,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2ORh,1392805066,eBay Building Digital Wallet That Stores 'Multiple Types' of Currency,"John Donahoe, eBay's CEO, has confirmed that the company is building a digital wallet for PayPal that can take multiple types of currency.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Donahoe dismissed calls made by activist and investor Carl Icahn, who recently called for PayPal to be spun off into an independent company. Donahoe disagreed, believing PayPal and eBay should stay just the way they are.  No spin, no spin-off  “Mobile is the most important platform shift that has happened arguably in the last decade. When mobile first started no-one would have downloaded a PayPal mobile app,” he said.  However, Donahoe points out that more than 100 million users downloaded the eBay app, with seamless PayPal integration. He also pointed out that the mobile platform helped PayPal get “viral traction”.  When asked to comment whether the spin-off would be a good idea as a hedge against digital currencies, Donahoe said digital currencies are not a threat, as they can be integrated into PayPal.  “There is nothing holding PayPal back from pursuing digital payments today, as part of eBay. In fact PayPal is pursuing digital payments and is the leading digital payments alternative in many different environments,” Donahoes said. He added:  “You can use digital currencies in the PayPal digital wallet, that’s in fact what PayPal is doing – is building a digital wallet that can take multiple types of currency.”  Bitcoin backers in eBay's ranks  Donahoe has made some positive comments about digital currencies in the past. However, this does not mean PayPal will add bitcoin to its new digital wallet.  The CEO is not alone, either. In December, PayPal president David Marcus said he is a “big fan” of bitcoin – claiming the currency is the future. However, he went on to say that he isn't ready to let people link their bitcoin wallets with PayPal accounts just yet.  Marcus pointed out that the regulatory framework has to become clearer and that volatility needs to come down before PayPal can seriously consider bitcoin. In other words, it won’t happen anytime soon.

42425458,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OTh,1392796890,Blockchain.info CEO Nic Cary Donates $10k in Bitcoin to University,"The CEO of popular bitcoin website Blockchain.info has donated $10,000 in bitcoin to the university he attended as a student.  Nic Cary graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Business Leadership Program at Washington State's University of Puget Sound in 2007. On 11th February he gave something back, contributing 14.5 BTC to the University for its 2013-14 Alumni Fund.  ""I was really lucky to be able to attend the University of Puget Sound and I had a wonderful experience – I developed amazing lifelong friendships and was challenged personally and academically every day,"" Cary said, adding that he wanted to get others on the road to success.  ""If it hadn't been for bitcoin I would still be paying back my student loans. My circumstances have put me in a position to give back and help some other students, so I'm hopeful I can make a small difference.""  He believes his could be the first bitcoin gift ever given to an American college or university.  Sherry Mondou, Vice President for Finance and Administration at the university, said she was ""delighted"" when she heard Nic wanted to make the donation.  “At the same time, we were a little uncertain how to proceed, as we had no gift policy on digital currencies and were unfamiliar with the process. But we greatly welcomed Nic’s thoughtful initiative and felt it would serve us well to learn to engage with the e-commerce world,"" she added.  The University won't be holding a position in bitcoin. Instead, it set up an account with bitcoin processor BitPay, which conducted the transaction based on the BTC/USD exchange rate at the time.  When is the right time to donate?  That raises an interesting question: when is the right time to donate bitcoin? It's a volatile currency, and the price tanked just before Cary made his donation. Had he made it a week before, the University would have received around $2,200 more if it had converted that week. Should bitcoin recover from its current Gox-induced fugue state, the chances are it'll be worth that much again, or more, in time.  How much should donors monitor the market before sending coins that will be instantly converted to fiat?  ""I'm sure some people will think I was foolish for making a donation in the middle of last week's turbulence (especially since the price was down),"" said Cary. ""I'm just not that worried about timing. I made my gift and look forward to making more in the future to amazing and deserving causes wherever they are in the world.""  Connie Gallippi, sister of BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi, runs a charitable foundation called the BitGive Foundation, which focuses on bitcoin-based donations. She admits that volatility is an issue when cashing out immediately.  ""Of course for others who see the long-term benefit and value increase of BTCs, they may decide not to cash them out right away,"" she said. ""I would consider it the same as donating stock. The recipient can decide whether to sell/cash out, or hang on to them and see what happens or integrate into a long-term funding strategy or 'rainy day' fund or whatever they choose.""  Maintaining a position in donated bitcoins makes it more complex from a taxation perspective, however, and Gallippi points out that there is still no firm guidance from the IRS. BitGive will claim donations in bitcoins similar to how organizations would handle any in-kind donation of value, such as a vehicle, she told CoinDesk.  Cary is a relative newcomer to Blockchain, assuming the CEO role in November 2013. Before that he was Manager of Customer Operations at Pipelinedeals.com, a position he assumed shortly after graduating.  The University of Puget Sound has produced at least one other bitcoin luminary: Erik Voorhees, who sold SatoshiDice last year, graduated from there in the same year as Cary.

42425460,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OXh,1392790459,Coinkite Promises to Offer Secure Storage For Bitcoin Companies,"Bitcoin debit card provider Coinkite has expanded its mission - it now wants to be the go-to provider for bitcoin companies needing safe private key storage.  The company, which shipped the first point of sale systems for its bitcoin debit cards early this year, is preparing to launch an API this summer, which will enable companies to store their bitcoins on its custom-built hardware security modules (HSMs).  ""With this API you’d have deposit and withdrawal and receiving address generation power,"" said CEO Rodolfo Novak, explaining how third parties could use its HSMs to store funds offline for their users.  The firm already uses the HSMs to store private bitcoin keys for its debit card customers. The HSMs, which it builds itself, are designed to store the keys securely. He describes them as ""bitcoin smart"", able to sign bitcoin transactions themselves.  ""Very soon we will start reselling the HSMs too, so you won’t even have to trust us with your private key,"" he said, adding that this would be a more expensive, enterprise-class solution. ""You could put one of our HSMs in your facility. We have no access to it. But this HSM would use our API to be able to facilitate every single transaction that you do.""  The solution will appeal to exchanges and online wallet companies in particular, he said. They don't want to hold all of their bitcoins in hot storage, where it is accessible online, in case they get hacked. But if they hold too much in cold storage (stored offline) they risk not having enough to cover their daily needs.  ""Those guys have huge problems with float, and they’re constantly faced with hacking attempts. Everyone is, in this industry,"" Novak said. The HSMs would enable them to keep coins accessible for online use, but in highly secured systems.  New POS machines  Coinkite is also expanding its core point of sale terminal business with a new model. Thus far, the company has sold just one type of POS machine, featuring a camera for reading QR codes, along with GSM connectivity, WiFi, and other features.  Around April, it is planning a scaled-down version that will cost a little more than half the price, said Novak. ""It will not have the QR code reader or GSM; only the WiFi capability. ""It's perfect for retail. It’s cheap, and rugged,"" he said. ""And it still takes our debit card.""  The idea is to entice even more retailer customers on board. The firm now has around 40 outlets using its bitcoin POS system across the globe, Novak said. Aside from bitcoin-related businesses, they include barbecue eateries, a couple of hotels, a bistro, a surgery clinic in Australia, and computer and electronic stores.  To this end, the firm has also rewritten the code for its online store, relaunching it last week to make the ordering process easier. It has revamped the ordering system, denominating it in fiat.  It now lists prices in 14 different fiat currencies, alongside bitcoin and litecoin, although it still only accepts payments in the virtual currencies. Fiat pricing is constantly adjusted using a weighted average from several exchange sources.  This will also make it easier for retailers to order its debit cards in bulk, he said. The firm is shipping bulk cards to retailers who then pre-load them with bitcoins and sell them for fiat currency.  This would effectively turn the retailers into exchanges for bitcoin. There is a switch on the current POS hardware that enables it to operate in either exchange or POS mode.  Exchange mode enables a retailer to effectively operate as a bitcoin ATM, buying and selling bitcoins, transferring bitcoins to the firm's debit cards, or printing out paper wallets with the coins on them.  The ability to switch this off at the terminal is important as regulators begin to hammer out the rules around bitcoins, Novak pointed out.  ""We chose to be a bitcoin company in the bitcoin way. We don’t touch fiat,"" he said. ""I find it hard to believe that the government would find a way to regulate bitcoin itself, but it may find a way to regulate the point of exchange.""  His own government of Canada recently announced that it would be regulating bitcoin, for example, but gave little detail.  The firm is also testing several other features in preparation for launch. One such capability is fund forwarding, which would enable bitcoins entering a Coinkite account to be automatically forwarded in full or in part to another bitcoin address.  ""Let’s say that you have a need to convert funds to fiat. We don’t want to prevent you from choosing the best exchange you prefer, so you can send it to BitPay, Coinbase, Bitstamp, or cold storage. You can send it to whatever you want,"" Novak concluded.  Pricing on the HSM modules has not yet been decided, but API access will be charged at a monthly rate.

The organization broke the news via blog post on 18th Februaryhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/, setting a 7th April deadline for nominations.  Voting will be held on 21st April, with multiple voting rounds set to occur if there are a large number of nominees.  In addition to the overview of the voting process, the Bitcoin Foundation provided information on how prospective nominees will be allowed to campaign for the position, as well as a list of the specific responsibilities of board members.  Nomination process  To nominate someone for the seat, you must first be a member of the Bitcoin Foundation, or you must become a member by 31 March. Voting will also be closed to members.  As the seat is an ""industry"" seat, only ""Industry Members"" can nominate and vote. Further, nominees will be required to declare their intent to run for the position.  Interested industry luminaries were also invited to inquire in more detail as to the specific functions served by board members.  Said the organization:  ""If you are an industry member or know of an industry member who would be interested in serving on the Board of Directors, we are happy to discuss further with you what the expectations and responsibilities of being a member of the board entails.""  Current board members  Once elected, the new appointee will join the seven-member board of directors at the organization. The board is comprised of one founder's seat, three individual seats and three industry seats.  Current members include chief scientist Gavin Andresen; executive director Jon Matonis; Bitcoin Magazine manager of communications Elizabeth Ploshay; founder of Ribbit Capital Micky Malka; CEO of Coinlab Peter Vessenes; and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.  Ongoing controversy  Of course, Charlie Shrem is not the only member of the Bitcoin Foundation to have fallen under scrutiny. In recent weeks, a growing number of bitcoin users have begun to call for the resignation of Karpeles after he made what some deemed misleading statements about Bitcoin protocol to the mainstream press that were later debunked by other industry figureheads.  To date, a petition to have Karpeles removed from the board has received 563 votes. It has since been passed along to the organization, the petition organizer said, though a formal response has not yet been issued.  The Bitcoin Foundation has not responded to emails from CoinDesk asking for clarity on Karpeles' standing at the organization.  Who do you believe should fill the empty spot?

42425463,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Obh,1392772493,The First US Bitcoin ATM Arrives in New Mexico,"After months of rumors and speculation, the first bitcoin ATM in the United States is now in operation.  The machine, manufactured by Lamassu, is located in a cigar bar called Imbibe in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and is being operated by Enchanted Bitcoin, run by Eric Stromberg.  Lamassu and Enchanted Bitcoin worked together to make the US bitcoin ATM a reality.  Zach Harvey, CEO of Lamassu, told CoinDesk that Stromberg was able to obtain proper regulatory permissions quickly, and that as a result, the launch occurred upon receipt of the ATM.  “He's been very good at concentrating on what had to be done to be fully compliant. Yet he kept things simple enough to manage a launch only weeks after receiving his machine.”  Compliance  New Mexico happens to be one of only two US states that do not require a money transmitter business (MSB) license to operate. The other is South Carolina.  Stromberg’s briskness has allowed his ATM to reach the US market in a short time. The absence of procedural money transmitter requirement in New Mexico may have helped, too.  Harvey told CoinDesk that Lamassu's ATMs have verification features built-in:  “We've always had compliance in mind. Our machine was designed to scan IDs barcodes and OCR for use with third party verification services.”  Compliance means that Lamassu has to remain vigilant on the latest money transmitter policies.  “It's an ongoing project. It's been a challenge to find a way to take the regulatory requirements and make them quick and painless for the end-consumer,” he said.  Physical and not just digital security is important as well, said Harvey.  “Our machines were designed to resist any standard smash-and-grab attacks. Anything more than that would render any ATM vulnerable.”  Demand  The current turnaround time for a Lamassu ATM is 10-14 weeks. Harvey told CoinDesk this is because the devices have become rather popular.  “This is only due to the recent rise in demand, we are making them and shipping them as fast as possible.”  Lamassu is building its ATMs as fast as it can, but it has competitors. Robocoin is planning to launch ATMs in Seattle and Austin, Texas, soon. Further, LocalBitcoins.com recently announced it is building a $2,732 BTC ATM of its own.  Because of this, Lamassu needs to deliver ATMs to customers as fast as possible to compete with a growing number of rivals.  “We are currently ramping up production from 40 machines a month to 60 machines a month, and then to 80 machines a month. Our goal is to build up inventory and reduce lead times to zero,"" Harvey said.  Harvey wants to be able to serve its customer base as quickly as possible.  “If people want our machine, we want to be able to give it to them now,” he said.  Lamassu ATMs are available to order. The price is $5,000 for one unit, $4,500 for 5-9 units and $4,000 for 10 units or more.  The company does accept fiat in the form of bank wires, but it prefers payment in bitcoin, according to its website.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/19/the-first-us-bitcoin-atm-arrives-in-new-mexico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adc742b2a55836add2acdeb4d2b35423d0dbe3b2-944x585.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
