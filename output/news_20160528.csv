42378715,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7la4N,1464452082,A Framework for Identity,"Dan Elitzer is a member of the IDEO coLAB, a shared platform to discover and act on the potential of new technologies, with current focuses on blockchain, digital identity, and IoT.  In this op-ed, Elitzer fleshes out a framework for how a digital identity system should function based on work performed by the IDEO coLAB team.  How do you identify yourself? Is it your name? Your email address? Phone number? Drivers license? Facebook account?  Last summer, IDEO coLAB brought together 25 students from top Boston-area universities — including Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and RISD — to design venture prototypes exploring the future of trust, transactions, and reputation. Before the programhttp://bitsblocks.ideofutures.com/about, I hadn’t given much thought to the concept of “identity” or identity systems. But abstract concepts start to take shape and become more tangible when you run into them repeatedly. Over and over throughout the summer, we saw teams wrestle with identity-related challenges as they designed their ventures:  When you’re distributing digital tokens representing voting rights for community projects, how do you ensure there’s a real person behind each account?  How can a university issue digital diplomas that graduates can prove are authentic and belong to them?  In the event of an emergency, is there a way to automatically give doctors access to your relevant medical history, while keeping it secure and private at other times?  You can probably think of some fairly straightforward answers to those questions. But when you go to implement them, you quickly find that the solution either makes fraud trivial or introduces a level of friction that users won’t tolerate.    • • •    Our exploration of digital identity continued into the fall, and in October IDEO coLAB and the MIT Digital Currency Initiativehttps://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/media-lab-digital-currency-initiative co-hosted a workshop. Students and professionals collaboratively explored how blockchain technology might play a role in solving identity-related challenges in the financial services and health care industries.  To help guide discussion at the workshop, we developed a simple framework of the core functions of an identity system. During a concurrent project, the IDEO coLAB team made a few iterations. It’s not perfect, but we’ve found it useful for organizing our thinking and analyzing where blockchains and other emerging technology might be applicable:  Issue  Whether it’s the US government assigning Social Security Numbers or Google letting you select an email address, there needs to be a way to create new identities and assign identifiers.  Store  Identity data needs to be stored somewhere. Usually this is a private database with administrator-controlled access, but technologies like IPFS and Blockstack are examples of new models for data storage and retrieval.  Authenticate  Individuals need to prove they are who they say they are when attempting to assert their identity. This is done using one or more factors of authentication: something you know (a password), something you have (a mobile phone), or something you are (photo or fingerprint). For example, think of what happens when you present your drivers license at a bar or airport. The person inspecting it looks at your photo, then at you, to make sure you’re the person represented on the card.  Authorize  Once they’ve authenticated themselves, individuals are authorized to perform certain tasks. Whether it’s being able to access the transaction history for your bank account or being able to enter a bar, identity systems get utility from enabling you to take actions and interact with people or businesses based on knowing who you are or certain information about you.  Recover  Stolen wallet or forgotten password? Individuals need a way to regain access to their identity data, should they lose it.  (Note: This is often the part of the process where the usability vs security tradeoff is most stark — protecting an account with a random 32-character password and fingerprint isn’t much good if “recovery” can be done using your zip code and the last four digits of your social security number. Conversely, asking the average user to print a recovery key when they create their account is absurd.)  Update  Users or administrators need to be able to add, remove, or edit attributes associated with an identity. Pieces of our identity information change over time: an address gets changed, a new degree is earned, a drivers license expires, etc. Digital identities need to evolve along with the people they represent.  Audit  How can someone check that your identity data is accurate?  In the context of regulated industries such as financial services or health care, identity data and the process by which it is recorded and accessed needs to be auditable by relevant government institutions. For user-controlled identity systems like PGP, code is open source and trusted parties that host data (e.g., Keybase) ideally go to great lengths to enable public auditing.    • • •    From our experience, these are the core components of any identity system. Each presents its own unique challenges for system design and opportunities for creating better user experiences. How will the system be used? How might it be hacked or exploited? Is a universal digital identity system possible or desirable…and by whom?  We will continue to use this framework within IDEO coLAB as a starting point for our work around the future of digital identity, which we’re pursuing in ways both big and small. One example is the machine shop certification system we prototyped over one week – you can read about it here. Identity is also relevant for things, not just people, so we’ll be extending this theme in context of our Internet of Things + Blockchain Fellowshiphttp://bitsblocks.ideofutures.com/iot-blockchain/ this summer.  We look forward to sharing more about what we’re thinking and doing in this space over the coming months. If you’re interested in learning more, visit our website and sign up for our newsletter.

42378701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZrn,1464445219,A Right to Exist: Using Technology to Create Better ID Systems,"Steven Malby is head of the Law Development Section of the Rule of Law Division for the Commonwealth Secretariat, the executive arm of the Commonwealth of Nations intergovernmental organisation.  In this opinion piece, Malby explores the challenges in bringing legal identity to the more than 1 billion people who lack recognition from governments worldwide and the steps taken thus far to find a solution.  Out of more than 7 billion people in the world, 1.5 billion officially do not exist. That is, they do not have a form of identity that is legally recognised by governments.  Sadly, it is all too easy not to exist. Simply being born as a member of a nomadic group in a remote rural area where birth registration is sporadic may suffice. Armed conflict, persecution or forced displacement can take away everything, including invaluable legal documentation.  Criminal groups engaged in trafficking in persons or smuggling of migrants forcibly take passports from victims, cementing the process of dehumanization and commodification.  Without legal identity, people cannot access basic health or education services. They cannot open a bank account, rent or buy property, get a job or vote. Those fleeing war or persecution cannot prove their origin. Identity is critical to reuniting displaced children with parents and family.  In the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, Goal 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions, recognizes the right of all to legal identity, including birth registration.  And yet, ‘legal identity’ is a complex and nuanced concept. It both empowers and invokes concern over privacy and the risk of discrimination. Legal identity can be evidenced in multiple ways: through a birth certificate, a passport, or a national identity card, all used at different times, for different purposes, and in different combinations.  Across the Commonwealth, a wide range of birth registration, citizenship and even digital identity laws govern legal identity systems.  Identity systems need to provide an official identity for the six-year-old girl in rural Africa whose birth was never registered, has never attended school and been displaced across borders by conflict. Those systems need to do so whilst protecting her right to privacy, and to process information held about her in a way that is secure and reveals only what is necessary to those who need to know.  Delivering legal identity for 1.5 billion people by 2030 is an immense undertaking. It requires new approaches and ways of thinking.  This month, the Commonwealth Secretariat joined forces in a unique summit of private sector enterprises, non-governmental organisations and states at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, to explore ways in which emerging technologies could contribute to this target.  The summit, entitled ‘ID2020,’ explored the realities of life without identity. It considered ways in which digital identity systems based on ‘blockchain’ technology could support legal identity for all, including through public-private partnerships. The Secretariat shared experience of legal identity laws from across the Commonwealth, and discussed the needs of member countries with emerging technology firms.  The ID2020 summit will be held every year to provide a platform for action and dialogue between technology innovators, states and international organisations. As a first step in realising the target of legal identity for all, Commonwealth Senior Officials of Law Ministries will review Commonwealth laws on legal and digital identity at their forthcoming meeting in October 2016.  The Commonwealth Secretariat is also leading the way in testing digital identity systems through its work on development of a blockchain-based app for the Commonwealth network of criminal justice contact points.  ID2020 represents not only a significant step forward towards realisation of Sustainable Development Goal 16, but also Goal 17, on revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.  The Commonwealth Secretariat will play its full role, supporting and partnering with member countries, and the global community, to promote the rule of law and ensure for all a right to exist.
