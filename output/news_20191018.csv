A spokesperson said Monday that FDAS' license application with New York State is still pending while more clients are being added to test the platform.  The business had initially been expected to be open in the first quarter of 2019.  In an interview published Friday with Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson, the FT said:  ""Fidelity started adding clients in the first quarter and is now engaged in a full rollout of its custody and trading services for digital assets — a boon to what is a fragmented and complicated industry, Ms Johnson told the FT in a rare interview.""  CoinDesk reported in February that Fidelity's crypto custody and trading services platform was being tested by a limited number of clients including hedge funds, family offices and financial advisors.  The $2.8 trillion asset manager is one of the first established traditional financial institutions to offer digital asset custody services as other peers are still waiting to see how the crypto industry comes into formation.  While there are several platforms providing similar services, Johnson said Fidelity's large client base and network were distinct advantages.  Coinbase, for example, “is still a company that most people had never heard of, and they don’t have the existing relationships with the independent advisers,” Johnson told the FT.  That crypto exchange, looking after billions of dollars of digital assets, was approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, and launched its custody services for third parties last October.  On crypto, in general, Johnson said, “If you’re either interested or technically adept, then it’s not really that big of a deal.""

42382863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBOB,1571432409,"With 18 Million Bitcoins Mined, How Hard Is That 21 Million Limit?","In a matter of hours, the 18 millionth bitcoin will have been mined and the world’s first cryptocurrency will draw one step closer to its hard-coded cap of 21 million coins.  “The pie is shrinking. This [milestone] gives people some simple math to raise awareness about where we’re at in the [bitcoin mining] process,” said Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards platform Lolli, adding:  “It’s good for people to see the progress of bitcoin, to look back on everything that has been done and will be done for the next 3 million. … You should pay attention to the next 3 million.”  But don’t worry, you’ll have 120 years to do so.  The next 3 million bitcoins will be progressively slower to mine as a result of block reward halvings which occur every 210,000 blocks (or roughly four years) and reduce new bitcoin supply by 50 percent. The final bitcoin is expected to be mined in 2140.  Or is it?  It seems blasphemous even to go there, given bitcoin's value proposition as digital gold. But outsiders foresee a day when the 21 million cap might, gasp, come up for debate.  Eventually, once there are no more bitcoins left to mint, miners will rely solely on transaction fees, which are paid by users to transfer coins through the blockchain. This change gives cause for concern to some who view bitcoin's block subsidies as integral to bitcoin's incentive system.  To skeptics, this could undermine the structure that motivates miners to record validated transactions in the ledger.  “All of your assumptions about incentives, risk and value go out the window,"" said Angela Walch, a research fellow at the University College London Centre for Blockchain Technologies. ""Please take the blinders off and stop assuming that everything will still work well once everything goes to a pure transaction-fees system as opposed to block [subsidy].”  Currently, with each block, miners get a subsidy of 12.5 newly created BTC, worth roughly $99,370, plus any additional transaction fees, which normally don’t total more than 1 BTC.  Along the same lines, Paul Brody, global innovation leader for audit firm Ernst & Young (EY), said bitcoin’s limited supply could limit the cryptocurrency’s utility as a global reserve currency.  Pointing to situations such as the Great Recession where monetary policy interventions were needed to lift the U.S. out of economic turmoil, Brody said:  “If bitcoin were to become a substantial part of the global monetary system, we would need to address [the hard supply cap] because a lot of economists agree deflationary systems are not necessarily the best thing.”  What next?  Both Walch and Brody suggested that bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap might one day be subject to change. What if?  “We need to acknowledge that the 21 million cap is aspirational,” said Walch. “If people decide to change that [supply] cap for certain reasons and enough people make that decision, the system will move to it. It’s aspiration, not reality.”  While technically feasible, a change to the supply cap would almost certainly be a non-starter for bitcoin users who cherish its gold-like properties. Indeed, bitcoin’s code has long been governed by a community with a bias toward retaining the coin’s original features as created by its pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Unlike ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, the bitcoin blockchain has rarely seen backward-incompatible, system-wide upgrades changing core code features.  In the rare instances it has, the bitcoin community has gone through fierce governance disputes – such as the infamous scaling debates of 2017, which centered on a potential increase to bitcoin’s block size. The philosophical rift ultimately resulted in the creation of bitcoin cash in August 2017.  Still, a prospective hard fork that would change bitcoin’s 21-million-coin supply cap is conceivable, if perhaps heretical.  “It’s not a given that bitcoin has to stay at that 21 million hard limit,” said EY’s Brody (who, it should be noted, is building enterprise applications on top of rival chain ethereum). “There is a governance mechanism to permit changes in bitcoin – if the community agrees that would be good.”  The other side  Even so, bitcoin advocate and author Andreas Antonopoulos stressed that governance drama surrounding bitcoin’s supply cap is nothing to lose sleep over – especially since bitcoin’s transition to a purely transaction-fee rewards model will take 120 years.  Antonopoulos added that from the very launch of bitcoin in 2009, mining was always “a marginally profitable endeavor” never intended to stay constant.  “[Mining rewards] dynamically adjust based on the network. … It's a very complex economic environment. It's not as simple as people think,” said Antonopoulos, adding:  “There are half a dozen variables that determine miner profitability [right now] including the cost of electricity, their access to bandwidth transaction, the block subsidy, the transaction fees at the time, bitcoin price, their local currency exchange rate, the type of equipment and how efficient it is at converting electricity into mining.”  As such, Antonopoulos says the concerns surrounding a transition from a block subsidy to purely transaction-based block rewards are grossly overblown.  “Nothing magical happens when block subsidy drops to zero,” said Antonopoulos. “It’s a very gradual and predictable change that happens over a period of 120 years. It’s already happening and every day [miners] make their decisions.”  While the 18th million bitcoin may not be the best reminder of the ongoing reality of a limited supply cap, the next upcoming milestone on bitcoin’s horizon assuredly will.  Viewing the next bitcoin halving as a far more notable event in bitcoin’s history, venture capitalist William Mougayar said:  “In my opinion, [the 18 million] milestone is not that significant in relation to the next halving which occurs May 2020. … On that date, the block [subsidy] will go from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.”  Andreas Antonopoulos image via Christine Kim for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/18/with-18-million-bitcoins-mined-how-hard-is-that-21-million-limit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc08e0d9dc4bf88c9ed17e13f862c234167062a8-1813x1049.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382852,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBc1,1571427014,"FATF Joins BIS in Calling Stablecoins 'Global Risk,' Citing Money Laundering Concerns","Stablecoins pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk to the world, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said Friday.  In documents released after its latest meeting, the intergovernmental organization referred to cryptocurrencies as a ""major strategic initiative,"" and said cryptos whose values are pegged to fiat currencies could have a particularly big impact.  Some 800 representatives from 205 jurisdictions met from Oct. 16 to Oct. 18 to discuss various issues under the jurisdiction of FATF, led this year by Xiangmin Liu of China, according to the publication. Crypto-related concerns were front and center.  While the document addressed cryptocurrencies broadly, it singled out stablecoins on multiple occasions, writing:  ""Emerging assets such as so-called global 'stablecoins', and their proposed global networks and platforms, could potentially cause a shift in the virtual asset ecosystem and have implications for the money laundering and terrorist financing risks. There are two concerns: mass-market adoption of virtual assets and person-to-person transfers, without the need for a regulated intermediary. Together these changes could have serious consequences for our ability to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.""  A second document  , titled ""Money laundering risks from 'stablecoins' and other emerging assets,"" said the FATF will continue to examine the characteristics and perceived risks of stablecoins and may even clarify or update its virtual currency guidance to better address this class of cryptocurrency.  ""The FATF will continue to ensure its standards remain relevant and responsive and it will report to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in 2020 on the risks from global 'stablecoins' and other emerging assets,"" the second document read.  The FATF's warning followed a report from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies and the and Bank of International Settlements (BIS) calling stablecoins a growing threat to monetary policy, financial stability and competition.  Report cards  During its session, the FATF determined how it would evaluate countries' implementation of its last guidance on digital assets and will add this process to its current mutual evaluation procedure.  In June, FATF called on national financial services and banking regulators to implement a strict know-your-client/anti-money-laundering regime, going so far as to require exchanges and wallet providers, dubbed virtual asset service providers (VASPs), to hold KYC information for recipients of transactions originating on their platforms.  ""Countries that have already undergone their mutual evaluation will be required to report back during their follow-up process on the actions they have taken in this area,"" Friday's document said.  The document made it clear that FATF member countries are required to implement its standards for digital assets, as well as other emerging asset classes.  ""Given the global nature of virtual assets, it is essential that countries implement these requirements swiftly, in particular understanding the risks and ensuring the effective supervision of the sector,"" one document read.  Digital identity  In addition to its concerns about stablecoins, the FATF discussed the increasing importance of digital identity in payment systems, according to the document.  ""In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards digital payments. The number of transactions [is] growing at over 12 percent every year,"" the document read. ""Customer identification is essential to prevent criminals and terrorists from raising and moving funds. However, in the growing digital world, different customer identification methods exist.""  As a result, the FATF plans to release draft guidance on digital identity for public comment. While the section did not discuss blockchain-based digital identity tools, a number of companies in the crypto industry are looking to create secure digital identity systems.  The guidance focuses on a ""risk-based approach to using digital ID systems,"" the document says, citing due diligence requirements as one issue.

42382840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBPR,1571425528,"Kik Sells Messaging App, Reaffirms Kin Crypto Integration","The Kik messaging platform has been bought by MediaLab, a holding company which operates Whisper and a number of other apps, the company announced Friday.  Kik Interactive, the company behind the messaging platform, previously announced that it would be shutting the app down in October, though CEO Ted Livingston announced last week that a company had signed a letter of intent to purchase the app. Details of the sale were not disclosed.  ""We believe that Kik’s best days remain ahead of it,"" the blog post read. While MediaLab plans to commit to Kik long-term, the company is looking to raise revenue through the messaging app, and will integrate ads on the platform as a short-term effort to do so. (Livingston has previously pushed back against the idea of enabling ads on the platform.)  Kik Interactive, the company behind the messaging platform, is currently embroiled in a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged Kik violated securities law when it raised $100 million in a token sale in late 2017. Livingston vowed to fight the SEC, but announced in late September that Kik would be shutting down the messaging app portion of its business. Livingston directly attributed this shutdown to the SEC fight in a blog post at the time.  Livingston did pledge that the company would continue to build out the Kin ecosystem, referring to the cryptocurrency Kik built as part of the token sale process.  In Friday's blog post, MediaLab said the messaging app would continue to enable kin transactions, writing:  ""We are fans of Kin and believe in its long term potential. We are excited to further partner with Ted and his team on expanding the Kin integration and have plans to further support the project. We’ll have more to share on that front soon.""  Going forward, MediaLab plans to improve the app, reduce the number of bugs, and solicit feedback from the app's users to determine what features they want or issues they have.  ""Ted Livingston and the rest of the team at Kik have spent the last 9 years building something truly special,"" the announcement read. ""At the risk of sounding cheesy we are still passionate believers in what the internet promised to bring in its early days - a connected and shared experience amongst people regardless of geography or time zone.

Based in London and founded in 2018, Archax’s front-end trade activities will remain ""blockchain agnostic,"" the firm said, but a private, permissioned version of Corda was needed for managing data following trades.  “The current post-trade process in traditional financial markets is hugely inefficient, with many intermediaries involved,” Archax CEO Graham Rodford said in a statement. “This partnership … [will] remove friction and streamline activities to improve efficiency and reduce cost.”  The firm added that its request to operate a multilateral trading facility (MTF) in London is being considered by the Financial Conduct Authority.  The partnership comes months after R3 hired software sales veteran Cathy Minter as chief revenue officer to boost business adoption of R3’s Corda Enterprise.

42382845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBUT,1571400233,"Fake Tor Browser Has Been Spying, Stealing Bitcoin 'For Years'","Hackers have been distributing a compromised version of the official Tor Browser that's packed with malicious tools used to both spy on users and steal their bitcoin.  Discovered by researchers at IT security firm ESET, the trojanized Tor has apparently resulted in a relatively small amount of bitcoin being lost to date, with funds taken by address swapping when users try to pay on dark net markets.  In an announcement emailed to CoinDesk on Friday, ESET's senior malware researcher, Anton Cherepanov, said the research had identified three bitcoin wallets used by the hackers since 2017.  ""Each such wallet contains relatively large numbers of small transactions; we consider this a confirmation that these wallets indeed were used by the trojanized Tor Browser,” Cherepanov explained.  At the time the research was completed, the three wallets had received 4.8 bitcoin (worth $38,700 at press time), though ESET said the actual amount stolen would be higher as wallets for the Russian payments service QIWI are also targeted.  The hacking campaign has been targeting Russian-speaking users of Tor – a network designed to keep identities hidden to avoid tracking and surveillance.  The cybercriminals behind the fake Tor browser have been using forums and pastebin.com to distribute their offering as the official Russian language version of the app.  ""Their goal was to lure language-specific targets to a pair of malicious – yet legitimate-looking – websites,"" said ESET.  On first website, the user receives an alert that their Tor Browser is out of date, even if not true. Visitors who are duped by the message are then redirected to a second website with an installer for the fake app.  Once installed, the malware-laden browser enables its creators to know what websites a user visits, to change the data on visited pages and grab the content of data forms. While the hackers could potentially display false information to users, the browser has only been observed to change the wallet addresses for the purposes of stealing bitcoin, Cherepanov said.

42382884,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBm5,1571398246,Looming Death Cross Suggests Bitcoin May Be Nearing Price Bottom,"View  Bitcoin's 50- and 200-day moving averages (MAs)look set to produce a death cross in the next week or two. Historical data shows the cryptocurrency could bottom out if the cross is confirmed.  BTC may drop to support near $7,430 before then.  A break above $8,820 is needed to invalidate the bearish lower-highs set up and confirm a bullish reversal.      Bitcoin may be close to bottoming out, as a popular contrary indicator is teasing a bearish turn for the first time since March 2018.  Potentially producing a so-called death cross, the 50-day moving average is falling fast and may drop below the 200-day MA over the next week or so. If confirmed, the chart event would be the first such crossover of these averages since March of last year.  A death cross is a long-term bear market indicator, according to technical analysis theory. In reality, however, it is a lagging indicator and often ends up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, as seen in the charts below.  The 50-day MA fell below the 200-day MA on March 31, 2018 (above left), following which the sell-off stalled around $6,500 and the cryptocurrency rose back to highs near $10,000 in the first week of May.  Note that the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions when the crossover happened.  A market is often oversold by the time a cross is confirmed, as the MAs are based on past data and the crossovers are a product of price rallies or sell-offs.        In mid-September, 2015, bitcoin's pullback from highs near $250 also ran out of steam near $220 with the confirmation of a death cross.  The cryptocurrency remained sidelined in the range of $220–$250 in the following weeks before breaking into a bull market at the end of October 2015. What followed was a meteoric rise to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.  The impending crossover may also turn out to be a bear trap, as bitcoin will most likely be oversold by then, having dropped more than 40 percent already from June's high of $13,800.  Additionally, the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and may repeat history by picking up a strong bid six months ahead of the event, as pointed out by popular analyst @100trillionUSD.  That said, the ongoing pullback from the recent highs above $8,800 looks to have legs, as per the technical charts. Therefore, bitcoin will likely remain on the defensive in the days leading up to the crossover and bottom-out below recent lows near $7,750.  The spread between the 50- and 200-day MAs currently stands at $417 – the narrowest since early May – and indicates that bullish sentiment is at its weakest in over five months.  Daily, 6-hour and weekly chart  Bitcoin bounced up from the 100-week moving average last week and witnessed a double bottom breakout on the 6-hour chart (above left).  Even so, the cryptocurrency failed to take out the 200-day MA on Oct.11 (above right) and has dropped to levels below $8,000, forming a bearish lower high pattern above $8,800.  Put simply, the bearish sentiment is still quite strong and a deeper slide below the 100-week moving average at $7,755, possibly to support near $7,430 (multiple daily lows in early June) could be in the offing ahead of the death cross confirmation.  The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above $8,820, invalidating the bearish lower highs setup.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

However, the October report, argues that widely adopted asset-pegged cryptocurrencies, or stablecoins, such as Libra are a growing threat to monetary policy, financial stability and competition.  Widely adopted stablecoins, dubbed ""global stablecoins"" in the report, have the potential to reach an international audience and have “significant adverse effects” on the current economic system, it argues.  Meanwhile, “[first generation cryptocurrencies like bitcoin] have suffered from highly volatile prices, limits to scalability, complicated user interfaces and issues in governance and regulation, among other challenges. Thus, cryptoassets have served more as a highly speculative asset class for certain investors and those engaged in illicit activities rather than as a means to make payments.""  Stablecoin taxonomy – defined as a money equivalent, contractual or property claim, or right against an issuer for an asset – will remain a preeminent legal question for the time being, the report continues. The effects of stablecoins on incumbent money systems such as wire transfers have yet to be fully understood as well.  While stablecoins may offer faster, cheaper and more inclusive payments, they can ""only be realized if significant risks are addressed.""  In a footnote, the G7 report says the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority's (FINMA) handling of the Libra Association, which falls under the regulator’s purview in Geneva, agrees with the G7’s stablecoin recommendations.  FINMA recently said Libra highlights the need for international coordination and ""appropriate prudential requirements"" for all services offered over that of a payment system.  The report on stablecoins was prepared at the request of the G7 in July, soon after the launch of Libra back in June. While obviously directed in part at the project, the report only mentioned Libra in one footnote.  Responding to the G7, the Libra Association sent out a memo Friday saying the stablecoin is ""not intended to change the role and influence of central bankers,"" adding:  ""Wallets and other financial services operating on the Libra Network (including exchanges and other on and off ramps) will have to comply with regulations, such as local capital controls, which can be tailored to prevent large scale flights from local currency to Libra coins in emerging markets.""

42382864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBQh,1571387445,What to Make of the SEC's Latest Bitcoin ETF Rejection,"The Takeaway:  The SEC rejected the latest bitcoin ETF proposal last week, though it wasn't entirely unexpected.  The decision clarified the SEC’s concerns, which mainly revolve around market manipulation.  Legal experts say a bitcoin ETF could be years away – because, in the eyes of regulators, the bitcoin market is too small and immature to support a fund right now.  The SEC suggested that a surveillance-sharing agreement between a regulated exchange and a bitcoin market of “significant” size might help allay its unease.  Bitwise and others see this as an opening. Some experts remain unconvinced.      The bitcoin market isn’t yet mature enough to support an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  So said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week when it rejected Bitwise’s bitcoin ETF proposal in a mammoth 112-page order that included more than 500 footnotes.  Legal experts said the decision suggests that a bitcoin ETF may still be years away. But Matt Hougan, Bitwise's global head of research, sees positives in the decision. The SEC has at least shown it’s willing to raise addressable concerns, rather than rejecting a product out-of-hand with little explanation.  “A bad outcome would have been a cursory [filing],” Hougan told CoinDesk, adding:  “After digesting it a little bit, we’re pleased with the detail the staff provided and the clarity of what we have to do.”  Zachary Fallon, a principal at Blakemore Fallon, said that while Bitwise’s effort may not have been successful, the process was revealing – and will almost certainly help when launching a bitcoin ETF at some point in the future.  Market manipulation  The SEC worries about the bitcoin market because of the potential for manipulation, said Lindsay Danas-Cohen, general counsel and chief operating officer at crypto exchange and brokerage Velocity Markets.  Bitwise pointed to its research showing that 95 percent of crypto trading is fake as proof that it understands the market. Perhaps understandably, this didn’t help the company's case.  “Bitwise tried to get out in front of these arguments by asserting they’re very aware that only 5 percent of the bitcoin spot markets are ‘real’ and I commend that effort,” Danas-Cohen told CoinDesk.  But Fallon, a former SEC senior counsel, said Bitwise did not explain how the exchanges with “real” volume were insulated from the prices found on other platforms.  He added:  “Bitwise did not address the concern that the price quoted on legitimate digital asset trading platforms is itself influenced by the weight of the other 95 percent and the prices quoted there. So it’s like the tail wagging the dog, or the dog wagging the tail, and the SEC said, ‘You need to address that risk.’”  Surveillance sharing  The solution to this issue, according to the SEC, may be surveillance-sharing agreements between national exchanges sponsoring ETFs (such as NYSE Arca, which filed the actual ETF proposal for Bitwise) and regulated markets.  “Until an ETF sponsor can satisfy the SEC's demand for surveillance-sharing agreements – or until the SEC changes its view on the Exchange Act (which almost certainly means waiting for a new Chairman) – there will be no bitcoin ETF,” Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance, told CoinDesk in a Twitter DM.  Chervinsky does not see this happening anytime soon:  “The SEC once again strongly rejected the idea that a bitcoin ETF sponsor can satisfy Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) without entering surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size, and given bitcoin's current market structure, it's very unlikely that any sponsor will be able to enter such agreements within the next couple years.”  (The SEC previously defined a “significant market” as one that where an individual trying to manipulate an exchange-traded product would have to trade on the same market, meaning a surveillance-sharing agreement would help in identifying any would-be manipulators.)  Notably, Danas-Cohen said the fresh emphasis on a surveillance-sharing agreement differs from previous disapprovals.  She speculated that, should the SEC greenlight an ETF in the future, it would want to point to such an agreement as evidence that it did everything in its power to protect against market manipulation.  “It’s just something tangible that the SEC can point to and review explicitly and say, 'Hey, broader world, this is exactly what we’re relying on and this is why we think that fraud and manipulation are rightfully off the table as significant concerns in the space,’” she said.  Philip Liu, chief legal officer and co-founder of investment firm Arca, noted that the SEC’s new order scarcely raised concerns about digital asset custody – a break from previous rejections that have focused on this issue.  “I assume that the custody issues are pretty much moot at this point,” he said.  There are a number of reputable “custodians” in the space now, including Coinbase Custody and Paxos Trust Company, and increased transparency between these entities and the regulators could help the SEC become more comfortable with the issue, Danas-Cohen said.  Moonshot  It seems unlikely that the SEC will approve an ETF for launch in the near future. Arca's Liu told CoinDesk that the SEC took a thorough look at the question and “pretty much put the kibosh” on the concept.  For his part, Chervinsky does not expect an ETF before the latter half of 2020.  “It’s reasonable to assume that Jay Clayton's SEC will never approve a bitcoin ETF,” he added on Twitter.  Clayton’s term is set to end in June 2021, but under SEC rules he could remain in office until 2023 if not replaced. The SEC chairman has long been an outspoken skeptic of the bitcoin market, saying as recently as last month that sponsors and companies applying for an ETF have work to do addressing issues such as market manipulation.  Danas-Cohen said she would be surprised if an ETF was approved over the next year:  “Under the current regime, I think it’s going to be difficult for an applicant to get all its ducks in a row in a manner that would give the SEC comfort. I think it would take a bit longer for the SEC to wrap their arms around the space.”  Chervinsky says the SEC’s current perspective on the Exchange Act comes directly from Chairman Clayton.  “It was the crux of the Commissioners’ denial of the Winklevoss ETF appeal in July 2017,” he said.  The SEC did not write the latest rejection. Instead, it delegated the task to the Division of Trading and Markets, Fallon noted. He said this could be because the commissioners do not have much to add on top of what they wrote in the Winklevoss rejection.  Next steps  The rejection won’t stop Bitwise. Hougan said the SEC has provided enough detail for his company to file again at a future date, though Bitwise has not yet decided when it will re-file.  “I don’t think anything [the SEC] said [that was] fundamental to the bitcoin market was impossible to meet,” he said, adding:  “It’s just a matter of answering their questions and providing them with yet more extensive data.”  Bitwise intends to explore surveillance-sharing agreements and it isn’t alone. VanEck and SolidX, which withdrew their ETF proposal with Cboe BZX in September, are also likely to re-file their rule change proposal at some future date.  Asked if he expects an ETF to one day be approved, Hougan said:  “I think if we can satisfy their requests, yeah, absolutely. I don’t think the commissioners or the Commission is inherently anti-bitcoin or crypto, I just think they’re appropriately cautious.”  Others remain less certain.  Bitwise did “move the baton further down the line,” but that’s no guarantee the company will get an ETF approved, Fallon said.  He likened the approval process for the ETF to convincing his parents to let him drive a car. There was an initial struggle, but, after a certain point, his parents gave in.  Assuming Bitwise – or another company – can answer the market manipulation issues, there is no reason why an ETF won’t be approved eventually, he said.  Danas-Cohen said identifying what a “significant market” consists of is another step that Bitwise needs to take if it wants to establish a surveillance-sharing agreement.  But for other observers, doubts remain.  Said Arca's Liu:  “The takeaway is, I just don’t see how it can be approved at this stage – for anybody that comes in.""

42382876,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBiJ,1571382129,Tourists in Popular Japanese Region Could Soon Use a Local Cryptocurrency,"Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI) and an Osaka-based railway company are issuing a local cryptocurrency for use in a popular tourist area in Japan's Mie Prefecture.  The MRI, formed in 1970 by Mitsubishi Group companies, said on Wednesday that the token, dubbed Kintetsu Shimakaze Coin, will be utilizing blockchain and is available only from Nov. 11 to Jan. 31 next year.  It is the fourth such unit created by the two companies as they work to refine the technology and develop relevant processes, procedures and services.  The experiment is a highly limited trial and will take place in the Ise-Shima region, a peninsular area known for its beaches, seafood, pearl cultivation and a national park. Only 15 establishments in the region will accept the coin, including the Shima Spain Village, Miyako Resort Shima Bayside Terrace, Kashikojima Espana Cruise and the Makonde Art Museum.  While the token will be temporary just for the pilot, Kintetsu hopes to eventually issue a permanent cryptocurrency for use along its railway lines, according to a news report from Nikkei.  To use the cryptocurrency, which is a stablecoin pegged to the Japanese yen, users must download the Kintetsu Shimakaze Coin app for registration.  They will be able to top up in 1,000 yen blocks, paying a 10 percent premium, up to 100,000 yen in total. Transfers of the coin will be possible between participants. At the end of the trial period, the coin will be retired and cannot be used.  The Kintetsu Group, the local company partnering with MRI, is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and owns transportation assets including lines into the targeted area of the program.

According to a report from the Korea Herald on Monday, the project is aimed to lower trading costs, which tend to be high for over-the-counter (OTC) stocks at the moment with a series of manual processes, and to improve security and address information imbalances between buyers and sellers.  The report added it will be possible to trade up to 4,000 securities on the platform with Samsung Securities managing the trading process.  When introduced next year, the blockchain component will allow for the verification of identities and the processing of the transactions. In particular, it will automate the updating of certain shareholder lists in a distributed fashion that currently have to be maintained by hand.  ""Most unlisted stock transactions in South Korea are made via online community bulletin boards and offline trades, leading to uncertainties surrounding the parties’ identities and the information needed in the investment,"" Dunamu's chief strategy officer Lim Ji-hoon was quoted as saying.  Blockchain for the trading of unlisted securities is already receiving attention in Korea.

The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) signed an agreement last week with Malaysia’s Maybank to determine how the banks’ respective digital payment platforms - Bakong and Maybank2u - can work in tandem to reduce often crippling remittance fees.  Any breakthrough would be welcome for residents of the two Southeast Asian nations. Though separated only by the Gulf of Thailand, Cambodia’s chief central banker H.E. Chea Serey told the Khmer Times that remittance fees can range as high as 30%.  That can change with the new partnership, Chea Serey said in the new announcement.  “The introduction of Bakong system will provide more possibilities in enhancing payment system at both domestic and regional level”  Bakong launched in July and now accepts users from eight separate Cambodian banks, including ACLEDA Bank - the country’s largest commercial bank with over $5 billion in assets last year.  Bakong’s potential linking with Maybank2u could tap into a much wider audience. A spokesperson for Maybank, the country's largest bank, said that 52% of all Malaysian online banking transactions went through Maybank2u.  “We look forward to providing our customers in Malaysia and Cambodia with a convenient yet cost effective solution for inter-country funds transfer,” said Datuk Hamirullah Boorhan, Head of Community Financial Services for Maybank Malaysia.

42382855,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBeX,1571371233,Huobi Plans to Open Fiat Gateway with Lira-Tether Pairing in Turkey,"Global crypto exchange Huobi plans to roll out a fiat gateway in Turkey that could increase access to more than 250 cryptocurrencies for local investors.  The move comes as Turkey puts forward a clearer legal framework for the crypto market in a country where many people already hold cryptocurrencies, Mohit Davar, Huobi’s EMEA regional president, told CoinDesk.  The company is announcing the project at the Eurasia Blockchain Summit in Istanbul on Friday.  Huobi announced in June that it intended to get more involved in the Turkish crypto market, but did not disclose details about the expansion at the time.  Davar said the exchange has partnered with one of the largest local banks to build the infrastructure and compliance standards for the fiat gateway, but declined to name the local bank partner.  He said Huobi would announce the partnership at a launch in December, at the latest, as the actual date could be earlier given as they have already started testing the gateway platform.  Huobi started to establish a partnership with the bank in June, he said, and has since been trying to address some of the biggest concerns voiced by Turkish banks.  “I think generally where there is not a clear regulatory framework in the market, it's been left to the discretion of the banks to make their own decision,” Davar said. “That is always to make sure that we have the right checks and balances, particularly when it comes to KYC and AML.”  “The banks want to make sure when they face off with us as a partner, that they are actually fulfilling their obligations,” he said.  The fiat gateway would enable transactions between local fiat currency Lira and dollar stablecoin Tether (USDT). Once users purchase tether through their bank account, they could trade it with any other cryptocurrencies on Huobi Global.  The company believes that the Lira-USDT pairing makes transactions in the local market much easier, compared to offering hundreds of pairing between Lira and the other cryptocurrencies.  “It's very difficult for any exchange to offer liquidity in the 250 coins that we hold against the local currency,” Davar said.  One could also convert Lira to dollar-pegged tether at the rate they are comfortable without worrying volatility of cryptocurrencies during the transaction, he added.  The exchange has also revealed its “aggressive” fee structure, Davar disclosed.  Turkish users will be able to trade at a 50% discount with 0.1% transaction fees, and even lower transaction fees by holding Huobi Token (HT). Another program would open up for professional traders in Turkey to trade with low fees across Spot and Margin trades.  The exchange has launched a mobile app and a Turkish version of Huobi’s trading website to help local customers. The next step is to onboard the local team and start the operation, including four full-time staff members, Davar said.  Davar said the banking partnership being worked on now is non-exclusive, meaning Huobi could sign up more banking institutions and non-bank investors as it expands its services in Turkey.",POSITIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/18/huobi-plans-to-open-fiat-gateway-with-lira-tether-pairing-in-turkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b6668a07e31cbd3d67d98fdada79e51b03b2f3e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tBjZ,1571358603,WATCH: How JET8 Is Injecting Crypto Into the Social Media Value Chain,"Jet8 says it is taking a new approach to social media and data ownership using blockchain.      Chief strategy officer Joshua Thomson sat down with CoinDesk to discuss how his firm is putting users “back in the center of the value chain.”      First, the platform enables anyone to create “Instagram-like” applications centered on their interests, hobbies or career. Secondly, members and content creators receive a portion of advertising revenue, in the form of the J8T token, for engaging with these apps.      The company claims this token, billed as a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, can be redeemed for real-world items at nearly 25,000 retail outlets, including 7-11 and Circle K, and a host of e-commerce platforms. (According to CoinMarketCap, the token trades on a handful of exchanges at a fraction of a penny, though volumes are minuscule.)      Jet8 also claims to have garnered nearly 20 million app downloads over four years. Much of its userbase is in southeast Asia and southern Africa, Thomson said.      The startup is making moves at a time when social media heads are facing scrutiny for the way their platforms turn users into products. In Thomson’s words, ""They’re monetizing our content and data.” He added off-camera:    “Today 100 percent of digital advertising dollars go back to the social networks for our data and engagement…….an inequitable relationship. At JET8, we are giving the ad dollar back to users for their data. This to us is much more equitable and empowering.”    Update (Oct.18, 16:00 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information about Jet8's token.
