The CFTC oversees the company as a designated contract market, and 90-day reviews are the legal process by which the agency can approve or reject contracts. Kalshi had submitted the contract for CFTC review last year but recently withdrew that original request, and the exchange is now returning to the agency with a new submission.  These particular cash-settled, binary contracts would allow users to predict and bet on which parties would have majority control of each of the two chambers of Congress.  The prediction markets – which allow people “to buy and sell contracts on whether events are going to happen or not,” as Kalshi describes it on its site – have had a tumultuous recent history with the CFTC.

13881385,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538309,1686952852,XRP Allegedly Attacked By SEC’s Hinman For Ethereum’s Benefit,"The legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a new twist as top lawyers accuse former SEC Director William Hinman of being paid to attack XRP in favor of Ethereum (ETH). Following the release of Hinman’s emails and drafts of his June 2018 speech, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton expressed his frustration with the intent of the released documents on a recent live CryptoLaw podcast. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Building: Expert Predicts Rise To $27,200 Payments To Disparage XRP In Favor Of Ethereum? Jeremy Hogan, lawyer and cryptocurrency expert, also weighed in on the matter alleging that former SEC Director of Corporate Finance, Bill Hinman, was paid to give a speech in which he declared that Ethereum was not a security. According to Hogan, Ripple, a leading cryptocurrency company, has suggested that Hinman was paid by the Ethereum Foundation or someone related to Ethereum to give the speech and give Ethereum a free pass. Hogan’s claims are based on email exchanges between Hinman and his colleagues, which reportedly show that Hinman had already named his first email “the Ether speech” before he began crafting the speech. This, according to Hogan, suggests that “right from the get-go”, Hinman is saying that ETH is not a security, and that was the point of him making the speech. Hinman’s speech, which was delivered in 2018, was seen by many in the cryptocurrency industry as a landmark moment in which the SEC effectively declared that Ethereum was not a security. This was seen as a significant victory for Ethereum and the wider cryptocurrency industry, as it provided clarity on how the SEC would regulate cryptocurrencies. However, Hogan has suggested that the speech was not only a free pass for Ethereum but also an attack on XRP, which was at the time Ethereum’s biggest competition. Hogan’s claims are based on Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, in which Ripple has argued that XRP is not a security and should not be regulated as such. Related Reading: Percentage Of ETH Addresses In Profit Reaches 5-Month Low Hogan’s allegations are likely to fuel speculation about the relationship between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry, and the extent to which the SEC’s decisions are influenced by external factors. However, it is important to note that Hogan’s claims are based on speculation and have not been proven. At present, the value of XRP stands at $0.4731, indicating a marginal recovery of 0.6% over the past day. This comes after a dip to $0.4564 on Wednesday. Despite the recent drop, XRP enthusiasts remain optimistic and are looking forward to a positive outcome that could potentially boost the cryptocurrency’s price to a new yearly high, surpassing the $0.5833 mark hit in May. This could position XRP, the sixth largest cryptocurrency on the market, in a favorable position to reach the $1 milestone.

42420218,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaAQf,1686952753,Crypto Detective ZachXBT Faces Defamation Lawsuit,"NFT trader MachiBigBrother, otherwise known as Jeffrey Huang, has sued ZachXBT, an independent blockchain detective, after the on-chain sleuth published a report last year alleging Huang embezzled tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto.  The lawsuit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges ZachXBT defamed MachiBigBrother, ""inflict[ing] serious reputational and monetary harm” on him. ZachXBT faces one count of libel and one count of libel per se, according to the complaint.  ""Without any regard for the ruinous effect that public allegations of criminal conduct can produce for the accused individual, [ZachXBT] not only proceeded to publish his defamatory article on Medium.com, he also maliciously promoted the article to his more than 300,000 Twitter followers,"" MachiBigBrother's lawyer said in the complaint.  MachiBigBrother's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The lawsuit cites an investigation ZachXBT published on his blog and on Twitter in June 2022 alleging MachiBigBrother manipulated crypto markets and embezzled 22,000 ether, worth nearly $38 million at the time of writing.  ZachXBT responded to the lawsuit on Twitter Friday, calling it ""a classic David [and] Goliath story.""  ""My understanding is that Machi[BigBrother] is very wealthy,"" ZachXBT tweeted. ""I am not. He is using his money to try [to] silence me.""  In the same Twitter thread, the crypto detective lamented that fighting the lawsuit could cost more than $1 million. He asked his followers to donate crypto to a wallet dedicated to his legal costs.  ""I’m asking for your help so this doesn’t happen & the truth survives,"" he said.  The wallet has racked up almost $95,000worth of crypto donations as of publication time.  The complaint requests the court order ZachXBT to pay “actual and compensatory damages,” in addition to “exemplary damages” of an amount to be determined by the court. It also requests Jeffrey Huang be reimbursed for any legal fees he racks up during the impending legal battle.  ZachXBT will not pause his investigative work as he prepares to defend himself against the lawsuit, his lawyer, Brown Rudnick Partner Stephen Palley, told CoinDesk.  ""To my knowledge, our client intends to carry on with his work,"" Palley said.  He added, ""We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and protect [ZachXBT] against this attempt to chill his free speech.""  ZachXBT skyrocketed to prominence within the crypto community after publishing original blockchain data analyses allegedly exposing the misdeeds of bad actors populating decentralized finance and Web3 spaces. His investigations have helped him amass a following of more than 400,000 users on Twitter and earned him a spot on Consensus Magazine's Most Influential 2022 list.  Billing himself an “on-chain sleuth,” ZachXBT often publishes the results of his investigations in Twitter threads and blog posts on Medium. His detective work has led to real-world arrests and gained so much traction on social media that he was forced to stop accepting community requests to investigate nefarious activities in the crypto sphere last March.

42420203,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaAEH,1686948243,"BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Not The Same As Grayscale’s Product, Experts Say","Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) terminology can sometimes be tricky, and fund management giant BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF has raised some questions.  To review, BlackRock’s (BLK) iShares unit on Thursday filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for creation of the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  The name and other details of the proposal sparked some confusion among industry experts as to whether BlackRock was applying for an ETF or a trust with properties similar to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  The answer is both.  “It’s a reminder of just how complex ETF terminology is,” Noelle Acheson, editor of Crypto is Macro Now, said. “Technically, BlackRock's proposal is for a trust, but it's a trust that allows redemptions, so it functions just like an ETF.”  In this sense, Acheson noted, the iShares product is nothing like GBTC, which has no redemption mechanism. “The market hears ‘trust’ and thinks it will be like GBTC with no redemptions, but that's not the case here,” Acheson said.  The key distinction is that an ETF for spot bitcoin “would be able to buy bitcoin at the end of the trading day to bring the fund's assets in line with its trading price. A trust does not have the ability to do this,” Joe Consorti, market analyst at The Bitcoin Layer said.  A trust will thus occasionally trade higher or lower than the value of its underlying assets – sometimes substantially – an issue currently facing GBTC which has been changing hands at a wide discount (currently about 40%) to its net asset value for years.  Grayscale has been attempting to convert its trust to a spot bitcoin ETF for some time, but has been rejected in that effort by the SEC, which cited worry about market manipulation, among other concerns.  BlackRock is hoping to get past the market manipulation, with CoinDesk reporting earlier on Friday that the fund manager’s application includes a promise of a “surveillance-sharing agreement” between exchanges.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/16/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-not-the-same-as-grayscales-product-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6dc7064754944a78fdbff72a541b9ccea974ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BlackRock throws its hat into the ring for a bitcoin spot ETF.  In a week of FOMC rate decisions, TradFi decoupling and bitcoin spot ETF proposals, BTC and ETH ended the week up 0.88% and 1.75%, respectively.  Among the five CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors, Digitization led the way over the most recent seven days, with a 1.4% gain overall. The Smart Contract Platform sector trailed all, falling 4.4% over the identical time period.  A 14% increase in Galxe (GAL) and 2.2% increase in Braintrust (BTRST) fueled Digitization’s move higher. GAL is up 10.6% year to date, while BTRST has declined 35% on the year.  GAL remains 3.3% below its 20-day moving average and has a current Relative Strength Index (RSI) value of 44.06. The direction of its RSI implies an increase in bullishness, increasing 69% since June 10, relative to the 21% increase in GAL prices.  DeFi names Maker (MKR), Uniswap (UNI), and TruFi (TRU) also had strong weeks, rising 8.1%, 7.8%, and 7.5%, respectively.  Boba Network (BOBA), a Smart Contract Platform asset, was the week’s laggard, falling 5.5%.  Bitcoin and ether continued a recent decoupling from traditional finance, as their correlations with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) trended negative.

Still, as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust application is set to hold the asset as a commodity, it will operate in the same manner as existing commodity-based ETFs.  If approved, the ETF will offer exposure to retail investors via a third party, with the ability to enter and/or exit positions intraday.  The application’s timing coincides with an SEC crackdown on the industry, including last week’s lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase.  Given the SEC’s rejection of all prior spot BTC applications, and the perception of an agency that is hostile to digital assets markets, investors will be eager to see how it decides on the BlackRock filing.  With $9 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. Some observers may consider the application an endorsement of the asset class, as it will create a potentially sizable bitcoin buyer.  An approval would also cast doubts on previous rejections and likely spur a new wave of applications.  Since the announcement of BlackRock’s application, BTC is up approximately 4.5%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/16/inverse-correlations-fomc-action-and-a-possible-spot-bitcoin-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6db83b7fb35cfb4a6233d47527ecfeb23fad1ee8-2245x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of Ethereum has been stuck in a sideways range recently, and many ETH holders have been unlucky for it. According to data from Glassnode, the percentage of Ethereum addresses in profit has now dropped to a 5-month low. Percentage Of Addresses In The Green Drops To 55.414% Back in 2021, when the price of ETH was at its highest, the majority of addresses held a comfortable position. Now, two years later, for new investors who bought at higher prices, the wait for their positions to go green again has been a long one. Related Reading: Curve (CRV) Observes 7% Bounce As Short Squeeze Occurs Glassnode, a crypto analytics platform, reports that the percentage of Ethereum addresses in green while measuring over a 7-day moving average is now at a 5-month low of 55.414%. Percentage of addresses in profit drop to five-month low | Source: Glassnode on Twitter This indicates that more than 44 percent of the people who own ETH are currently at a loss. In the same vein, the number of profitable addresses has dropped to its lowest point since March of this year, standing at 56,311,171.899 at the moment. Moving ETH Off Exchanges The amount of ETH held on cryptocurrency exchanges has also dropped to its lowest level in over 5 years. This means less ETH is available for trading on exchanges, which can impact the price and liquidity. Traders are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges and holding it in private digital wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Building: Expert Predicts Rise To $27,200 The drop can also be linked to an all-time high level of staking in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract. Data shows that the majority of ETH held by large investors are now moving ETH into the contract, showing that interest in ETH staking is growing. This declining supply, coupled with increasing mainstream interest in ETH, could drive the price higher if demand remains strong. Ethereum Plunges Below $1,700 Meanwhile, Ethereum broke below critical price support earlier this week. The price plunged below $1,700 to $1,630 yesterday, marking its lowest value since March 16. The plunge in price and profitability is largely attributed to negative sentiment around rising inflation fears and the overall weakness in the crypto market recently.

42420204,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaAFJ,1686947400,BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Would Be a Big Deal,"Well, well. BlackRock (BLK) entered the chat early last year and it finally spoke up.  BlackRock’s iShares unit filed paperwork Thursday afternoon with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).  As with all things perpetually online, many are tying themselves up and tripping over semantics. Is this proposed fund actually an ETF or just a trust? The question seems odd, but the tippity top of BlackRock’s S-1 filing sports this as the name of the proposed fund: iShares Bitcoin Trust.  Before going further, as Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas tweeted, this is exactly how the SPDR Gold Shares ($GLD) ETF works. It's a trust, but it acts like an ETF. Without getting into it too deeply, if the iShares Bitcoin Trust is approved and functions with daily creations and redemptions, then it would basically look and act like an ETF. Who cares if it’s technically a “trust?”  The answer is “many people.” The market has some consternation with the word trust in the context of publicly-traded bitcoin instruments given Grayscale’s bitcoin product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC holds bitcoin and shares can be purchased over-the-counter for price exposure to the underlying bitcoin. There’s consternation because GBTC shares trade at a steep discount to net asset value.  See also: GBTC Discount Narrows After BlackRock's ETF Filing  In plain English, according to Grayscale’s website, the market value of a share of GBTC is $13.40 even though the amount of bitcoin held per share is $23.00 (as of June 15, 2023).  (Disclosure: Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group)  That’s bad for many reasons. But this shouldn't happen with BlackRock’s product since it's basically an ETF. Really though the interesting conversation to be had about this technically-a-trust-but-basically-an-ETF has to do with how this will affect exchanges and paper bitcoin.  Trading above bitcoin’s cap  Bitcoin liquidity has suffered ever since Binance eliminated its zero-fee bitcoin trading program earlier this year and FTX collapsed last November. The Binance news probably goes without further explanation, but on FTX, documents showed that its bankruptcy team has been unable to locate virtually all the bitcoin the failed exchange owed customers. (Who knows how much of that bitcoin was just “paper bitcoins” or IOUs.)  And that’s nothing to say of the bear market which has scared away market participants.  With this market illiquidity has come volatile price swings. But if the iShares fund is approved and BlackRock comes into the bitcoin market, there’s a good chance this would cure any concern of liquidity problems. The sheer amount of attention a BlackRock-sponsored bitcoin ETF would garner cannot be overstated. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. At a minimum it would bring an air of legitimacy and that air should breed a heavy inflow of money.  Maybe that would increase the price of bitcoin, but beyond that there are two very important things to consider going forward that I will be watching.  First, exchanges should be a bit fearful. If new investors want price exposure to bitcoin and don’t care about the aspect of it that makes it cool (like using it), then those investors will look to pay as little as possible for that bitcoin. Why would an investor pay a 1% fee at an exchange when they could pay a tiny fraction of that through an ETF when they aren’t interested in actually using bitcoin?  Second, with bitcoin’s fixed supply is the introduction of a spot ETF from BlackRock going to supercharge the expansion of paper bitcoin? The Bitcoin protocol says that only a certain amount of bitcoin can exist, but the financial markets certainly don’t say that. Financial markets allow the creation of exotic financial instruments that can represent pretty much anything, including any amount of bitcoin.  Because the going U.S. dollar market price for bitcoin is dependent on the amount of U.S. dollars an exchange would give you for bitcoin and that amount is governed by the market, what’s to stop the market from being affected by immense speculation on derivatives markets which make the effective supply of bitcoin tick over its finite supply cap? Potentially, nothing.  See also: What Winter? Institutions’ Crypto View Rosier Than You Think  To be sure, there’s some debate over whether the SEC will approve BlackRock’s offering. So far the securities agency has rejected every spot market bitcoin ETF put before it, essentially because it believes the bitcoin market can be manipulated. BlackRock’s filing comes with heightened market surveillance features, however, so some analysts think this may be the first spot bitcoin ETF out the door – plus it’s BlackRock, is the SEC going to deny BlackRock?  In any event, whether this all means the price of bitcoin goes up or down or wherever it should be, an approval of the iShares Bitcoin Trust will be a big deal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/16/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-would-be-a-big-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e3001cdc2bf5412338af7b005ed06dc71cc1dd7-1920x1489.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If approved, some of BlackRock's $9 trillion in AUM could be shifted to iShares Bitcoin Trust. Even if this application isn't approved, the fact that BlackRock wants market share is a positive sign for GBTC shareholders in my opinion. There could soon be more investment money flowing into Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) after all. Despite the investment fund outflow problem that has been plaguing the entire cryptocurrency landscape recently, BlackRock ( BLK ) apparently sees an opportunity in the market after filing for a United States listed Bitcoin ETF on June 15th. This is, frankly, an interesting development given the current war between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the broader cryptocurrency industry. According to the application filing , BlackRock's ETF would be called the iShares Bitcoin Trust and use Coinbase ( COIN ) to custody the Bitcoin that is held for investors. The pricing reference rate for the underlying assets will come from CF Benchmark, which is a subsidiary of crypto exchange Kraken . Both Kraken and Coinbase have had recent run-ins with the SEC. Through the Trust, BlackRock would issue 40,000 share baskets on a continuous basis. Redemption would not be allowed on an individual share basis. However, full baskets of 40,000 shares could be redeemed by authorized participants. Bitcoin and spot ETFs, a troubled history The BlackRock application is significant because there isn't currently a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. However, no US-based spot BTC product isn't from a lack of trying. The SEC has somewhat notoriously denied every single spot Bitcoin ETF application to date; of which, there have been well over a dozen. Van Eck, WisdomTree, Ark 21Shares, Global X, NYDIG, and Grayscale have all had spot applications denied in recent years. In many cases, these firms have endured multiple denials. The SEC's negative stance on spot ETFs has generally been attributed to what the agency claims to be a lack of investor protections and manipulation concerns. Spot ETFs are available elsewhere, however. For instance, Canadian investors have the Purpose Bitcoin ETF ( BTCC:CA ). To this point, the SEC has only allowed Bitcoin futures ETFs like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) in the United States. BITO is a fundamentally different product from spot ETFs because it uses short-dated contracts for Bitcoin exposure rather than holding the asset directly. GBTC shareholders could end up the real winners The biggest Bitcoin investment instrument in the United States by AUM is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ). GBTC launched in 2013 and has traded domestically through the OTC markets. That fund currently has nearly $16 billion in BTC under management yet the market capitalization of the fund's shares is trading at just over $9 billion due to what has been a painful trend in the fund's price to net asset value: Data by YCharts After trading for many years at a significant premium to the fund's NAV, shares shifted to a discount in 2021 and have fallen dramatically against the underlying asset ever since. At one point near the end of 2022, GBTC shares closed at just under a 49% discount to NAV. While the discount has recovered to a less horrid 42% as of article submission, GBTC shares are still underperforming both the BITO futures ETF shares and the underlying asset over the last 12 months: Data by YCharts The company has made various attempts to right the ship, including applying to convert shares to an ETF. However, Grayscale's application to convert the fund was denied by the SEC last year. As a result of that denial, Grayscale sued the SEC and claimed the agency was being ""arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory."" Grayscale further claimed the SEC was using flawed logic for the denial. One of the ongoing speculations within the market has been that GBTC shares would revert back much closer to net asset value if the fund was allowed to convert to an ETF and offer redemption of shares for the underlying asset. Even with a high minimum threshold for redemption, the ability to redeem GBTC shares for the underlying asset would figure to trigger a dramatic repricing higher in GBTC as arbitragers buying Bitcoin at a 40% discount through GBTC shares could immediately redeem for the underlying and pocket the difference after taking delivery. Somewhat corroborating this thesis was the share price response to a panel of judges grilling the SEC's attorneys at a March hearing . GBTC shares closed up more than 14% on a day when BTC was actually down in response to the judging panel questions. Risks There is certainly no guarantee BlackRock's ETF application will be approved by the SEC. Gary Gensler appears to be making it his personal mission to keep as much traditional investor capital away from the crypto industry as possible. It seems unlikely in my view that BlackRock's application will be approved. However, the mere fact that BlackRock has even submitted an application for a spot ETF is very telling. Despite the recent outflow issues, there is clearly investor interest in Bitcoin exposure, judging by Grayscale's $16 billion AUM for GBTC. Summary In the unlikely event, BlackRock's application actually is approved, it could be argued that Grayscale's conversion application should be reconsidered and ultimately approved as well. I think even the slight possibility that BlackRock's application could be approved makes GBTC shares a very worthwhile arbitrage play at current levels. It's difficult for me to comprehend how the SEC could justify approving BlackRock after denying so many other firms. But it's also difficult for me to comprehend why BlackRock would even try if the company didn't internally believe their application had a shot. From where I sit, the potential for a BlackRock spot ETF is a positive catalyst for BTC from a pure price per coin standpoint. The company has a monstrous $9.1 trillion in assets under management. If even just 0.1% of that wealth finds its way to BlackRock's proposed spot ETF without cannibalizing other BTC investment funds, it would be a $9 billion bid on BTC. That bid would theoretically help GBTC share prices, even if the NAV discount stays exactly where it is.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612024-blackrocks-etf-filing-good-for-grayscale-bitcoin-trust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13877473.jpeg

Last week, the cryptocurrency failed to break through its $27,500 resistance level and dropped to a low of $24,700. However, Bitcoin has again shown signs of regaining its bullish momentum, with a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and trading at $26,400 at the time of writing. Many analysts have predicted a continuation of the uptrend in Bitcoin’s price, which has been ongoing since January 2023. Related Reading: Curve (CRV) Observes 7% Bounce As Short Squeeze Occurs Bearish Momentum Fades As Bitcoin Retests $26,500 According to Glassnode co-founder Yan Allemann, the current stage in this trend is the retesting of the $26,200 level as bearish momentum fades. Allemann believes that this is an important stage, as it will determine whether Bitcoin can break through its previous resistance and move toward the next target of $27,200 However, while Bitcoin is showing signs of regaining its bullish momentum, it’s important to recognize that it is still fragile at this level. Therefore, building confidence among investors is crucial to sustaining Bitcoin’s upward trend. On a positive note, BlackRock’s recent application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its new exchange-traded fund (ETF) has given Bitcoin holders and bulls hope. As reported by NewsBTC, the recent announcement of BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has the potential to impact BTC’s price significantly. If approved, this ETF would enable a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which could drive up demand and ultimately increase its price. ETFs provide a convenient way for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, creating a new demand avenue for the cryptocurrency. This could increase buying pressure and a potential surge in Bitcoin’s price. Potential BTC Reversal From Support Bitcoin has recently bounced from its bullish trend and the top of its range, indicating that it still has some work to do before establishing a sustainable upward trend. According to market analyst Crypto Con, one of the most accurate indicators of Bitcoin’s bullish or bearish momentum is the 140-day moving average (MA), which shows that BTC’s price is below this crucial level. The 140DMA is a widely followed indicator in the cryptocurrency market, as it clearly signals whether Bitcoin is in a bullish or bearish phase. When BTC’s price is above the 140DMA, it’s a bullish signal, indicating that the cryptocurrency will likely continue its upward trend. Conversely, when the price is below the 140DMA, it’s a bearish signal, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will likely experience a downward trend. Bitcoin’s price is below the 140DMA, indicating that it’s in a bearish phase. However, Crypto Con hopes the cryptocurrency will experience a huge reversal from this support level, leading to a bearish fakeout of the 140DMA. This strong bullish signal could indicate that Bitcoin is ready to continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Developer Unveils Shibacals, Advancing Shibarium Development As BlackRock’s potential Bitcoin ETF gains attention and BTC gradually regains its bullish momentum, investors are increasingly optimistic that Bitcoin’s bottom is already behind. There is a growing belief that the largest cryptocurrency in the market is poised to reach new annual highs in 2023 and possibly even surpass its all-time high. However, for BTC to continue its upward trend, the cryptocurrency needs to maintain its current level of $26,000 throughout the weekend. A sustained price above this price mark could indicate that BTC is on track for a green week in the coming days.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,369, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC was trading below $25,000 – near its three-month low – as recently as Thursday morning before settling at about $25,500 in the hours immediately following the BlackRock filing.  Read More: BlackRock's iShares Files Paperwork for Spot Bitcoin ETF  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,721, up 4.5% from Thursday, same time. Earlier this week, ETH lost the $1,700 threshold for the first time since mid March.  Other major cryptocurrencies, including those that tumbled following their mention in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase last week, regained large swathes of ground. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, was recently up more than 7%. ADA, MATIC and ALGO, the native cryptocurrencies of smart contract platforms Cardano, Polygon and Algorand, respectively, rose 3.5%, 3% and 4.1%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the cryptocurrency market’s performance, increased 4.4%, although CoinDesk’s Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators remained in downturn territory, reflecting lingering investor worries about an industry being buffeted by increasing U.S. regulatory scrutiny, as well as inflation and monetary policy concerns.  The main equity indexes were trading sideways after seesawing earlier in the day with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite up slightly but the S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, down a smidgen. Stocks have surged six consecutive days with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all recently hitting 2023 highs. Gold and U.S. Treasury yields both ticked up.  In a speech Friday, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank remained concerned about inflation, even as it has weathered criticism that its hawkishness precipitated a March crisis in the banking sector. Earlier this week, the Fed halted a 14-month diet of rate hikes that have often weighed heavily on crypto and other asset markets.  “The Fed's job is to use monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate, and right now that means raising rates to fight inflation,” Waller said at an economics conference in Norway. “It is the job of bank leaders to deal with interest rate risk, and nearly all bank leaders have done exactly that. I do not support altering the stance of monetary policy over worries of ineffectual management at a few banks.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian crypto asset manager 3iQ, suggested that the timing of BlackRock’s filing may reflect “implicit support” as it confronts the SEC’s legal actions. In BlackRock’s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust, Coinbase will serve as custodian of bitcoin held in the trust.  “By filing complaints against Binance and Coinbase on consecutive days, the SEC literally paired these two exchanges together as it relates to many, but not all alleged actions,” Connors wrote. “The timing of BlackRock’s filing can be seen as an effort to undo this pairing, by reiterating their commitment to Coinbase and a regulated spot bitcoin trust in the same action.""  Connors added: “A definite plus for Coinbase and the industry as this filing lays out clear processes for custody, liquidity, and price monitoring, positively impacting Coinbase’s business prospects and industry adoption.”  Read More: Bitcoin Shorts Lose $16M as BlackRock ETF Filing Sparks Bullish Outlook  UPDATE (June 16, 2023, 19:00 UTC): Adds Mark Connors comments.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/16/bitcoin-recrosses-263k-to-hit-highest-level-in-a-week-amid-blackrock-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da2be66267ed9afd9d8a95f6d3dadf5a94ccf3b3-1714x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420224,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaAUn,1686939220,Coinbase Policy Chief Shirzad Squares Off With SEC Enforcement Director Grewal,"This morning in a sun-dappled conference room high above the streets of Manhattan, a crowd of lawyers and journalists got a preview of crypto’s coming legal Ragnarok. It was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Coinbase, months early – albeit slightly more polite and vague than things will be in any coming court showdown.  The fireside chat, sponsored by Rutgers School of Law and the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, ranged well beyond legal formalities to matters of principle and theory. The latter included the question of why, or whether, cryptocurrency should be allowed to exist in the United States at all.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In the end, the forum encapsulated the broader challenge of the crypto-regulatory dialogue: how frequently the two sides seem to be talking past each other.  The law is the law  In one corner was SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir S. Grewal, who laid out his rationale for the SEC’s enforcement suit against Coinbase in conversation with Rutgers law professor Yuliya Guseva. Grewal characterized the suit as the logical endpoint of a series of clear signals sent over the past five years or more, starting with the 2017 DAO report.  “In any other space, if you’re working incrementally, you’d see increased compliance,” Grewal observed. “[In crypto], we haven’t seen that, so we’ve had to change strategy.” In other words, in Grewal’s view, the SEC lawsuit came down against Coinbase because the exchange didn’t respond to earlier warnings.  Grewal also provided some insight into the decision to pursue exchanges including Coinbase and Binance, rather than continue individual enforcement actions against violating token issuers.  “I have less than 1,300 people” on staff, Grewal said. “Every year I have 700 recommendations we bring to the commission. We can’t be everywhere all at once … When we’re evaluating cases to bring, we have to make judgment calls.”  Grewal also offered insight into other outstanding questions, including the challenge of regulating decentralized exchanges (DEXs). “I’ve seen entrepreneurs and individuals in the center of all of these” supposedly decentralized projects, Grewal said. “Maybe it will present a challenge one day, but we see entrepreneurs at the center of all these projects.” In other words, as Gary Gensler made clear at the outset of his tenure, simply saying you’re decentralized is no defense.  You’re pushing that nexus between policy and U.S. law out of the perimeter of U.S. law. That’s a big deal. This has to be a matter of national strategy.  In a final notable comment, Grewal put crypto influencers on notice. In particular, he warned YouTubers and others that he and the agency are watching for attempts to exploit members of minority groups. “They’re [promoting crypto with] the promise of financial inclusion to a segment of the population that has been excluded from traditional finance. That’s offensive to me … I find that conduct to be some of the most egregious conduct we’ve dealt with,” he said.  See also: How Social Media Influencers Fed Bankman-Fried's Cult of Personality | Opinion  The loyal opposition  Hot on Grewal’s heels, though, came a conversation with Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, who prior to joining Coinbase in 2021 served as head of government affairs for Goldman Sachs and spent time in the George W. Bush White House.  On the confrontation with the SEC, Shirzad barely hedged his speculation that the SEC is stepping on an ongoing legislative process – an argument Coinbase has also made in legal filings under the Administrative Procedures Act.

Morris – The New Crypto Bill Gary Gensler Doesn't Want You to Know About | Opinion  “The normal dynamic in Washington [D.C.] is that when the constitutional branches of government are [acting], typically regulators will step back and let the political branches figure it out,” said Shirzad. “It’s not typical that you’ll see congressional action moving in earnest, and not just a government department, but a regulatory agency, rush in to redefine facts on the ground to get ahead of that. I don’t know if that’s happening here … but if that were happening, it would be unusual.”  “I don’t know whether there’s a dimension of legislative strategy to this,” Shirzad mused. “And there’s the chairman saying we don’t need more digital innovation, so there may be some of that.”  That gets close to the heart of the matter. While the SEC says it’s enforcing the law, the industry has struggled to make the practical case that existing law doesn’t work for many blockchain-based digital assets.  Shirzad further advanced the case that basing crypto regulation only on existing law will harm U.S. competitiveness and innovation.  “This is not just a convenience issue over whether one industry can operate in the United States. We’re at a critical juncture … blockchain is the value layer of the internet. That has significant implications,” Shirzad said, citing several ongoing blockchain pilot projects by the likes of JPMorgan as evidence.  Even more pointedly, Shirzad highlighted that the SEC’s approach may be counter to the agency’s own goal of investor protection.  “To the extent it becomes part of public policy to push exchanges offshore, you’re pushing that nexus between policy and U.S. law out of the perimeter of U.S. law. That’s a big deal. This has to be a matter of national strategy,” he said.  If there was one clear takeaway from this warm up match, it may be that the opponents each want to fight on a different battleground. For the SEC, it’s all a matter of the law, as written and strictly interpreted.

It has one of the cleanest balance sheets in the sector, with almost no debt and some cash left to scale. The company is starting to put capital to work in hopes that it can double mining capacity this year. Led by a strong May for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining transaction fees, some of the public miner equities have been continuing their phenomenal year to date runs through mid-June. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) has been one of the clear standouts from the pack in recent months: Data by YCharts Year to date, BTBT shares are up over 400% while some of the larger players in the industry are up between 100-200% and haven't made fresh highs since April. Having gone long BTBT shares back in late March after calling the company a ""hold"" in my January article for Seeking Alpha, it's been a marvelous run to say the least. Now in mid-June, we have a fresh earnings report, recent production figures, and growth strategy moves to assess. May Production & Global Exahash All things considered, Bit Digital had one of the better months in the sector, in my opinion. In May, the company produced roughly 113 Bitcoin. That was a 31% increase over April on an active hash rate of 1.2 exahash per second. A large factor in the production increase for Bitcoin miners broadly in the month was the surge in transaction fees as a share of the total block reward. Transactions averaged a 12.7% share in May after averaging just 2.4% from January through April. BTC Transaction Fees (IntoTheBlock) What has helped Bit Digital's stock performance is the company's return on costs has been stronger than peers. From a mining efficiency standpoint, Bit Digital had an outstanding May after producing 94.2 BTC per exahash. This gave the company the top spot in the industry for the month of May and it maintains a top 5 ranking when adjusting that metric to a year to date average: BTC/EHs May 2023 YTD AVG BTBT 94.2 88.8 HIVE 92.4 90.5 IREN 92.4 93.9 BITF 91.8 88.3 CLSK 90.9 90.2 CORZ 88.2 84.6 CIFR 82.2 75.7 MARA 81.9 74.0 ARBK 69.2 64.6 RIOT 64.4 68.0 HUT 56.5 59.1 Source: company filings, author calculations While the transaction fee trend has come down a bit midway through June, at a 5.9% average share of block reward, transactions are still playing a more meaningful role in Bitcoin mining revenue. Of course, the improving economics of Bitcoin mining haven't gone unnoticed and global hash rate recently surpassed 400 EH/s. Data by YCharts This means there is more competition for the block reward and miners generally receive a smaller share of that reward if they aren't able to maintain capacity growth in line with global exahash growth. That said, global exahash has come down off the May high as the price of BTC has struggled since the March spike. Q1 Earnings In the first quarter earnings release, Bit Digital noted $8.3 million in revenue. This was up 6% from the prior quarter and was primarily derived from the company's Bitcoin mining operation. Revenue from Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) staking rewards was less than $100k in the quarter. The company's cost of revenue declined 13% from $6 million to $5.2 million sequentially. Total opex declined from $17.4 million in Q4-22 to $8.8 million in Q1-23 but that did amount to a 9% increase over Q1-22. That said, from a net income standpoint Bit Digital had its best quarter since Q2-21 at $(2.3) million: Data by YCharts The large negative net income figure from Q4-22 is largely due to a $50 million mining rig impairment at the end of the year. From a balance sheet perspective, Bit Digital eliminated more than half of the company's liabilities and saw property and plant assets decline by another $3.5 million due largely to an additional $2.2 million miner rig write down: Quarter Cash and Equivalents Digital Assets Net Property and Plant Total Liabilities Q1-22 $28.1 $43.9 $28.7 $7.7 Q2-22 $44.3 $30.6 $90.0 $7.0 Q3-22 $32.3 $33.0 $80.7 $6.4 Q4-22 $32.7 $27.6 $22.6 $10.5 Q1-23 $27.9 $27.1 $19.0 $5.2 QoQ -14.7% -1.8% -15.9% -50.5% YoY -0.7% -38.3% -33.8% -32.5% Source: Seeking Alpha, Company filings As of March 31st, Bit Digital had just $5.2 million in total liabilities versus nearly $28 million in cash and equivalents though that figure was down to $15.4 million at the end of May. In subsequent events since quarter end, the company has made various rig purchases and hosting agreements to help scale the company's mining capacity. As of the end of May, Bit Digital is holding 453.6 BTC and 10,996 ETH, of which 6,692 are in stake. Scaling Strategy Between late April and early May, Bit Digital agreed to purchase 6,600 mining rigs from various unaffiliated sellers. The machine breakout is 3,600 S19s and 3,000 S19j Pros. In the past, Bit Digital has disclosed its preference to buy machines in the spot market rather than direct from manufacturers. The company appears to be scaling at the right time as ASIC prices are at or near multi-year lows according to data from HashRateIndex: ASIC Prices (HashRateIndex) The company has been actively announcing expansion plans throughout the second quarter. An April, Bit Digital announced 20 MW in hosting services through Coinmint in New York. In early May, Bit Digital agreed to 4 MW of hosting with Blockbreakers out of Canada. On May 18th, Bit Digital announced a two-year agreement for over 8 MW with an Iceland-based Bitcoin mining firm called GreenBlocks. In this agreement, Bit Digital is providing a 39-month interest free loan of up to $5 million to GreenBlocks so that company can build out the operation for Bit Digital: GreenBlocks will exclusively use the advances to buy miners that will be operated for the benefit of the Company at a facility in Iceland, with an overall capacity of 8.25 MW. To secure the prompt payment of advances, the Company has been granted a continuing first priority lien and security interest in all of GreenBlocks' rights, title and interest to the financed miners. According to Bit Digital, so far those loan advances have totaled just under $3.6 million to GreenBlocks. While I'm not enamored with the interest free loan for machines that the company won't ultimately own, Bit Digital's leadership appears motivated to diversify hosting providers and hosting jurisdictions to the best of the company's ability. So far, what we can tell from Q2 is the company has been putting dollars to work in an attempt to scale mining capacity in an environmentally friendly way before the halving next year. Risks One cause of concern for me back in March was that we didn't know how much capital Bit Digital put into the MarsProtocol venture that was announced earlier in the month. The company did provide some clarity on that investment in the Q1 earnings report. As it turns out it was just $89k for 40% of the MarsProtocol business. I stand by my initial feeling that BTBT shareholders won't see a return on that capital but that remains to be seen. Bit Digital says it hasn't been impaired yet. Additionally, we will observe at least some degree of share dilution on the next quarterly report. The company raised $3 million in gross proceeds by selling 1.3 million common shares to Ionic Ventures LLC in May. Share count has remained relatively flat over the last 4 quarters but that's something to keep any eye on going forward as Bit Digital tries to double mining capacity this year. Summary Bit Digital has a compelling model. The overwhelming majority of the company's revenue is from mining BTC. Yet it has what I view as a well balanced approach to managing its digital assets in treasury by converting some of its BTC to ETH for staking rewards. While staking rewards is still a very small driver of the company's overall revenue, it is a far less expensive business to operate since it doesn't require expensive mining rigs to validate transactions. The company has been making moves over the last two months and I think it remains one of the more interesting miners in the public equity markets given its low debt, spot market rig purchases, and focus on blue chip digital assets. I believe this one is going to continue to outperform and I still like it as a high-upside proxy for Bitcoin bulls.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611997-bit-digital-scaling-at-right-time?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13873272.jpeg

The price of GBTC shares jumped more than 8% over the past 24 hours to near $14, TradingView data shows, outperforming the digital asset the fund holds. Over the same period, bitcoin (BTC) rose 3.5% to $25,800.  The discount is currently at around 40%, according to CoinDesk’s calculations. This is the lowest level since mid-May, down from 44% earlier this week, but still significantly higher than the 35% level it reached earlier this spring, according to YCharts.  Many crypto observers keenly awaited how GBTC’s discount would react to the news about BlackRock, the world’s largest ETF issuer and a mainstay in the traditional finance world, attempting to register a spot BTC ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Multiple investment managers, including WisdomTree, VanEck, Ark Investment Management with 21Shares, have tried to register such a product over the past two years, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected all applications, so far.  BlackRock’s application, however, could be a game-changer, analysts have noted, given its clout and track record. The investment firm has won regulators’ approval for ETFs in 575 cases versus a sole denial, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted.  Grayscale – a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company – is currently in a legal standoff with the SEC, after the firm appealed the agency’s decision to deny converting its closed-end GBTC fund into an ETF. The so-called “GBTC discount” developed because the fund doesn’t allow redemptions, so investors can only sell their shares on secondary markets.  While crypto markets rallied in the past years, GBTC shares traded at a significant premium to net asset value. Notably, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital made outsized bets to harvest the premium, then spectacularly blew up when the fund’s shares turned into a discount as crypto prices cratered last year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/16/gbtc-discount-narrows-after-blackrocks-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9180848b8301d8f2a26afc9e67c96de8e329cf2-1622x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fundraise follows the protocol's public testnet launch on Aptos earlier this month. The mainnet launch is expected to follow within the next several months, and Concordia will concurrently launch on additional chains.  Since the so-called “DeFi Summer” of 2020, decentralized finance has grown increasingly fragmented, making it difficult for users to transfer assets or access liquidity between blockchains. Cross-chain bridges can help with this problem, but are also a hotbed of security risks. Streamlining the process, reducing the risks and introducing compliance could bring more decentralized and traditional finance (TradFi) players into the space.  Concordia wants to make it easier for users to access and manage cross-chain liquidity and collateral. The protocol also offers users a simpler way to manage the collateral used for margin trading, a method of using borrowed money to buy or sell assets for a potential profit. Concordia users can manage that collateral from a single account and transfer assets from multiple blockchains without the need for wrapped tokens or bridges. The underlying application programming interface (API) architecture is modular – institutional investors, for example, could pick and choose what features they want to use. Developers who want to build using Concordia have access to the protocol’s shared pools of liquidity.  ""We're on a path to integrate across DeFi and TradFi,"" said Thomas Ruble, chief technology officer of Concordia, in a statement. ""To move real assets at the speed of frictionless blockchains is the goal everyone wants.

The sale featured hotly-anticipated works like Dmitri Cherniak’s “The Goose” and brought in almost $11 million.  Meanwhile, Snoop Dogg released a dynamic NFT collection tied to his upcoming music tour while the ApeCoin community debated whether it made sense to pay each of its Special Council members $20,833 a month.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Wild Goose chase: Auction house Sotheby's concluded a spirited live auction of NFT artwork seized from bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), this time bringing in over $10.9 million in sales. Dozens attended the live auction that took place in New York and included pieces from the ""Grails"" collection. In total, there were 37 works from generative artists like Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs, Snowfro and more.  High stakes: Several high-value NFTs were up for auction, leading to lively bidding wars that often far outpaced Sotheby’s estimates. For example, Dmitri Cherniak's Ringers #879 (often referred to as ""The Goose"" for its resemblance to the bird), was estimated to sell for $2-3 million, ultimately sold for $6.2 million. Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #479, which was estimated to sell for $120,000-$180,000 sold for $622,300.  High spirits: The auction comes at a time of slower movement in the NFT market and smaller-figured sales of blue-chip NFTs compared to the height of the NFT boom. The impressive sales figures suggest that collectors still have an appetite for high-end digital collectibles.  Dogg days of summer: Rapper Snoop Dogg has launched a new NFT collectible series that will evolve in utility as he goes on tour this summer. The Snoop Dogg Passport Series will grant NFT holders access to behind-the-scenes content, exclusive merch, art and experiences from the music icon. Each NFT is available for purchase for about $42 or 0.025 ETH.  Evolution revolution: Dynamic NFTs have exploded in popularity in recent months, allowing digital assets to change over time and providing continuous and novel use cases for holders. Adidas, Jack Butcher, Mason Rothschild and others have all recently released dynamic NFT projects. We did a deep dive into these “living NFTs,” which you can read up on here.  Going bananas: Holders of ApeCoin – the native currency of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem that launched in March 2022 – were locked in a debate on Twitter this week over the six-figure salaries awarded to members of the ApeCoin DAO Special Council. The Ape Foundation facilitates the governance process of the ApeCoin DAO, which pay each member of its Special Council a monthly salary of $20,833.  ""Complete joke"": One user tweeted called the pay a “joke” and questioned the value of the Special Council. Another tweeted that it was a “slap in the face” to holders of ApeCoin.  ""Good work ain’t cheap"": Special Council member Yat Siu responded to the backlash, saying that “you get what you pay for.” Another agreed that they were receiving fair compensation.  Future plans: Voting is open for ApeCoin holders to nominate new members of the Special Council and Steward positions, beginning in July. Members are simultaneously discussing a re-evaluation of the salary structures.  Artist Spotlight  Who: Dmitri Cherniak  What: Generative artist Dmitri Cherniak has been experimenting with crypto since 2014, but he gained widespread popularity in 2021 with the release of his breakthrough NFT project “Ringers” through the Art Blocks platform. Born in Canada and living in New York, Cherniak was trained in computer science and uses custom software to create visual art with high-quality prints to accompany his NFTs. According to Sotheby’s, his work “has had an enormous impact on the field and its acceptance by the larger art world.”  Why: If you’ve been on crypto Twitter recently, you’ve probably seen Cherniak’s Ringers #879 splattered on your homepage and turned into memes - even Beeple got in on the action. Why though? Well, the NFT has been cemented into the NFT culture as an example of the limitless creative boundaries of NFT artwork. The NFT, created at random using code created by Cherniak, bears an uncanny resemblance to a goose, lending to its nickname and mass appeal. As collector 6529, who purchased the NFT on Thursday for $6.2 million explained: ""On-chain long form generative art is an act of faith by the artist and the minter. Once the algorithm is committed to the blockchain, nobody knows what outputs it will produce … The Goose has had a historic journey so far through key moments in NFT history and I suspect its journey has just begun.""  In Other News  On par: American Express teamed up with fashion site Hypebeast and golf brand Metalwood Studio to offer co-branded merchandise that can be accessed through POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) NFTs.  Time for Trump prizes: Despite becoming the first U.S. president to be charged with federal crimes, Trump Digital Trading Cards sent an email blast letting sweepstakes winners know it was time to burn their NFTs for prizes… like meeting the former president.

42420221,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaATl,1686930895,"U.S. Banking Watchdog Makes Case for Tokenization, Just Not on Public Blockchains","Self-styled crypto skeptic Michael Hsu, the acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said tokenization of assets is a serious advance into the future of finance, but decentralized blockchains may be too problematic to handle that movement.  Achieving decentralization, security and scale all at once “is not possible with a public blockchain,” Hsu said at an American Bankers Association event on Friday.  “As a result, the crypto industry remains largely self-referential and disconnected from the real world,” he said. The sector is “immature and rife with risks, despite several years in the mainstream spotlight, billions of dollars of venture capital investment and millions of hours of code commits.”  Though U.S. banking regulators including the OCC have warned the institutions they regulate that involvement in crypto needs exacting scrutiny, a number of financial firms – including Wall Street banks – have experimented with managing their own blockchain projects. Hsu said such “centrally operated, trusted blockchains have the potential to deliver security and achieve scale efficiently.” He added that tokenization “does not require decentralization and trustlessness.”  “With tokenization, the instruction, transaction, and settlement can theoretically be collapsed into a single step, removing those frictions – provided, of course, that the technology is interoperable with central bank money and real-world settlement systems,” he said. “The legal foundations for tokenization need to be developed.”  Read More: Wall Street Giant DTCC Launches Private Blockchain in Big Crypto-Milestone for TradFi",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/16/us-banking-watchdog-makes-case-for-tokenization-just-not-on-public-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fa65ef0e9c34a692a100851abbcbd70a5cf3f74-3412x1919.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420202,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaADF,1686930866,What Winter? Institutions’ Crypto View Rosier Than You Think,"Amid the angst over crypto U.S. regulation and a revived bear market, an email from the digital assets team of a major international investment bank presented me with a contrarian indicator and a reminder not to solely view this industry with a U.S. lens.  Its subject read: “Major global study reveals pension funds, fund managers, other institutional investors and wealth managers are positive on digital assets and plan to invest.”  Did this come from Bizarro cryptoland? My mind immediately went to that Seinfeld episode in which Bizzaro is referred to as a separate parallel universe in which everything is the opposite of what’s going on in this one.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  My recent experience with, say, recruiting staffers from investment institutions to go on stage at our Consensus conference has been that many are now too afraid to publicly show their interest lest it put a target on them for Elizabeth Warren’s “anti-crypto army.”  But, no. This is a legit survey, with some big findings. (It was later written up by CoinDesk’s Sam Reynolds.)  The survey was conducted by Laser Digital, the digital assets team at Nomura, a household name on Wall Street and a powerhouse of Japanese finance. The team said its survey covered “pension funds, wealth managers, family offices, hedge funds and investment funds, insurance asset managers and sovereign wealth funds) who collectively manage around $4.956 trillion in assets.”  And then it offered up some striking numbers:  96% see digital assets as an investment diversification opportunity,  91% see digital assets helping to produce “all-weather’ income strategies to “cope with the risk of inflation and the debasement risk of fiat currencies,  82% are positive about the digital asset class in general and Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular over the next 12 months,  Just 3% of respondents are negative about the outlook for the sector while 15% are neutral.  While the summary did note there were challenges to implementation and, not surprisingly, highlighted regulation as one of the main ones, this is a strikingly upbeat response from an industry that doesn’t like to put its views on crypto out there very publicly.  My takeaways from this:  Institutions have a deeper understanding of crypto and a greater degree of conviction than ever before. That respondents had firmly held positions on the sector is a sign many are now aware and educated. That is a good thing.  This was a global study. It included institutions of significant diversity in terms of their structure, ownership and geographic location. That brings a much broader perspective on this industry than hearing from banks and U.S. fund managers that are more tightly woven into the language and mindset of Wall Street.  The diametric view of crypto in other financial centers stems in part because of a more constructive approach by governments there. Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, London, Bermuda, Switzerland, and Paris are all financial hubs with ties to institutions and capital managers of different stripes. Each has taken deliberate steps to create a legislative framework for digital assets that, while setting up compliance requirements of varying strictness, is designed to enable innovation in the space. In the U.S., we are stuck with turf wars between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and between Democrats and Republicans.  Amid Crypto Winter, there is a pendulum swing back toward integrating blockchain technology into the existing financial system, with a special focus on tokenizing “real-world assets.” This is helping sustain and spur institutional interest, since many of them are sitting on assets ripe for tokenization. (It was notable, however, that the survey respondents also expressed interest in bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency risks.)  The angst in the U.S. will pass. There is no way the U.S. can afford to stay isolated if the rest of the world is diving in.  So, cheer up. There’s a way out of this.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

42420217,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaAPd,1686930081,"Politics Is Interested in Crypto, Even if Crypto Isn't Interested in Politics","In the last two weeks, Washington D.C. policymakers presented the American people with two different futures on digital assets. One leads to American innovation and job growth. The other is a dead-end street in a one-road town.  Last week, with twin actions against Coinbase and Binance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made clear that it believes crypto should not exist in America. There’s no other reasonable conclusion, given the agency’s decision not to issue a crypto-specific securities framework, despite the glaring lack of clarity in the current regulatory regime.  John Rizzo is the senior vice president of public affairs at Clyde Group.  While legal experts argue that current law is largely silent on the classification of crypto assets, the SEC has decided that regulation by enforcement is an acceptable means of instituting its preferred policy outcome.  Across the street from the SEC’s headquarters, Democrats and Republicans made progress on a bill to institute crypto market structure rules. The “discussion draft” legislation takes from a bipartisan law, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, to institute a way for token issuers to fundraise for their offerings while maintaining strong investor protections.  See also: U.S. Lawmakers Can Get Crypto Regulations Right if They Act Now | Opinion  The draft would also allow firms to appropriately register with government agencies like SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has claimed has always been possible. And it settles the securities versus commodities debate, including whether the federal securities or commodities regulator will take lead. (Gensler, who has said all cryptos but bitcoin resemble securities, used to think most were commodities.).  The discussion draft issued by Chairs Patrick McHenry (R-NC) of the Financial Services Committee and Glenn Thompson (R-PA) of the Agriculture Committee is slightly to the left of where an ideal Republican bill would be and slightly to the right of the Democrats’ preferred outcome. In other words, it’s just the right amount of compromise.  Suppose Republicans and Democrats can move from discussion draft to legislation and legislation to law. In that case, the crypto market will finally have stabilizing clarity that will foster innovation while protecting consumers and investors.  In other words, it’s just the right amount of compromise  The U.S. will begin to catch up with the rest of the world on crypto asset regulation, and policy developments relating to financial assets can go back to being, well, boring, which is good if you’re interested in financial stability.  The end game of the SEC’s regulation by enforcement spree is unclear and should give even those skeptical of crypto assets pause. Even if the SEC is successful, crypto doesn’t go away. It just goes elsewhere – perhaps beyond U.S. borders and the control of U.S. regulators.  That’s all the more reason lawmakers need to make substantial progress on a crypto market structure bill.  The further crypto assets move from the U.S.’ regulatory perimeter, the less domestic regulators can manage risks from crypto assets.  Do you care about investors getting fleeced by fraudsters and bank-like runs that destabilize the financial system? Good luck calling another country and getting them to care about views outside their jurisdiction. Do you think blockchain technology could benefit U.S. society and want our innovators and workers to lead the way? Try again. That innovation will be happening in Dubai, Paris or Beijing.  Ending the crypto wars and reaching a negotiated regulatory framework that finally provides clarity is the only rational way forward for this country. Unfortunately, there’s reason to believe that rationality may not prevail.  See also: John Rizzo – Bitcoin Should Be Central to Regulation of Digital Assets | Opinion  Last week, during a valedictory round of interviews following his enforcement actions, Chair Gensler may have committed a classic political gaffe. Responding to an interviewer’s question, a seemingly exasperated Gensler said the U.S. “doesn’t need” more digital currency. That’s quite an admission from a chair who claims to lead a “merit-neutral” agency that does not put the finger on the scale when it comes to the wisdom of investing in a security.

42420236,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCTd,1686929749,SEC Enforcement Director: 'We're Not Concerned With the Labels' in Crypto Cases,"""Regulation by enforcement"" is ""a catchy but tired refrain that's used effectively by crypto market participants and lobbyists,"" said the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Enforcement Division Friday.  The SEC has been enforcing existing rules and regulations, said Gurbir Grewal to an audience of academics and lawyers during a panel co-hosted by the Lowenstein Sandler law firm and Rutgers Law School, in some of his first public remarks since the SEC brought charges against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.  The moderators asked about the SEC's recent actions and the concept of regulation by enforcement. The regulator, who used to be the Attorney General in New Jersey, said the agency was continuing to oversee the crypto industry but that it was focused on activities within the sector, rather than the tokens themselves.  ""We're not concerned with the labels. We're concerned with the offerings, the labels are not important to us,"" Grewal said. ""The technology is important. What's underneath the hood, because when we look underneath the hood, when we kick the tires, we've seen plenty ... DeFi [decentralized finance] offers that are neither decentralized nor finance but rather just straight [fraud].""  He also spoke to the rise in recent enforcement actions within the crypto sector.  ""I think what you've seen is that the crypto markets in the downturn, the increase in risk has forced us to focus our efforts here. Maybe that's been perceived as an uptick, but I think it's us just doing our jobs as we have been for the last few years,"" he said.  ""We will extend our jurisdiction as far as the law allows,"" Grewal said. ""We have tremendous cooperation with a lot of regulators. We meet with them frequently, we have MOUs [memoranda of understanding] with a lot of regulators that facilitate our ability to collect evidence abroad. And I think the more we do that, the more cooperation that exists among regulators, the less space that there is between us and the [U.K.'s] FCA and [Australia's] ASIC and others that we work [with]...

42420241,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCZp,1686929542,BlackRock May Have Found Way to Get SEC Approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF,"Blackrock’s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week might stand a better chance than previous attempts by other fund managers thanks to the promise of a “surveillance-sharing agreement” between exchanges.  On page 36 of the Nasdaq (where the proposed ETF will be listed) 19b-4 filing, it's stated that to mitigate against market manipulation, Nasdaq will be brought in to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin (BTC).  Surveillance-sharing agreements allow for the sharing of information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification, allowing for little possibility of market manipulation.  Nasdaq’s proposed surveillance-sharing agreement, dubbed the “Spot BTC SSA,” is what makes this application different, and not simply the company’s size as the largest asset manager in the world, said Graeme Moore, Head of Tokenization, Polymesh Association.  “The SEC is very concerned with market manipulation related to Bitcoin prices, and has cited this in almost, if not all, previous rejections,” Moore said in an emailed statement. “This is because the SEC’s view is that Coinbase and others are not regulated as exchanges and therefore cannot be trusted to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’.”  The SEC is very concerned with market manipulation related to Bitcoin prices, and has cited this in almost, if not all, previous rejections  However, industry veteran Dave Weisberger, CEO & Co-Founder of CoinRoutes, countered that any such surveillance-sharing agreement is superfluous.  “Why should it be necessary?” Weisberger said in an interview with CoinDesk.” Because Kraken, Coinbase, ItBit, Lmax and Bitstamp -- all of their data feeds are public,” he added. “The SEC could clearly get all this data or hire someone to feed it to them. You can know every trade in every order, and that will give the SEC the ability to say, 'Hey, this looks like a manipulative trade. So who did it?'""  The SEC has previously highlighted the importance of a surveillance-sharing agreements. In a notice in January regarding Cboe BZX Exchange’s request to list and trade shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, agency officials said that “an exchange that lists bitcoin-based ETPs can meet its obligations under Exchange Act Section by demonstrating that the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets.”  Blackrock’s iShares filed paperwork with the SEC on Thursday afternoon for the formation of a spot bitcoin ETF. The move comes after several other ETF proposals, including those of Grayscale, VanEck, and WisdomTree have previously been rejected.  Correction (16:00 UTC, June 16, 2023): Noted that Nasdaq, not BlackRock, made the 19b-4 filing.

13870621,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538233,1686929444,Curve (CRV) Observes 7% Bounce As Short Squeeze Occurs,"Curve DAO token (CRV) has observed a 7% bounce during the last 24 hours as mass liquidations of short traders have occurred in the market. Curve Funding Rates Turned Extremely Negative Following Price Decline According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, an extreme amount of shorts had accumulated on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently. The relevant indicator here is the “funding rate,” which keeps track of the periodic fee that Curve perpetual contract traders on a specific exchange are paying each other right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are willing to pay a premium to the short contract holders in order to keep their position currently. Such a trend implies that bullish sentiment is held by the majority of investors. On the other hand, negative values suggest that a bearish mentality is the dominant force in the market at the moment as the shorts are paying a fee to the longs. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Curve funding rates on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the past month or so: The value of the metric seems to have been quite red not too long ago | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Curve Binance funding rate had assumed negative values recently as the cryptocurrency’s price had continued to head downwards. The decline in the asset’s price came in part because of all the FUD in the wider cryptocurrency sector, like the SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase, or the Fed interest rates decision, while the other factor was CRV-specific uncertainty. The root cause of this FUD is the fact that the Curve Finance founder has taken up a large loan against a wallet that currently holds around 30% of the entire circulating supply of the token. As the price of the asset has taken a hit recently, concerns about this position getting liquidated have grown in the market. Since the wallet holds such a significant part of the cryptocurrency’s supply (288.7 million tokens to be precise), a potential liquidation could have wide-reaching consequences for the project. From the graph, it’s visible that the Binance funding rate had become extremely red as this FUD spread around. This means that the sentiment on the exchange had become quite bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Show No Panic Loss Selling, What Does It Mean? Historically, whenever the traders have leaned too hard into any particular direction, the market has tended to actually show a sharp move in the opposite direction. The reason behind this is an event called a squeeze, which takes place whenever a sudden swing in the price occurs and causes a mass amount of liquidations to go off at once. These liquidations only end up fueling said price swing further, leading to even more liquidations happening in the market. In this way, liquidations can sort of waterfall together during a squeeze. Related Reading: What Happens To Bitcoin Price If Spot ETF Is Approved? Gold ETF Story Reveals In the graph, it’s visible that after the funding rate had turned very negative, the indicator suddenly started going the other way, and it has now already turned very slightly positive. This suggests that a short squeeze has taken place in the market, as the shorts that had accumulated have all been washed away. The Curve price has jumped off this squeeze, registering a rise of about 7%. CRV Price At the time of writing, the Curve DAO token is trading around $0.61, down 20% in the last week.

The decrease in Bitcoin's average transaction fees makes it more user-friendly and could lead to increased adoption, but it may also indicate lower network congestion and usage. The breach of the head and shoulders pattern's neckline serves as a bearish signal, suggesting that Bitcoin's price is likely to experience further declines. In continuation of the previous analysis , the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) price maintains a downward trajectory from its recent peaks. This article offers a timely update to shed light on the present circumstances in the Bitcoin market and unveils a new potential selling opportunity for investors. It delves into the unfolding of patterns such as the symmetrical broadening wedge, the double top, and the emergence of a head and shoulders pattern that witnessed a breakthrough recently. This significant pattern break suggests an impending increase in selling pressure within the Bitcoin market. Recent Development in Bitcoin Market The recent downturn in Bitcoin's price is attributed to the mounting regulatory pressure on major crypto exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the most influential platforms for trading cryptocurrencies, have injected a sense of uncertainty into the market. Accusations of market manipulation and unauthorized securities sales have shaken investor confidence, with concerns over how these legal actions might affect future capital flows into the sector. While Bitcoin and Ethereum seem exempt from these particular allegations, the fact that regulatory scrutiny of the crypto space is set to intensify considerably cannot be overlooked. The inherent nature of the crypto market also plays a significant role in the ongoing bearish trend. Unlike traditional equity markets, cryptocurrencies are traded round the clock, leading to higher volatility, especially during weekends when liquidity is typically thinner. This amplified volatility often persuades traders to employ leveraged positions, causing substantial swings in price direction. Moreover, despite an initial dip, Bitcoin remained largely resilient when the lawsuits were first announced. Now, however, investors seem to be reassessing this risk, incorporating the regulatory threats into their valuation models, which in turn is applying further downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. The combination of heightened regulatory scrutiny and market dynamics suggests that Bitcoin's price could remain lower for the foreseeable future. The decline in Bitcoin's average transaction fees suggests a more user-friendly environment for transactions on the network, as shown in the chart below. High transaction fees have been a frequent criticism of Bitcoin, potentially limiting its use for microtransactions or as a daily currency. When transaction fees were at their peak in 2023, it would have been costly for users to perform transactions, especially smaller ones. Now that the fees are lower, this makes Bitcoin more accessible and practical for regular use, potentially leading to an increase in adoption rates. However, this trend also might suggest a decrease in network congestion, which could indicate lower usage or demand. On the other hand, the decrease in the average number of transactions per block may reflect a decreased volume of transactions on the Bitcoin network. This drop could result from various factors, including possible shifts towards alternative cryptocurrencies with lower fees or faster transaction times. This decline might also be a response to the lower transaction fees, as a decrease in fee revenue could discourage miners from processing transactions, thereby reducing the network's capacity. However, it could also simply represent a normalization following a period of unusually high activity. The overall impact on Bitcoin's price will depend on the interplay between multiple factors, including broader market trends and developments. Data by YCharts Bitcoin Grappling with Ongoing Bearish Pressure Bitcoin continues to face bearish pressures, as delineated in the previous report. As anticipated, cryptocurrency is witnessing a downward trend due to the increasing prevalence of potent bearish indicators. A glance at Bitcoin's updated weekly chart reveals that the price has been declining, adhering to the dynamics of a symmetrical broadening wedge pattern. The potential target of this decline is the lower trend line of the symmetrical broadening wedge, as indicated by the red arrow. This bearish outlook is further underscored by the emergence of a double top at the $64.9k and $69.0k thresholds. The neckline of this double top was breached at $29k, and a resistance retest at $31k followed suit. The price's downward continuation can be attributed to the rigorous rebound test at the neckline of the double top, as shown in the chart below. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (stockcharts.com) To provide a more precise visualization of the trends, the logarithmic view of the price chart indicates that the recent decline from $31k stems from a formidable resistance at the neckline. It is anticipated that the price will continue this downward trajectory. The one potential obstacle in this descent is the mid-level Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) support. If a weekly candle closes below the $24k mark, it would indicate a break in the mid-level RSI support, suggesting a further price reduction. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (stockcharts.com) Bitcoin Weekly Chart (stockcharts.com) To further dissect these patterns, Bitcoin's short-term price trend can be analyzed using the daily chart below. It showcases the formation of another broadening wedge pattern, delineated by red dotted lines. As the price began to drop from the $31k resistance level, the behavior of Bitcoin followed a head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating strong bearish implications. As predicted in the previous update, these patterns were likely to break down, leading to lower trading prices. Bitcoin Daily Chart (stockcharts.com) The implications of these patterns for investors are critical. As the optimal selling opportunity has already been exploited and Bitcoin's price has fallen to lower levels, investors may be anxious about the next steps in the Bitcoin market. Investors could currently be considering additional market opportunities at the potential price bounces. However, the short-term chart below suggests a neckline break, implying a potential further drop in the coming weeks. If a bounce towards the $25.5k or $27k occurs, investors should consider selling Bitcoin in anticipation of lower prices. The decline target could potentially extend to between $15k and $20k, or even lower. Bitcoin Daily Chart (stockcharts.com) Market Risks Bitcoin and Ethereum displayed robust resilience to the SEC lawsuits' initial shock, indicating the cryptocurrency market's inherent potential for shock absorption and recovery. This resilience could set the stage for a potential future price rebound. Enhancing this possibility is the recent reduction in Bitcoin's transaction fees, which makes it more practical for daily transactions and could spur higher adoption rates. As more individuals begin using Bitcoin regularly, it could stoke demand, possibly leading to a surge in its value. It is intriguing to note that the continuous 24/7 trading feature of cryptocurrencies, often associated with increased volatility and seen as a potential risk, could potentially work in favor of Bitcoin. By having certain catalysts in play, such as favorable regulatory advancements or a substantial increase in adoption, this heightened volatility could catalyze significant price surges. Furthermore, the recent decrease in the average number of transactions per block might merely signal a return to normal after a period of heightened activity. This normalization could imbue the market with stability and lay the groundwork for an upward price trajectory. Bottom Line In conclusion, the Bitcoin market is presently facing a wave of volatility and downward pressure, mainly attributed to escalating regulatory scrutiny on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. Yet, Bitcoin has showcased remarkable resilience, signifying the inherent potential of the crypto market to bounce back from such tumultuous situations. Nevertheless, the future is laden with uncertainties. Bitcoin investors should maintain vigilance towards evolving market trends, with special emphasis on regulatory news and broader market shifts. The possibility of more price declines in the near term implies that any upward price fluctuation could provide a strategic opportunity for investors to sell. In the realm of technical analysis, the emergence of head and shoulders patterns are traditionally seen as bearish indicators, while the formation of a symmetrical broadening wedge alludes to intense market volatility. These patterns suggest a continuation of the bearish trend and forecast further drops in price. The breach below the neckline further substantiates this forecast, suggesting that the price could potentially tumble further toward the $15k to $20k range, or even lower.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611968-bitcoin-likely-to-decline-further-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13870398.jpeg

As such, the documents offer a rare but limited window into Tether’s finances, long a subject of controversy and conjecture in the crypto industry. When Attorney General Letitia James announced her office’s settlement with Tether in February 2021, she said there had been times in 2017 and 2018 when USDT, Tether’s stablecoin, was not fully backed. The new documents, created six months after the settlement of NYAG’s investigation, neither prove nor disprove that claim.  They do, however, add one more piece to the puzzle of where Tether stores the assets backing the token. Over the years, information about the company’s banking relationships has come out only in dribs and drabs.  Tether (USDT) is the world’s largest stablecoin, holding a significant role as the counterparty asset for crypto trades on countless exchanges. It is designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar, with Tether claiming it holds at least a dollar’s worth of assets in reserve for every single USDT token in circulation. The company has long been dogged by concerns that USDT has been less than fully backed, concerns the New York State Attorney General’s office seemingly vindicated in April 2019 when it announced that Tether had loaned some $850 million in reserves to Bitfinex, an exchange it shares corporate officers and parentage with. Bitfinex lost access to that amount of its own funds when its payment processor was seized by authorities.  In its FOIL request, CoinDesk requested documents detailing the USDT stablecoin’s backing after Tether published its first public document laying out what its reserves were composed of. At the time, nearly half was in unspecified commercial paper.  In announcing its settlement with the NYAG’s office in 2021, Tether claimed it would publish the same information it shared with the NYAG on its reserves for at least two years. Its first public release, in May 2021, amounted to a pair of pie charts and a brief statement.  A portfolio report in the released documents, dated April 7, 2021, contains similar pie charts but far more information, providing specific U.S. dollar amounts for Tether’s reserves. Information pertaining to actual fixed-term deposits was redacted, but shows Tether held millions in reserves in certificates of deposit, bonds and especially in commercial paper.  According to a letter dated June 4, 2021, Tether kept funds in Ansbacher (Bahamas) Limited (confirming Forbes reporting from February of this year) and Capital Union Bank in the Bahamas (the latter relationship was previously reported by the Financial Times) and Far Eastern International Bank in Taiwan (Tether’s use of Taiwanese banks was previously reported by Bloomberg, though no names were given). However, the vast majority of its assets were in Bahamas-based Deltec Bank and Trust – more than $26 billion as of March that year. (The Deltec relationship has been public since November 2018, when Tether released a letter on the bank’s letterhead, which famously bore a squiggle of a signature and no employee’s name. Deltec’s chairman later confirmed to CoinDesk the document was authentic.)  According to CoinGecko, there were $40.8 billion worth of USDT in circulation as of 10:30 p.m. ET on March 31, 2021.  The same document goes on to detail what assets were in each of the respective institution's holdings, confirming that Tether had a significant amount of its reserves in commercial paper.  Another portfolio report, issued by Ansbacher, further breaks down these details, showing that nearly 85% of Tether’s holdings at the financial institution were commercial paper. Corporate bonds made up the bulk of the remainder, with 13.7% of Tether’s holdings taking that form. High yield bonds, floating rate notes and credit accounts made up the remainder.  The document was not signed.  Similarly, Capital Union Bank provided a report which said nearly 88% of Tether’s holdings were “liquid assets,” though it did not provide a further breakdown.  Several of these documents detail the Tether legal team’s communications with the NYAG’s office immediately after they settled the regulator’s long-running inquiry into Tether.  According to one of these communications, the NYAG’s office had questions about Tether’s commercial paper holdings after the settlement.  “Regarding Tether’s acquisition of commercial paper assets, Tether maintains accounts at different banks as identified in our prior letter. Tether requests quotes for commercial paper offerings from those banks who, in turn, request these from brokers and other counterparties who either deal directly with issuers for the issuance of commercial paper, or who deal on secondary markets to purchase commercial paper,” read a letter from Tether’s outside counsel sent on June 25, 2021.  CoinDesk obtained the documents after a nearly two-year legal battle after Tether filed to block the NYAG from releasing them. Klaris Law represented CoinDesk in court, securing a victory in February.  Prior to the publication of this article, Tether published a statement acknowledging the NYAG FOIL officer’s release of the documents after the company did not take the steps necessary to appeal a court decision ordering the documents be shared. A second statement published Friday purported to detail what was in the documents.  “Tether initiated these proceedings in the first instance to prevent the public dissemination of confidential customer data and to prevent the use of sensitive commercial information that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors,” the first statement said. “However, our ongoing and demonstrable commitment to transparency means that we must prioritize openness over further time-consuming and unproductive American litigation that distracts from the real issues facing our community.”  Tether did not immediately respond to a detailed list of questions about some of the documents.  In its statement, Tether also said it “found it suspicious” that USDT depegged after millions of dollars’ worth were sold on decentralized finance pools “on the same day” that the New York government shared the documents with CoinDesk.  In fact, the stablecoin briefly lost its peg prior to 07:00 UTC (3:00 a.m. ET) on June 15, at least five hours before the NYAG FOIL officer shared the documents with CoinDesk’s attorneys.  “CoinDesk learned from our lawyers on June 12 that we would finally receive the documents after a long court dispute in which Tether tried to block their disclosure,” said Marc Hochstein, Executive Editor of CoinDesk. “We did not share the news of our win with anyone outside our editorial staff until after we received the documents on the morning of June 15 in New York, hours after USDT lost its peg. CoinDesk stands by the integrity of our reporting.”  UPDATE (June 16, 2023, 15:55 UTC): Clarifies that Tether may have had funds in other unspecified securities in addition to commercial paper.",NEUTRAL,USDT,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/16/tethers-banking-relationships-commercial-paper-exposure-detailed-in-newly-released-legal-documents,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/621d3d05d646f4917ca05dfc62a053f473eddef9-1500x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Saylor has said that under the right conditions, the price of Bitcoin will jump by 10x to set a new trading high at $250,000. In other news, Tradecurve, a new hybrid exchange has outlined plans to overtake Binance as the number one crypto exchange, and some experts believe it is possible. Michael Saylor has predicted a 10x price jump for Bitcoin, predicting the crypto will trade as high as $250,000 in the next bull run. According to Saylor, regulatory clarity will be the catalyst for the next bull run. While Binance suffers due to regulatory clarity, a new hybrid exchange has tapped into markets that could see it overtake the number one crypto exchange. Michael Saylor Predicts 10x Price Jump for Bitcoin (BTC) In an interview with Bloomberg, Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Microstrategy, an enterprise business intelligence provider, predicted that the price of Bitcoin could jump by 10x. In explaining the reasoning for his prediction, Saylor said regulatory clarity in the U.S. will drive the next Bitcoin rally. The presence of regulatory clarity will encourage venture capitalists that have avoided cryptocurrencies to jump into the industry. He adds that the recent crackdown on many top crypto exchanges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would lay the groundwork for the next major Bitcoin bull run. Congress is already working on a unified crypto regulatory framework and assigning crypto-specific roles to SEC and CFTC, meaning the next Bitcoin bull run couldn’t be far away. If Saylor’s prediction holds true, we would witness Bitcoin set a new all-time high at $250,000, beating its previous ATH at $68,789. Binance Has a New Challenger, And the Hybrid Exchange Could Overtake It On the journey to regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry, the leading crypto exchange, Binance, has been caught in the web of the SEC. The crackdown on centralized exchanges has opened a window for the newer hybrid exchanges, which many crypto experts have called the future of crypto trading because they combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. One hybrid exchange, Tradecurve, has set out to challenge the dominance of Binance by incorporating into its platform trading features that Binance lack, including more trading options (forex and derivatives), negative balance protection, self-management of private keys, low latency ultra-fast order execution, and algorithmic trading. By looking to offer wider assets for trading and features that will make for a seamless trading experience, Tradecurve plans to topple Binance as the number one crypto trading platform. With the current regulatory crackdown on Binance, many crypto analysts believe Tradecurve has a chance to steal market share from Binance to reduce its dominance. Tradecurve is on track to enact its plan, currently in the fourth presale phase expecting to raise $20 million to launch its platform. The project has enjoyed massive support from investors currently buying its native token, TCRV, at $0.018 per token.

Cryptocurrency traders are now asking ChatGPT, the most popular AI-driven chatbot globally, to tell them everything they need to know surrounding the future value of Binance coin, Tradecurve, and Bitcoin during the current bear market. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Asking ChatGPT About Binance coin According to ChatGPT, the price of Binance coin at the end of 2023 is difficult to predict with 100% accuracy; however, based on the current market conditions and historical price data, the AI is able to make some educated guesses as to how far it can climb. On June 9, 2023, Binance coin traded at $259.21 per coin. This represents a lower point of value than the one Binance coin had at the start of the month, but there are factors that could impact its price in the future, including Binance's continued push towards creating new features and products, market demand, and overall regulatory compliance of the exchange. The price of Binance coin at the end of 2023, according to some piece predictions made for the Binance coin, places it at a value of $465.85. The Answers ChatGPT Gave for Bitcoin The price of Bitcoin as of June 9, 2023, is at $26,607.05. Analysts went to ChatGPT to get accurate predictions about the future of Bitcoin. However, the AI did note that nothing can be predicted with 100% certainty. The key factors that can affect the value of Bitcoin, according to ChatGPT, include the overall momentum of the market, mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and the development of new, innovative features on top of the network or the creation of Layer-2 scaling solutions for it. The price of Bitcoin at the end of 2023 could see an increase, however, and based on estimates, BTC is expected to reach $65,000 by the end of the year. What ChatGPT Thinks about The Performance of Tradecurve Investors and traders are also curious about new projects, and Tradecurve has stood out due to its popularity, appeal, and the freedom it provides investors as it does not require KYC checks whilst also having the lowest fees in the industry. Tradecurve is a hybrid exchange that combines the best elements of CEXs and DEXs to provide a truly unique, decentralized experience that will enable anyone on a global scale access to markets that are otherwise unavailable to them due to banking restrictions or regulations. Each user of Tradecurve can effectively and effortlessly trade cryptocurrencies, as well as any other derivative, from one account while also maintaining privacy through the platform's DeFi capabilities. TCRV is the utility token behind the platform, and it is currently undergoing Stage 3 of its presale, where it is offered at $0.015. When asked about the future of the cryptocurrency, ChatGPT noted how it could climb to 100x at launch, bringing it to $1.5 in value, because of the increased demand for such a solution after heightened regulation of CEXs, and because of the fast sales of the TCRV tokens, where the team has already sold millions of tokens and can generate $20 million before the presale ends.

EUIPO has finalized a proof of concept ""having engaged in real-life operational tests with four brands, two logistics operators and a customs authority,” following a months-long trial, which showed “promising results,” the agency said of an initiative now known as European Logistics Services Authentication (ELSA), based on a separate project known as the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).

The objective is simple but ambitious: to cultivate a smart contract platform with an unwavering focus on decentralized finance. Frax Protocol: A Trio of Stablecoins and Integrated Subprotocols The Frax Protocol represents a pioneering development in the crypto world. At its core, it issues three distinct decentralized stablecoins: FRAX, a USD pegged asset; the Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin, which uniquely ties its value to a basket of consumer goods, creating a new unit of account independent of national currencies; and FraxEther (frxETH), a stablecoin pegged to ETH, designed to replace WETH in smart contracts. Complementing these stablecoins, the protocol also houses three subprotocols: Fraxlend, Fraxswap, and Fraxferry. Fraxswap, the first Automated Market Maker (AMM) using time-weighted average market maker orders, helps in rebalancing collateral, minting/redemptions, adjusting stablecoin supply, and deploying protocol-owned liquidity on-chain. Fraxlend creates a lending market for Frax-based stablecoins, allowing the origination of debt, bespoke non-custodial loans, and the incorporation of collateral assets into the Frax Finance economy. Lastly, Fraxferry enables the transfer of Frax Protocol tokens across multiple blockchains. Frax Share (FXS) serves as the primary governance token across the Frax ecosystem, accruing fees, revenue, and excess collateral value. An additional governance token, FPIS, is specific to the FPI and shares its value capture with FXS holders. A Gauge Rewards System allows the community to propose rewards for strategies that integrate Frax-based stablecoins. The fixed, halving annual FXS emissions flow to different gauges based on veFXS staker votes. Frax Finance Sets Sights on Layer 2 with Fraxchain Fraxchain, a project by the makers of the Frax stablecoin, is set to strengthen the hold of decentralized finance in the blockchain landscape. “Fraxchain marks the zenith of the entire Frax ecosystem and mirrors the traction and usage we’ve attained,” Frax founder Sam Kazemian explains. A Glimpse into the Fraxchain Framework The slated release date for this network is by the end of this calendar year. The network's governance will hinge on the holders of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. The modus operandi of the network includes leveraging the Frax stablecoin and Frax Ether, the project's liquid staking derivative, for transaction fees. What's more, the fees garnered by the roll-up network could partially be burned or funneled back to the Ethereum mainnet, to be dispersed among stakers of the FXS governance token, Kazemian outlined. Fraxchain hinges on a Layer 2 rollup model. In this arrangement, it will publish state roots to the Ethereum mainnet for securing the network. The rollup network will also incorporate decentralized sequencers—these nodes order transactions into batches in a rollup network. Any entity can operate them, as long as they secure the nod via a governance vote. Kazemian further elaborated on this feature: “Fraxchain proposes a solution where sequencer roles can be auctioned off and rotated, creating a decentralized sequencer base. If a sequencer is forced to shut down, Fraxchain would allow the next elected sequencer to pick up from where the previous one left off,” he explained. Fraxchain: By the Numbers As per the numbers, Frax's ecosystem has made a significant mark on the world of crypto. As of this writing, the total supply of Frax stands at over $1.23 billion, while Frax Shares (FXS) have a market cap exceeding $371 million. The Frax stablecoin is listed on major exchanges and is integrated into numerous DeFi platforms, while FXS token is used for governance decisions, further cementing its position in the decentralized finance space. The launch of Fraxchain encapsulates the pivotal move of Frax Finance to fortify its position in the DeFi world. It will be interesting to monitor the progress of this Layer 2 solution, with an eye on the continued growth and traction of the Frax ecosystem.

42420229,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCKL,1686923409,Crypto Traders Flock to OTC Markets as Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Amid Regulatory Clampdown,"Crypto traders are turning to over-the-counter (OTC) markets to source elusive liquidity following a regulatory crackdown that has resulted in a substantial decrease in market depth on centralized exchanges.  OTC demand has been steadily on the rise since the collapse of FTX in November, with subsequent spikes being attributed to the collapse of several crypto lenders last year and more recently the SEC's decision to sue Binance, according to Zahreddine Touag, head of trading at Paris-based market making firm Woorton.  The catalyst for this demand has been the sharp drop in market depth across exchanges. Market depth is a metric that measures liquidity by assessing how much capital would be required to move an asset in either direction, typically measured at a spread of 2%.  Last month, Jane Street and Jump, two prominent market makers, announced that they were at very least reducing their trading activity. This compounded the liquidity woes that had been felt since FTX's collapse, with market depth on exchanges sliding by more than 50% between November and May, according to Kaiko.  And this week it emerged that market depth on Binance.US, the exchange at the center of the SEC's lawsuit, had plunged by more than 76%.  This effectively means that traders looking to execute larger transactions will have to deal with inevitable slippage as order books remain thin. As a result, the OTC market, which allows traders to conduct large transactions without needing to go to an exchange, looks to be becoming more prevalent.  ""We've been receiving a lot more [OTC] demand,"" Woorton's Touag told CoinDesk. ""Spreads are tight due to daily recurring flow we have on both sides from payment providers, brokers and algorithmic traders.""  This trend is eerily reminiscent of the time after Mt Gox, the largest crypto exchange at the time, got hacked and subsequently ceased operations in 2014. Despite the largest exchange falling, the demand for digital assets continued, with peer-to-peer markets on exchanges like LocalBitcoins emerging as the champions of the 2014 bear market.  But as crypto continued to thrust itself into the world of traditional finance, the stature of firms getting involved in the industry began to notably increase. By 2020, counterparties would no longer be an arbitrage trader on LocalBitcoins, and publicly-listed companies like MicroStrategy dealt directly with Nasdaq-listed exchange Coinbase.  This week the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF as it attempts to create a secure investment vehicle for funds and trading firms to gain crypto exposure.

Crypto analysts study the charts to see what this means for the meme coin while also discovering a new token, rising against all odds—Uwerx. This article explores what the SEC lawsuit could mean for Dogecoin (DOGE) while exploring the unique benefits Uwerx has to offer its users. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Fate of the Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE), like several other tokens, has been caught in the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. While several media platforms spread uncertainty and fear regarding Dogecoin (DOGE), crypto analysts take a different approach to the token’s price predictions. Most media outlets have communicated that the recent sell-offs and price drops in Dogecoin (DOGE) forewarn investors of an even bleaker future. But crypto analysts have stated that the sell-offs and price drops were not driven by long-term traders but by short-term investors. According to industry experts, the fate of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the crypto market is less bleak than media outlets will lead most to believe. Today, Dogecoin (DOGE) sells at $0.061421, with a live market cap of $8,554,931,776. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) market supply is presently at 139,736,336,384 DOGE. Due to market sentiments, Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to reach $0.092 by 2024. Uwerx (WERX): A Brighter Future Uwerx is positioned to be the leading freelance platform globally. Uwerx is set to be different and preferable compared to other freelancing platforms. Considering Uwerx’s increasing numbers, one might state that Uwerx is already meeting its goals. With over 6,200 sign-ups on the Uwerx platform, over 1,600 followers on Twitter, and over 1,600 subscribers to the Telegram community, the Uwerx platform is growing beyond all expectations. While other platforms might take this as a sign to work less hard, the Uwerx team remains unrelenting. With the current listing on CoinSniper and the scheduled Uwerx listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, the Uwerx Team is doing all it can to ensure that Uwerx reaches its target audience. The confidence of the Uwerx team in expanding its reach can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Uwerx has successfully passed its audit approval by InterFi Network and SolidProof. This implies that the platform is excellent by all standards in the industry. In addition, Uwerx is set to only offer a 1% transaction fee, a very affordable fee compared to Upwork and Fiverr’s 10 and 20%. Uwerx will also be offering its users incentivization and gamification features to serve as more motivation for their work. Uwerx will also put a 25-year liquidity lock in place for its tokens. Uwerx team tokens are included in the mix as team tokens have already been locked for nine months, further assuring Uwerx users of the security and stability of their tokens. Once Uwerx is unveiled on the 4th of August, 2023, contract ownerships will be renounced, thus eliminating the likelihood of scams and fraud. The Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled, allowing Uwerx users to store their tokens securely, just like staking, as they get rewarded dependent on the variables existing within the platform. The Alpha platform has also been unveiled, and Uwerx will soon be transitioning from the Alpha Platform to the Beta platform, allowing Uwerx users to test the platform for themselves. The Uwerx team encourages users to send their feedback via email to the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. On the 31st of July, 2023, when Uwerx’s presale ends, WERX token holders will receive their tokens in a 6-week vesting period. Uwerx will also carry out a Test Airdrop when the Uwerx presale ends. Uwerx (WERX) Presale: Beyond the Stars The Uwerx team has been in awe of Uwerx’s incredible growth and sell-out of its presale. The first four stages of Uwerx’s presale were all sold out in a very short time. The Uwerx team has also had to modify the critical token allocations due to the high demands for Uwerx. WERX tokens sell at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on all purchases. Considering that Uwerx will be launched officially on the 4th of August, this price is bound to increase soon. Click on any of the links to purchase your WERX tokens at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on your purchases.

13868839,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538251,1686922362,"Bitcoin Market Dominance Touches Two-Year Peak, Here’s Why","Amid the ongoing crypto regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged to its highest level since July 2021, suggesting a shift in the sentiments of traders and investors towards the world’s pioneer and most substantial cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This milestone highlights the current volatility of the crypto market as it continues to grapple with regulatory uncertainty and the various factors that impact Bitcoin’s value. The Resurgence Of Bitcoin Dominance The latest data from TradingView reveals that Bitcoin dominance, defined as Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, has hit a high of 49.5%. This level has not been recorded since July 2021 when Bitcoin’s dominance touched a peak of over 48%. It is worth noting that earlier this year in April, Bitcoin’s dominance momentarily reached 48.83%, after which it fluctuated within a specific range. Related Reading: BlackRock Inches Closer To Launching Bitcoin ETF: Potential Impact On BTC Price However, the past week saw a notable increase in Bitcoin’s market dominance, correlating with the time when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) categorized numerous tokens as unregistered securities in its lawsuits against the world’s largest crypto exchanges – Binance and Coinbase. Consequently, many of these tokens such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) have experienced significant price drops, while Bitcoin’s value has remained comparatively stable. Market Influences And The Upcoming BTC Halving The regulatory actions by the SEC underscore an environment of uncertainty that has had noticeable effects on the crypto market. Amid this backdrop, Bitcoin emerges as a sort of safe haven. Micheal Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, echoed these sentiments in a recent interview with Bloomberg, predicting that: “the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to Bitcoin and a half a dozen to a dozen other proof-of-work tokens.” Furthermore, anticipation around the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, slated for April or May 2024, could be a contributing factor to Bitcoin’s increasing dominance. This quadrennial event reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by half, effectively slowing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created to manage inflation and maintain their scarcity. The impending halving will result in a block reward decrease from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125 bitcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price On Shaky Ground: Market Analysts Warn Of Potential Fall To $20,000 Level Notably, BTC has been in a downward trend in the past week. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a bearish movement falling by nearly 5% in the past 7 days. However, over the past 24 hours, BTC has picked up an uptrend, seeing a 2.3% gain in its value. Bitcoin currently has a market price of $25,515, at the time of writing after initially trading below that price range earlier this week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s trading volume has plunged over the past 24 hours from over $15 billion on Thursday to $7.7 billion at the time of writing indicating less trading activity.

According to a breaking report from Le Monde, investigations into the exchange's activities were to have been underway since at least the early quarter of 2022. The inquest, led by the judicial investigation service of finance and under the specialized interregional jurisdiction of Paris, has brought into question the exchange's adherence to legal norms. Reportedly, the focus of the probe revolves around ""acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering."" Particularly, the exchange is being examined for its participation in investment operations, concealment, and conversion - all purportedly carried out by offenders that generated profits. Offhand, however, these allegations appear to be more a matter of misinterpretation and miscommunication withe the regulatory body than a wilful abandonment of due diligence from the side of Binance. Binance Commits To KYC Procedures Simultaneously, questions have been raised about Binance's commitment to 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) procedures, a regulatory framework meant to curb money laundering activities. Reports suggest that Binance may not have been fully compliant with these protocols, leading to further speculation about the exchange's operations. To further complicate matters, it's alleged that Binance had been offering services to French customers without obtaining an appropriate operating license. Regulations enacted in 2019 require crypto exchanges to gain the approval of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to legally operate in France. Binance commenced operations in France in 2020 but purportedly only secured AMF approval in May 2022, fueling further controversy. In response to the claims, a Binance spokesperson maintained that the company cooperates with global law enforcement and abides by all local laws. However, they refrained from commenting on specifics about the investigation. ""Binance invests considerable time and resources into cooperating with law enforcement globally. We abide by all laws in France, just as we do in every other market we operate,"" the exchange said in a tweet thread responding to reportage on the matter. To clarify:In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors, are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities. Binance, as always, was fully collaborative and we met our… — Binance (@binance) June 16, 2023 Binance: Between Compliance and Current Charges This French investigation comes amidst Binance facing litigation in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought forward 13 charges against the crypto exchange's U.S. subsidiary and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Recent reportage also indicate that Binance.US has also cut off staff amid the ongoing legal troubles. These revelations underscore the challenging terrain for Binance, as well as for similar platforms such as Coinbase. As of mid-2022, the SEC stated that out of the 62 million users on Binance globally, only 25 million had filled in KYC documents. This implies a substantial proportion of users on the platform are operating without the requisite KYC documentation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Reportedly, the focus of the probe revolves around ""acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering."" Particularly, the exchange is being examined for its participation in investment operations, concealment, and conversion - all purportedly carried out by offenders that generated profits. Offhand, however, these allegations appear to be more a matter of misinterpretation and miscommunication withe the regulatory body than a wilful abandonment of due diligence from the side of Binance. Binance Commits To KYC Procedures Simultaneously, questions have been raised about Binance's commitment to 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) procedures, a regulatory framework meant to curb money laundering activities. Reports suggest that Binance may not have been fully compliant with these protocols, leading to further speculation about the exchange's operations. To further complicate matters, it's alleged that Binance had been offering services to French customers without obtaining an appropriate operating license. Regulations enacted in 2019 require crypto exchanges to gain the approval of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to legally operate in France. Binance commenced operations in France in 2020 but purportedly only secured AMF approval in May 2022, fueling further controversy. In response to the claims, a Binance spokesperson maintained that the company cooperates with global law enforcement and abides by all local laws. However, they refrained from commenting on specifics about the investigation. Binance: Between Compliance and Current Charges This French investigation comes amidst Binance facing litigation in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought forward 13 charges against the crypto exchange's U.S. subsidiary and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Recent reportage also indicate that Binance.US has also cut off staff amid the ongoing legal troubles. These revelations underscore the challenging terrain for Binance, as well as for similar platforms such as Coinbase. As of mid-2022, the SEC stated that out of the 62 million users on Binance globally, only 25 million had filled in KYC documents. This implies a substantial proportion of users on the platform are operating without the requisite KYC documentation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

HIVE has little wiggle room to survive and grow as shareholder equity declined 68% since 2021Q4 due to declining asset value. Due to the increase in Bitcoin mining difficulty, HIVE's Bitcoin production declined (42%) more than our predictions (32%) even though mining capacity recovered to pre-Merge levels. HIVE is still far from safety, as Bitcoin is still trading near cash expense per Bitcoin and well below its total mining cost per Bitcoin. HIVE is trading 115% above its adjusted NAV, Bitcoin needs to trade above $54,414 to provide sufficient profitability to compensate for the premium valuation. The Becoming of A Legacy Bitcoin Miner About a year ago in July 2022, HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) was our prime go-to crypto mining company to invest in. It had many advantages over other Bitcoin mining companies. It operates with 100% renewable energy, sub $20,000 total mining cost per Bitcoin (including all business costs), growing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) reserves, attractive valuations (trading below adjusted net asset value, NAV), and more. The only major risk we identified was 'The Merge', which is Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake ('PoS'). Hence, we maintain our strategy to HODL Bitcoin. Although 'The Merge' was imminent, Ethereum's transition had been delayed for many years . There was no saying how long HIVE can enjoy the high margins from mining Ethereum. Then 2 months later in September, Ethereum's pivot to PoS is completed. Still, HIVE was adamant about optimistic opportunities to mine other Proof-of-Work ('PoW') coins and tokens should Ethereum switch to PoS. We studied and outlined 3 ways we expect HIVE to navigate . So it will be interesting to see how has HIVE fared since 'The Merge'. HIVE's Post-Merge Bitcoin Production On a high level, Bitcoin production is a function of 2 things: mining capacity and Bitcoin network hash rate (or mining difficulty). We predicted that the production (revenue) will decline by more than 32% due to the mining difficulty differential between Bitcoin and Ethereum. In 2022Q4 and 2023Q1, HIVE's Bitcoin production fell by 43%, 10% more than our estimation. In this sense, the 10% additional decline can be attributed to the increase in Bitcoin mining difficulty. HIVE also seemed to agree. In all of HIVE's monthly updates in 2022Q4, HIVE seemed very conscious about the mining difficulty of Bitcoin to attribute the decline in Bitcoin production to the increased mining difficulty. For example: The Bitcoin network difficulty saw a total 17% increase during the month of October... Bitcoin mining difficulty had increased substantively for the month of October relative to the month of September... The Bitcoin network difficulty was consistent throughout the month of November, with less than +/- 1% variance... But when mining capacity increased in 2023Q1, HIVE no longer mentioned mining difficulty. We just think that HIVE could be more explicit in attributing the decline in production to mining capacity (Table 1) as well. Referring to Table 1, HIVE's production has yet to recover to the pre-Merge level. We think that it is unlikely for HIVE to regain the pre-Merge production level anytime soon. On one hand, the Bitcoin mining difficulty has been increasing by 93% annually since 2021H1. On the other hand, HIVE missed its mid-2023 6.2 EH/s target, and may not have the balance sheet to expand willfully. In May 2022, HIVE stated that: HIVE is pleased to provide a market update on the Company’s growth plans for the year ahead. The Company will be at 6.2 Exahash BTC equivalent hashrate in one year , based on contracted monthly deliveries of ASIC and GPU hardware (with deposits in place), up from 3.4 Exahash of BTC equivalent hashrate today. Note that HIVE used the term 'equivalent hashrate', meaning the 6.2 EH/s target also includes Ethereum mining capacity. Since the Ethereum mining capacity is worth less in terms of Bitcoin-equivalent capacity post-Merge, 2022Q3 and 2022Q4 saw a 40% drop (2.06 / 3.4 EH/s, Table 1) in mining capacity. It is not until May that HIVE recovered pre-Merge mining capacity. Even so, Bitcoin production remains below pre-Merge levels due to the increase in mining difficulty. Hence, HIVE's concern about increasing mining difficulty is well justified. Table 1. HIVE's Historical Bitcoin Production and Mining Capacity Quarter ('CY') Bitcoin-Equivalent Production Mining Capacity (EH/s) 2023Q2 913.8* 3.32 2023Q1 792 3.08 2022Q4 787 2.06 2022Q3 1380.2 2.28 Source: Author (* indicates estimation extrapolated from May Production) In June 2023, HIVE resumed its 6 EH/s year-end target. Whether HIVE can realize this target remains to be seen. HIVE currently has $8.6mil in cash and $15.7mil in deposits. We previously estimated that it requires $23mil to add 1 EH/s of mining capacity. Hence, adding another 2.7 EH/s would require about $46mil. Hence, we do not think that HIVE has the balance sheet to meet this expansion target at the moment. Else, we expect to see an increase in liability or outstanding shares (about 13%). In any of the 3 cases, shareholder value will decline. Implications of HIVE's Shareholder Equity Decline If HIVE does not meet the 6 EH/s target, production will decline due to the increased mining difficulty. This lowers the intrinsic value of the company. A decrease in production also increases the mining cost per Bitcoin as many of HIVE's expenses are fixed expenses. Either HIVE has to offload its Bitcoin reserves to cover expenses or HIVE has to raise equity or liability to cover expenses. These lead to the death spiral. If Hive raises funds through equity, HIVE's shareholder equity will decline further. Table 2 showed that HIVE's book value and book value per share has been declining even before 'The Merge'. Book value decreased a lot but book value per share decreased even more. An attempt to fund expansion through equity offerings will further decrease HIVE's book value per share. Table 2. HIVE's Declining Shareholder Equity QR( CY ) Shares Outstanding (mil) Equipment ($mil) Total Assets ($mil) Total Liability ($mil) Total Equity ($mil) Book Value Per Share ($) 2022Q4 82.7 93.9 189.4 48.5 140.9 1.70 2022Q3 82.53 132 278.4 50 228.5 2.77 2022Q2 82.2 172 319 60 319 3.88 2022Q1 77.7 (Post reverse split) 177.5 452 63 389 5.05 2021Q4 388,433,985 107 487 55.1 432 Source: Author Currently, HIVE's market cap ($262mil) is 86% higher than its book value. Using our conservative measurement (adjusted NAV) to include only cash, prepaid, equipment, and Bitcoin reserve, HIVE is trading 115% higher than its 2022Q4 book value. Comparatively (Figure below), HIVE's shares were trading at similar prices back as today in Oct 2022 but it was below book value. In addition, HIVE shareholders lost 68% of shareholder equity since 2021Q4. It is observable that the decline in shareholder equity is caused by the decline in HIVE's asset value. This implies that HIVE has lesser wiggle room to survive a prolonged Bitcoin downturn and expand mining capacity. These observations further cement that HIVE shareholder is quickly losing equity. The same can also be applied to funding through liability, which also ultimately reduces shareholder equity. Data by YCharts Mining Efficiency We've previously provided evidence to show that HIVE's cost basis had de-anchored from the optimal historical average. We also estimated an increase in HIVE's cost basis due to an increase in energy prices, risk of lesser curtailed energy, and differential of energy usage between Bitcoin and Ethereum mining. In the press release for the 2023Q3 quarter, HIVE has confirmed that HIVE is not likely to regain pre-Merge mining efficiency: We ( HIVE ) are sad to see the higher margin from mining Ethereum gone and now will be more easily compared to our Bitcoin mining peers… We estimated that the total mining cost per Bitcoin would rise to $66,000. Fortunately, HIVE's total mining cost per Bitcoin only increased to $48,000. HIVE's total mining cost is worse than CleanSpark ($33,276, CLSK ), Marathon Digital Holdings ($32,100, MARA ), and Riot Platforms ($46,200, RIOT ). Only Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) was found to be worse than HIVE so far due to unsystematic energy woes. Table 2. HIVE's Historical Total Mining Cost per Bitcoin QR( CY ) Total Mining Cost per BTC 2022Q4 48,000 2022Q3 32,100 2022Q2 36,000 2022Q1 53,230 2021Q4 22,500 2021Q3 17,842 2021Q2 23,468 Source: Author When HIVE's total mining cost per BTC is observed along with its declining asset value, it could mean that HIVE cannot afford to replace its mining rigs. Furthermore, Bitcoin is currently trading near its total cash expense per Bitcoin ($19,000, excluding depreciation and Stock-based payments). Should the SEC's lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase ( COIN ) take a turn for the worse, HIVE might be able to survive another Bitcoin shock. Given enough time, based on HIVE's Q2 production update trajectory, we expect HIVE's total mining cost per Bitcoin to steadily decline to the $30,000 - $35,000 benchmark over time as production slowly picks up. But we do not expect it to go back to pre-Merge levels because operating cost (including depreciation) per Bitcoin alone already stands at $39,000 in 2022Q4. Valuation & Verdict As mentioned earlier, HIVE has lost a significant amount of book value since 2021. HIVE is also now trading well above its book value even though HIVE was trading at similar price levels 3 quarters ago. This implies that HIVE has to compensate for this high valuation with a higher level of profitability. Assuming the 6 EH/s expected capacity, our model suggests that Bitcoin has to trade above $54,414 to justify HIVE's current valuation. This is not too bad given that Bitcoin has to trade above $50k, $68k, and $62k to justify MARA, RIOT, and HUT's respective market cap. We maintain that CLSK is still the most attractive undervalued Bitcoin mining company so far, according to our model. It is very unfortunate that HIVE has to take a few steps back just to pivot away from Ethereum. During this period, CLSK, RIOT, and MARA have expanded aggressively, especially MARA (Table 3). With the industry rapidly expanding mining capacity, HIVE might be left behind. Remember that a Bitcoin miner's production performance is relative to another other. Unless HIVE finds ways to beef up its balance sheet and expand, HIVE risks becoming a legacy Bitcoin miner that will struggle to survive. For these reasons, we cannot recommend an investment in HIVE. It is also because of risks like these that we recommend direct investment in Bitcoin over Bitcoin mining companies. Else, you might like to consider CLSK. It's the only Bitcoin mining company our model currently looks at favorably. We hope that HIVE can recover and prove us wrong. HIVE's survival can help keep the Bitcoin network as decentralized as possible, which is good for the overall crypto industry. Table 3.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The iShares unit of fund management giant BlackRock (BLK) filed paperwork Thursday afternoon with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF. To be named the iShares Bitcoin Trust, the fund's assets will ""consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust,"" according to the filing, which said that the custodian will be crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Though approving a number of futures-based bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has notably rejected other fund management company attempts at opening a spot bitcoin ETF, including those from Grayscale, VanEck, and WisdomTree.  Altcoins suffered losses over the last week, with the tokens called out as securities in the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase witnessing some of the worst drops. Among them isPolygon’s MATIC which is down 19% for the week even after posting a gain early Friday. Avalanche’s AVAX lost 17% and Solana (SOL) 15%. Ether, unmentioned in the suits, held up slightly better, losing 9%. Bitcoin declined 3% for the week, though it’s higher by 2% over the past 24 hours to the current $25,500.  Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is leaving the Netherlands, after failing to persuade the Dutch regulator to issue a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, which attests that it meets anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines. As of July 17, Dutch residents will only be able to withdraw their funds from the platform, according to a statement from the exchange. “We regret to announce that Binance is leaving the Dutch market,” Binance said on its website. “This unfortunately means that no new users residing in the Netherlands will be accepted as of today … No further purchases, trades or deposits will be possible. We encourage those users to take appropriate action by withdrawing assets from their accounts.”  Trending Posts  Binance Under Investigation in France, Accused of 'Aggravated' Money Laundering  Avantgarde, Agio Digital Unveil Institutional Onchain Funds Platform  U.S. Court Will Rule on Terraform Labs' Push to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit Within a Month",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/16/first-mover-americas-blackrock-files-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a36668be36bbf7f9dd999d5e293d6388f5e73440-1936x1224.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto market has been a volatile space, prone to sudden shifts in sentiment, and MATIC is no exception. The recent downturn in the sentiment surrounding MATIC has left investors and traders cautiously observing the price charts. Once considered a promising project in the crypto space, Polygon’s potential for growth has been impeded by the recent actions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission against altcoins.

Chart: TradingView.com Fed’s Pause On Rate Hikes Fails To Stabilize Crypto Markets On the whole, financial markets have continued to exhibit volatile movements, causing cryptocurrencies to decouple from the performance of traditional equities markets. The recent downturn in the crypto market seems to be linked to the press conference held by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on June 14, during which he announced that the central bank would temporarily halt rate hikes for the month of June. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: Assessing The Ripple-Colombia Central Bank Partnership While this decision aligned with investors’ expectations, it had an unexpected effect on the crypto market.

Crypto giant Binance’s US affiliate, Binance.US, has reportedly laid off some of its staff after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange with securities violations and sought a temporary restraining order to freeze the exchange’s assets. Reuters reports that around 50 people, or 10%, have been laid off. Sources say employees in the exchange’s legal, compliance, and risk departments have been dismissed. Media outlet CoinDesk cites documents in which Binance.US management described the SEC as a “politically motivated regulator” that forced the company to become a “crypto-only exchange.” The documents read: As part of this transition, and because of our preparation for a multi-year and very costly litigation process, the Board has asked Management to shrink the size of our teams across the company and reduce our burn rate. Adding: Unlike every other US crypto company, we have been working to avoid this scenario, but circumstances have now shifted. This was a very hard decision – one that we didn’t take lightly. We are sad to see our colleagues depart, but we wish them the best and will do what we can to assist them in this transition. Binance.US Suspends USD Deposits and Withdrawals Last week, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing the exchange of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations. The next day, the agency filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of two of Binance’s US units. Days after the SEC filed suit against Binance and requested to freeze Binance.US’s assets, the exchange announced that it was suspending US dollar deposits, and its banking partners were preparing to halt fiat withdrawals from June 13.

FDIC-Insured Accounts - False Claims On June 15, 2023, the FDIC addressed a cease-and-desist to the CEO of OKCoin, Hong Fang, intimating the latter of a potential violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. According to the government agency, the company has falsely claimed a level of customer protection that it does not provide. The letter claims that OKCoin has misrepresented the extent to which customer assets are protected by federal deposit insurance. The FDIC insurance, which only covers traditional bank accounts, does not extend to customer accounts on crypto exchanges. In its list of offerings, OKCoin stated that it offers “FDIC-insured accounts,” which is a misrepresentation. The FDIC claimed that this misrepresentation makes a false promise to the customers and misguides them into making riskier moves due to this false sense of security. FDIC Issues Cease-And-Desist In the letter, the FDIC sought to bring the discrepancy to the attention of the firm and asked them to take corrective steps to alert customers about the limitations of their services. An excerpt from the letter reads, “OKCoin is not FDIC-insured and the FDIC does not insure non-deposit products. By not distinguishing between U.S.-dollar deposits and crypto assets, the statements imply FDIC insurance coverage applies to all customer funds (including crypto assets).” The agency pointed out that users and potential customers should be properly intimated about all the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The FDIC also claimed that the crypto firm needs to further explicitly clarify the lack of regulatory protections on crypto held on its exchange. In order to properly inform the customers of this information, the government agency has asked the company to review its marketing materials, website content, and other public statements. OKCoin To Revise Communication The FDIC's intervention serves as a reminder of the regulatory challenges surrounding the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. As the popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies increase, regulatory bodies are striving to keep pace with emerging risks and ensure consumer protection. OKCoin, founded in 2013, is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally, serving a significant number of users. The allegations by the FDIC could potentially impact the trust and confidence of OKCoin's customer base. Users who may have relied on the falsely claimed FDIC insurance could be reevaluating their positions on the platform. The exchange will need to revise its marketing communications and provide clear and accurate information to its customers about the level of asset protection offered by its platform. The outcome of this situation will have implications not only for OKCoin but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the need for responsible practices and regulatory compliance.

42420226,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCJJ,1686912170,Binance Under Investigation in France for 'Aggravated' Money Laundering,"Binance's French unit is under investigation by local authorities for the ""illegal"" provision of digital asset services and ""acts of aggravated money laundering,"" the Paris public prosecutor's office told CoinDesk.  The investigation relates to illegally operating as a digital asset service provider before it received regulatory approval in May 2022 and ""aggravated money laundering by taking part in investment operations, concealment and conversion, the latter being carried out by perpetrators of offenses having generated profits,” the public prosecution office told CoinDesk. Binance is registered as a PSAN, or digital asset service provider, with the French financial regulator, the AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers).  The world's largest crypto exchange is already facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging failure to register as a trading platform and the sale of unregistered securities. The French unit is suspected of having canvassed French customers through its local arm outside the legal framework until 2022, Le Monde reported earlier on Friday.  The Paris public prosecutor confirmed to CoinDesk that an investigation concerning Binance by the specialized interregional jurisdiction of Paris led to a referral to the SEJF, an anti-financial crime arm of the government, in February 2022. ""The documentary and computer elements collected during the search will now have to be the subject of an in-depth study,"" the prosecutor said.  ""We continue to work closely with regulators and law enforcement agencies on all ongoing compliance requirements to uphold high standards,"" a Binance spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Binance invests considerable time and resources into cooperating with law enforcement globally. We abide by all laws in France, just as we do in every other market we operate. We will not comment on the specifics of law enforcement or regulatory investigations except to say that information about our users is held securely and only provided to government officials upon receipt of documented appropriate justification.""  After publication, the company's Chief Executive Officer Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted to confirm there had been a ""surprise visit"" by the authorities within the last couple of weeks, but that other unnamed crypto firms had been subject to similar treatment. France continued to be the company's flagship center in Europe, he added.  Earlier Friday Binance said it was quitting the Netherlands after failing to obtain a license showing the company meets the country's anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines. The exchange also applied to end its registration with Cyprus' securities regulator, saying it was focusing its efforts ""on fewer regulated entities in the EU.""  During last year's Paris Blockchain Week, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said the city is ""probably ... the financial hub for crypto in Europe and the larger part of the world."" The company had also previously said it was injecting $116 million through a partnership with a local nonprofit to fund growth of the French crypto ecosystem.  France, for its part, has been courting crypto firms as the European Union sets up to regulate crypto under its recently sealed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.

13864474,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538224,1686910556,What Happens To Bitcoin Price If Spot ETF Is Approved? Gold ETF Story Reveals,"The application by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, for approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the biggest story in the crypto market today. Numerous experts are extremely optimistic that an approval of the first Bitcoin spot ETF in the US will be a massively bullish event, attracting huge amounts of new capital and triggering a new bull run. But where does this theory come from? Bitcoin is often referred to as the digital gold of the 21st century, so it’s an obvious choice to look at the history of gold and the first gold based spot ETF. Why The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Would Be So Bullish The first thing to note is that BlackRock applied for a spot ETF and not a Futures ETF. The SEC has already approved a number of Bitcoin Futures ETFs that hold Bitcoin futures contracts on the CME. These are currently traded on the US equity markets, but have relatively low popularity. And this has its reasons, first and foremost the so-called “drag”, as Scimitar Capital explains. Drag refers to the underperformance of a fund that attempts to replicate the return of a particular underlying asset and is a long-term result of regular portfolio rebalancing. To track the spot price, BITO, the largest bitcoin futures ETF, holds 2/3 in the front-month future and 1/3 in the following month. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? However, this “rolling” is costly because of transaction fees, slippage and because futures for the last month are usually traded at a premium over the first month in BTC (“contango”). For this reason, futures ETFs are not a good investment for retail traders in the long run and are therefore unpopular. A Bitcoin spot ETF does not have these disadvantages. “This is the reason why physically backed ETFs like GLD and IAU for gold have a combined 90B of AUM whereas futures backed ones like BITO and USO have a paltry 1.6B,” Scimitar Capital says. The first gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), was listed on the NYSE on November 15, 2004 and revolutionized gold trading. Before GLD came on the market, it was possible to invest in gold in the form of bars, coins, certificates and shares of gold mining companies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims $26,200 But 100 SMA Hold The Key In Short-Term The exchange-traded fund made investing in precious metals a no-brainer and eliminated the problems of shipping and vaults. The same revolution could be coming to Bitcoin by a Bitcoin spot ETF. Retail investors could hold Bitcoin long-term through the ETF without worrying about custody and private keys. And the revolution in gold also made itself felt in the price. While the price of gold was still below $450 per ounce in November 2004, gold saw a meteoric rise in the years that followed. In September 2011, less than seven years after the launch, gold was trading at $1920 per ounce. Many economic factors have influenced the price of gold, but the launch of ETFs certainly played an influential role in attracting global institutional funds to the market. The digital gold of the 21st century, Bitcoin, may yet see this price explosion if history repeats itself. At press time, BTC traded at $25,604, reclaiming the 200-day EMA (blue line).

As many as 96% of the surveyed investors working for pension funds, wealth managers, family offices, hedge funds and investment funds see digital assets as representing an investment diversification opportunity alongside traditional asset classes such as fixed income, cash, equities and commodities, the survey found. They said they were prepared to stash as much as 5% of their investments in digital assets.  Professional investors collectively manage $4.95 trillion in assets. Laser Digital polled 303 of them for the survey. Participants were interviewed online during April, and came from most major financial markets across the world.  “Our comprehensive study reveals that the majority of institutional investors surveyed saw a clear role for digital assets in the investment management landscape, and the benefits they can bring, such as greater diversification of portfolios,” CEO Jez Mohideen said in a release.  Some 82% of the investors had a positive outlook on bitcoin and ether, and 88% said they or their clients were considering investing in digital assets. This enthusiasm for digital assets, however, doesn’t mean they are doubling down on memecoins such as PEPE or DOGE, rather they prefer regulated products as such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the survey found.  Around 90% of those surveyed said that it is important to have the backing of a large traditional financial institution for any digital asset fund or investment vehicle before they or their clients would consider putting money into it – a potentially bullish sign for bitcoin ETF proposals such as BlackRock’s.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/16/professional-investors-still-have-an-appetite-for-digital-assets-survey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5882d24ea6b6cd44c31e07c324fa586eb594583c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420234,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCRZ,1686906000,"Central Banks Successfully Test Over 30 CBDC Use Cases, Including Offline Payments","A joint experiment by central banks has tested ways to connect monetary authorities and the private sector to facilitate retail digital currency payments, according to a new report released on Friday.  The experiment saw the London Innovation hub of the Bank for International Settlements – which groups the world’s central banks – and the Bank of England develop 33 application programming interface (API) functionalities to test more than 30 central bank digital currency (CBDC) use cases, including offline payments.  API software allows two or more computer programs to communicate and share data with each other.  “Project Rosalind” looked at how an API layer could support a retail CBDC and facilitate safe and secure payments through different use cases, said Francesca Hopwood Road, head of the BIS Innovation Hub London Centre, in a press release.  The Bank of England is currently consulting on a digital pound, which it has said will likely be needed in the future. The bank set out in its consultation that it would host the centralized ledger and the application programming interface (API) for a potential digital pound. The API would allow private sector firms to access the ledger and provide services such as automated payments.  “There is actually no shortage of different ways that the market might respond and engage with this,” Hopwood Road told CoinDesk in an interview, referring to Project Rosalind.  A diverse range of payment options were tested in this experiment such as online, offline and in-store payments via interactions with QR codes, mobile phones, smart cards and more, the report said. The project also explored the facilitation of micropayments.  “One use case that Rosalind was employed for was a child-parent wallet, and looking at how payments could be made in that kind of scenario – responsible spending, how parents can allocate pocket money to children, how that money could then be spent in different locations and all those different things,” Hopwood Road said.  The study also found that the API layer could work with different ledgers, she said.  In April, the BIS released a report on Project Meridian, also with the Bank of England, which successfully tested the use of distributed ledger technology in running interbank transactions.  The BIS seeks to experiment in different areas to help contribute to the “very important” CBDC conversation at the moment, Hopwood Road said. Jurisdictions are increasingly exploring the issuance of CBDCs and some countries like Nigeria and the Bahamas have already issued them.  “I think if you look across the range of experiments that we have done in the Innovation Hub, increasingly in the CBDC space, whether it's wholesale or retail, we are experimenting and exploring different dimensions, [such as] cross border, offline, security,” Hopwood Road said.  “I think these are all very important elements of CBDC exploration, and areas that we know central banks are increasingly focusing on and turning their attention to,” she added.  Blockchain network Quant announced its role as part of the vendor team for Project Rosalind on Friday. In a press statement shared with CoinDesk, Quant said it had partnered with digital solutions platform UST on the project, ""with Quant providing the underlying infrastructure and blockchain platform, secure smart contracts and interoperability of central bank ledgers, and UST building the frontend Rosalind API layer.""

13862404,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/colombia-s-central-bank-announces-ripple-partnership,1686905700,Colombia’s Central Bank Announces Ripple Partnership,"The Banco de la Republica, Colombia’s Central Bank, has announced a partnership with Ripple as it looks to explore the use of blockchain technology in the country. Colombia will conduct a pilot project to test Ripple’s CBDC platform for its high-value payments system. The country already uses Ripple’s technology for land distribution efforts being undertaken. The Banco De La Republica And Ripple Partnership Ripple has stated that Colombia’s Central Bank, in partnership with the Ministry for the Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC), will conduct a pilot for Ripples CBDC (central bank digital currency) platform to help improve its high-value payments system. The initiative is part of a larger blockchain experimentation phase being conducted by the Ministry for the Information and Communications Technologies. According to Ripple, its CBDC platform will be experimented with and tested in a controlled environment without the risk of compromising public resources. In a statement, the Minister of Information Technologies and Communications of Colombia said, “Potential efficiencies can be evaluated through the results obtained in the development of a solution with blockchain technology, which manages to improve and complement the processes in the entities in a safe and efficient way.” The vice president of Central Bank Engagements and CBDCs at Ripple, James Wallis, added that he believed the project could clear a path for significant transformative advancements regarding the use of blockchain technology in the public sector. “By harnessing the power of the CBDC Platform, based upon the XRPL, this project will pave the way for transformative advancements in the utilization of blockchain technology within the public sector.” However, the announcement did not disclose when Colombia plans to launch its own central bank digital currency. CBDCs Picking Up Steam In simple terms, a CBDC is a digital version of a country’s fiat currency, such as the Euro and US Dollar, or in Colombia’s case, the Colombian Peso. CBDCs are backed by the country’s central bank and are digital assets different from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is because CBDCs are controlled by a centralized entity, the central bank. According to the Atlantic Council’s central bank digital currency tracker, a total of 120 countries are actively exploring a CBDC. Out of this, 11 countries, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and St. Lucia, have launched their own CBDC. A further 18 countries are in the pilot stage. These include India, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Australia, Iran, and several others. A further 32 countries have CBDCs in the development stage. These include the United States of America, Brazil, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Turkey, Canada, Bhutan, Bahrain, Indonesia, and others. Colombia and Ripple Have Partnered Before The partnership between Colombia and Ripple is not the first time the two have partnered together. Last year, the Colombian government, in partnership with Ripple Labs, launched an initiative to rectify the government’s land distribution efforts. The project was backed by Peersyst Technology, a blockchain development company, and Ripple and will permanently store and authenticate property titles on Ripple’s public blockchain. This would help eliminate cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and make land distribution more equal in the country. Ripple was launched to help banks and financial institutions move funds around quickly without incurring extra fees. Currently, XRP is the world’s 6th largest cryptocurrency. Colombia’s Pro-Crypto Stance Colombia has adopted a pro-crypto stance since electing Gustavo Petro as president in August 2022. The new president is extremely pro-Bitcoin and has spoken strongly in favor of the cryptocurrency during speeches. He has also taken a proactive approach towards cryptocurrencies in general and has hinted that he truly believes in the power of digital assets. President Petro has made several pro-Bitcoin statements in the past. “Bitcoin removes the power of issuance from the states and the seigniorage of the currency from the banks. It is a community currency that is based on the trust of those who carry out transactions with it. Since it is based on the blockchain, trust is measured and grows, hence its strength.” No surprise then that Colombia has taken several initiatives towards adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Right after his election, the government of Colombia launched its digital currency initiative and confirmed its plans for a digital currency. The initiative would be developed in partnership with the country’s central bank. It would make Colombia part of an exclusive group of Latin American countries, such as Venezuela and El Salvador, adopting blockchain technology. In March 2023, Binance announced that it would be launching its prepaid crypto card in Colombia. This would mark the third country in Latin America where Binance debuted its crypto card after Argentina and Brazil. According to Binance, its new crypto card would allow holders to pay with crypto instead of using standard debit or credit cards. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Starting from 17 July, 2023, existing Dutch resident users will only be able to withdraw their assets from the Binance platform. No further purchases, trades or deposits will be possible. We encourage those users to take appropriate action by withdrawing assets from their accounts.”  Europe has generally been receptive to crypto exchanges and their anti-money laundering efforts. Binance is already AML compliant in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania. Two days ago, the exchange said it planned to leave Cyprus to focus on becoming fully compliant with the new European Union rules on crypto-assets (MiCA).  Binance said it has been in a comprehensive registration application process as a virtual asset service provider with the regulator. “Although Binance explored many alternative avenues to service Dutch residents in compliance with Dutch regulations, unfortunately this has not resulted in a VASP registration in the Netherlands at this time.”  The exchange said it will continue to engage with Dutch regulators.  Existing Dutch resident users are being sent an email with comprehensive information about what this means for their accounts and any assets they currently have on the Binance platform, alongside any steps they will need to take.

13861307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538199,1686903042,Why Is Bitcoin Up Today?,"The Bitcoin price has risen 3.2% since yesterday’s low of $24,827. At press time, BTC was trading at $25,590 and has thus reclaimed two extremely important price levels for the moment: first, the Bitcoin price has once again risen above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) currently at $25,299, and second, the price is now also back above the 200-week EMA at $25,304 (with the weekly close becoming of crucial importance). As always, there are several narratives for yesterday’s rise in price. The most obvious narrative and currently the biggest topic in the market is the Bitcoin spot ETF filing by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A spot ETF is seen as the holy grail that could finally open the floodgates for institutional liquidity, as Bitcoinist reported today. Reasons For The Bitcoin Rally BlackRock is believed to have a strong chance of getting the first spot-based Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC due to its political influence and network. The new capital inflows made possible may have the potential to be the next bull run catalyst, according to many experts. “BlackRock getting a BTC ETF through would be the best thing that could happen to BTC,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said yesterday. Accordingly, the news is likely to have created a bullish sentiment in the market. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Tether FUD Could Be Good For Bitcoin However, as always, several reasons play a role in the price movement on the Bitcoin market. One issue that should not be neglected is always the macro situation and the US dollar index (DXY). The latter has seen a setback in the last three days, falling from 104.70 to currently 102.21. This is likely to have favored BTC for now. As for the macro situation, Wednesday’s interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) certainly still plays a role. The main story is that the market is not buying Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish stance. Analysts believe that the two more rate hikes announced in the dot plot are a feint to prevent a bullish breakout in the financial markets. Finally, BTC’s decoupling from the S&P 500 has also been seen in recent days. Yesterday’s move could have been the start of a catch-up rally in which BTC shakes off the unnecessary losses caused by the Tether FUD and the SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance US.

If approved, BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF will become the first crypto spot ETF in the United States of America. Details Of The Application News about BlackRock being close to submitting an application for a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) was recently revealed by a source familiar with the matter. According to a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the custodian of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings would be the Coinbase Custody Trust Company. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon would hold custody of the fund’s fiat currency. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the “Bitcoin Custodian”) is the custodian for the Trust’s bitcoin holdings, and Bank of New York Mellon is the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings (the “Cash Custodian.” The application, filed on the 15th of June, 2023, states, “The Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in Bitcoin.” According to the filing, the Bitcoin price will be updated every 15 seconds during regular market trading through the CF Benchmarks Index. Previously Approved Spot Exchange Products The filing also noted that previously approved spot exchange-traded products in the commodities and currency markets were generally unregulated and that the commission relied on the underlying futures market as the basis for approving or rejecting trust shares in previous instances. “As such, the regulated market of significant size test does not require that the spot bitcoin market be regulated in order for the Commission to approve this proposal.” So far, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a single spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund despite several applications in the past. After a spate of rejections, Grayscale had filed a suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investment firm had challenged the SEC’s refusal to approve Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund. In its arguments, Grayscale stated, “The fundamental problem with the order is that it contradicts previous SEC orders giving the green light to Bitcoin futures ETPs that pose the same risk of fraud and manipulation and have in place the same CME [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] surveillance mechanism to protect against those risks.” Others, such as Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and European investment firm 21Shares, have also been pushing hard for their own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval, having filed their third application back in April. Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF was the world’s first spot-traded Bitcoin ETF, having been set up in early 2021. BlackRock’s Previous Exchange-Traded Fund BlackRock had announced the launch of a Europe-focused exchange-traded fund in September 2022. The ETF looked to provide its European customers with greater exposure to crypto and the blockchain ecosystem. Other reports at the time also indicated a metaverse-focused ETF was also in the pipeline. The ETF was called the iShares Blockchain Technology UCITS ETF and had around 75% of its holdings consisting of exchanges and blockchain companies. The remaining 25% was made up of companies that supported the larger blockchain ecosystem. The ETF gave BlackRock’s European customers to several major companies in crypto, including Galaxy Digital, Marathon Digital, and Coinbase. Furthermore, the biggest holdings in the fund included USD Cash (13%), Block (11.40%), Coinbase (13.20%), Riot Blockchain (10.50%), and Marathon Digital Holdings.

How will this collaboration affect the price of XRP? On Thursday, Ripple announced that the central bank of Colombia and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies (MinTIC) would be exploring the use of blockchain technology in the country’s high value electronic payment system with Ripple. The central bank did not specifically state it will pilot test a central bank digital currency, even though it will employ Ripple’s CBDC platform, supported by a private version of the XRP Ledger. Ripple and @Peersyst are partnering with Colombia’s @BancoRepublica in conjunction with @Ministerio_TIC to pilot use cases that will enhance Colombia’s high-value payment system.🇨🇴 Learn more about the partnership: https://t.co/X9jyJ3pvDa — Ripple (@Ripple) June 15, 2023 Ripple has not let regulatory constraints prevent it from innovating and expanding its reach, notably in Colombia, despite the fact that the blockchain startup is still engaged in a highly publicized legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. A Technological Solution In The Offing For Colombia? Blockchain technology was highlighted by Colombia’s minister of information and communication technology, Mauricio Lizcano, who claimed that it would offer a technological solution (Prototype) that would enable simulations of various use cases in the high-value payment system. Peersyst Technology, a blockchain technology company based in the region, is MinTIC’s direct partner. According to James Wallis, vice president of central bank engagements and CBDCs, Ripple: “By harnessing the power of the CBDC Platform, based upon the XRPL, this project will pave the way for transformative advancements in the utilization of blockchain technology within the public sector.” Ripple previously introduced its end-to-end XRPL-driven CBDC solution, which would enable central banks, financial service providers, and governments to establish their own digital currencies while also assisting them in resolving issues with CBDC deployments. The Colombian government said in August 2022 that it was looking into introducing a CBDC to facilitate transactions and decrease tax evasion, and that it also planned to prohibit cash transactions for quantities more than 10 million Colombian pesos (about $2,390).

What The Latest Collaboration Means For XRP Price Meanwhile, XRP is back in the red despite briefly rising above $0.55 earlier, adding more than $2 billion to its market capitalization in a 24-hour span, and the publication of the contentious papers pertinent to the Ripple lawsuit. At the time of writing, and after news of the Ripple-Colombia central bank partnership broke out, the price of the XRP token looked it could use more energy to extricate itself out of negative territory. According to the most recent data provided by cryptocurrency market tracker CoinMarketCap, XRP was down by almost a percent in the twenty-four hour time frame, down 8.56 percent in the last seven days, and threatening the 18 percent gain over the past month. XRP is currently trading at $0.47. XRP market cap currently at $24.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com There are a number of possible explanations for the recent drop in the price of XRP following the announcement of the partnership between Ripple and the central bank of Colombia. XRP price all in red. Source: CoinMarketCap First, investors may not put much stock in the relationship because of the regulatory concerns that typically accompany partnerships between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial institutions. The trend of XRP’s price could be affected by selling pressure due to this uncertainty. The general state of the market and the attitude of investors could also be factors in the drop of cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Sheds 19% As Bearish Sentiment Looms Large XRP Price Trajectory: Factors To Consider The price of XRP may fall regardless of specific news or collaborations if there is a lack of confidence in the crypto sector or a general slowdown in the broader economy. Investor emotion, market conditions, and regulatory considerations all play a role in how much of an effect the Ripple-Colombia central bank agreement has on XRP’s price. At the same time, the dispute between the SEC and Ripple is a major factor influencing the value of XRP. Although the release of the Hinman documents first boosted XRP since they appeared to support Ripple’s case, the altcoin’s price eventually fell as investors’ confusion and worry overcame their initial joy.

Bitcoin regained the $25,500 level to erase declines of the past two days, when it fell to as low as $24,860. The move provided some respite to major tokens such as Polygon Network’s MATIC and Cardano’s ADA, which eased some losses from a two-day slide. Dogecoin (DOGE) led gains among major tokens with a 4% move in the past 24 hours; litecoin added (LTC) added 3.3%.  On Thursday, CoinDesk reported that BlackRock planned to offer a Bitcoin ETF with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) serving as custodian. This was confirmed later after a filing showed the company’s iShares fund management unit filed paperwork for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF.  “An estimated 20% of Americans have now owned bitcoin at some point. BlackRock’s proposed ETF potentially offers the other 80% an option that is altogether more familiar and accessible,” said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, in an email to CoinDesk. “BlackRock’s increasing engagement shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world’s largest financial institutions.”  As such, the market strength of bitcoin impacted shorts – or bets against the currency – the asset with BTC-tracked futures seeing over $16 million in short liquidations in the past 24 hours. This figure was smaller than usual due to large declines in the past week, causing some traders to risk less capital than they normally would.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously rejected other attempts by fund managers at listing a spot bitcoin ETF, including those from Grayscale, VanEck, and WisdomTree.

Prometheum's co-CEO Aaron Kaplan was recently invited to testify before Congress, a rare occurrence for an executive from a relatively obscure company in a nascent industry. During the session, Kaplan voiced his support for the SEC's existing regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, while casting criticism on a significant portion of the industry. His statements have sparked intense discussions within the industry, and have elicited skepticism from some quarters. Possible Inconsistencies: Prometheum's Relationship with the SEC Adding to the intrigue surrounding Prometheum's operations is a revelation that the company paid over $1.5 million in sales commissions to a Chinese-affiliated entity, which carries a less-than-stellar regulatory track record. This has raised concerns within the Blockchain Association, leading it to further investigate the company's regulatory dealings. The criticisms are mainly centered on the fact that, despite being approved as a SPBD, Prometheum faces a considerable challenge in terms of regulatory compliance, and, for its end, the capacity to do so. The company's trading platform will not be able to facilitate the trading of any tokens until the projects behind those tokens have registered with the SEC. As it stands, there is no clear pathway for such registration under the existing SEC regime. This highlights a glaring contradiction in Prometheum's claims of offering a regulatory compliant platform for digital asset securities.The skepticism is well-founded, with several red flags raising questions about Prometheum's operations. The company reportedly paid in excess of $1.5 million in sales commissions to a Chinese-affiliated entity, which carries a dubious regulatory record. Such practices would typically invite scrutiny, but they appear to have been overlooked in Prometheum's case. These findings are the result of diligent work by the Blockchain Association, which continues to investigate the company's actions and interactions with the SEC. Further, Prometheum's claims of being a compliant path were brought into question during Kaplan's congressional hearing and an interview with journalist Laura Shin. It was suggested that Kaplan misinterpreted the legalities surrounding the crypto industry, thereby misrepresenting his company's position. This was reflected in the words of Representative Mike Flood, who dismissed Prometheum's assertions as unfounded. Regulatory Concessions Despite its status as a SPBD, Prometheum's Alternative Trading System (ATS) faces a considerable regulatory hurdle. The platform will be unable to trade any tokens until those tokens' creators have first registered with the SEC. This presents a roadblock, given the lack of a clear path to registration under the current SEC regime—a reality at odds with Prometheum's proclamations of offering a regulated platform for digital asset securities. Prometheum's unusual trajectory underscores the broader struggle within the crypto industry to navigate the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment. It highlights the critical need for greater transparency and a well-defined regulatory framework that can keep pace with innovation in the digital asset space. Prometheum has been under scrutiny since its co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, testified before Congress and made statements supporting the SEC's regulatory approach towards crypto exchanges, while criticizing much of the crypto industry. Prometheum claims to be a broker-dealer approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as an alternative trading system. Current Tensions In U.S. Crypto Regulation Prometheum's position comes at a time when the crypto industry has been expressing concerns over what they perceive to be an antagonistic regulatory environment in the U.S., especially in the wake of recent lawsuits filed by the SEC against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Prometheum plans to list regulated cryptocurrencies. However, this has been met with criticism. Rodrigo Seira, special counsel at Paradigm, pointed out that the SEC's stance is that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities, and therefore cannot be traded even on regulated exchanges. In response to a question during the congressional hearing from Congressman Mike Flood about whether Prometheum lists bitcoin or ether, Kaplan confirmed that the platform does not list either of these. Kaplan's statement seems to contradict the idea that no additional legislation is needed, as argued by Flood. Prometheum had previously announced plans to support digital asset securities, including Flow, Filecoin, The Graph, Compound, and Celo. The company has yet to provide a public disclosure on the matter. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(FDIC), the U.S. banking regulator ordered late Thursday, complaining the company is making false claims.  The FDIC has demanded OKCoin USA Inc., the San Francisco-based sister exchange to OKX, remove any offending claims from its site immediately or face a possible enforcement action for violating U.S. banking law, the FDIC said in its letter to CEO Hong Fang. It’s the latest of several such warnings to crypto firms from the banking watchdog.  “OKCoin is not FDIC-insured and the FDIC does not insure non-deposit products,” the agency said in its cease-and-desist demand. “By not distinguishing between U.S.-dollar deposits and crypto assets, the statements imply FDIC insurance coverage applies to all customer funds (including crypto assets).”  The agency cited three examples of “false and misleading representations,” including a mention on its website that the Provenance Blockchain’s HASH token on OKCoin had “received broad regulatory acceptance from the SEC, OCC, FED, and the FDIC” and a 2020 posting to the company’s website, where it advertised itself as “Licensed across the US with FDIC insurance on OKCoin accounts.” It also cited a company official’s Twitter post that “if you are in the US we offer FDIC insurance on USD deposits.”  The regulator previously sent similar orders to now-bankrupt Voyager Digital and to FTX.US, after then-President Brett Harrison suggested in a tweet that the company was covered by the regulator. The FDIC had also issued a broader warning to the crypto sector, saying FDIC protections focus only on banks, not crypto firms that have FDIC-insured bank accounts.  ""A core principle at OKCoin is to respect applicable laws and regulations, and we remain committed to collaborating with stakeholders including regulators whenever possible,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""OKCoin is aware of this matter and is taking immediate action to assess the statements flagged by the FDIC and address them as necessary.""

42420239,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCXl,1686880626,U.S. Court Will Rule on Terraform Labs' Push to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit Within a Month,"The question of what exactly an ""investment contract"" is and whether that phrase applies to TerraUSD (UST) became the heart of the Thursday night hearing on Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  ""The SEC only wants one word to have any meaning. They want to delete the word 'contract,'"" argued Douglas Henkin, an attorney with the Dentons law firm representing Terraform.  Part of the defense's core argument pushed the idea that UST did not have a contract and was designed for practical uses, rather than as an investment – echoing similar arguments numerous other token issuers have made in arguing that their respective crypto assets are not securities.  Ahead of Thursday's hearing, which was originally scheduled for 2:00 p.m. ET but later moved to 7:00 p.m. ET, Terraform's legal team filed some additional documents, including a transcript from the hearing held Tuesday to discuss the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Binance.US.  Even though some people may have staked UST in the Anchor protocol in the hopes of a return, the token itself should not be considered a security because of the possible other uses, the defense argued.  ""By design ... it's pegged one to one to the dollar, it's designed not to fluctuate,"" Henkin said. ""That's for commerce ... that's a consumptive use.""  The analysis of whether something is an investment contract allows for possible consumptive uses, said SEC Devon Staren.  The expectations by investors and the economic realities around the UST token are what led to the SEC's assertion that there were securities violations, she said.  ""We don't agree that there needs to be a formal contract,"" she said.  The SEC sued Terraform Labs earlier this year, alleging it and founder Do Kwon mislead investors in the TerraUSD project, and alleging that Terraform's Anchor Protocol and LUNA token were securities.  In April, Terraform moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the SEC hasn't asserted jurisdiction over either the company or Kwon and making disputes tied to the Administrative Procedures Act and the major questions doctrine.  Senior Judge Jed Rakoff, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, questioned whether there was a major questions issue, saying Congress intended to give the SEC broad regulatory authority when drafting the laws overseeing the agency.  Henkin likened UST to bitcoin, saying that unlike other assets which are managed by a centralized party, UST is controlled by a decentralized group through the LUNA token.  ""It's true that the original algorithm was coded by TFL, but then it was turned over to the community,"" Henkin said.  Henkin and the judge went back and forth on various orange grove comparisons, using the Supreme Court case at the heart of the Howey Test to look for hypothetical similarities to UST and how it is currently or may be used.  The Terraform attorney also pointed at multiple points to the Supreme Court's recent West Virginia vs. Environmental Protection Agency decision, which said Congress must authorize any major actions from the EPA (and other federal agencies) if they're far afield from what's seen as the agency's traditional remit.  But Staren said the decision only ""prevents agencies from promulgating extraordinary new rules,"" saying the SEC is only enforcing existing law.  Near the end of the hearing, the SEC emphasized that it's not necessarily the tokens themselves, but the broader ecosystems they're part of that supported its analysis.  Referring to Mirror Protocol assets, the SEC's Staren said that the regulator isn't alleging the assets themselves are securities-based swaps, but the transactions they're involved in are. She broadened that sentiment during her closing remarks.  ""These crypto assets alone are not investment contracts,"" Staren said. ""LUNA alone is just a piece of code.""  Judge Rakoff said he would publish a ruling on the motion to dismiss on or before July 14.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin spurts but then stabilizes. Other cryptos reverse some Wednesday losses.  Insights: Hong Kong's banks may not yet be ready to help turn the City into a crypto hub.

But the rally, which regained ground lost the previous day, fizzled out well short of the $26,000 threshold BTC lost nearly a week ago. The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at $25,556, up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin swooned late Wednesday amid ongoing worries about U.S. central bank monetary policy overreach and growing U.S. crypto regulatory scrutiny.  Read More: BlackRock's iShares Files Paperwork for Spot Bitcoin ETF  Ether spiked similarly to trade above $1,660, a 0.8% gain from Wednesday same time. Other major cryptos went from the negative territory they'd occupied for much of Thursday to green with SOL, the token of the Solana smart contracts platform Solana, recently up 1.8%, and SAND and AXS also rising more than a percentage point. MATIC, the native crypto of the Polygon blockchain, was down more than 4%. These assets were among 19 mentioned in U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) lawsuits that accused exchanges Binance and Coinbase of violating securities laws.  In an email to CoinDesk, Brian D. Evans, the CEO of Web3 venture studio and advisory firm BDE Ventures, noted the investor angst about the increasingly unfavorable U.S. crypto climate.  “I feel like we’re at the beginning of a big shift involving project founders seeking locations to base themselves outside the United States,"" Evans wrote. ""In this sense, the market feels very dislocated. In the United States, they’re left scratching their heads over the intricacies of a regulatory system that hasn’t been updated since the Great Depression.""  Evans wrote that this failing has sent projects ""searching out better-regulated jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, Dubai and the U.K.""  Read More: SEC’s Binance, Coinbase Suits Create Uncertain Future for Listed Tokens: Legal Experts  He added: ""A global reshuffling is taking place that is shaping up to center the next burst of innovation and market exuberance in Asia and the Middle East. In that sense, then, I think the digital asset ecosystem is actually becoming more robust, making the likely fireworks following the next Bitcoin halving all the more surprising to a large number of observers. In short, the bullishness is there, yes, but it’s increasingly being driven by events happening abroad.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +4.5% Entertainment Shiba Inu SHIB +2.6% Currency Cosmos ATOM +1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC −5.3% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT −4.6% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −3.9% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Hong Kong as Crypto Hub? The Banks May Not Be Ready  Take their money!  That’s the message that Hong Kong’s financial regulator is telling some of the City’s banks who refuse to onboard crypto clients.  ""The HKMA has consistently communicated the importance of banks following the risk-based approach to managing the risks of individual customers,"" a Hong Kong Monetary Authority spokesperson told CoinDesk earlier.  It’s not the first time we’ve heard of crypto companies having trouble banking in Hong Kong.  A few months ago, news broke that the Hong Kong branches (which are largely autonomous and operate by local rules) of some of China’s state-owned banks were soliciting crypto business in the City.  There was just one problem. While they might talk a big game about being ready to embrace crypto – unthinkable years ago – potential clients found it nearly impossible to get on-board.  ""The city’s digital assets regulation is overall friendly and encourages banks to work with crypto companies, however, banks still currently have stringent requirements in place, which makes it difficult for crypto businesses to expand and grow,” Adrian Wang, founder, and CEO of Metalpha, a Hong Kong-based digital assets wealth management company, said to CoinDesk at the time. “We have yet to see major progress in the banking sector to embrace crypto. Hopefully, that will change soon.”  At one time, Hong Kong had the unfortunate reputation of being a money laundering center for organized crime. HSBC paid out record fines for their behavior. It’s a much more conservative, risk-managing organization as a result. Billions in penalties will do that to a company.  Almost understandably, banks don’t want to get involved with crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC, which seem to have given themselves a supranational mandate, have accused Binance of co-mingling $12 billion in funds and violating securities laws. The same goes for Coinbase.  Banks would really not want these as a client.  Binance and Coinbase are the big fish and were attacked first, but who knows what exchange could be next. Even if a bank in Hong Kong doesn’t do business in the U.S., it can still be caught up in the regulatory dragnet – if U.S. authorities go after an exchange that’s otherwise legal in Hong Kong – by virtue of it offering USD products.  Of course, one should always remain optimistic, but Hong Kong looks like it has a long way to go before it can be considered a crypto hub.
