42379727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYln,1502316352,Goldman Sachs: 'Real Dollars At Work' in Cryptocurrency Markets,"Goldman Sachs has published a question-and-answer report focused on cryptocurrencies in which it suggests that clients should be keeping a closer eye on the market.  According to ZeroHedge, which first published details of the Q&A, the bullish remark came in conjunction with what constitutes a broad look at the market, including questions that cover ethereum, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the ways in which cryptocurrencies can be traded in the US.  Perhaps most notably, the Q&A's authors – which included Goldman staffers Robert Boroujerdi and Jessica Binder Graham, according to Bloomberg – make the argument that clients ought to be watchful of future developments, even if they aren't committed to actually making any investments.  The authors wrote:  ""Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are), real dollars are at work here and warrant watching.""  The release notably follows a series of bitcoin market analyses sent to Goldman Sachs clients in the past several months.  Near the end of July, Goldman Sachs chief technician Sheba Jafari predicted that the price of bitcoin would expand to a new high above $3,600. Yesterday, the price of bitcoin crossed the $3,500 mark for the first time.

42379724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYjH,1502309122,Bring on the Forks: Bitcoin Traders See Improving Price Outlook for 2017,"There are two bitcoins now?  It's safe to say uncertainty cast a pall over the cryptocurrency markets last week when on August 1, a group of developers and miners split the blockchain and created a new cryptocurrency.  It was the first (high-profile) bitcoin fork to date, and in response, the price very well could have entered a period of unprecedented churn. With bitcoin and bitcoin cash competing, it wasn't hard to foresee this creating market dislocations and downward pressure on price.  What happened, however, was the opposite, as in the last few days markets have surged past all-time highs. In fact, analysts have indicated a major upswell in confidence and a broad consensus that the upward march of bitcoin's price could continue.  Brad Chun, CEO of blockchain startup Mooti Digital Identity, went so far as to argue that institutional money is likely to pour into bitcoin as a result.  Chun told CoinDesk:  ""For early tech adopters who can't fathom a market cap of over $50 billion or $100 billion for bitcoin, they haven't seen anything yet. While we might see profit taking short-term, I view any dips as buying opportunities.""  Chun, who plans to hold bitcoin through the remainder of 2017, has a $5,000 end-of-year price target on bitcoin, a price figure that includes bitcoin cash and any other potential ""fork currencies"" created as a result of disagreements over the network's future.  Kevin Zhou, of the cryptocurrency fund Galois Capital, is also bullish on the price of bitcoin, particularly after Segregated Witness locked in on the main bitcoin blockchain yesterday and the split went by without incident.  Zhou said bitcoin could see price gains of 200 to 300 percent year-over-year, for the next two years. And added that $3,000 to $4,500 ""seems reasonable"" as a price target for the year, though he hedges a bit on that range.  Harry Yeh, managing partner at Binary Financial, is more categorical now that the hard fork has passed.  ""Expect a big move past $3,500 – possibly this week,"" he told CoinDesk. Yeh believes $4,000 ""is on the horizon"" for bitcoin by the end of the year.  'Fork Mania'  But perhaps the most prevailing view in the wake of the bitcoin cash fork is that a major headwind has just come off the table.  The argument goes like this: bitcoin survived a fork without a major technical or price catastrophe. As a consequence, the market has stabilized, clearing the way for higher prices in the future.  Yeh explained:  ""Traders trade based on technical and fundamental analysis. With the hard fork issue gone and the technicals being very bullish again, long term there is definitely a lot more confidence amongst traders.""  Once again, confidence has risen because the downside risks weren't realized.  Tellingly, and in keeping with this thesis, Yeh points out that this is only the case until ""the next"" fork arises to darken markets.  Here, Zhou's comments reflect how forks can be both positive and negative factors in the market. While forks can create uncertainty and risk, he noted forks also have an upside – the ability to spawn new assets.  ""I also think after the success of bitcoin cash forking off bitcion, we might see a lot of other forks happening. 2014 was altcoin mania; 2015-2016 was blockchain mania; 2017 is ICO mania; maybe 2018 will be fork mania,"" he said.  When up signals down  Elsewhere, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at Whaleclub, struck a more nuanced note on price direction and short-term price targets.  ""2017 has been a stellar year for bitcoin. Barring a black swan event (this is a big assumption in the industry), I think the bull run will continue through the end of the year since it's the predominant trend,"" he remarked.  While Zivkovski has admitted that the price could see a short-term pullback, he said he is watching out for whether the $3,000 price will hold. If it does, he said $4,000 might not be far off.  Interestingly, Zivkovski struck a novel note that none of the other analysts picked up on: The possibility that soaring bitcoin prices could cause a negative feedback loop for the price of bitcoin.  In a nutshell, his thesis is that the ""incredible price rise"" in bitcoin is attracting the attention of both governments and regulators on a global basis. As a consequence, ""a wider crackdown on bitcoin exchanges,"" he said, could mitigate price gains.  In other words, bitcoin could become a victim of its own success.

42379730,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYn3,1502305215,Bitstamp Will Add Ether Trading to Cryptocurrency Exchange,"European cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp will launch new trading pairs for ether next week.  Beginning on August 17, Bitstamp will add markets denominated in US dollars, euros and bitcoin for the ethereum-based digital currency. As part of the release, Bitstamp also revealed a new pricing structure for its markets, which unifies the fees it assesses among the exchange's trading pairs.  In an effort to promote the new markets, Bitstamp will waive trading fees for those pairs until October 1. It will continue to offer discounts through the end of the year.  Bitstamp is one of the last major cryptocurrency exchanges to list ether. In statements, the exchange indicated that it will add support for additional assets, framing the unified fee structure release as part of that process.  Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world's oldest bitcoin exchanges. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitstamp operates the third most voluminous exchange in US dollar terms, reporting about $43 million in trades over the past 24 hours.  The addition of ether comes amid new developments in that digital asset's market. As CoinDesk reported yesterday, ether prices crossed the $300 line for the first time in a month.  Ether markets have subsided somewhat since then, trading at roughly $294 at press time.

42379719,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYgl,1502298333,Cryptocurrency Investment Fund Completes $1.8 Million ICO,"A digital asset investment project has netted close to $1.8 million through an initial coin offering (ICO).  The Digital Developer Fund closed its ICO this morning, raising 6,429 ETH – worth roughly $1.85 million at current prices – over a month-long period. The company behind it, based in the Cayman Islands, had previously invested in domain names through a venture dating back to 2010.  The effort is one of the latest to use cryptographic tokens to represent shares in an investment firm. According to materials published on the Digital Developers Fund website, token-bearers will receive quarterly dividends distributed through an ethereum smart contract. Any net profits generated through the fund will also be issued to token-holders.  As is the case with many ICOs, the sale was blocked to prospective buyers from the US. Other recent examples of this strategy include district0x, a blockchain-based marketplace project that raised $9 million through an ICO at the start of the month.  Token sales have accelerated in recent months, as shown by data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker. Nearly $1.7 billion has been raised to date through the model, with more than $500 million during July alone.  That month also saw a major release from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the topic. The agency published its findings from an investigation into The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that sold $150 million worth of tokens at the-current prices, only to later collapse following a debilitating code exploit.  The SEC said that DAO tokens constitute a kind of security, and that other tokens may fall under this definition.

42379742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYvr,1502294467,Full Steam Ahead? Segwit2x Reaffirms Bitcoin Hard Fork Plan,"The technical team behind the bitcoin scaling proposal Segwit2x is doubling down on its controversial plan to introduce code that would seek to hard fork the network in three months time.  Now that Segregated Witness has locked-in on the bitcoin blockchain, and ""step one"" of the group's proposed roadmap is complete, Bitcoinj developer Jean-Pierre Rupp has filed an in-progress announcement that would recommit the group to increasing the block size parameter to 2 MB.  While the official statement is still being reviewed by the open-source group, it has achieved ""general approval"" from Segwit2x members, according to Bloq founder and Segwit2x developer Jeff Garzik.  As such, the confirmation is emerging as one of the first signs that bitcoin could be headed for more turbulent times ahead.  Since many bitcoin users don't support the change (at least not so quickly), the fork could lead to another split of the bitcoin network and the creation of another bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin cash, which split from the bitcoin blockchain last week, has already attracted criticisms for creating brand confusion, though its price (currently $318) has held steadier than some expected.  Also still backing the move are bitcoin's miners. According to the GitHub announcement, miners making up 90% of bitcoin's computational capacity plan to dedicate hash power to the new, hard-forked blockchain starting in November.  And though many in the community remain skeptical about Segwit2x's timeline for a 2 MB hard fork, the confirmation of a coming announcement should also put to rest speculation that the creation of bitcoin cash, and its struggles to so far attract users to a chain with more capacity, would have quashed the idea the change is needed.  Software shuffle  Also notable is that the post highlights the Segwit2x group's outlook toward its software use, as well as how scaling debates are playing out in their development.  For example, the announcement notes that Segwit2x is not compatible with Bitcoin Core, the network's most widely used software implementation. Further, it seems Bitcoin Core isn't interested in its software being compatible with Segwit2x's tech.  On Monday, developer Matt Corallo filed a pull request to further separate Segwit2x and Bitcoin Core nodes, a move that could hint the groups are preparing for a formal separation that would find them continuing on separate blockchains.

42379723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYi1,1502285418,Litecoin Prices Hold Steady Near $50 as Bitcoin Locks In SegWit,"The price of litecoin continues to hover near all-time highs, even as the technical advances that sparked its revival are being added to other platforms.  Just a day after miners on the bitcoin protocol effectively agreed to upgrade their software to support a code change called Segregated Witness (SegWit), litecoin is trading at roughly $48, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The relative stability is notable given litecoin's price boomed on the news it would adopt the change, one originally designed to redefine and increase capacity on bitcoin.  Since litecoin's miners reached an agreement to make the upgrade on April 11, the price of the cryptocurrency has increased more than 300%, rising from $11 at the time to $48 now. That price is just shy of its all-time high of $53 observed in July.  The cryptocurrency's year-over-year gain is more impressive at over 1,000%. Litecoin was trading at just $3.79 on August 8, 2016 – a time when the protocol was struggling to determine its roadmap amidst an increasing array of competitors.

Bitcoin Exchange Could Issue Tokens in Bid to Relaunch,"Bitcoin exchange BTC-e will return under a new name and issue a token in order to refund users, according to a forum account tied to the platform.  The comments come after BTC-e, one of the longest-running and arguably most secretive of the world's cryptocurrency exchanges, was shuttered by U.S. authorities late last month. After arresting one of the exchange's alleged operators, officials handed down more than $100 million in fines and seized BTC-e's web domain.  However, the exchange's remaining staff, communicating through a long-held account on the Bitcoin Talk forum, have pledged to return despite the crackdown, later claiming that it was able to secure access to at least some of its funds.  In the latest statements, BTC-e said it ""managed to gain control of 55% of the funds"", with the remainder having been confiscated.  The anonymous spokesperson said the platform is working with an unnamed group of investors to revive the site, adding that the BTC-e brand would be abandoned ""due to unresolved issues from the Office of Financial Crimes of the US Treasury."" The exchange said the rebranding process would begin at the end of August, and promised future statements on the detail of the plan.  BTC-e also aired the intention to issue a new token, dubbed ""BTE,"" in an effort to return funds to users. Customers would be refunded as the exchange buys back those tokens from the market – echoing how Bitfinex repaid its users following a $60 million hack last summer.  The exchange's staff explained (in a translated statement):  ""All liabilities for fiat (USD, EUR, RUR) will be transferred to BTE tokens (1 BTE is 1 USD) at the exchange rate on the date of conversion. Probably, for more operative closing of promissory notes, ICO will be held on BTE tokens.

Holders of BTE would later be credited through seven different cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, litecoin, namecoin, novacoin, peercoin, ether and dash – ""and write off the amount of 45% in BTE"", according to the post.  To receive their tokens, users will have to verify their identities, the exchange detailed, citing investor requirements.

42379737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYyN,1502265611,Safello Aims for Comeback with New Bitcoin Buying Option,"Launching in 2013, Safello didn't mince words – the startup boldly declared its aspiration to become the ""Coinbase of Europe.""  But while it initially grabbed headlines, the Stockholm-based company has fallen off the radar in recent years. As major regional startups like Cryex and KnCMiner succumbed to operational issues, Safello simply wasn't able to gain the traction with regional VCs it needed to compete.  According to Frank Schuil, Safello's CEO, the slump had a lot to do with the company's mission – at the time, many were skeptical of cryptocurrency's viability.  ""What we tried to do initially was quite ambitious in creating a banking services platform. Unfortunately, that was maybe too early and too ambitious, so what we did in 2016 was go back to our roots,"" Schuil said.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Back then, it was almost impossible to get any payment service provider, financial institution or bank to work with us.""  But attitudes about cryptocurrency have gradually changed, and Safello is again working toward its goals.  Announced today, Safello has closed a partnership that enables customers to purchase bitcoin with Mastercard and Visa credit cards. The service was tested with British pounds in a trial, but now supports euros, Norwegian krone, Danish krone, Czech koruna, Swiss franc and Hungarian forint.  Change of fortune  In interview, Schuil sought to portray Safello as a startup in the midst of a revival along with the wider industry. So far in 2017, the value of bitcoin has increased over 250%, and the value of the wider cryptocurrency asset class has grown from $10 billion to over $120 billion today.  In the interest of capturing this momentum, Safello has also launched a new front end and reworked much of its back end, aiming to improve its exchange and wallet services.  Further, Schuil suggested that, despite past problems, he's now optimistic that the startup will be able to find and identify partners that can help it grow.  ""We were finally able to close a partnership with a party that helped us get credit card payments with 3D Secure, which we needed from a fraud [prevention] point of view, at a rate that was reasonable,"" he said.  Going forward, the exchange is working to build out other payment methods and hopes to soon relaunch ICBIT – a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency futures exchange it acquired in October, under the Safello name.  Returning to Norway  In what was perhaps a more symbolic move, the company is also re-entering Norway, a market in which it had previously had trouble gaining traction.  Given its presence in Europe, Safello initially tried to extend services to the market, but Norway had ruled that bitcoin was subject to VAT, a consumption tax that put immense burdens on companies transacting in the digital currency.  But earlier this year, Norway lifted the VAT rule, taking cues from a 2015 ruling from the European Court of Justice that states bitcoin wasn’t subject to VAT in the EU – and Safello was ready to capitalize.  ""We already had all of the pipelines required to enter quickly,"" Schuil said.  With this return, Safello is now active across all of Europe (except Iceland where regulations are in place restricting cryptocurrency exchanges).  While Schuil declined to disclose user numbers or transaction data, he said the exchange now has ""tens of thousands of customers"" – an number he indicated he plans to do his best to increase.

42379720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYfV,1502251236,Fidelity Brings Bitcoin Tracking to Traditional Investor Portfolios,"Fidelity users can now track their bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments alongside more traditional assets.  Announced today, the company's R&D and innovation unit, Fidelity Labs, is formally partnering with cryptocurrency startup Coinbase to make the feature available. Fidelity customers must already have a Coinbase account to take advantage of the service, which will be rolled out to users starting tomorrow.  The move effectively formalizes work Fidelity CEO Abby Johnson first teased months ago at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference.  As such, Fidelity's Hadley Stern, a senior vice president and managing director, built on the narrative put forth by Johnson in her speech, framing the move as part of the company's inquisitive outlook on the new tech.  Stern told CoinDesk:  ""We've made bitcoin available for use in our cafeteria. We've enabled people to donate bitcoin to their Fidelity Charitable Donor Advised Fund. The partnership with Coinbase is another point along that path of bitcoin development.""  He continued: ""With each of these different experiments we're learning along the way.""  Cautious inroads  The announcement comes at a time when large, traditional financial services firms are beginning to take small steps to engage with the cryptocurrency ecosystem, spurred by the rapid increase in value of the nascent asset class.  Last month, for example, American Express partnered with portfolio firm Abra, effectively allowing cardholders to purchase bitcoin for the first time on the peer-to-peer payments app.  In a sense, Fidelity has upped the ante by allowing investment customers to view their entire integrated portfolio of assets, cryptocurrencies included, on a single platform. At this point, however, the functionality is read-only – meaning clients aren't able to execute trades on the Fidelity platform.  However, it could be read as the first step toward potentially expanded services.  Hadley hinted at this possible interpretation, though he stopped short of saying so, framing the announcement as part of Fidelity's ""continuing commitment"" to developing products and services using new technology.

42379747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KZ29,1502243404,Ether Tops $300 as Price Rises to 30-Day High,"The price of ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, hit a high above $300 today, rising to a press-time total of just over $307.  With the move, the price climbed to its highest total since June 30, according to data from Coinmarketcap, a time when it was descending from all-time highs set in early June amid a wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs) on the platform.  Still, ether appears to be bucking its recent downtrend, rising more than 35% over the last week, up from the $227 total observed at the start of trading on August 2.  The price increase further comes at a time when the price of bitcoin is at or near all-time highs. Bitcoin set a new record earlier today, climbing above $3,500 for the first time in history.  At press time, the appreciation of both assets appears to pushing overall investment in cryptocurrencies higher, with the total value of all publicly traded cryptographic assets reaching an all-time high just above $124 billion.
