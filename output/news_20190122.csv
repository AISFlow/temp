42402470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvve,1548196225,50 Cut as $60 Million Blockchain Project Nebulas Lays Off 60% of Staff,"The company behind the Nebulas blockchain project has gone from a team of 80 people to just 30, CoinDesk has learned.  After gaining attention in August for its decision to delay its token distribution, including holding onto founder tokens for a period of 10 years, the company has undergone a series of layoffs that have seen peripheral elements of its roadmap shelved, at least pending a recovery in the market for Nebulas' NAS token.  ""One of the reasons was the market price kept going down,"" Becky Lu, a spokesperson for the company, told CoinDesk.  NAS, meant to power a protocol that is itself seeking to measure and score other blockchains, debuted at $2, but is currently selling for a little more than a quarter of that price now, according to CoinMarketCap. Once a top-100 cryptocurrency, the market cap of the NAS token is currently $25.7 million.  Lu said the layoffs at the company began last summer, impacting its largely Beijing-based team.  The company, she said, also wanted to tighten its strategic focus:  ""Another reason we decided to cut off the unimportant projects like third-party wallets [was that they are] not core to the main tech visions mentioned in the [Nebulas] white paper. So the dev team of that project was first impacted.""  The news is the latest that hints at the extent to which a downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market is hurting companies in the blockchain industry – following layoffs at ConsenSys, Bitmain, ShapeShift and BlockEx. That said, the cutbacks at Nebulas, with more than 60 percent of staff being shown the door, have been some of the most dramatic reported yet.  Two years' runway  Lu would not say whether treasury management had been an issue, though it's notable the cuts came just seven months after the team raised $60 million in its token sale.  Nebulas has continued to make progress despite setbacks, issuing various incentive programs for community members and developers.  At the end of 2018, the company launched its NOVA testnet, which measures the quality of data on blockchains. More detail can be seen in CEO Hitters Xu's 2018 year in review post on Medium.  Lu now estimates the team to have enough runaway for two years, suggesting the project will have time to make additional progress on its roadmap. She concluded:  ""Now that the team has accomplished most of the tech development, the main job for this year is to build up the community government and consensus to achieve full decentralization.""

42402466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJvri,1548194706,Bakkt Makes Initial Hiring Push for Bitcoin Futures Exchange,"Ahead of its hotly anticipated launch, bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt has launched a hiring campaign. Eight new job posting were published Tuesday on the company's website.  Bakkt is looking for several experienced software developers, including mobile and blockchain developers; an institutional sales manager with experience in North America or Asia; and three higher-level positions including a director of finance, director of security engineering and director for blockchain engineering.  An institutional-grade regulated exchange for crypto derivatives founded by the Intercontinental Exchange (the New York Stock Exchange's parent company), Bakkt was expected to go live on December 12 last year, but the launch was postponed twice.  It was initially delayed to until January 24, with the company citing a need for ""additional time for customer and clearing member onboarding."" It is now delayed indefinitely while the exchange waits for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to grant an exemption for Bakkt’s plan to custody bitcoin on behalf of its clients.  The ongoing government shutdown has contributed to the delay. The CFTC needs at least 30 days for a public comment period, plus however much time may be needed to review the comments and make a decision once this period concludes. It is unclear when this comment period may begin.  However, Bakkt's team hasn't been sitting idly by waiting for the green light: it closed a $182.5-million funding round and acquired ""certain assets"" belonging to Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG), an independent futures commission merchant, earlier this month.  The deal, involving RCG's staff and technology, was supposed to help Bakkt improve its risk management, anti-money-laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and treasury operations, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler said in announcing the acquisition.  Her most prominent hire to date has been Adam White, one of the longest-serving employees at industry unicorn Coinbase, who joined Bakkt as chief operating officer last year.

42402482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJw8R,1548186017,What We Learned in 100 Crypto Talks With Institutional Investors,"Jeff Dorman, partner at crypto asset management firm Arca Funds, spent 18 years on Wall Street and in fintech before turning his focus to developing crypto asset strategies and products.  This article originally appeared in 'Institutional Crypto,' a weekly CoinDesk newsletter focused on the nexus of Wall Street and crypto assets. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.    ------------------    Through meetings with over 100 institutional investors over the past four months from California to New York, one thing has stood out most − an overwhelmingly positive response.  These endowments, family offices, pensions and other institutions are enthusiastic about crypto assets despite an overall pullback in crypto valuations upwards of 75 percent from their all-time highs.  This is remarkable.  Though the majority of these investors want to dip their toes in the crypto pool, they come from varying backgrounds and have different levels of knowledge:  Those just beginning their crypto educational journey  Those that didn’t have a “crypto specific mandate,” but are evaluating crypto managers in the same way they evaluate all emerging fund managers  Those that are well versed in crypto, and considering an immediate allocation.  Not surprisingly, each category of investors had different questions and goals.  The 'Beginning' Investors  Learning a new industry can be daunting.  The typical learning curve looks something like this:  Phase I: The first time you hear about blockchain or crypto --> Skepticism  Phase II: You spend the next six months researching and learning --> Optimistic but confused  Phase III: You spend the next 12 months going deeper down the rabbit hole until you want to dedicate the next 20 years to this new technology --> Passion and full adoption  Most investors considering digital assets are somewhere between “Phase I” and “Phase II” and, even if they weren’t thinking of allocating, it was not uncommon to hear some variation of “crypto is hard to ignore right now.""  Two points resonate universally with this group:  You’re 100% long the financial system right now! Even if you moved to 100 percent cash across all of your investments, you are still 100 percent long the financial system (via the banking system). As we saw in the 2008 banking crisis, 2011 European sovereign crisis and the 2018 emerging market currency crisis, there is systemic risk out there that investors want to hedge against. Crypto offers investors exposure outside of the traditional financial system, and many argue it is actually more dangerous NOT to have some exposure to crypto than it is to have a small allocation.  Crypto is both an asset class and an infrastructure. As an asset class, there are opportunities today to participate in the growth of emerging technologies. The pie is growing even as prices collapse and, with enough research, you can figure out which slices of the pie to grab.As an infrastructure, you have time to wait. But you’ll want to familiarize yourself today because one day soon, every asset class you own may be represented in digital asset form (equities, fixed income, real estate, hard assets). Viewing the utility of cryptocurrencies through price alone misses the fundamental revolution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain have uses far beyond price.  What matters most is understanding how crypto assets can meet their goals and fit within their risk tolerances, as well as how it fits as a smaller piece of an overall balanced and diversified portfolio.  Understanding every nuance is secondary. For example, most investors who invest in healthcare equity funds don’t fully understand Medicare reimbursement, hospital admissions and patent processes. Instead, these investors know enough to recognize that they want exposure to healthcare, and then hire experts to express the individual views for them.  This is likely what will happen in crypto.  The 'Traditional Hedge Fund Due Diligence' Investors  Investors in this camp spend most of their time seeking out strategies that expose them to the potential upside while limiting downside risk:  This is what most often gets their attention:  Don’t focus on how high it can go; focus on how low it can go. A good fund manager in any asset class tries to capture most of the upside, while ensuring that downside risk is mitigated. This is an especially important message for investors to hear in crypto, since most of what they see and hear strictly focuses on outlandish return potential.  DO NOT short this market today. I’ve spent my entire career trying to isolate idiosyncratic risk and removing market risk through cap structure arbitrage trades and long-short trades, but this strategy does not yet work in crypto for a variety of reasons (asymmetric upside, low liquidity, high costs, etc). As such, the best hedge today is simply not to own a token that you don’t like. Currently, the best way to protect against the downside is by sizing positions correctly according to risk/return profiles, taking chips off the table when this equation is no longer favorable, and using derivatives to hedge tail risk.  A top-down AND bottom-up approach. Active management matters in crypto, perhaps more than in any other asset class, because of the large swings and bifurcations between top performers and underperformers. Understanding the macro landscape (top down) while simultaneously searching for value (bottom-up approach to security selection) is how to take advantage of current market conditions. Few investors want to hear about best ideas because they are not ready to execute them on their own − but they do want to understand the process.  Conversely, the biggest pushback from this group is that the underlying asset class itself is still so new, and it’s hard to invest in something that has unknown tangible value. But it’s important to remember that many asset management strategies can work on top of any underlying asset class. For example, there are managed futures funds that focus on very esoteric underlying assets (like weather futures).  Others in this group point to how some crypto assets are “frauds” or have market values in large excess compared to value. But this exists in traditional asset classes too.  There are hundreds of penny stocks that retain market cap value and trade, despite no underlying value. And there are plenty of “stub bonds” in the corporate bond and distressed market that have no value but remain priced and trading for decades.  As the overall size of legitimate crypto assets grows, these outlier, “worthless,” tokens will fade and become less impactful.  The 'Savvy Crypto' Investors  As you might expect, investors in this bucket are trying to figure out which managers they trust to generate high risk-adjusted returns in the crypto space. In addition to focusing on risk management like group 2 above, this group of investors often got much more granular with their questions about what specifically goes into a crypto portfolio.  The two messages that resonated the most were:  Developers are the new research analysts. Research has greatly evolved over the past decade, especially with the emergence of digital assets. The ability to read lines of code in GitHub, test pre-launch products and engage with various development communities is a must for any fund investing in this space.  What is 'fundamental research' in crypto? This is a smart question. Unlike traditional asset classes like equities and fixed income, there is no widely agreed upon Graham & Dodd Security Analysis in crypto. BUT, that doesn’t mean valuation frameworks aren’t in the works. There has been great work done like MV = PQ, NVT analysis and even variations of Metcalf’s Law. It’s right to question the fundamental value of these new technologies, but wrong to dismiss the lack of progress.  Looking ahead, this group is already excited about today’s crypto assets, but also focused on what is coming in the future. They want to align themselves with managers who are in a position to take advantage of today’s opportunities, while also being on the front-line when new opportunities arise.  Conclusion  This past year has opened my eyes to the progress that is being made on both the technology side and the education side. Whether investors have a specific mandate or not, most are trying very hard to figure out where crypto fits into their process and portfolio.  While it is true that many funds already have some secondary or tertiary exposure to crypto via their traditional hedge fund or VC investments, it’s becoming clear this alone is not satisfying their needs.  As stated earlier, “Crypto is pretty hard to ignore right now.” Unless investors want to completely write it off, they will have to figure out how to get involved.

Announced today, Marina Khaustova, former chief marketing officer and co-founder of Element Capital Group, has joined Bitfury as the CEO of Crystal Blockchain, the company's analytical tool for investigating public blockchain transactions. Meanwhile, Chris Dickson, previously at enterprise software vendor Panaya, joined Bitfury as head of software sales.  Both are newly created positions, underscoring the increasing importance of diversified software offerings to Bitfury, which started in 2012 as a bitcoin mining operation. It entered the enterprise blockchain software business in 2017 with the launch of Exonum, its blockchain infrastructure aimed at enterprise users. Also in 2017, Bitfury launched an app for payments on bitcoin's layer 2 lightning network.  Then last year, the company rolled out Crystal, a service that looks for signs of criminal activity on the blockchain for law enforcement, financial institutions and cybersecurity clients.  ""After a year of growing interest in the product, we are bringing Marina on board to help take it to the next level,” John Mercurio, Bitfury's chief communications officer, told CoinDesk.  At Element, an investment bank focused on tokenization and cryptocurrency capital markets, Khaustova developed the go-to-market strategy for U.S. blockchain companies and advised token sales. Earlier, she founded and led several digital advertising startups in Russia and the U.S., the last one being Los Angeles-based AdtoApp, according to her LinkedIn profile.  In a press release, Khaustova said that in her new role, she will ""build a compliant bridge between digital assets and the traditional financial system.""

The LSE Group announced Tuesday that its Millennium Exchange matching engine has been chosen to power AAX, a new exchange platform being launched by Hong Kong-based fintech firm ATOM Group.  AAX is scheduled to be launched in the first half of this year and will be the first crypto exchange to use the matching engine product, according to the LSE.  According to a separate statement from the ATOM Group on Tuesday, the LSE Group also provides tech solutions to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) and Singapore Exchange (SGX).  ATOM Group CEO Peter Lin said that Millennium Exchange will help AXA build a platform that ensures “safe, trusted and secure” trading for both retail and institutional investors. It will also enable AAX to provide a “scalable” and “compliant” crypto trading platform, the firm said.  For security solutions to protect the upcoming exchange, ATOM Group said it will partner with the U.S.-based cybersecurity firm Kroll.  Crypto trading platforms are increasingly looking to source their infrastructure from traditional stock exchange companies.  Last April, crypto exchange Gemini partnered with Nasdaq to use its SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to automatically detect any possible price manipulation or other illicit activities. Recently launched tokenized shares trading platform DX.Exchange also harnesses a matching engine product from Nasdaq.  Conversely, the LSE has been looking at blockchain tech for some time, although unlike some stock exchanges like the ASX, it has not moved to adopt the tech so far.

""We think we or one of our portfolio companies will be able to exploit that key recovery system. We think this system is going to be revolutionary, and as it is totally outside the scope of what tZERO is doing, we wanted to make sure that the technology finds the right home.""  Medici owns 80 percent of tZERO and treats the startup with special attention, hence its deployment of Hopkins to lead the platform.  ""Steve is a real doer, he gets this industry as well as anybody, he participated in so many deals,"" Johnson said. ""I’m really pleased for tZERO that he’s there to move the company forward.""  All of this is going on as Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne is trying to sell the company's flagship online retailing business to raise cash for Medici's investments. Overstock's share price lost nearly a third of its value last month, amid continued bloodletting in the crypto markets.  Johnson, however, said he remains optimistic about the future of Medici's portfolio companies. ""Blockchain has a great future that is separate from the future of cryptocurrencies,"" he said, concluding:  ""People were pessimistic about the internet when the dot-com bubble bust in 2001, but it didn’t mean the internet didn’t have a wonderful future. And the crypto bubble may have burst in 2018, but ten years from now blockchain will prove to be a really useful and revolutionary technology.""  tZERO image from CoinDesk archives.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/22/overstock-blockchain-fund-shuffles-management-ahead-of-tzero-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c71ef448a877dfc850b7c871e9374ca6d19052f-1267x563.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413307,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MFS,1548158462,"Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work Algorithm Needs Replacing, Argues BIS Study","The proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies is not viable in the long-term and needs to be replaced, argues a new study from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  BIS, considered to be the central bank of central banks, published a research report on Monday, saying that PoW – which uses a network of powerful computers to secure the network – is “extremely expensive” and the only solution is to “depart” from using the algorithm.  Author of the report, Raphael Auer, a principal economist for the monetary and economic department at the BIS says that there are two fundamental economic limitations of the algorithm.  First, bitcoin is vulnerable to double-spending or 51 percent attacks, hence it requires ""extremely expensive"" protection based on PoW.  Second, as the system stops awarding bitcoin as block rewards to miners, the algorithm will not be able to generate transaction fees ""in line with the goal of guaranteeing payment security.”  ""Simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality,"" he suggests.  Auer, therefore, suggests that blockchain tech developments are needed to speed up payment finality and to keep the liquidity of cryptocurrencies intact.  “Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help,"" he says, ""but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalization.”  But the lightning network is also not without its concerns, he says. For example, there is a trade-off between efficiency and centralization with the scaling solution. Such solutions, are ""no magic bullets, as they face their own scaling issues,"" he says. As of Jan. 3, 2019, 362 of a total of 544 committed bitcoins were associated with a single website, meaning two thirds of lightning capacity at the time was controlled by one entity, the paper states.  Auer believes that it is important to look at the bigger picture and answer how the crypto ecosystem can complement and improve upon the existing monetary and financial ecosystem rather than replacing it.  He concludes:  ""The current technology seems unlikely to replace the current monetary and financial infrastructure. Instead, the question is rather how the technology might complement existing arrangements.”  Back in September, the BIS published another report on the crypto markets indicating that “their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions” as they remain largely unregulated.

42381487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rzt3,1548154819,Bitcoin Sees Longest Stretch of Price Consolidation Since October,"Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing the longest stretch of range-bound price activity in three months.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been largely restricted to trading between $3,700 and $3,500 since Jan. 11 – the longest stretch at such a narrow range since the end of October.  Back then, the market had gone quiet, with prices staying within the $6,500–$6,350 range in the 12 days leading up to Oct. 28. On the following day, BTC dropped to $6,208. After another period of sideways movement, bitcoin fell well below the crucial support level of $6,000 on Nov. 14.  The current period of consolidation may also end with a big move to the downside, as BTC reinforced the primary bearish trend – as represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average – with a 10 percent slide on Jan. 10.  The potential post-breakdown drop toward December lows near $3,100 could be rapid, too, as a prolonged period of consolidation often ends with a violent move.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $3,515 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.40 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart        As seen above, BTC's 12-day-long range play is the longest since Oct. 28.  Back then, Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2,-2 on the 20-day moving average) were flat-lined, representing a neutral bias. As of now, Bollinger bands are signaling a bearish bias with a slight tilt to the downside.  Another major difference is that prices had consolidated around the 20-day MA in October. This time, however, the moving average is working as stiff resistance, as indicated by BTC’s failure to secure a UTC close above that level on Jan. 19.  Weekly chart  The outlook remains bearish while BTC is held below the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA), currently at $3,715.  The long upper shadow (spread between high and close) attached to the previous weekly candle indicates that the ""sell-on-rise"" mentality is still intact, meaning the brief price bounce soon ran into offers.  That candle also confirmed the end of a corrective bounce from December lows signaled by the preceding bearish engulfing candle.  View  Bitcoin's longest stretch of price consolidation will likely end with a convincing break below $3,500 and could be followed by a re-test of the December low of $3,122.  The bearish case would weaken if the cryptocurrency sees a UTC close above the former-support-turned resistance of the 21-day MA, currently at $3,732.

42381483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RzpH,1548147604,Dutch Financial Authorities Plan Licensing Scheme for Crypto Exchanges,"Financial authorities in the Netherlands are planning a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges and wallet service providers to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.      De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the nation's central bank, and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) published a report earlier this week, suggesting that fiat-to-crypto exchanges and custody solution providers must be licensed as cryptocurrencies carry “high financial crime risks.”      “These risks must be addressed effectively, which can be achieved as a result of the international coordination of countermeasures that AMLD5 [the Fifth European Anti-Money Laundering Directive] provides,” the report states.      The two authorities said they are recommending the licensing regime instead of a registration system because it allows “pre-market entry assessment"" to know whether involved parties will comply or are able to comply with the AMLD5 rules.    A registration regime, on the other hand, would be “less effective” as it only allows for a “limited substantive assessment” of these parties.    Secondly, the authorities have also recommended that the European regulatory framework for corporate funding should be amended to enable blockchain-based development of small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to enable the use of crypto assets like shares or bonds.      Accordingly, the authorities have recommended reconciling the national definition of a security ,with the broader definition in European legislation to bring new forms of corporate funding such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and security token offerings (STOs) under the scope of applicable rules.      “Amending the definition is also desirable in anticipation of potential European consensus on the qualification of certain cryptos as security under present legislation,” the report added.      Finally, the regulators have called for international crypto rules to be put in place given the fact that Dutch-based providers of crypto services number less than 30 and their volumes are “negligible” compared to large-scale players globally.      “The evolution of cryptos is primarily internationally-oriented given their inherent cross-border nature, and cannot be confined to the Dutch market alone,” the report states.

42381488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RzuJ,1548131474,"Bitcoin's Price Counters the VIX, Confirming It's Still a Risk Asset","Evidence is emerging that bitcoin has yet to truly earn its reputation as an ""uncorrelated asset.""  Case in point, bitcoin's latest sell-off from $6,000 to nearly $3,000 was accompanied by a surge in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The VIX measures the 30-day forward-looking volatility of the S&P 500 to gauge the market’s fear and risk tolerance, which is why it is commonly referred to as the “fear gauge” for the broader U.S. stock market.  In theory, the VIX should be low when the S&P 500 is in a steady uptrend and should only rise as does fear, causing panic selling and for either smart or weak hands to be shaken out of the market.  Bitcoin, being a store of value that isn't the product of a government, is advertised to be unaffected by the perceived fear or risk in any market, yet as the chart below shows, that is not yet the case.  BTC/USD vs. VIX  The VIX printed two significant peaks in 2018. The first occurred on Feb. 6 when it reached 50.3 and the second on Dec. 24 when it reached 36.1.  At the first peak, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10 percent from its January highs and on the second peak it was down closer to 20 percent from the record highs achieved just two months prior.  Needless to say, fear was, and still is, prevalent in the broader U.S. Stock market, which should have resulted in either a stable or bullish bitcoin, right?  Wrong. Bitcoin inversely correlated with the VIX on both occasions. When the VIX reached its first peak, bitcoin had just finished falling 70 percent from its January highs and during the second peak, its price had just declined another 50 percent.  Bitcoin’s negative correlation with the VIX shows it performs poorly when fear in the U.S. equities market creates a ""risk-off"" environment – by definition, the opposite of a safe haven asset.  Gold vs. Bitcoin  For reference, the globally recognized safe haven asset, gold, positively correlated with the VIX during its two major peaks in 2018.  During the VIX’s February high, gold (US$/OZ) largely traded sideways between $1,300-$1,370 and only began to fall toward $1,160 in May as the VIX sank and the S&P 500 regained strength.  Gold, again, correlated with the VIX during its December peak. As equities began crashing and fears of a global economic recession circulated, the shiny metal had already been in a 20 week long and more than 10 percent uptrend.  Indeed, the physical physical store of value is still earning its name as a safe haven asset while the digital alternative has yet to be able to.
