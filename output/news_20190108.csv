42381445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmjp,1546983648,ShapeShift Lays Off 37 in Latest Crypto Industry Cutback,"Crypto exchange ShapeShift has announced a round of layoffs, citing a range of difficulties including a tough market climate.  In a blog post published Tuesday, CEO Erik Voorhees wrote that the startup had laid off 37 employees, or a third of its staff. He described the process as “a deep and painful reduction, mirrored across many crypto companies in this latest bear market cycle.”  As Voorhees noted, ShapeShift isn’t the only crypto startup to move to trim its workforce in recent weeks. As CoinDesk previously reported, ethereum production studio ConsenSys announced a 13 percent staff cut in early December. More recently, chat startup Status and bitcoin mining giant Bitmain confirmed that they were cutting staffers.  In one of the most transparent testimonies of its kind to date, Voorhees detailed several problems that worked against Shapeshift heading into this decision. Besides the mounting legal concerns that have impeded the entire industry, Voorhees contended that the company grew too fast and spread out its efforts into too many product areas (such as CoinCap, it's CoinMarketCap competitor, and KeepKey, an acquisition).  Additionally, the company's decision to begin doing know-your-customer checks on customers caused a large loss in clients and users. Lastly, transactions, in general, dropped across the board, leading to a general drop in revenue, Voorhees wrote.  Though Voorhees said the firm had hedged for such risks, it wasn't enough to allow the company to remain at its current staffing level.  ""2018 marked a rough year. While this new one starts upon some painful reorganization, we’re encouraged and hopeful for 2019,"" he wrote.  ShapeShift declined to comment further when reached.

Ripple announced Tuesday that Euro Exim Bank, alongside payment startups JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo and FTCS, would be leveraging XRP for cross-border transactions. Further, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND and Rendimento have signed on to RippleNet.  As a result, the startup now has more than 200 customers worldwide, according to Tuesday's reveal.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company is now signing two-three customers per week, and last year saw a 350 percent increase in customers sending live payments.  ""We're beginning to see more customers flip the switch and leverage XRP for on-demand liquidity,"" he added in a statement.  Euro Exim Bank director Kaushik Punjani noted that his bank's customers have traditionally been restricted from settling transactions quickly and cost efficiently. This issue extends to both major corporations and individual remitters, he said, adding:  ""Working collaboratively with Ripple and selected counterparts, we have designed, tested and are implementing both xCurrent and xRapid in record time, and we look forward to the benefits these will bring our customers.""  David Lighton, CEO and co-founder of remittance service SendFriend, similarly touted the focus on cheap cross-border payments as the main benefit of using xRapid.  ""A distributed ledger-based solution, leveraging Ripple's XRP asset allows us to settle transactions in real time, with lower capital requirements and lower costs. We're proud to partner with Ripple to offer our customers cheaper, faster, payments to the developing world,"" he told CoinDesk.  A number of other companies have already begun using xRapid, which uses the XRP cryptocurrency, for international payments, including MercuryFX, Cuallix and Catalyst Corporate Credit Union. However, while the three firms provide financial services, none possess a banking license like Euro Exim does.  In the past, other companies including Western Union, MoneyGram, Viamercias and IDT have trialed xRapid, though none are utilizing the platform in full production at this time.

42381452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RmrN,1546969903,Exchange Says $200K in Ethereum Classic Lost As Blockchain Attacks Continue,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io said Tuesday that it will absorb the loss of roughly $200,000 worth of ethereum classic – about 40,000 ETC – in light of a series of blockchain history rewrites that continue to occur.  In a blog post, the exchange said it had confirmed the 51 percent attack – whereby an entity controls sufficient computing power to alter the network's transaction history and double-spend coins – and identified three addresses that it said are tied to the attacker in question.  ""Gate.io's censor successfully blocked attacker's transactions at the beginning and submitted them to the manual exam. Unfortunately, during the 51% attack, all the transactions looked valid and confirmed well on the blockchain. The examiner passed the transactions. It caused about 40k ETC loss due to this attack. Gate.io will take all the loss for the users,"" the exchange said in its statement. The press-time price of ETC is $4.97 per token, according to CoinMarketCap.  The announcement corroborates similar claims made by crypto exchange Coinbase, which said Monday that it had identified double spends have occurred as a result of deep block reorganizations (reorgs) on the ethereum classic blockchain.  Information shared by Bitfly (Etherchain), Coinbase and Blockscout indicates that the attacks continue. ""We updated our blog last night with additional attacks. We won't resume ETC sends/receives until we feel that it's safe to do so,"" a representative for Coinbase said.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitfly CEO Peter Pratscher explained that although a number of reorganized blocks could be confirmed on the ethereum classic network, no analysis of the movement of transactions could yet be ascertained on their part to confirm or deny double spends.  On the other hand, Blockscout’s project lead Andrew Cravenho told CoinDesk that evidence of a double spend attack is “100 percent.”  Pointing to a reorg that occurred between block number 7261495 and 7261496 on the ethereum classic blockchain, Cravenho reported that 26,000 ETC were spent once before the reorg occurred on block number 7261492 and again thereafter on block number 7261497.  “This double spend transaction was effectively stolen,” said Cravenho. He also added that while it's still possible the event could have been caused by accident due to specialized mining hardware testing as suggested yesterday on the official Ethereum Classic Twitter page, the likelihood of this is slim.  “If I was testing new hardware, I wouldn’t be testing $100,000 in a single transaction,” Cravenho quipped.  Developer efforts  Some developers in the ethereum classic community have come publicly to agree with Blockscout's analysis, including developer Donald McIntyre, who told CoinDesk: ""The last information I have is that there was no attack by any ASICs provider but a textbook 51% and double spend attack."" At the same time, not all ethereum classic developers are in agreement.  Ethereum classic developer Cody Burns maintained that a clear picture of what is happening on the ethereum classic network is yet to be uncovered, declining to comment when asked about the cause for these reorg attacks.  And on the matter of proactive steps forward to ensure the security of the network, Burns told CoinDesk that developers are similarly moving forward with caution.  He told CoinDesk:  “We have been discussing options [to] mitigate the current threat, but no one wants to make a hasty decision that would expose greater security threats.”  Adding to this, McIntyre went so far as to suggest tentative steps ""to decide whether an urgent PoW algorithm change in ETC"" is necessary in the short term and ""rule changes to the client or protocol for example a temporary reorg cap per miner"" in the longer-term.  Still, given the decentralized form of governance overseeing the relatively nascent blockchain network, McIntyre concludes that coordination between ethereum classic developers remains unformalized.  ""As we are truly decentralized, we don't have formal processes or any top down management of our network, communications or decision making process. However, we do coordinate as we share the same incentives to support the network, so we communicate regularly, albeit not with the method or [system] of a centralized team,"" said McIntyre.

42381462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn1R,1546966852,BitTorrent's Master Plan to Bring a Tron-Powered Crypto Token to the Masses,"This weekend, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao lauded Tron on Twitter for bringing a crypto-powered business model to the storied file-sharing software it bought last summer, BitTorrent.  Zhao, who topped CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2018, wrote:  ""The grandfather of Dapp[s] finally finds its decentralized currency and business model. Should be a very interesting case study.""  Zhao's tweet yielded over 100 retweets and over 500 likes, and a decent thread of comments following what he had to say. Many responders seemed to jump to the conclusion that Tron would make BitTorrent a paid service. Instead, it's giving users an option to spend some crypto – the new BitTorrent Token (BTT), to be precise – to improve their user experience.  The BTT white paper (PDF)https://www.bittorrent.com/btt/btt-docs/BitTorrent_Token_Whitepaper.pdf promises a broad universe of possibilities, according to a review by CoinDesk. ""By introducing a mechanism for value storage and exchange we aim to greatly broaden the universe of possible participants – either service requesters, service providers or both,"" the document reads.  As for whether BitTorrent would move to a paid model, the white paper addresses this directly: ""Participation in the BTT transactions is required to be both fully disclosed and optional for end users.""  The more substantive critiques of the move generally argued that BitTorrent wasn't anything but a decentralized exchange for pirated material. The BTT white paper, however, argues that the protocol could find more uses with a token:  ""Optimizing the existing BitTorrent protocol is an obvious first step in the introduction of a cryptographic token but it barely scratches the surface of what is rapidly becoming possible.""  The entities behind BTT – Tron and the BitTorrent Foundation – envision three core business lines that could potentially be decentralized via BitTorrent if a value instrument were to be built into it: content delivery, file storage and privacy-protecting proxy services.  While the list isn't exhaustive, it hits a lot of the same categories that the Telegram Open Network listed for itself as well. Further, Elaine Ou, a blockchain engineer and Bloomberg opinion contributor, has blogged about past attempts to tokenize bandwidth and data storage (spoiler alert: they haven't worked out in the past).  Regardless, these new BitTorrent activities still run up against the initial friction for existing BitTorrent users: they have become very accustomed to the protocol delivering its services for free.  That said, the white paper goes to great lengths to explain that it's not actually free. It contends:  ""The system essentially implements a barter economy where individual clients collaborate based on trading pieces of a file they each are trying to download, with delivery bandwidth used as the deciding factor for whom to keep bartering with.""  Civilizing the BitTorrent economy  With the BTT white paper, the company wants to make it clear: BitTorrent users have always paid for their downloads – they pay with bandwidth.  It's been a barter economy. Just as with the human economy, the idea is that, by adding a fungible token into this barter system, the economy can expand to the benefit of everyone in it.  BitTorrent works by breaking files into lots of parts. So the first piece a user downloads becomes available to another user who wants the same file, but hasn't downloaded that piece yet. That's called a ""seed.""  It doesn't always work out fairly, though, as the white paper explains:  ""Due to bandwidth asymmetry, files frequently complete downloading long before a peer has been able to upload an equivalent amount of bytes.""  This means that some users can get a partial free ride. If too many of the users sharing and downloading the same file shut their BitTorrent clients down after they have completed their download, it can disrupt a swarm and lead to user-experience gaps.  As the white paper points out, the system still works pretty well on balance. People can generally get whatever they want on BitTorrent because there are so many users.  Still, the company thinks adding a token could make it work just a little better, and grow the service even larger.  Bigger picture  Either way, though, a major goal for Tron here seems to be turning a huge user base of decentralized internet users into crypto users, so it can win the adoption game.  Ash Egan, who takes the lead on blockchain and crypto at Accomplice VC, told CoinDesk that he saw the acquisition as a bid by Tron for legitimacy.  ""BitTorrent has been well respected and stress tested for 15 or so years,"" said Egan. ""What better way to legitimize themselves than to make an acquisition of that stature?""  That stature includes a large user base. BitTorrent, which first launched in 2001, claims 100 million people use its protocol each month. The white paper makes clear that Tron and BitTorrent plan to leverage those users to bring people around to using crypto:  ""While many new decentralized protocol proposals are suggesting ambitious technical paths forward, almost all are silent on how to address the enormous marketing challenge of building critical mass which is a crucial technical necessity for all distributed systems.""

42381450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmq7,1546959640,Japan Eyes Regulation of Unregistered Crypto Investment Schemes,"Japan’s financial regulator is reportedly looking to close a legal loophole that lets unregistered investment firms solicit funds in cryptocurrencies rather than cash.  According to a report from Sankei Shimbun on Tuesday, Japan's Financial Service Agency (FSA) is planning revisions to bring such schemes under the country’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, although no timeline for the changes was provided.  Currently, the act prohibits unregistered schemes from collecting investments in fiat currencies, but it does not mention cryptocurrencies.  The issue has reportedly received increased focus from the watchdog in the wake of rising incidences of crypto pyramid schemes in the country. Back in November, police in Tokyo arrested eight men alleged to have run such a scheme that collected 7.8 billion yen (almost $69 million) in cryptos from thousands of victims.  The eight were said to have collected most of the payments in bitcoin, as well as another 500 million yen (about $4.40 million) in cash, under the guise of a bogus investment firm called Sener.  Sankei Shimbun cited officials as saying that, if the scam had solicited only cryptocurrency, it's possible the criminals would not have been caught.  Japan's FSA has been actively regulating the cryptocurrency space since the shockwave that followed the collapse of the Mt Gox exchange in 2014. Measures have included instigating a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges and scrutinizing exchanges over security and compliance with anti-money laundering rules.  Just yesterday, the agency was reported to be considering approving crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the same time, it has now apparently dropped plans to approve trading of crypto derivatives on financial exchanges due to concerns the products would encourage speculation.

42381456,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmv9,1546956037,Ethereum Miner Linzhi Calls Out Project Coders for Proposed ASIC Ban,"Shenzhen-based miner manufacturer Linzhi has published a statement in response to a “tentative” decision, made by ethereum developers Friday, to block specialized hardware, or ASICs, from securing the platform in exchange for rewards.  This would involve the implementation of “ProgPoW” in an upcoming upgrade, a code change that is optimized for graphic card, or GPU, hardware.  In today’s statement, Linzhi said it was “shocked” by the move, stating, “We reject arbitrary enforcement of rules, and request clear and equal guidelines to be established for all hardware makers.”  The statement continued:  “Today we are calling upon the ethereum developers to publish rules and requirements for what constitutes a good ProgPoW ASIC maker.”  Elaborating on the statement in an email to CoinDesk, director of operations Wolfgang Spraul said that such rules could include more transparency, or even monthly audits of hardware companies by ethereum developers.  “The rules should probably include defining better relationships between hardware makers, miners, and developers,” Spraul said, “That's up to the ethereum developers to define, we think.”  Following the meeting on Friday at which the developers approved the proposal, discussion regarding ProgPoW has escalated, with several prominent community members coming forward to argue against the change.  ASICs for ProgPoW?  Linzhi is currently designing a chip for ethereum’s current mining algorithm, Ethash. Having expended $4 million on its production, the upcoming miner claims significant advantages over former ethereum ASIC designs.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Spraul also said that pending its implementation into ethereum, the company will research the feasibility of building specialized ASIC hardware for ProgPoW.  “I can publicly confirm today that we intend to study the feasibility, and then build, ProgPoW ASICs,” Spraul said.  Because ProgPoW changes ethereum’s underlying mining algorithm, Ethash, to be more memory-heavy, the code switch is said to make GPU hardware competitive with ASICs.  Proponents of ProgPoW say  that if hardware designers try to build ProgPoW ASICs – which is to say a specialized chip with the sole function of computing ProgPoW – it would just end up resembling GPU hardware.  Still, Spraul denied this, stating that “Hardware innovation is non-linear,” and “We can accelerate ProgPoW by a factor of 3x to 8x.”  Yesterday  , ethereum classic underwent a 51 percent attack – something that the cryptocurrency’s Twitter account claimed may have come from Linzhi. Spraul pushed back on such claims, saying “They are entirely baseless.”  Miners image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ETC | EXCHANGE | MINING | RESEARCH,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/08/ethereum-miner-linzhi-calls-out-project-coders-for-proposed-asic-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc233ab8578b6c77a4f8151135aff9db0d7ded7e-1500x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmtt,1546949740,Africa Needs Open Currency Competition. It Needs Cryptocurrency,"Terence Zimwara is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and economic analyst from Zimbabwe, with firsthand experience of his country's record hyperinflation. Terence also likes to share his views via his blog.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  As digital currencies gradually gain traction, a counter narrative emerged as the year progressed: central banks that belatedly acknowledged the value of cryptocurrencies now want to launch their own.  However, some want the prerogative to issue this currency assigned to them and only them, because central banks ‘enjoy the confidence’ of the public. Speaking at a Brookings Institute organized discussion event, Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank of International Settlements, boldly declared earlier this year that technology cannot substitute for all what central banks do to make trustworthy currencies.  This kind of pushback against cryptocurrencies has long characterized the debate on bitcoin, blockchain and digital currencies. At the core are two fundamental issues, control and freedom to choose. Central Banks naturally want to perpetuate the status quo because of the obvious advantages this comes with that status.  Yet, cryptocurrency's popularity stems from the ease with which it enhances commerce, and the insulation it offers to investors' value when financial markets hit turbulence. Perhaps banks would not gripe as much as they are doing now, if bitcoin did not threaten to shred the currency-issuing monopoly they presently enjoy.  The power that comes with monopoly over creation of money is unmatched and that is why virtually all central banks insist on having the sole rights to print money. On the other hand, blockchain technology is a natural reaction to years of this unjust state of affairs. Blockchain technology is an attempt to force sweeping reforms to the global financial system.  Therefore, it is also important to keep the latter perspective when discussing the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies. When central banks say they want to issue their own digital currencies, we have to invoke the context we have just explained above. In fairness, central banks in advanced economies across the EU, the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan etc, sometimes do genuinely try to protect their respective citizens from hackers, fraudsters or from any other undesirable elements that may want to do harm.  Central banks also claim their presence helps to infuse trust into financial systems. For instance, banks do not normally trust each other, so the intermediary role played by central banks ensures the smooth flow of transactions between them. In other words, central banks build and maintain confidence in financial markets.  It is on this basis that Carstens doubts if any new technology will substitute for all these centuries of creating good practices, which in a way generates the trust that society has on the currency that we know today.  Risks and advantages  However, this assessment is incomplete, if not disingenuous, because it dodges the central theme of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general – ending unfair currency issuing monopolies.  Privately issued digital currencies come with risks but equally, they come with important advantages and one such advantage is competition or choice. Competition makes free markets efficient and when a market is deprived of this, a waste of resources often follows and customers become worse off.  Already, the cryptocurrency market is endowed with a growing number of digital currencies aside from bitcoin. The choice of such ""altcoins"" ranges across ethereum, litecoin, XRP, bitcoin cash and many more, and each is an attempt to give the holder a unique advantage that they cannot get elsewhere.  There is no monopoly here: different players have been allowed to issue cryptocurrencies but still the market continues to grow. When a central bank issues a currency, you have no choice but to accept that currency, even if you have some misgivings about the currency or the process of issuing it.  Laws have been passed to preclude private entities from printing national currencies because, apparently, competition is not preferred when it comes to money creation. So even when you know that the issuing party is incompetent or corrupt, you have no choice but to abide.  Times of crisis  To Illustrate, Zimbabwe’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) pursued what became known as quasi-fiscal activities between 2004 and 2008. The RBZ ran parallel expenditure activities, which many blamed for the hyperinflation, which peaked at 500 billion percent and the ultimate collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar.  The public lost confidence in this institution and the banking system in general, as evidenced by the nature of deposits mobilized by most banks after the hyperinflation period. It is quite natural that many people now question the legitimacy or importance of this institution.  So, when the same institution announced that it planned to issue a so-called surrogate currency back in 2016, there was a predictable outcry, with many fearing it was an attempt to bring back the worthless Zim dollar.  Cryptocurrencies give a choice to those opposed to a national currency, as was the case in Zimbabwe in November 2016, when bond-notes became legal tender. Unfortunately, ignorance levels were, and still remain, very high – ordinary Zimbabweans did not realize they had an option to switch to cryptocurrencies.  Now, a few years later, bond-notes appear to be on their way out, as they are losing value quickly and ordinary people will be hard hit again. So, it is quite perplexing to hear the likes of Carstens assert that people have confidence in central banks. Which central banks? There are obviously better corporate governance standards in Europe where Mr. Carstens hails from. There are also strong institutions that help to keep central banks in check, something absent in many developing countries.  Competition is healthy  It is unfair that powerful figures from rich and advanced economies want to stifle an innovation, which could uplift societies across the continent, just because the innovation is not ""international best practice.""  Africa has had its unfair share of currency crises, from Mozambique to Zambia, from Nigeria to Zimbabwe, and it is apparent the central banking system does not always work well. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies offer an exciting alternative, which we must be allowed to explore. Privately launched cryptocurrencies must be allowed to compete with currencies issued by the continent’s central banks.  This competition will help central banks on the continent to improve and reform.  African nations must also resist attempts to adopt the Venezuela model, where the state reportedly banned others from issuing digital currencies before it launched its own – the petro.  No one can really predict what will happen to cryptocurrencies in the coming years, yet that should not stop us from dreaming about the future. Often new technology changes lives in many ways that even those creating the technologies could not have imagined. Now is the time for open minds and not fear.

42381469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn7j,1546946356,Looking North? Bitcoin Price Dip Forms Bull Flag Pattern,"Bitcoin's (BTC) minor pullback from two-week highs could end up fueling a breakout above the key hurdle of $4,140.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $4,090 at 17:15 UTC on Sunday – the highest level since Dec. 24 – validating the short-term bullish reversal confirmed on Dec. 20.  Even so, the positive momentum has weakened slightly in the last 36 hours. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,995 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,934 earlier today.  The 3 percent correction from two-week highs, however, has carved out a bull flag on the technical charts. Put simply, the pattern often represents a pause in a rally and can accelerate the preceding bullish move.  So, it seems safe to say that the price pullback has pushed up the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above $4,140.  4-hour chart  BTC has created a bull flag pattern – a bullish continuation setup – on the 4-hour chart.  A 4-hour close above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,005, would confirm a bull breakout. That would signal a revival of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753 and would open the doors to $4,340 (target as per the measured move method).  Essentially, the flag breakout could end up yielding an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout above the neckline of $4,140.  More importantly, higher lows (marked by red arrows) at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low), $3,629 (Jan. 1 low) and $3,753 (Jan. 6 low) indicate that the bulls are in control. Therefore, crossing the flag resistance should not be a tough task.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC is taking the support of the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs), validating the short-term bullish setup indicated by these upward sloping averages.  The 14-day relative strength index is holding in bullish territory above 50.00 and prices seem to have found acceptance above the 50-day MA hurdle.  The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the higher side.  View  A bull flag breakout, if confirmed, could yield a break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline level of $4,140.  A UTC close above $4,140 would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal (transition from the bearish-to-bullish market) and open up upside towards the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  The bears may feel emboldened if BTC violates the bullish-higher low pattern with a move below $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The organization announced Monday that the funding is a “scalability, usability and security” grant, in particular aimed to boost work on Casper, a proof-of-stake protocol upgrade, and the scaling solution dubbed sharding, as well as light clients, developer tools, audits and infrastructure improvements.  The grant will be provided in several phases, the foundation said, adding that the first part is already done and the rest will be completed as specific milestones are reached. These include the completion of eWasm compatibility work, shipping a light wallet for mainnet and the completion of the first two phases of the sharding effort.  Parity is a blockchain infrastructure startup, co-founded by former Ethereum Foundation security chief Jutta Steiner. It is known for its ethereum software client, Parity Ethereum, which it claims is “the fastest and most advanced.” The startup has also developed several tools, such as Substrate, a service that lets users create customized blockchains for decentralized applications.  The Ethereum Foundation said in its statement that it is committed to funding teams and individuals building common infrastructure around the network. Back in October, it granted nearly $3 million to a number of blockchain startups and developers.  The foundation said:  ""We have been delighted to see our ecosystem rally around and support technical merit and value alignment, and we are devoted to using our resources to further this mission too. We do so responsibly through milestone-based grants to projects, both large and small, commensurate with the potential impact of their work.""

42381459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RmwP,1546938010,Blockchain Water Purifier? New China Mobile Appliance Earns You Tokens,"Telecommunications giant China Mobile is trying to show everyday consumers the value of blockchain by incorporating the technology into an ordinary household product.  The company’s internet of things (IoT) unit has developed a water purifier with a built-in computing chip and an IoT module. Like other IoT-connected devices, it will collect data on user behavior, which will be valuable to manufacturers and suppliers.  But according to Xiao Yi, a product market director at China Mobile IoT, this smart appliance will stand apart from most by giving consumers something in return for their data – and that’s where blockchain comes in.  Depending on how long and how frequently consumers use the product, they will earn a blockchain token called PWMC, which they can then redeem for replacement filters, or to purchase other goods.  This rewards system will provide an incentive for usage that’s lacking in other IoT products, Xiao said, while at the same time make blockchain relatable for the average person who doesn’t spend all day trading cryptocurrency.  “Our goal is to also attract those who are not in the cryptocurrency or blockchain community, who may have heard of this technology but not necessarily understand it,” Xiao told CoinDesk, adding:  “To embrace a more mainstream adoption, we need to turn something that appears professional into something that’s very ordinary.”  To be sure, the water purifier is far from a mass-market product. Right now, it is available only through a one-month crowdfunding campaign on Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, with a goal to raise 200,000 yuan or $30,000 by Jan. 21. (Buyers will receive only the device; the tokens must be earned by using it.)  The sale is being conducted by Chain Infinity, a company based in Guangzhou that was jointly created by China Mobile’s IoT division, as well as Jingtum and MOAC, two China-based blockchain startups.  The project was initiated around the end of 2017. Aside from incentivizing user participation with tokens, Xiao said a key purpose for China Mobile IoT to move into blockchain is the technology’s unique feature of recording data in a tamper-proof fashion.  The devices feature both computing chips and IoT modules so that they’re connected to the internet without relying on wi-fi, and can run as individual nodes so that consumers’ usage information can be transacted and recorded on a distributed network.  According to Xiao, this data will be recorded on SWTC, a public blockchain built on the byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm launched by China Mobile’s technical partner Jingtum.  But wait, there’s more...  The water purifiers follow a line of blockchain-enabled televisions that China Mobile rolled out for sale via Chain Infinity on Nov. 11, China’s equivalent to the U.S. Thanksgiving Black Friday sale.  Similarly, the TVs incorporate IoT modules and computing chips that connect to the SWTC network as individual nodes for recording information about user behavior.  Further, by setting up the TVs, consumers activate a cloud mining contract for the bitcoin network that Chain Infinity has signed with mining farms. Depending on the models, the contract period could last from two to three years, after which a certain amount of bitcoin are promised to the TV owner as a return.  And since all the assets will be stored in crypto wallets created by accounts registered on Chain Infinity, Xiao said they can be used either for buying other consumer goods available on the store or to be exchanged against each other.  “Based on existing laws, exchanging tokens for tokens or for tangible goods is not illegal, so long as you don’t exchange those into money,” Xiao said. “And China Mobile has SIM cards, pre-paid packages and other consumer stuff. You can either use the tokens directly, or participate in a flexible and yet compliant barter.”  In September 2017, the People’s Bank of China notably issued a ban on initial coin offering activities as well as fiat-t-crypto spot trading. Yet since then, over-the-counter and crypto-to-crypto trading have still been accessible to Chinese investors.  China Mobile is one of the three large state-owned telecommunications companies in China. Founded in 2006, China Mobile IoT is a fully owned subsidiary that has rolled out various consumer modules and enterprise solutions to enable mobile connectivity for houseware products such as cars and cameras.  Xiao said the water purifier and the TV are the first steps of its blockchain experiment. Further, China Mobile has also signed a partnership agreement with MOAC, another public blockchain project that launched its network in April 2018, to launch a standardized enterprise solution for combining IoT modules and blockchain computing chips.  The goal, according to Xiao, would be licensing such technology to other enterprises that are interested in rolling out similar blockchain-enabled IoT products.  That said, he added that, depending on the general user’s habits, this concept may not apply to every type of IoT device. Xiao concluded:  “In general, it’s more suitable for larger houseware stuff that have higher and continuous usage demand on a daily and regularly basis.”  China Mobile image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/08/blockchain-water-purifier-new-china-mobile-appliance-earns-you-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46c20b53186634b30deb2b7aaab2e2aa8bf67de7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn5D,1546912819,Ether Markets Are Mimicking Bitcoin's 2015 Price Bottom,"Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but when history repeats it can be difficult to ignore the potential implications.  Such is the case with price chart of ether, the ethereum network's native cryptocurrency.  Since Sept. 2018, the price chart of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has mimicked the market structure of bitcoin’s bear market bottom in 2015.  In the world of technical analysis and trading, similar and repeating market structures are known as fractals, similar to the recurring patterns found in art, nature and mathematics.  The two emotions of fear and greed are what drives price action in a market, so repeated investor behavior yielding similar results may not be that far-fetched, especially when those emotions create fractals in the cryptocurrency market.  BTC/USD vs. ETH/BTC comparison  The above chart depicts the eerie fractal from BTC’s bottom in 2015 (upper frame) playing out on the ETH/BTC chart (lower frame).  Needless the say, the structure of the two charts are nearly identical, with only minor discrepancies.  As can be seen, going from left to right, both assets printed a “V” shaped bottom followed by a minor rally and subsequent bearish trendline breakdown. After the trendline break, both markets endured a period of abnormally low volatility compared to their typically erratic nature.  As the old saying in investing goes: “never short a dull market”. These periods are commonly found to be when markets store – or accumulate – energy before a significant advance.  Larger players also tend to lose interest in boring markets, leaving just the smaller retail traders who, in large part, favor long over short positions, in turn creating a market that favors the bulls.  Following the dull market, both BTC and ETH produced a minor rally followed by another sell-off, as depicted by the blue downward curved lines.  Both markets quickly rebounded in a curved bottom fashion, driving the price to a “V” shaped top, lastly followed by bullish continuation from the previous rebound.  The differences  Indeed, the similarities are striking, but there are differences between the two that may play spoilsport to the fractal actually playing out.  According to stock market legend Richard D. Wyckoff, price charts abide by a law of “cause and effect.”  In other words, the longer the trend stays sideways A.K.A. ""the cause,"" the more powerful and long lasting the subsequent trend, A.K.A. ""the effect"" – another reason shorting a dull market can be risky.  This is particularly relevant here since the cause for BTC’s 2015 bottom was nearly an entire year long, whereas ETH’s cause is so far just over three months.  Taking that into account, it could be argued that a long-term uptrend would be an unlikely result if ETH/BTC keeps advancing since its cause is considerably smaller than BTC’s was.  A bullish effect is still possible, though – just perhaps one that is more proportional to its 3-month cause.
