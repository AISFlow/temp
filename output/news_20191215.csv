42403688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWwf,1576431000,"Dissidents and Activists Have a Lot to Gain From Bitcoin, if Only They Knew It","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Alex Gladstein is Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation and Vice President of Strategy for the Oslo Freedom Forum since its inception in 2009.      We are in an era of gradual global bitcoin awakening. The technology has proven robust and resistant to attacks. Over time, the price has continued to climb from pennies to thousands of dollars. Brilliant entrepreneurs and scientists are improving the protocol’s usability, privacy, decentralization and network resilience. Still, it’s important to remember that only a very tiny percentage of people on this planet understand its value as a tool of freedom.      In my work at the Human Rights Foundation, I have the privilege to meet hundreds of dissidents, activists, and journalists from difficult political environments. To date, very few have meaningfully used bitcoin or started to realize its power as a financial escape valve and parallel economy. That ratio is starting to shift, but only in what seems like slow motion.      Even as the bitcoin network pushes into its 12th year of existence, mainstream consumers and corporate users remain stubbornly closed-minded towards the technology. Well-read, intelligent business leaders, politicians, philanthropists, and media parrot the same talking points: bitcoin is too volatile; it’s only for terrorists and drug dealers; it’s pure speculation and has no actual value; it’s an environmental disaster; and, most recently, that it won’t survive the rise of quantum computing. Unfortunately, these arguments (which I tried to debunk in an essay earlier this year) have trickled down to the average person. This collective anti-narrative is strong and prevents greater numbers of people from developing curiosity in bitcoin, from learning about bitcoin, and from using bitcoin.      Our world’s growing financial perils are much-discussed: rampant inflation, rising national debts, fiat devaluation, financial surveillance, and a fear of increasing corporate and government control over our money as cash disappears. You can’t go a day without reading about some aspect of global economic malaise in the front pages of your favorite newspaper or website. There are many pundits who claim to know why the world is going in this direction – but very few who understand that bitcoin is a way out. Many of those who do learn tend to do so out of necessity, not out of luxury.      For example: independent media outlets and civil society organizations in Hong Kong are starting to accept bitcoin donations because their banking accounts are being monitored and controlled; Venezuelans, Iranians, and Palestinians are using bitcoin to do cross-border payments and break through financial controls and sanctions; Chinese are using bitcoin to convert their wealth into an confiscation-resistant store of value; Argentines, Turks, and Lebanese are using bitcoin to opt out of collapsing fiat systems; Syrians and Nigerians are working in the software industry and earning money in bitcoin and using local peer to peer markets to withdraw into fiat to buy goods when necessary; just to name a few. As time goes on, more and more people are realizing that bitcoin can be a way for them to achieve financial sovereignty in an era of increasing instability and surveillance.    Into 2020    As we head into 2020, what are bitcoin's prospects as tool for freedom? Ironically, even in the most democratic countries, bitcoin users need to worry about privacy. American and European governments are just as likely as authoritarian regimes to hire chain analysis companies to track bitcoin user activity. Regardless of your geographic location, you’ll want to see base-layer privacy improvements; wider usage of mixers and other ways to obfuscate transactions; and bigger Lightning Network capacity. If successful, these will allow a growing number bitcoin users to operate without fear of reprisal. As more governments wisen up and turn to chain analysis tools, individuals need ways to protect themselves.      Beyond privacy, the ability for individuals to buy bitcoin with fiat and convert bitcoin into fiat is a big challenge. In the past few years we have seen an incredible increase in local liquidity, where it’s now fairly easy to buy or sell bitcoin in most major urban areas around the world, even inside dictatorships and countries in conflict. If you have bitcoin in Tehran, Beijing, Aleppo, Caracas, or even Gaza, with a bit of research you’ll be able to find someone who will sell you fiat in return. But this infrastructure needs to continue to improve if bitcoin is to live up to its true promise of a borderless, permissionless, censorship-resistant store of value and money for everyone, especially as governments increasingly crack down on exchanges and on- and off-ramps.      As we look forward to 2020, bitcoin “as is” is working as Satoshi intended and is already powerful enough to materially help hundreds of millions of people facing financial repression. The problem is, they just don’t know about it yet. It is incumbent upon those in the Bitcoin community to continue to find ways to share knowledge about this remarkable invention with others. Yes, we face technical, infrastructural, and legal challenges. But the biggest is just a matter of more effectively spreading the word.

42403689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWyd,1576427400,How DeFi Goes Mainstream in 2020: Focus on Usability,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Alex Mashinsky, a veteran entrepreneur and technologist, is CEO of Celsius Network, an ethereum-based lending platform.      2019 was an important year in the slow but steady march towards a future of decentralized finance (DeFi).      Bitcoin once again hit five figures, cementing it position as digital gold (in the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman). The ethereum ecosystem continues to expand. Exciting new DeFi ventures are grabbing headlines every week, from decentralized VPN providers to blockchain infrastructure projects to payment providers.      Equally important, 2019 saw an acceleration of a global attitudinal trend: dissatisfaction with centralized powers. Popular mistrust of banks and financial institutions is deepening. Disinformation on social media platforms is on the rise. Corruption, inequality, and authoritarianism are driving people to the streets, from Hong Kong to Santiago, demanding structural change or new governments. The post-Cold War order has devolved into a tinderbox – which is why all roads lead to a decentralized future where people seize control of their assets, their data, and their financial future.      To be sure, the DeFi movement still has so very far to go. Today’s total crypto market cap of $195B (at the time of this writing) is over $150B shy of the assets managed by the 10th largest U.S. bank. The vast majority of consumers still do not hold cryptocurrencies. They store their money with banks and other centralized financial institutions, and invest only in stocks and bonds.      With 2020 upon us, the crypto community finds itself in an awkward position: we have been so busy building base layer infrastructure and shoring up support among enthusiasts that we practically forgot about the average consumer.      We need to bring DeFi into the fold of mainstream financial services. But, to do so, DeFi projects must build on-ramps – including better user interfaces, accessible products and services, and stablecoins – that make it easier for people who don’t know much about cryptocurrency to buy digital assets easily and participate in decentralized financial services.    A Road Map    First, DeFi needs interfaces that are familiar, intuitive, and enjoyable. DeFi projects can and should maintain multi-sig contracts, protection of data privacy, access to distributed blockchains, and all the other decentralized features. But they should lay them underneath the hood of applications that are consumer-friendly, like mainstream platforms or online banking services.      Second, the DeFi community should create products and services for a greater share of the population. Trading and arbitrage platforms are useful for day-traders and hedge funds, but the people who need DeFi the most are not looking to actively trade crypto assets. DeFi projects must rediscover the original purpose of bitcoin by focusing on peer-to-peer exchange and removing toll-collectors from financial services. Projects like Celsius Network (of which I’m CEO), Voyager, Compound, and Monarch, among others, are providing more common financial services like lending, interest income, wealth management, and collateralized loans. Offering these services will allow DeFi projects to expand their reach by providing real value to more people across the world, no matter income, age or location.      Third, DeFi providers should be conscious of the fact that many people still feel uncomfortable investing in digital currencies due to price volatility. As such, stablecoins will be an important bridge from centralized fiat assets to decentralized cryptocurrencies. First-time buyers will be surprised to discover they can (a) earn more interest on stablecoins than on dollars in a savings account, and (b) not have to worry about depreciation in the value of their collateral. Resembling fiat currencies, stablecoins can function as a teaser for BTC, ETH, and other decentralized currencies and DeFi projects.      In sum, DeFi and cryptocurrencies can go mainstream, but they need to be as easy to use as Facebook or Google. Just as one cannot throw first-time swimmers into the deep end of the pool and expect them to swim, we cannot introduce crypto novices to complicated DeFi services and expect them to become Hodlers. Let’s concentrate our efforts in 2020 on making DeFi into a movement where everyone can participate and enjoy the fruits of decentralization. After all, Bitcoin just hit its 11th birthday and we’re only getting older.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Alex Mashinsky,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/15/how-defi-goes-mainstream-in-2020-focus-on-usability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ab4608e70dedc71a7edacbc36450671d8873075-1200x981.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Partial transcript below (Stone Bitcoins segment only)      More ways to Listen or Subscribe.         On today's episode...      In the midst of the biggest bubble to date, deep in the ""then they laugh at you"" phase, and with the China narrative rising for the first time as trade volumes overtook the rest of the world, Adam B. Levine was joined by Stephanie Murphy and Andreas M. Antonopoulos in early 2014 for a conversation that is very different, yet somehow the same as they react in real time to all-time high prices of $220...      But first, In the nearly seven years since they started talking Bitcoin, Adam's favorite segment from his favorite writer is without question, ""the Island of Stone Bitcoins"" by then-LTB managing editor George Ettinger. Bitingly funny and still one of the easiest ways to accurately explain how blockchains and tokens work without the need for technology at all, this segment is not to be missed.      Let's Talk Bitcoin! #421 is sponsored by Brave.com and eToro.com, and is distributed in partnership with CoinDesk.com      Transcript:      SO YOU'VE DECIDED TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT BITCOIN.       I, for one, am glad to hear it. You have my congratulations and respect; explaining Bitcoin is a noble endeavor. Other noble endeavors include bathing a leper, manually clearing blockage from a constipated mule, and applying for anything involving the words ""phase one human clinical trials.""       My point is you're doing something that is highly necessary and will ideally make the world a better place in the grand scheme. In the immediate future, however, you will be miserable. You will be miserable, tired, and will really wonder how anything good could come of this. Bitcoin does not lend itself to casual explanation or to convenient metaphor.       In fact, very few comparisons even suit it! It's a currency but it works like a commodity. It's mined in limited quantities, so... it's almost like gold! ...except it's created at an exact, fixed rate and will end at an exact, fixed point. So, not like gold. The work of 'mining' doesn't really 'accomplish' anything, either.       Bitcoin is a trainwreck of anachronisms to have to dump on any unsuspecting novice, and horrible pseudo-words like 'blockchain' and 'hashcash' just make it sound more like a scam.       Take all this insufferable jargon and add the fact that any given person you're explaining it to has used fiat currency notes their whole life and you have a recipe for... for nothing. Probably, nothing. There is a slightest sliver of possibility they will understand and take interest, and the much greater likelihood they will become exasperated and simply hate the stuff out of frustration and I'm getting angry just thinking about it actually.       You're more likely to create a frothing madman who calls Bitcoin a pyramid scheme (showing equally poor understanding of Bitcoin AND pyramid schemes) than an excited new adopter. What we need is a story- a story with a point, with a message, with an illustration of what we're trying to get across. In ancient times, before the centuries-old culmination of written human language was abandoned in favor of ""blogging,"" this was known as an ""allegory.""       In my last article I made mention of a story that helped to finally introduce me to the world of Bitcoin, and the more I've learned the more apt the story has become. There is a strong allegory for Bitcoin in a currency that has already been used before. That currency is hundreds of years old, and there isn't anything else quite like it.       THE PRIMORDIAL BITCOIN       Off in the Pacific Ocean, among the Caroline Islands, is a particular trio of small islands known together as the Island of Yap. Its native residents form several communities among the islands and number in the thousands. From its 'discovery' by Spain in the sixteenth century until the turn of the twentieth, it was a largely ignored Spanish property.       Once the island fell under German ownership in 1899, more details of their peculiar culture were finally exposed to the western world. More specifically, their peculiar economy. Yap was lush in vegetation and fairly sustainable but had no precious metals or minerals to be found.       So, for function of currency they made stone coins. The people of Yap, keen on not half-assing this 'coin' thing, decided to go big AND to go home. They sailed up to four hundred miles to other islands with vast limestone quarries so that they could carve out enormous stone discs three to twelve feet in diameter, wheel them over to rafts, and sail them back to Yap. The men who carved the stone rolled it into a convenient place (even if it took a dozen extra hands to do so) and it was ready for trade.       After they 'mined' and moved the coin, its journey really was done. When time came for a large trade, something on par with livestock or a dowry, the coin changed hands. By 'changed hands' I mean the two involved parties loudly and publicly declared that this particular coin here was now property of so-and-so, and proceeded to leave it right where it was. Nobody could be arsed to move the bloody things. They were massive, and the community was tight-knit; so why bother?       So generations passed and the stones never moved. Tallies were never marked or recorded on the stones- it wasn't necessary. Business was conducted and announced publicly, and the rightful owner of any given stone was common knowledge to anyone living near it.       So these stone coins weren't traditional ""coins."" You could not fit them in the pockets of anything but the most clownly of pants. You did not even put them in a vault for safekeeping. They simply existed, and the community kept the knowledge of who owned which at any given time.       Anyone who has arrived at letstalkbitcoin.com through conscious effort and not via any elaborate cat-on-keyboard incidents should be able to see some of the parallels at work here. To those of you who see it, I say shut up, it gets even better.       THE STONE BLOCKCHAIN       For at least three generations, there was a particular family in a particular home whose wealth was well-known across the islands. The family had long been owners of what might have been one of the biggest stone coins in circulation. ... and not one person on those islands had ever seen it.       Those aforementioned generations earlier, this enormous coin was carved out and loaded up for transport by an expedition of incredibly ambitious Yap residents. Their prodigious haul slipped from import manifests and into mytho-history when a harsh storm battered their rafts just a little ways from home shores.       The raft carrying King Coin (or Coin Kong? I didn't really think this one through, sorry) was cut loose, and their newfound wealth plummeted to the seafloor. In a boring, physicality-obsessed, fiat economy, this would be the tragic end of an otherwise uplifting tale of heroic (and Homeric) avarice. The story would be embellished, talk of sirens and wizards would be peppered throughout the narrative, and, at the end of the day, these men would still be broke.       The people of Yap, however, didn't see what the fuss was about. The men of the expedition all vouched for the proportions of the coin and its general location. Adding to this the fact that it was 'lost' only in the tangible sense and not in the fiscal one, there was no reason not to go on using it.       After all, they lost their millions to a storm, not to the craps table. Just like ""that coin between those two trees,"" or ""that coin next to Jim's house,"" and ""that coin of Bob's that looks conspicuously like a phallus but he gets angry when you point it out,"" this coin entered circulation based on reputation. It was ""that coin at the bottom of the ocean,"" and this family had clutched it for years before spending it on God-knows-what.       The stone coins already existed in a decentralized, community-enforced 'ledger.' By this precedent, they no longer needed even to be tactile objects. Stone coins were simply a unit on the Stonecoin Blockchain, tracked by group-verified transactions. With only so many coins in circulation, the community kept fairly consistent tabs on who owned what.       Whether or not Yap investors lived in fear of a 51% attack is beyond the scope of this allegory; the point itself should be abundantly clear by now.       SO THE STONE COINS ARE AN ALLEGORY FOR BITCOIN       ...the point is that the stone coins are an allegory for Bitcoin. I hope I didn't make that too subtle. In this interpretation of the Stone Money of Yap as an allegory for Bitcoins (see previous sentences,) the story becomes a functional teaching tool. The story of Yap and its coins is a place to start when introducing newcomers to the blockchain.       I cannot emphasize ""teaching the blockchain"" nearly enough; you don't teach a person what a ""Bit-Coin"" is, just as much as you don't explain the texture, shape, and flavor of Yap's limestone coins. You tell them how they are recorded and how they're used. Just as each of us keeps record of the blockchain, the people of Yap all had to keep aware of who owned what. Ownership was a matter of public declaration. By spreading the word to others, it became verification. You didn't own currency unless you got the majority of the community to agree you did. You did this by conducting your business transparently, and announcing all transactions to the world at large. A deal made in secret or made dishonestly was impossible; transparency was part of the protocol. Bitcoin and stone coin changed hands almost identically.       Whether limestone or crypto, these aren't the typical 'coins' one rustles from sofa cushions or the pockets of your playground extortion victims. We don't lay eyes on these coins- we just all agree on where they are and who they belong to. All our Bitcoins are on the metaphorical ocean floor, safely away from prying eyes and sticky fingers, and every member of the community is sitting on a hard copy of the ledger. We don't simply 'trust,' however- our ledger is produced, updated, and thoroughly encrypted by the same software protocol that makes it possible.       Prying eyes aren't left totally in the dark, either; the same blockchain that tracks this ledger is protected from being altered, but is visible to any who want to see what coins have moved where. What Yap enforced by culture we enforce by encryption. What they cut from stone we carve from graphics cards. It's these traits that made their stones and our bitcoins commodities instead of reserve notes; false value could not be simply printed off a press. Bitcoins and stone coins weren't empty promises generated on a whim. They are the product of investment, whether its time spent sailing or time spent mining a processor.       The story of Yap, the stone coins, and the system they used is a great teaching tool, certainly- but it's not just for the outsiders. See, the story of stone money doesn't simply end there; all of us within the community can learn from what happened to Yap's stone coins when the Tax Man came calling.       STONECOIN GOES TO WASHINGTON       After Germany got over the novelty of having their own tiny preindustrial island, it decided to move in and get unpacking. They mercifully weren't insistent on displacing or bothering the native culture too much, but they wanted room for military stations around the islands and needed the infrastructure to connect them. The simple gravel walking trails connecting all of Yap's villages were awesome for bare feet and batcave-sized novelty coins, but were less than ideal for German road vehicles. The German government sent word out to all the village leaders that wider, modern stone roads needed to be implemented across the islands.       It isn't in doubt whether or not the elders got the message- it just seems unlikely that any of them gave a damn what their absentee foreign overlords wanted. There was very little incentive to appease these strangers, and months upon months went by without any sign of the tropical expressway the military was looking for. German officials, recognizing that no progress was being made, resorted to other means of motivating the locals. The callous Germans slaughtered the island inhabitants swiftly and brutally is what you expected me to say, because you, sir, are a racist, and shame on you.       These were turn-of-the-century bureaucrats, not Nazis, first off. Second, social disagreements didn't actually escalate into graphic violence at the rate modern flame-wars would have you believe. The Germans' solution was so simple and nonviolent it made Ghandi look like Manson. A few officials went around the Island, spray-painting sizable black X's on the biggest stone coins they could find. They then proclaimed, for all to hear, that these stones were now confiscated funds of the German government.       The people of Yap had been fined. Durable, modern-sized roads appeared in very, very short order. Upon completion, friendly German officials were dispatched once again- this time with solvents to clean the marks off the stones. The levied fines had been refunded. The people of Yap were manipulated, of course- but was their money manipulated, or was their belief? The Germans never took a thing away from the residents of the Island; they simply preyed on the peoples' willingness to play by their rules.       In their graciousness to be part of the larger world their European 'masters' presented, the people of Yap mistakenly believed that those paint-wielding officials' rules held real power over them. Forgetting that they themselves -the community- held power over their money, they let the ILLUSION of authority give a few bureaucrats REAL authority.       There's an altogether-different, and much-less-funny allegory at work there. In the world of Bitcoin we're beset on seemingly all sides by the spectre of government intervention. We have men and women of our own community crying out for recognition, permission, and regulation from various political masters- all out of fear. Bitcoin isn't being threatened by the government. We are.       Bitcoin is a protocol. It is not a place or a thing, and to call it international is still understating its virility. Bitcoin is apolitical. It transcends boundaries as if no boundaries existed. Law can claim about as much jurisdiction over Bitcoin as it can over wind and rain. It simply isn't all that vulnerable to governance. But WE are- and we're projecting our weakness onto Bitcoin by begging for political legitimacy. In threatening businesses and individuals over Bitcoin, bureaucrats are again painting marks on values that they don't respect. They CAN harm us as individuals, it's true; but we can't give them more power than they are due.       So long as we go back and forth between cryptocurrency and fiat currency, we are pinned under their thumbs. The more we trade in Bitcoin as a currency, and not a speculative medium for Dollar gains, the more freedom we secure.       Business and value are human creations, not political entities, and by seeking their approval and placating their whims we give them political authority over us. If we keep volunteering to play the Bitcoin game by their rules, we may eventually start to believe them. ...and then, Bitcoin won't be Bitcoin anymore. It'll be theirs.       The story of Yap and the eponymous ""Island of Stone Money"" was originally told in 1910 by anthropologist William Henry Furniss III. The subsequent 1991 revisiting of the subject by the Hoover Institution was researched and written by Milton Friedman.

42403680,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWpm,1576422000,"In 2019, Students Demanded Blockchain Education. In 2020, It’s Coming","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Danziger is the chief technology officer at the MouseBelt Blockchain Accelerator.      With startups and Fortune 500 companies in dire need of blockchain talent, and the average U.S. salary for a blockchain developer at $130,000, now is a good time for students to get an education in blockchain skills and a good time for universities to start offering blockchain courses. In 2019, we saw progress towards greater blockchain education, but there are still gaps that need to be filled.      Of the 70-plus+ student blockchain organizations we work with here at MouseBelt, only about a third have access to blockchain courses on campus. Several big rural institutions, like Indiana University, have groups of passionate students leading blockchain efforts, but receive little funding or attention from administrators.      The good news first. This year, The University of California system launched an initiative to support student blockchain innovation across their campuses, IBM is working with Columbia University on two blockchain accelerators, and Portland State offers an online Business Blockchain Certificate.      Meanwhile, the industry is also taking action into its own hands. Earlier this year, 13 major crypto projects came together to launch The Blockchain Education Alliance, an initiative to provide university students with the connections and knowledge needed to enter the fast-growing blockchain workforce. Additionally, a tech recruiting firm specializing in blockchain was launched to connect projects with talent.      What’s more, students are recognizing the enormous potential of the industry and demanding education for a way in. In the past year, student interest in blockchain education doubled compared to the year prior. The 70+ student-run blockchain organizations across 16 countries include some top higher education institutions including UCLA, UCSB, UC Davis, Duke, University of Chicago, USC, University of Wisconsin, and the University of Washington. These student groups aren’t just meeting to discuss blockchain. They are incubating their own projects and even consulting for local businesses.      This is just the start. As we look towards 2020, I believe we are going to see continued buy-in from university faculty and administrations. This will manifest through more accredited courses, more specialized degrees with blockchain focuses at all levels (BA, MA, MBA, PHD), more collaboration with industry among researchers and entrepreneurial organizations and more alumni funds that accept crypto donations.      I also believe we’ll begin to see education expand to underserved areas including the rural U.S, Latin American and Africa. Currently many of the available resources are concentrated in universities located in major cities. There are blockchain use-cases in industries such as mobile, agriculture, and energy that could have significant impacts in these underserved areas, so the need for education beyond big markets will only grow.      Blockchain technology is here to stay and the need for talent today and in the future has never been more clear. 2019 taught us that the next generation is enthusiastic to be part of this future, but need education to participate properly. While we’ve already begun to see signs, in 2020, higher education and industry players will need to fully buy-in, providing students more resources and education than before.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Galen Danziger,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/15/in-2019-students-demanded-blockchain-education-in-2020-its-coming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4a986a1b8ce582961feac348cdd6a37cf212674-1146x850.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42403677,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWlq,1576419832,"Even if a Thousand  Projects Don't Make It, Blockchain Is Still a Change Catalyst","Gartner, an IT research and consulting firm, came up with a framework to look at the stages of adoption and market enthusiasm of emerging technologies. Though criticized by some for being unscientific, the Gartner ‘Hype Cycle’ has caught on in popular culture. Where might cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology be now in that cycle compared with emerging technologies of the past?      Measured by market valuations, cryptocurrencies have experienced several booms and busts. The Mt. Gox-led boom and bust of 2012 to 2014. The ICO boom and bust of 2017 to 2018. And more recently the tokenization and Facebook Libra led boom and, dare I say, bust of 2019.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Gary Gensler is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, Co-Director of MIT’s Fintech@CSAIL and Senior Advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. He was formerly Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Under Secretary of the Treasury, and a partner at Goldman Sachs.    Market values are but one measure and don’t necessarily equate with underlying viability of an emerging technology. While expectations have waned, might cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology still be at inflated expectations? Many minimalists would contend so. NYU economist Nouriel Roubini isn’t alone with his oft-noted doubts about cryptocurrencies.      Might the field be bouncing along the trough of disillusionment, awaiting signs of viable use cases?      Joe Lubin, founder of Ethereum and ConsenSys, thinks so, finalizing the terms of his bet with Jimmy Song on the future viability of DApps. Song remains optimistic about the utility of bitcoin as a digitally scarce store-of-value, but remains decidedly a minimalist with regard to the viability of blockchain technology for other uses.      Through the mist of 2019’s hype of bold announcements, the crypto market’s ups and downs, and departures of hundreds of projects from the field, though, some ground-truths are evident.    Satoshi Nakamoto – whomever she, he or they are – solved the payments riddle, how to securely move value peer-2-peer on the internet while avoiding double-spending.  Money is but a social and economic construct.  Regardless of cryptocurrency viability, we already live in an age of digital money.  Append-only ledgers and multi-party consensus (a.k.a. blockchain technology) provide an alternative which can address verification and networking costs.  Adoption rests on addressing comparative viability and value proposition of use-cases.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have evolved into a speculative asset class.  A new form of crowdfunding, built upon smart contracts and ICOs, raised nearly $30 billion.  Crypto exchanges – not yet appropriately brought within public policy frameworks – have provided retail investors a direct way to trade crypto assets.  Crypto markets have been rife with scams, fraud, hacks and manipulation.  The potential this technology to be a catalyst for change is real.    This last point – crypto and blockchain technology acting as a catalyst for change - may not fulfill the heightened expectations of maximalists, but may be Nakamoto’s most enduring early contribution. This new form of private money and its underlying shared ledger technology already have been catalysts for central banks, big finance and big tech. Along with fintech innovations, crypto initiatives have spurred incumbents to update payment solutions and explore new approaches to finance and multiparty database management.      The People’ Bank of China’s Digital Currency/Electronic Payments project and the US Federal Reserve’s FedNow℠ Service real time payments projects both emerged in the wake of Facebook’s Libra announcement. Facebook’s ambitious initiative to create “a new global currency, which could meet the daily financial needs of billions of people” is spurring change even in the face of the many policy challenges it raises.      To many observers, the question remains what uses will cryptocurrencies and blockchain have beyond acting as a catalyst for change? Beyond bitcoin providing a scarce digital speculative store of value, and niche applications in digital exchanges, gaming, and gambling, what applications will be sustainable for cryptocurrencies as a new form of private money? What will actually benefit from the shared multiparty ledger systems facilitated by blockchain technology?      Actual adoption of crypto or blockchain technology projects rests on addressing comparative viability and value creation propositions. Foremost:    How will the technology’s decentralization actually benefit the use case’s economics?  How will governance and collective action amongst multiple parties be resolved?  What specific gaps or pain points would a native token fill compared with fiat payment system?  What are the benefits of any P2P transfers not facilitated by traditional systems?  What are competitors (both traditional and blockchain) doing to address purported pain points?  What are the tradeoffs of performance, privacy, security, governance & regulation?  How can broad adoption and user interface be realized?    Though literally thousands of projects have yet to land on broadly adopted use cases, I remain intrigued by Satoshi’s innovation’s potential to spur change – either directly or indirectly as a catalyst. The potential to lower verification and networking costs is worth pursuing, particularly to lower economic rents and data privacy costs, and promote economic inclusion. Further, shared blockchain applications might help jumpstart multiparty network solutions in fields that historically have been fragmented or resilient to change. Even in this slightly less ambitious form – acting as an innovative irritant to incumbents and traditional technologies – cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have already prompted real change and can continue to do so.      As an informed reader of CoinDesk, what do you think? Where might you place yourself on the scale from minimalist to maximalist? Where might the Gartner team put cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as we close out the 2020s?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Gary Gensler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/15/even-if-a-thousand-projects-dont-make-it-blockchain-is-still-a-change-catalyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86f97d6a9c02ec4ca6bf7a647e979576b3f19bed-1191x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWsj,1576404000,"At a Refugee Camp in Iraq, a 16-Year-Old Syrian Is Teaching Crypto Basics","How do you explain ethereum to someone who doesn’t know how to use email? What’s the best way to convey how many satoshis add up to a single bitcoin?      Those are among the questions faced by Yousif Mohammed, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee in Iraq’s Arbat refugee camp, who teaches other people in the camp about cryptocurrency.      “I want to solve a problem in my community. We have a lot of problems, like corruption,” he said.      Since he still has family left behind in Damascus, he’s particularly fond of the idea they could all earn and send money among their dispersed social networks, regardless of the borders that have increasingly failed them in recent years.      “People really need to know all the things about the internet and their phones and laptops,” he said. “We are in an advanced world and we should learn.""      Mohammed owns a small amount of ether, which he earned through a local education program run by the nonprofit Hello Future. It’s too little to spend, so he’s eager to earn more. Hello Future founder Charlie Grosso said she gave ether because it was less expensive than bitcoin.      Grosso said most of the students in Mohammed’s class think of mobile devices and computers like old-school Nintendos: They know they can play games or use a calculator, but are unfamiliar with access to global networks.      “The idea of searching to verify information is unknown to them,” she said. “They just don’t have that framework.”      Even with this steep learning curve, Grosso said all 44 teens that took her digital literacy class quickly grasped the concept of stateless, digital money. Perhaps this is because they are familiar with gold and other tangible assets. Plus, there’s no PayPal in Iraq because local banks are still restricted by economic sanctions.      In some ways, people who only know cash economies may be better suited to crypto markets than those who underestimate the value of social ties.    Mama bank    “Two years ago, I got my first phone. Now everyone in my family has a smartphone,” Mohammed said. “I like games like Minecraft because I can build things, design things and improve my English.”      Like many of the 9,000 residents in the camp, his unbanked family stores its wealth with the matriarch who runs the household.      Mohammed’s sister works at a bakery, his father is a carpenter and his brother works in a nearby town at a digital marketing agency (he even has a laptop). Each breadwinner turns over a salary to the matriarch, who doles out cash as needed to any member of the family. This is a common practice in the developing world, especially in times of economic turmoil.      “My mom is like the bank,” Mohammed laughed. “Cryptocurrency might be good for saving money because if you put your money inside a bank, the bank might steal it.”      Grosso said she hopes to graduate 100 students from her digital literacy course in 2020, further expanding the pool of crypto-savvy teens that can help their parents learn. Without their social networks, places like Arbat that lack crypto-exchange access will continue to be liquidity deserts.      “The way to deliver last-mile needs is by building out trusted sources from the community itself,” she said. “If the whole idea of decentralization is to be participatory, to self govern, then you have to start somewhere in delivering the tools to those it is meant to affect the most.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/15/at-a-refugee-camp-in-iraq-a-16-year-old-syrian-is-teaching-crypto-basics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e2e5789c7279a1087efcea5be9610b5d5feb6c5-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
