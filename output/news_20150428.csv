42398311,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTG9y,1430262012,Coinbase Launches Bitcoin Exchange in the UK,"Coinbase has launched its bitcoin wallet, exchange and merchant services in the UK.  The UK is only the second country, after the US, to gain access to the San Francisco-based company's bitcoin trading platform – Coinbase Exchange.  Coinbase  co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said the decision to launch in the UK was partly influenced by his trip to London last year.  “The interest in the UK is at a different level than it is elsewhere in Europe. We got the sense that the demand there was really high … [and] London is a financial capital of the world, so it was a logical next step,” he explained.  Exchange access  Users in the UK can now trade bitcoin on the Coinbase Exchange in two new currency pairs – BTC/GBP and BTC/EUR.  Customers are now able to add GBP and US dollars to their Coinbase wallets via wire transfer and can add euro using SEPA. The company’s merchant tools are also available in the UK.  The exchange launched in select states in the US three months ago and Armstrong said he was more than pleased at how well it has performed to date.  “We’re already the biggest exchange by volume in the US and number three or four in the world, depending on the data you look at. I think launching in the UK will help improve on that and increase the liquidity on the platform,” he said.  Banks and regulators  Armstrong said the two major issues Coinbase has faced when trying to expand into other countries are trying to get banks to cooperate and navigating regulatory environments.  The CEO explained his company has a banking partner in the EU region (although declined to name it), which agreed to support GBP payments.  He said working with regulators in the UK was time consuming, but he gave credit to the financial regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA):  “The FCA has been really great to work with. I think they’re being very forward thinking in this space right now. The UK regulators were very easy to work with and I think are setting a good precedent for how other countries should look at this.”  Ongoing strategy  Coinbase is in talks with regulators and banks in a number of other countries with a view of expanding access to its exchange and wallet even further.  “One of our goals is that we want to try to be, as a wallet at least, available in 40 countries by the end of this year, which is a pretty ambitious goal – we’re in 24 right now. But I think that will certainly be possible,” said Armstrong.  His company, which has raised a total of $106m to date, currently employs 105 people across the globe, boasts 2.1 million users and provides bitcoin payment processing services to over 39,000 merchants.  Armstrong explained that Coinbase’s strategy is threefold: “Our strategy is: Launch the exchange, make it the most liquid exchange in a bunch of different countries. Launch the API, make it easier for people to build all sorts of applications, and the third thing is our consumer wallet, so we’re expanding that to a bunch of developing and first world countries.”  He added:  “If we can get all of those three things done, I think we’re going to be able to help move the bitcoin ecosystem forward.”  UK image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/28/coinbase-launches-bitcoin-exchange-in-the-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f655118fcaf223898fef2a8d8f0298f71cc9583-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398318,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGGr,1430254835,Bitcoin Marketplace Purse Unveils 'Instant' Amazon Shopping,"Purse has announced 'Instant', a new product that aims to expand the appeal of its existing e-commerce marketplace while continuing its focus on Amazon shopping.  Launched in 2014, Purse now claims 32,000 users on its traditional 'Name Your Discount' marketplace, which matches individuals looking to buy bitcoin with a credit card and users willing to sell bitcoin in exchange for savings on Amazon purchases.  Purse co-founder Andrew Lee explained that Instant finds the company stepping in to play an active role on the formerly peer-to-peer (P2P) platform, purchasing Amazon gift cards from its market and holding a reserve of these assets for buyers who want items more quickly.  Drawing on a more familiar product as an example, Lee told CoinDesk:  ""Our model was like Airbnb, person to person. This is like if Airbnb said let's take the 100 most popular locations in San Francisco and just contract them out and offer them to consumers.""  In exchange for reduced savings, 5% as compared to as much as 20%, Lee said that Instant buyers will benefit from free shipping with Amazon Prime.  Lee went on to suggest the move was inspired by a need to improve the platform's user experience.  ""In terms of the delivery time, we didn't have much of a guarantee,"" Lee explained. ""Sometimes it would be one-two days, other times it would be two weeks. With Purse Instant we're taking out all those variables.""  Lee went on to suggest that he believes the move positions Purse to be at the forefront of using bitcoin as a means to penetrate the consumer deals industry while solving what he called the liquidity issues facing owners of Amazon gift cards.  ""Long-term vision, we have a unique value proposition enabled by bitcoin,"" Lee continued. ""If you think of those people who hunt for promo codes, you can skip all that now by just having bitcoin.""  The move comes amid a recent flurry of experimentation from the Roger Ver and Bobby Lee-backed team, which launched a bid to take its model into the physical world with a bitcoin-only retail shop in February.

42398319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGJo,1430249437,Bitcoin Community Rallies to Aid Nepal Earthquake Victims,"Nepal has dominated the headlines this week following a devastating earthquake, which at the time of press, had already claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people.  Just as swift, however, has been the charitable response.  The Red Cross  has committed an initial $300,000 of aid as well as an additional 19,000 non-food relief kits including essential items such as clothes and mosquito nets. Meanwhile, online fundraising platform Global Giving has already raised approximately $570,000 as part of an attempt to raise $1m to support victims.  Members of the bitcoin community, in Nepal and around the globe, have also rallied around the cause, seeking to provide both needed aid and a reminder of how bitcoin can help charitable efforts lower the cost of accepting international donations.  See Change Foundation  founder Erik Bouchard, for example, confirmed that his organisation has so far received over 100 bitcoin donations in 36 hours, ""ranging from $1 to $100 [per donation]"".  The Nepal-based charity is seeking donations to cover the costs of providing short-term housing units to those affected by the earthquake. More than 740 homes, he said, have been destroyed in his small district, at the epicentre of the quake alone.  ""People are still sleeping in the streets and open spaces,"" Bouchard added.  Donations will also be used to help pay towards a blood drive, medical care, transportation and lodging.  Grassroots effort  Bouchard was well-suited to tap this funding stream, noting that the decision to accept bitcoin donations via BitPay in November last year followed requests by the technology's passionate Reddit community.  ""Bitcoin has shown unbelievable promise for our work,"" he explained. ""We posted a note of what we did with the first $30 in bitcoin donations to r/bitcoin and over $2,000 came in from ChangeTip and website donations.""  The See Change Foundation is not alone in its efforts, though.  Bitcoin-focused non-profit, the BitGive Foundation, is accepting bitcoin donations on behalf of Medic Mobile's Nepal's office, which then cashes them out into fiat using bitcoin payment processor BitPay.  Medic Mobile  , co-founded by Josh Nesbit, a former pre-medical undergraduate student at Stanford University, offers a software that enables healthcare professionals to collect data, analytics and send messages in remote areas.  In a post on the BitGive Foundation blog, the team spoke about how the bitcoin community had previously been supportive of its efforts, writing:  ""The bitcoin community has already been so supportive of our efforts in the past and we'd be grateful for that support again. Every donation will go directly to our Nepal office and help us as we deploy the right technology to help [victims].""  International bitcoin aid  Companies in the international cryptocurrency space have also reacted to Nepal's earthquake by coordinating donation campaigns.  The American Red Cross, the official affiliate of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement is accepting bitcoin donations via bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip and processing the transactions via BitPay.  To donate on Twitter, users must first sync a bitcoin wallet and transfer the desired funds to their ChangeTip account. Once this is done, donors must mention the American Red Cross (@RedCross) and ChangeTip (@Changetip) and the desired donation amount, as follows:    @ChangeTip send $5 to @RedCross for #NepalEarthquake      — Yessi Bello Perez (@yessi_kbello) April 28, 2015    Kyle Kemper, head of tipping at ChangeTip, said that the American Red Cross was proving that it was a leader in innovation by leveraging social media, bitcoin and ChangeTip to procure donations in the digital currency.  ""They are just scratching the surface of the potential for this technology but we are hoping that the volume of donations and the money raised gets them thinking about the opportunities to leverage this technology not only in raising funds for relief but for distributing relief,"" he said.  Victoria Van Eyk, VP of community at ChangeTip took to twitter to announce the amount of bitcoin donations sent to the Red Cross so far – which at the time of press, stood at more than $3,000.    Community donations currently at 15.06790687 BTC as of this Tweet. For all you non-Bitcoiners, that's ~$3427.35 USD donated to @redcross! — Victoria van Eyk (@victoriavaneyk) April 28, 2015              The funds, while still a small part of the relief effort, however, are clearly appreciated, and as evidenced by on-the-ground reports, much needed.

42398310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGAx,1430244612,Nevada Regulators Seek Bitcoin Poker Site Operator's Arrest,"UPDATE (28th April 21:35 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information from the Nevada Attorney General's Office, as well as a copy of the formal complaint filed against Bryan Micon.      The Nevada Attorney General's Office is seeking to arrest the operator of defunct bitcoin poker service Seals with Clubs.  As reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Bryan Micon was charged in Nevada court on Monday with operating an unlicensed interactive gaming system. Micon is accused of failing to acquire the necessary licensure to operate Seals with Clubs.  If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and $50,000 in fines.  Seals with Clubs shut down in February, a move attributed to then-unspecified operational security concerns believed to be connected with a pending crackdown by state regulators. Micon later left the US for Antigua, stating shortly after the closure of Seals with Clubs that his home had been raided by agents from the Nevada Gaming Commission.  In a press statement, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt said that the charges were being brought against Micon in order to protect the state's gaming industry, noting:  “Operating or otherwise conducting gaming in the state without a license is illegal, and this office will aggressively pursue individuals and companies who seek to circumvent gaming regulations.""  During a press conference, according to the Review-Journal, it was revealed that an agent for the Nevada Gaming Control Board had gone undercover during an investigation into Seals with Clubs.  According to the release, the case is ""the first instance of state-level criminal prosecution in Nevada of an illegal Internet poker site using Bitcoin as currency.""  Complaint alleges unlawful operation  According to the complaint, Micon is accused of running an unlicensed gaming platform from March of last year until early February, when Seals with Clubs announced its closure.  The three-page filing states:  ""Between about March 1, 2014 , and February 9, 2015, [Bryan Micon] willfully operated, carried on, conducted maintained and/or exposed for play in the State of Nevada an internet gaming poker site under the name Seals with Clubs, without first procuring and thereafter maintaining in effect the required licenses.""  Micon's attorney Richard Shonfeld did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shonfeld further declined to offer more details when contacted by the Review-Journal.  ""Bryan has always maintained that he committed no wrongdoing, but I’m not in a position to comment on the Attorney General’s filing because I haven’t seen it,"" he said.

42398315,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGDu,1430233991,SEC Filing Hints at Overstock's Plan for Bitcoin-Based Securities,"Overstock.com, the online retailer currently developing decentralized stock market Medici, has outlined how it might issue digital securities in a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.  Submitted on 24th April, the S-3 form outlines Overstock’s intention to issue new stocks or securities. The offerings, according to the company, could amount to as much as $500m.  The filing also details how Overstock may seek to issue digital securities through an alternative trading system. Under a section entitled 'Risks Applicable to Digital Securities Offerings', the company states:  ""We may decide to offer securities as digital securities, meaning the securities will be uncertificated securities, the ownership and transfer of which are recorded on a cryptographically-secured distributed ledger system using technology similar to (or the same as) the distributed ledger technology used for trading digital currencies.""  The prospectus goes on to identify how the digital securities would differ from traditional securities, highlighting that settlement periods would be much shorter. In terms of risk, the company also acknowledges the ""novel and untested"" nature of the concept.  Overstock director of communications Judd Bagley suggested the filing fits into the company's broader plans to use the technology underlying bitcoin to power a new kind of stock exchange.  ""There are many parts involved in achieving this, and one of them is the Alternative Trading System we’ll be using to match buyers and sellers. In other words, an ATS is part of the Medici project,"" he said.  Details, risks  According to the prospectus, faster settlement times are one benefit of utilizing digitally-based securities. Overstock also pointed to the various risks associated with the concept, some of which parallel the challenges of holding digital currencies.  Notably, the prospectus outlines how, if implemented, the trading system would disclose certain types of investment information, explaining:  ""The number of securities, the purchase price paid for the securities and the public keys associated with the securities involved in each transfer of the digital securities from the first issuance of the digital securities will be permanently available to the public.""  The document also references the potential use of multi-signature technology, noting how ""any number of [private keys] may be required in order to authorize a transfer of ownership of the digital securities.""  Limited liquidity was identified as a key risk factor within a crypto-powered trading environment that could pose a risk to investors.  ""You may not be able to resell your digital securities on a timely basis or at all,"" the filing notes.  Medici work underway  According to Bagley, Overstock's work on the Medici crypto stock exchange continues. The project dates back to last year, when the company announced it had hired several Counterparty developers to build out the concept. Some later left the project.  Bagley noted that an alpha version of the exchange is currently being tested internally. Looking ahead, he said that Overstock will continue refining and polishing the concept:  ""Once we’ve demonstrated that this platform works for trading in digital equities, we’re going to continue iterating and adding functions that will make it resemble any other trading experience, except for the fact that trades will settle much more quickly and securely.""  ""The technology works,"" he added. ""It’s very exciting.""

The article has been updated to reflect this.      ""The greatest minds in cryptocurrency"" will come together to discuss bitcoin and the blockchain on billionaire Richard Branson's personal private island this May.  Taking place on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands from the 25th to 28th, the event will feature discussions moderated by Hernando De Soto, president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, Wall Street Journal senior columnist Michael J Casey and Matthew Bishop, US business editor for The Economist.  Branson has been enthusiastic in his praise for the bitcoin, having previously invested in payment processor BitPay and accepted the digital currency for his space travel enterprise Virgin Galactic.  The event's welcome message frames the gathering in terms that emphasise the lasting impact of blockchain technologies, stating:  ""Come visit with Sir Richard Branson on his private island for a set of intimate discussions highlighting critical issues and solutions and to lay out the framework for a world where the humankind is fully benefiting from the amazing technology behind the blockchain.""  Besides the Virgin Group founder, the event's hosts include BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov and venture capitalists Bill Tai, Suzi Mai and George Kikvadze.  In total, the event will include 30 luminaries from the bitcoin and larger digital currency space, including bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, Bitreserve's Juan Llanos, Tally Capital's Matthew Roszak and entrepreneur and Bitcoin Foundation chairman Brock Pierce.  The event is also the latest high-profile bitcoin conference to be held in the Caribbean following the Satoshi Roundtable in February.
