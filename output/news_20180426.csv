42428994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr15h,1524779136,Sony Eyes Blockchain Use for Digital Rights Data,"Japanese technology giant Sony is looking at using blockchain to store digital rights data.  In an application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Sony explains that current digital rights management (DRM) solutions that aim for interoperability ""may not be very reliable and rely on one unique point of failure. If the rights locker provider or system goes out of business or otherwise fails, the user loses all the acquired content.""  A blockchain could store the required identification information to ensure users could watch the products they purchase, according to the filing.  DRM systems refer to technologies that limit access to copyrighted materials only to those who purchase access. Sony cites UltraViolet, a cloud-based locker for digital rights, as one example.  The application was filed jointly by Sony and subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the document specifically cites movies as an example of the type of media the system could be applied to.  However, Sony also argues the blockchain-based system could manage rights to ""various types of content or other data, such as movies, television, video, music, audio, games, scientific data, medical data, etc.""  The application describes several potential implementations of the technology. In one, each user's rights are encoded on a dedicated blockchain. This ledger begins with a genesis block, which stores identifying information about that user. When the user acquires rights to certain content – by purchasing a movie download, for example – those rights are committed to the blockchain.  Concurrently, a ""DRM computer system would verify the rights in the blockchain and then decrypt the media when needed. This computer system can take different forms, including a ""DRM agent"" residing on a user's device, according to Sony.  As previously reported, Sony has been looking at other applications of the technology, including as a means to authenticate user data and manage education data.

Available market data  shows that CBOE saw its highest-ever volume for bitcoin futures since it first debuted the contracts back in December. 18,210 contacts for the May futures were traded, along with 703 for the June contract and 87 for the July contract. No volume was reported for the exchange's August-dated contract.  CBOE Options Institute senior instructor Kevin Davitt, in a social media video posted on Thursday, said that ""[the] average daily volume (ADV) runs about 6,600 in XBT Bitcoin Futures. Yesterday's volume was nearly three times ADV.""  He went on to explain:  ""Yesterday was the highest daily volume for bitcoin futures since their introduction here at CBOE nearly five months ago. The lead month May futures traded 18,210 contracts, and across the term structure a total of 19,000 bitcoin futures traded here yesterday. The previous high-volume session was January 17 with just less than 15,500 contracts traded.""  Wednesday's volume was an outlier among the past several days, as well as the results seen during Thursday's session. On Monday, XBT Bitcoin Futures traded at 3,881, rising to 6,653 on Tuesday. On Thursday, volume was reported at 5,634 contracts as of press time.  CME, according to market data, also saw a big trading day on Wednesday.  The exchange saw the volume of its bitcoin futures contracts market double on Wednesday from the day before, shooting past 11,000 contracts. Unlike CBOE, it was CME's April 2018 contracts which saw the bulk of the spike, according to its website.  The spike in January's volume coincided with the expiration of the first set of contracts, Davitt said. However, Wednesday's volume did not, nor did it have a 15-20 percent range in futures Davitt would otherwise have expected, he added.  ""We will certainly be watching to see if this is a volume aberration or if more and more institutional types are moving into crypto,"" he said.

42429005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Nh,1524769503,Ripple Says Sales of XRP Cryptocurrency Rose 83% In Q1,"San Francisco startup Ripple Inc. is reporting an uptick in sales for a cryptocurrency core to its product suite.  According to a post on the firm's site, released Wednesday, the company sold $167.7 million worth of XRP in the first three months of 2018, an increase of 83 percent compared to the previous quarter and of 2,400 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Ripple has long been closely associated with the open-source XRP Ledger, a technology on which it has built tools aimed at enterprise businesses.  The company further said direct sales of XRP totaled $16.6 million – a decline of 17 percent compared to the previous quarter. Programmatic sales of the cryptocurrency more than doubled, on the other hand, rising from $71.5 million to $151.1 million.  Tom Channick, Ripple's head of corporate communications, told CoinDesk that XRP sales ""exceeded our expectations.""  He added:  ""As a company, our strategy remains focused on signing up customers to use our technology and moving those customers into production. If we continue to do that, we will fix how money moves around the world.""  XRP's clout relative to the total cryptocurrency market grew in Q1, with its share of overall market volume growing from 5.3 percent at the end of 2017 to 6.9 percent at the end of March.  As for its share of total cryptocurrency market value, the report notes:  ""While the total market capitalization of all digital assets was the same on both November 24, 2017 and March 31, 2018, XRP's share of that market capitalization doubled, rising from 3.56 percent to 7.57 percent – a continuation of a trend that first began in 2017.""  XRP's price took off in late 2017, rising from less than $0.25 at the beginning of December to a peak of $3.84 in early January. The token's subsequent fall was just as steep, and within a month, it was trading at just under a dollar. At the time of writing, 1 XRP is worth around $0.82.  Ripple's first-quarter report also addressed the negative influence that a global regulatory crackdown, combined with uncertainty about the future, has had on cryptocurrency prices. It did not specifically reference Ripple's own regulatory questions, however, including whether XRP is a security.  Ripple markets XRP and other solutions to banks as a means to increase efficiency and reduce cost in payments, particularly those transacted across borders. The cryptocurrency has attracted a devoted following, but also a fair amount of criticism too, including questions about its degree of centralization and the pace of adoption.  Ripple has issued quarterly XRP reports since Q4 2016, when it soldhttps://ripple.com/insights/q4-2016-xrp-markets-report/ $4.6 million XRP directly to institutions.  David Schwartz, the startup's chief cryptographer, explained programmatic sales on Reddit in November, saying:  ""This is done by third parties that Ripple employs to use agreed algorithms to execute sales, usually by market making that is biased in favor of a net sale. Ripple does not have direct control over these sales and cannot adjust their timing on a short-term basis.""  Direct sales, by contrast, are conducted by XRP II, LLC, a registered and licensed money service business. The main buyers, the company has stated in the past, are financial institutions.  Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow accounts in December ""to create certainty of XRP supply at any given time."" The company released around 300 million of these XRP in Q1, which it says ""are being used in a variety of ways to help invest in the XRP ecosystem.""

42429004,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Lh,1524762360,Crypto Mining Made Up 10% of AMD's Revenue in Q1,"Cryptocurrency mining demand accounted for as much as 10% of AMD's first-quarter revenue this year, according to the chip maker.  ""The strength in Radeon products was driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in [the first quarter of] 2018,"" chief financial officer said Devinder Kumar during an earnings call on Wednesday after AMD revealed that it made $1.65 billion in first-quarter revenue, a 40% increase year-over-year.  Kumar noted that the combined gaming and blockchain demand contributed to a 95% boost year-over-year for its GPU and computing markets. That said, Kumar indicated that the company believes that it will see a ""modest decline in graphics [revenue] due to blockchain.""  All in all, AMD anticipates less than 10% of its 2018 revenue will come from cryptocurrency miners.  ""Based on the strength of our business momentum, for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20s[%] over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018,"" he said during the call.  Looking past the figures, however, CEO Lisa Su struck a somewhat optimistic tone for AMD's prospects in the blockchain infrastructure sector.  She remarked:  ""I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies. There are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don't see a significant risk of secondhand GPUs coming into the market. I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies, and, two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer.""  ""They're not necessarily buying just for mining,"" Su continued. ""I think, most people are comparing sort of this blockchain time period to the last one which was a couple of years ago and I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we've seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what's happening.""  The only unknown factor at play involves retail sales, as Su said it was ""hard to tell"" whether retail sales go toward gamers or miners. But even there, AMD believes it has a close approximation of the demand.  ""I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief,"" she later concluded.

According to CryptoGround, which monitors Mt Gox's remaining wallets, the bitcoins were removed from four separate addresses in increments of approximately 2,000, with 0 BTC remaining in each wallet that the funds were extracted from.  The wallets are under control of the exchange's bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Tokyo lawyer who also revealed in March that he had sold about $400 million of Mt Gox bitcoin and bitcoin cash in September of 2017. At present, the Gox addresses still hold roughly 146,106 BTC, blockchain data shows.  Additional network data  indicates that trustee holdings of bitcoin cash are on the move, with 16,000 BCH being sent over the course of four transactions.  Kobayashi is tasked with liquidating the tokens on behalf of Mt Gox creditors, most of whom have not recovered their funds after the exchange closed its trading operations in 2014. Yet the process hasn't been without controversy, given that the value of the bitcoins held by Mt Gox exceeds the amount claimed by the exchange's creditors.  Founded in 2010, the exchange boasted around 80 percent of global trading volume at its height. Since Mt Gox's closure, the exchange and its founder, Mark Karpeles, have been embroiled in legal battles, including class action lawsuits and embezzlement charges.  As CoinDesk previously reported, past sell-offs from the wallets have coincided with steep declines across the cryptocurrency market. Notably, a transfer of funds on February 5 was concurrent with a 50 percent decline in market value from January's all-time market capitalization high of $830 billion.

Having clocked a two-month high of $20.67 earlier today, OMG is now changing hands at $18.20 on Bitfinex – up 15 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, OMG's BTC-denominated exchange rate jumped to a seven-month high (highest since Sept. 30) of 0.0023466BTC.  The price rise may be associated with the OMG's listing today on Bithumb, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea. The token was alo listed on Zebpay, one of India's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, yesterday.  According to the chart analysis, though, the outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above $14.40.  Daily chart  The bullish triangle breakout indicates long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and has opened the doors for a retest of the record high of $28.50.  It's worth noting that the bullish breakout is matched by a 415 percent spike in 24-hour trading volume. So, the rally looks sustainable. Further, the momentum studies are biased to the bulls too, with both the 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA trending north.

Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $14.40 (April 21 low) would signal bullish invalidation. Meanwhile, a drop below $12 would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

42428987,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr0xh,1524744936,BBVA Issues $91 Million Loan Using Two Blockchains,"Spanish banking giant BBVA has completed a pilot that issued a €75 million ($91 million) corporate loan using two different blockchain technologies.  According to a report from the Financial Times on Thursday, the bank's latest exploration of the technology focuses on the entire issuance process, including negotiation of terms and signing the corporate loan. The system used for the trial is based on both a private digital ledger and the public ethereum blockchain.  The report said that, as as a first step, the pilot requires both the borrower and the bank to start terms negotiation on a privately held distributed ledger that simultaneously updates the transaction's progress on both sides.  As such, BBVA claims the system can reduce the negotiation phase from ""days to hours,"" following which the completed contracts are moved onto the ethereum blockchain for immutable record keeping, the report said.  The latest experiment expands BBVA's existing work in applying blockchain technology across a range of its business operations.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the bank has already tested a blockchain solution for paperless trade transactions between Europe and Latin America. And in October of last year, it moved to use distributed ledger technology to match the foreign exchange between itself and its Mexican subsidiary.  BBVA is not the only established financial institution investigating the technology's potential to streamline loans transactions.  Recently another two European banking giants – Credit Suisse and Dutch bank ING – also announced the completion of a live $30 million securities lending transaction based on a blockchain application co-developed with enterprise blockchain consortium R3.

During a financial earnings call on Thursday, Robert M. Yi, Samsung's executive vice president of investor relations, said the profitability increase seen in the firm's semiconductor business played a significant role in setting a new quarterly operating profit record of 15.6 trillion Korean won ($14 billion).  Yi explained the phenomenal rise, saying:  ""In the semiconductor business, the earning increases significantly year over year thanks to favorable market conditions driven by strong demands in server and graphic card memories as well as earning improvement in both the System LSI and Foundry businesses led by an increasing demand of chips used in flagship smartphones and cryptocurrency mining.""  While Samsung did not disclose precise figures for the mining chip side of the business, the positive figures follow a February confirmation from the tech giant that it was now producing 8nm and 11nm processors to meet growing market demand from the cryptocurrency mining industry.  Samsung's expansion into cryptocurrency mining also adds to the regional competition in the sector, with Taiwanese chip maker TSMC also reporting similar growth in mining chip demand during its own recent earnings call.  Looking ahead, Samsung forecast that the demand for mining processors will continue to expand in Q2, while the earnings of its LSI and Foundry businesses may decrease due to slowing demand for smartphone components.

42429007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr1Rh,1524738638,Bitcoin Risks Deeper Pullback After Drop Below $9K,"After an overnight drop, bitcoin looks to have found acceptance below $9,000 and risks a deeper pullback, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency hit a one-week low of $8,652 on Bitfinex earlier today and is now trading at $8,700. The 10-percent decline from the weekly high of $9,767 on Wednesday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  Further, the failure to hold above the key technical levels – descending (bearish biased) 100-day moving average (MA) of $9,126 and the double top bearish reversal neckline of $9,280 – will be discouraging for the bulls.  However, only a break below $8,459 would signal a short-term bearish reversal and open the doors for a deeper sell-off.  Daily chart  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Wednesday (trading range was wider than Tuesday's high/low), which, as per textbook rules, is a sign of sudden bearish reversal. That said, traders and analysts usually want to see negative price action on the following day, before calling a bearish reversal.  Accordingly, only a close (as per UTC) today below the key support of $8,459 (April 15 high) would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and open doors for a deeper pullback.  However, BTC is showing signs of a negative follow-through, as currently it is trading under the previous day's low of $8,765 – though the downside is capped by the ascending (bullish) 10-day moving average at $8,706 and the gradually ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-day MA.  4-hour chart  BTC may regain some poise if the bulls manage to defend the 4-hour 50-day MA in the next few hours. On the other hand, a failure to hold above the bullish 4-hour 50-day MA and 10-day MA would boost the odds of sustained drop below $8,459.  View  Confirmation of a bearish outside-day reversal would open up downside towards $7,823.  A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would signal a violation of higher lows and higher highs pattern (bullish setup) and would also mean the long-term descending trendline breakout has failed. In such a case, BTC could revisit the April 1 low of $6,425.  Bullish scenario  BTC will likely revisit $9,280 if the bulls manage to defend the 4-hour 50-day MA and 10-day MA in the next few hours.  Acceptance above $9,280 would expose the 200-day moving average, currently located at $9,853.

42428986,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLr0th,1524736811,IBM Partners with Jewelry Industry on Hyperledger Supply Chain Project,"IBM is collaborating with jewelry industry leaders to create a cross-industry supply chain tracking platform, the tech giant announced on Thursday.  Powered by a permissioned blockchain built on Hyperledger Fabric, the TrustChain initiative will facilitate the tracking of diamonds and precious metals as they advance from mine to market.  The consortium comprises a variety of industry businesses, with U.S. jewelry retailer Helzberg Diamonds, precious metals refiner Asahi Refining, jewelry manufacturer Richline Group, independent third party verification firm UL and precious metals supplier LeachGarner as members.  TrustChain will kick off by tracking six styles of gold and diamond engagement rings on the system.  Transparency and trust are at the core of the Initiative, IBM general manager of blockchain services Jason Kelley told CoinDesk in an interview, due in no small part to consumer demand for corporate responsibility and ethical consumption.  ""Consumers now have a high demand for trust in what they're buying,"" he said, noting that statistics show that most consumers – especially millennials – will pay more for brands and products that are sustainable.  However, Kelley said businesses stand to benefit from the initiative too. He compared the project to IBM's other supply chain initiatives for the food and shipping industries, for which blockchain pilots have rapidly reduced the amount of time required to track the origin of a product.  In the jewelry industry use case, businesses will be able to share data with one another in real time, streamlining the steps of the supply chain and reducing redundancy.  As a result, Kelley added,  ""You get an operating system that drives effective trust and innovation.""  ""And as you start to increase this effectiveness, you start thinking about what you're freeing up"" – namely capital, labor and time, he added. ""You're able to return that value back to the system and look at new ways to do business.""  As such, Kelley considers the blockchain the ""OS for trust and innovation.""  However, a lack of access to digital technology at crucial points in the supply chain – remote mines, for example – could encumber the TrustChain Initiative.  ""It's not the answer to all things,"" Kelley conceded.  Nonetheless, he suggested that the increasing ubiquity of smart phones across the globe means that this obstacle is likely only temporary.  In such instances of limited access to digital technologies, ""there obviously will be and has always been a challenge for connectivity,"" Kelley said. ""So we're not solving that small gap but we are allowing them to now connect into the blockchain when they have the connectivity.""  Initiative members expect TrustChain jewelry to be available to consumers by the end of 2018.

42428979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxnh,1524729646,"Barclays, Goldman Champion ISDA Standard for Blockchain Derivatives","Blockchains and smart contracts were supposed to fix the inefficiencies and slash the costs of derivatives trading, but two years since such promises came in vogue, a foundational issue has yet to be ironed out.  Before banks and traders can rely on a distributed ledger technology as the vaunted “single record of truth,” there first needs to be better standardization. Yet as it stands, they use a hodgepodge of data structures and formats to track the life cycle of trades, reflecting in part the variety of regulatory requirements imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.  Simply put, without a common language, there’s not much to be gained from having a common ledger.  Now, the financial world’s blockchain evangelists are pinning their hopes on a broader industry effort to harmonize the way data is presented and reported, regardless of the platform used. Known as the common domain model (CDM), it was proposed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in May of last year and has the support of blockchain tech startups such as R3 and Axoni.  But perhaps the biggest champion of CDM as the key to making blockchain a reality in the derivatives space is Barclays.  The U.K.-based bank recently set up an internal CDM adoption working group, and will be presenting its vision for how smart contracts can be combined with the concept Thursday at ISDA’s annual meeting in Miami, Florida.  It’s a pivotal time for the project, as ISDA is expected to release the first iteration of the blockchain-compatible version of CDM early this summer.  Sunil Challa from the business architect team at Barclays was emphatic about hitting the reset button.  “There is a shiny new technology promising to be a panacea for fixing many post-trade processing issues. So, now is an opportune moment to re-engineer our processes,” Challa told CoinDesk, adding:  “Simply replicating the existing fragmented state would be a colossal missed opportunity.”  A common tongue  Stepping back, Barclays has played a central role in the convergence of DLT, smart contracts and common data standards.  Two years ago the bank showcased a prototype of how smart contracts could be used throughout the lifecycle of a derivatives trade, including negotiating an ISDA master agreement, entering individual trades and performing the trades on a distributed ledger.  While the concept has caught on, the standards challenge remains in the way of adoption, according to Dr. Lee Braine, a member of the investment bank CTO Office at Barclays. On the one hand, distributed ledger platforms are now reaching acceptance by some of the most systemically important market infrastructure incumbents, Braine said.  “But what we haven't yet seen is adoption of common standards by the industry,” he said. “What we ultimately need in the derivatives space is multiple market infrastructures, including multiple clearing houses, adopting a common standard for data formats, reference data, transactional data, and business processes.”  That’s where Barclays and others believe the CDM comes in.  Traditionally, banks have worked to standardize the format of messages between them, but kept their own idiosyncratic ways of communicating data internally – like a country with a national language but numerous local dialects.  But, as Braine pointed out, the CDM and DLT share a common goal in going further and standardizing data within institutions. (Speaking the national language at home, as it were.)  In this way, the CDM could provide an alternative route for addressing the looming challenge of interoperability between different blockchain platforms. At present you often hear industry participants talk about being “blockchain-agnostic” because it’s too risky to bet on just one platform provider.  To illustrate this point, Braine described a future scenario in which banks are trading with each other on different distributed ledgers. If there are some counterparties on one network and other counterparties on other networks, then does that mean you would need to host a node on every network? Or are they going to be genuinely interoperable?  “A simplistic solution would be to revert to the traditional model of silos with messaging between them, but that risks replicating the fragmentation of the past,” said Braine.  “If you instead transition to the CDM, then at least there is opportunity to standardize on data structures, lifecycle events etc.”  And if that isn’t persuasive enough, Barclays estimates significant cost savings to the derivatives market. Its working group projected around 25 percent efficiency gains from adopting CDM just in the clearing space, and around $2.5 billion in annual run costs.  Regtech rising  Barclays isn’t alone among financial in advocating for the CDM, of course.  Goldman Sachs is also a supporter, and sees the common data standard, when combined with shared ledgers, as a way to alleviate some of the pressure created by the increased reporting requirements under regulations like the European Union’s MiFID 2.  Ayaz Haji, the technical architect for the MiFID 2 program at Goldman Sachs, said a common representation of product terms and lifecycle events should not only reduce inconsistencies but also provide a platform for further efficiencies.  The investment bank won’t rule out alternatives to blockchain in adopting the standard, however.  “Those who are closest to the CDM project recognize that a persistent shared implementation such as DLT would be the most optimal way to use the model,” said Haji. “That said we are also open minded about potential implementations and look forward to vendor feedback to the version of the model which is due to be published by ISDA shortly.”  Less equivocal than Goldman, Barclays is making a forceful case for using DLT in conjunction with the common standard.  For example, Braine also pointed out a way that a common data standard could amplify another benefit of blockchain.  A commonly pitched use case for the tech is the streamlining of regulatory reporting – the regulator can operate a node on the blockchain and pull data directly from it. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority has already tried this out, participating in a proof-of-concept for regulatory reporting of mortgage transaction data using R3’s Corda platform.  The problem is that in the current world, banks have their main trading data, and their risk models basically duplicate that and perform a simulation.  “If we were able to use a common domain model, we would be able to use exactly that same data. We wouldn't need to write two versions of what's going on, one just for the risk model,” said Braine.  Ultimately, though, reaching common standards, like implementing blockchains, is a team sport, and the game is still far from won.  Clive Ansell, head of market infrastructure and technology at ISDA, concluded:  “There is a fantastic opportunity ... but the level of success will depend on the industry operating to a common data and processing model.""

In a blog post published Thursday, Binance issued a response to a report yesterday which revealed that Zhao is currently facing a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court by venture capital giant Sequoia Capital.  As reported yesterday, the case stems from the collapse of negotiations for an investment in Binance by Sequoia. After the talks fell through, the VC firm brought the lawsuit against Zhao, accusing him of breaking an exclusivity agreement by talking to another potential investor IDG Capital in December last year.  ""Mr. Zhao denies all of Sequoia's allegations relating to the present dispute. As the substantive issues in dispute between the parties are subject to confidential arbitration proceedings, Mr. Zhao will make no further comment on the matter,"" the company said.

The post continued:  ""Sequoia obtained an ex parte injunction without notice against Mr. Zhao at the end of December 2017. After a hearing attended by both parties' legal representatives in April 2018, the High Court of Hong Kong has now determined that this injunction should not have been granted, as it had been improperly obtained and constituted an abuse of process by [Sequoia].""

42428983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxth,1524713468,The 17 Millionth Bitcoin Is About to Be Mined: What It Means and Why It Matters,"Bitcoin's limited supply is about to get a bit more limited.  Barring an unforeseen event, the 17 millionth bitcoin is likely to be mined in the coming day, data from Blockchain.info shows, a development that would mark yet another milestone for the world's first cryptocurrency. That's because as per bitcoin's current rules, only 21 million bitcoin can ever be created.  Stepping back, the milestone, the first million-bitcoin marker to be crossed since mid-2016, is perhaps noteworthy as yet another reminder of the technology's core computer science achievement – digital scarcity created and enabled by shared software.  In short, bitcoin's code, since cloned and adapted by scores of other upstart cryptocurrencies, ensures that only a set number of new bitcoins are introduced to its economy at intervals. Miners, or those who operate the hardware necessary to track bitcoin's transaction set, are rewarded with this scarce data every time they add new entries to the official record.  Still, there's a lot of variability in the process.  Of note is that it can't be precisely predicted when the 17 millionth bitcoin will be mined or who will mine it, due to the many minute variances that are created in keeping a common software in sync. That said, there's a relative predictability. Each bitcoin block produces 12.5 new bitcoin, and as bitcoin blocks occur roughly every 10 minutes, about 1,800 new bitcoin are created each day.  As such, it's perhaps best to view this event as a ""psychological barrier,"" Tetras Capital founding partner Alex Sunnarborg told CoinDesk, one that is interpreted differently by different communities.  Sunnarborg, for example, sought to stress that another way to interpret the result is that 80 percent of all the bitcoin that will be ever created have now been mined. In other words, only about one-fifth of the eventual supply remains for miners and future buyers.  Others see the milestone as one that's ripe for appreciation of the technology and its achievements.  ""I think it is awesome,"" Tim Draper, the venture capitalist who bought millions of dollars worth of bitcoin seized by the U.S. government at auction in 2014, said of the coming milestone.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I would bet the founders wouldn't have imagined how important bitcoin would become in their wildest dreams.""  Way with words  Others sought to suggest the milestone is one that should be considered as an opportunity for education about both the features of bitcoin, and those of cryptocurrencies broadly.  For example, unless all of the humans who operate the computers running the bitcoin software decide to make a change (a perhaps unlikely scenario today), there's really no way to ever introduce more new bitcoin. This achievement, a technical reality, has played a key role in bitcoin's association with money, economics and other scarce, naturally occurring assets.  In this way, the goldbugs and readers of Austrian economics who piled into bitcoin early on were quick to realize the value of the feature, perhaps giving rise to the term ""cryptocurrency"" itself.  Trace Mayer, one of this group's most vocal members, summed up the philosophy in a recent tweet, in which he argued governments might seek to prevent users from holding bitcoin in the future.    ""Increasing money supply is a means to confiscate through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation or due process of law,"" he wrote.    Even the new way new bitcoins come into being, called ""mining,"" is a nod to the gold analogy.  Rather than being issued by a central bank, bitcoin is created by a network through the work of maintaining the blockchain. When a miner finds a valid hash for recent transactions, solving the bitcoin protocol's puzzle, he or she is rewarded with a ""coinbase transaction,"" bitcoin credited to her account.  A little bit of cryptocurrency is created and deducted from the final supply.  The bitcoin supply curve  How participants have been rewarded has, of course, changed over time.  When bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin block on Jan. 3, 2009, he created the first 50 bitcoins. This reward stayed the same for another 209,999 blocks, when the first ""halvening,"" or reduction in rewards, took place.  It didn't come as a surprise. Every 210,000 blocks, according to a hard-coded schedule, the network reduces the block reward by 50 percent. Following the most recent halvening, in July 2016, the reward is 12.5 bitcoin.  That means that while there are only 4 million bitcoin left to mine, the network will not reach its final supply in anything like the nine years it's taken to get this far. As the halvenings halven, the rate of monetary inflation - supply growth - slows.  BashCo, a pseudonymous moderator on the r/bitcoin subreddit, has plotted the trajectory of bitcoin's total supply (blue curve) against its rate of monetary inflation (orange line).  Source: BashCo.  Assuming the bitcoin protocol remains the same (a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average and the halving schedule and supply cap are unchanged), the last new bitcoin will not be mined until May 2140.  The next 120 years  With this in mind, the chart hints at another common talking point when acknowledging the milestone – that bitcoin is programmed to run for a very long time.  Jameson Lopp, lead infrastructure engineer at wallet provider Casa, was quick to remind CoinDesk that bitcoins are divisible, and that as such, the smallest parts of each bitcoin can hold seemingly infinite value.  He said:  ""While 17 million BTC may sound like a lot, it's incredibly scarce - there won't even be enough for every current millionaire to own a whole bitcoin. Thankfully, each bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis, thus there will always be plenty to go around!""  But there are other quirks to the software as well.  For one, bitcoin will never actually reach 21 million units, partly for mathematical reasons, partly because miners have not always claimed the full reward. On May 17, 2011, for example ""midnightmagic"" claimed a 49.99999999 block reward, rather than an even 50.  Further, to be clear, bitcoin does not stop running when 21 million bitcoin are produced. At that point, the idea is that miners would be compensated purely through the fees, which they already collect. (Though some scientists have sought to project whether such a market would work in practice).  With so many questions left unanswered, if anything, the event serves as yet another reminder of how far bitcoin has come, and just how far it has to go.  In the words of long-time developer Adam Back:  ""Another million down four more to go.""  A more detailed explanation of the bitcoin's supply and digital scarcity can be found here.

Gemini will use Nasdaq's SMARTS Market Surveillance offering to automatically detect any possible price manipulation or other illicit activities, according to a Wednesday's announcement.  Nasdaq currently uses this technology to monitor its marketplaces for abnormal activity. Part of the system compares historical trading data with real-time activity to look for ""unusual trading patterns that could be potential breaches of exchange trading rules and practices,"" as Nasdaq explains.  The cryptocurrency exchange will use it to monitor its major trading pairs for bitcoin and ether, particularly the crypto-to-crypto pairings and those involving the U.S. dollar. Additionally, any suspicious activities tied to bitcoin futures contracts will also be sought out.  Gemini chief executive Tyler Winklevoss said the move is part of the exchange's efforts to maintain a fair market. He explained:  ""Since launch, Gemini has aggressively pursued comprehensive compliance and surveillance programs, which we believe betters our exchange and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole ... Our deployment of Nasdaq's SMARTS Market Surveillance will help ensure that Gemini is a rules-based marketplace for all market participants.""  Stepping back, Gemini has been making efforts in recent weeks to expand its exchange. In March, the company announced it may add additional cryptocurrencies – naming bitcoin cash and litecoin in particular – to its platform later this year.

42428975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLqxdh,1524704458,Fitch Ratings: Blockchain Is a Potential 'Game-Changer' for Insurers,"One of the ""Big Three"" credit rating agencies thinks blockchain is a ""game-changing technology.""  Fitch Ratings touted the potential uses for blockchain within the insurance industry in a report published Wednesday, saying ""insurance is fertile ground for blockchain's capabilities.""  In particular, the company sees blockchain as a tool for streamlining the transactions companies conduct while simultaneously reducing instances of fraud, according to a press release posted alongside the report, which wasn't publicly available as of press time.  Those benefits are likely to be felt in the long-term – sometime in the next three to five years – whereas the short-term implications are likely to be minimal. As well, the tech is unlikely to impact the credit ratings of affected firms before that time, according to Fitch.  As Fitch explained:  ""Efficiencies and cost reductions could be achieved by reducing the need for reconciliation and audits, automating certain processes and improving access to data. Estimates of the potential savings for the global (re)insurance industry from Pricewaterhouse Coopers and B3i, an insurance industry trade group focusing on blockchain, range from 15 percent to 30 percent of annual current expenses.""  That being said, the company also noted that ""the uncertainties around this nascent technology remain pronounced."" In particular, it is unclear how widely blockchain technology will be adopted, and whether the pay-offs of using a platform built around the tech will outweigh the initial investment.  ""There are numerous legal, regulatory and security issues that need to be addressed to facilitate wide-scale adoption,"" Fitch wrote, adding that: ""...the ultimate viability of the technology for the insurance industry will depend on a select group of industry leaders adopting blockchain to gain competitive advantages.""
