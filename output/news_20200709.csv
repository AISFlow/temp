42384062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0K5N,1594327894,"Market Wrap: Stocks Tick Downward and so Does Bitcoin, to $9,200","Bitcoin is back at $9,200 Thursday as crypto derivatives helped push its price down and equities closed lower.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,211 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 2.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,154-$9,469  BTC below 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bearish signal for market technicians.    When stocks overall trend lower, it often leads to bitcoin prices dropping, said Karl Samsen of Global Digital Assets. He added that as public companies continue to release their dismal quarterly business results, equities will drop even more. “We’re seeing a W-effect in terms of the COVID-19 reopening” of the economy, he told CoinDesk. Thus, the stock markets aren’t performing well Thursday.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed flat, eking out a 0.40% gain as transportation and real estate stocks pushed up the index.  Europe’s FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.7%. Rolls-Royce stock fell 11% on poor first-half financial results.  The U.S. S&P 500 was in the red 0.56% as losses in retail hammered the index, even while tech stocks were mostly up for the day.    Read More: Bitcoin Started Moving in Sync With S&P 500, Volume Dropped, in June      As spot bitcoin headed lower Thursday, the cryptocurrency derivatives market saw its first excitement in a week as sell liquidations popped up on BitMEX. Traders who were long bitcoin saw over $20 million in BitMEX positions exited as price dropped on the spot exchanges such as Coinbase.      Meanwhile, traders continue to place fewer bitcoin option bets, a sign they don’t expect crypto volatility to return – at least not yet, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of exchange Alpha5.      “When volatility is much lower, as it is now, there is no natural game,” said Shah. “It’s not worth it to sell options down here, and hence activity comes to a standstill,” he added. Indeed, the volume on options market is much lower, and the amount of traders using the commodities exchange CME for bitcoin options have dried up in July.      “Honestly, it is frustrating for all of us – lower volatility and a narrower range,” said Christopher Thomas of cryptocurrency broker Swissquote. “We’ll likely explode out of it at some point. We need a trigger.”      Nevertheless, things change, especially in uncertain times, said George Clayton, managing partner of New York-based Cryptanalysis Capital. “Crypto never stays in one place for long,” Clayton said. “I don't like the technical picture, but a big move in either direction wouldn't surprise me.”    Curve's value on the rise    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Thursday, trading around $239 and slipping 3.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The total value locked in Curve is $71 million, the second-highest for a decentralized exchange, or DEX. Curve is used to quickly trade between stablecoins and has $12 million in daily trading volume, just behind Uniswap for DEXs.      Peter Chan, a trader at Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant, says Curve could see increased volume due to traders moving out of USDC and into other stablecoins amid recent news that CENTRE, the consortium behind USDC, froze $100,000 worth of the token in one account at the behest of an unspecified law enforcement agency.

New York prosecutors alleged in April 2019 that Bitfinex lost $850 million in client and corporate funds, and then used money from affiliated stablecoin Tether to cover the loss. Bloomberg first reported the ruling.      iFinex, which operates both Bitfinex and Tether, argued the funds had been deposited with a Panama-based company and were later seized by authorities in different countries. The firm had earlier also said it has been working to recover the funds seized by the Portuguese, Polish and American governments.      In its decision, the appeals court rejected the argument that tether was neither a commodity nor a security, and affirmed the stablecoin falls under the court’s jurisdiction.      “Not even virtual currencies are above the law,” New York Attorney General Letitia James told CoinDesk in a statement.      As it’s headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands, Bitfinex had also argued it does not fall under the jurisdiction of state authorities and doesn’t cater to local traders.      The court rejected the argument on the grounds the Attorney General’s office was seeking documents going back to 2015, and iFinex had permitted New York customers to trade on the Bitfinex platform until January 2017. In addition, the court noted some of the firm's executives had been based out of New York.      “We will respect the court's order.

42384059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0K1b,1594320517,I'm a Syrian Refugee. This Is How Bitcoin Changed My Life,"Tey Elrjula is a tech entrepreneur, a refugee and the author of ""The Invisible Son,"" now available for pre-sale.      Bitcoin is good for whatever you need. I’ve used it to order pizza and to build a fulfilling career, despite all types of hardships.      I’ve been using bitcoin for years because my family needs it, not because I enjoy speculative trading. In 2013 I was introduced to cryptocurrencies while working with software engineers in the Netherlands. My idea was that if we created money from code, then money would become a way of communication and its value would represent the community.      See also: The Truth About Bitcoin and Hezbollah in Lebanon      I used to send money from the Netherlands to my family in Lebanon twice a month, and the fees were killing me. Even worse, the long waiting lines at money transfer shops were torture. There are still a lot of insurmountable restrictions on money transactions, especially those that exclude large populations around the world.      For example, a sizable segment of people in Saudi Arabia doesn’t have residence permits and are not able to transfer money to their families in countries such as India or Pakistan. Bitcoin doesn’t have those restrictions or involve exorbitant transactional charges.      Later in 2013, I started a Facebook group on bitcoin. I moderated the page and had discussions with many of the 10,000 people who came there, most of whom were from Egypt. I met a lot of interesting people in that group, such as Abdullah Almoaiqel. Abdullah is now the co-founder and partner of Rain, which is the first regulated digital currency exchange in the Middle East. The company is based in Bahrain and operates from Bahrain and Egypt.      Then, in 2014, everything started going wrong. My European residency card expired at the end of that year and there was a war going on back home. People said Hezbollah, the local militia, was fighting to keep ISIS out of Lebanon.    Technology is helping us live in a world where we need to trust less and verify more.    Half of Syria was flooding into the Netherlands back then, and smugglers were active on the other side of Europe. I bought a small book to teach me how to pray in Islam, then started to practice my prayers and listen to the Koran. I also started listening to Sayed Hassan Nasrallah’s speeches, his recitals and calls to fight alongside Hezbollah in Syria. I was surrendering to my fate of being deported to Syria or Lebanon.      Sleepless nights went by, with the Facebook pages continuously broadcasting images of the brutality of war in Syria. I did not want to be part of this.      On Sept. 11, 2014 , 500 migrants lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea attempting to cross to safe land. It was at that moment I realized how blessed I was to be in Europe, and I surrendered to the idea of becoming a refugee.      Meanwhile, I kept working on the Facebook page I ran with a top Egyptian software engineer and early adopter of bitcoin. The Egyptian bitcoin users kept me busy. I chatted with a lot of people and answered their questions on the mining process, price speculation, buying bitcoin and selling it. They knew I was moderating from Holland, but didn’t know I was now partially undocumented.      I turned 30 in the camp and lied to my parents, telling them I was in my nice European apartment waiting for the immigration authorities to renew my residency. Nobody knew I was living alongside the other Arab refugees in a camp except me.      Refugees do not have IDs, so they can't have bank accounts. They don’t know anyone in the Netherlands, not yet at least. Bitcoin became an even bigger part of my professional work. The constant exposure to crypto landed me translation jobs for reporters who were covering bitcoin stories.      On sunny days, I earned a few hundred euros as an escrow agent connecting buyers and sellers of bitcoin. In July 2015, I earned a technical expertise certificate from the University of Nicosia and registered on the bitcoin blockchain. Finally, I was credentialed, a professional and no longer a hobbyist.    Slowly my Bitcoin identity was overcoming my refugee identity.    The general public looks at the Bitcoin network as a gambling game in which you can lose all your money. Many meetups were starting to appear in the Netherlands. I started working as a speaker. One such event in the Netherlands was called Bitcoin Wednesday, held on the first Wednesday of every month. Slowly, my Bitcoin identity was overcoming my refugee identity.      For years to come and every time I come out onto a stage, I would ask people to put their hands in their pockets and take the coins out. In return I would give them bitcoin for the same amount. Why? Because the best way to understand bitcoin, especially after they hear the pizza story, is to use it.      Money and identity have been hand-in-hand for centuries, yet I used bitcoin without an identity. Besides my email, I did not need anything to use money and transact digitally. However, I do need an identity to present myself to the world and interact with services like education and diplomas, health care and vaccines, travel and airline tickets. Technology is helping us live in a world where we need to trust less and verify more.      I have travelled to more than 20 different European cities and a few in the Middle East delivering keynotes, public presentations and leading workshops showing organizations the digital future of education, money and business where it is built on principles of don’t trust, verify.

42384054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0JvJ,1594317415,Tron Arbitration Challenged in Hostile Work Environment Lawsuit,"A legal challenge is calling on a court to overturn an order allowing the central organization developing the Tron cryptocurrency to privately litigate a lawsuit through arbitration.      Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek, employees fired from the Tron Foundation last year, filed a writ of mandamus with the First District Court of Appeal in California in San Francisco on June 17 to reverse arbitration in a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and hostile work practices at BitTorrent, a file-sharing service acquired in 2018 by the Tron Foundation. In March the San Francisco Superior Court approved the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent's request to settle the lawsuit in arbitration instead of in court.      “We are confident the Court of Appeal will give due consideration to the legal issues framed,” one of Hall and Juraszek’s lawyers in the lawsuit, William Fitzgerald of Fitzgerald Law Offices, said in an email to CoinDesk.      See also: Major Crypto Firms Including Binance, Civic, Tron Targeted in Flood of Lawsuits      Unlike an appeal, where an open-ended judgment on a civil or criminal case’s final outcome is rendered potentially after several years, a writ of mandamus decides within months whether a court fulfilled or violated its obligations.      The writ of mandamus says the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent submitted inadmissible documents supporting an arbitration agreement that contained illegal contractual terms. According to the writ of mandamus, the San Francisco Superior Court acknowledged the arbitration agreement was “unconscionable,” or skewed to favor the employer, but sided with the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent anyway.      The San Francisco Superior Court ruled the arbitration agreement was valid as long as the employees saw, and took the initiative to sign, the paperwork. Hall and Juraszek responded in February to the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent's motion to compel arbitration by claiming they had not read or were not permitted to negotiate the agreement.      The lawsuit alleges Tron's CEO, Justin Sun, and Tron head of engineering Cong Li assaulted Tron personnel during office meetings, favored Chinese employees and harassed Hall and Juraszek for alerting the company to pirated content and child pornography circulating on BitTorrent programs. The alleged retaliation campaigns involved Sun and Li demoting and firing Hall and Juraszek, who had above-average scores on performance reviews, and tampering with their personnel files and corporate email accounts to orchestrate a cover-up.      Hall and Juraszek filed the lawsuit in October after reporting the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), a state labor agency that handles employment discrimination and harassment. The California DFEH in October gave Hall and Juraszek permission to file the lawsuit after they chose to move their complaints about the Tron executives and entities to a court of law.      The incidents allegedly occurred at the Tron Foundation’s San Francisco office, the site of the Tron BitTorrent team. The Tron Foundation is headquartered in Beijing, China.      “We believe the Court issued a detailed and well-reasoned order compelling Mr. Hall and Mr. Juraszek to arbitrate their claims against Rainberry under Rainberry’s legally compliant arbitration program,” Ellis Liu, a spokesperson for the Tron Foundation, said in a statement to CoinDesk. BitTorrent was renamed Rainberry in California corporate records following its $120 million sale to Sun and merger with the Tron Foundation.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Ada Hui,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/09/tron-arbitration-challenged-in-hostile-work-environment-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c2da3b4529d95d6f9bae8d1b97d17c14ff9afb7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the report, June was the most uneventful month for bitcoin (BTC) trading since February as a lack of market activity brought down trading volume to a four-month low of $36.6 billion.   In light of the subdued market and low volatility, bitcoin saw a price drop of 4.4%, the lowest monthly change since August last year.   The report also found that in a reversal of trends from earlier this year, bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 turned “substantially more positive” and climbed to 0.65 in late-June.   In the same month, bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with gold slipped below the 1-year average and hit a low of -0.49.   According to the report, bitcoin’s reversal in correlations with gold and S&P 500 made it behave less like a safe-haven asset and more like a traditional financial asset amid a global stock market recovery during June.   The report says market participants for bitcoin should now pay closer attention to the 30-day forward looking volatility index for the S&P 500 (VIX), and that if BTC is going to break the multi-year macro down-trend, it would need to climb above $10,500 and trigger an upward trend.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/09/bitcoin-started-moving-in-sync-with-sp-500-volume-dropped-kraken-says-in-june-volatility-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74fa15ce65ec646827b0f63e01dc585203eae376-1200x730.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's official Chinese business registry now lists Nangeng Zhang as the company's sole director.  Zhang's title has also changed from chairman and general manager to executive director and general manager.  He joined Canaan as CEO in 2015.  Four executives in total – Co-chairman Jianping Kong, founder and CFO Jiaxuan Li, non-executive director Qifeng Sun and public affairs director Songhua Tu – have been removed from the registry.  All but Songhua Tu had previously been listed as company directors.  Both Kong and Li are still listed on the registry as part of Canaan's ""core team.""  According to the registry's changelog, the update took place on July 6.  Sources speaking to Chinese media said Canaan is wracked by an internal struggle between Zhang, who is based in Beijing, and the directors at the company's headquarters in the southern city of Hangzhou.  It's unclear what's behind the dispute, but there's speculation it could be over Canaan's long-term strategy.  Some have compared the takeover at Canaan to the bitter conflict currently raging between the two co-founders of rival bitcoin miner maker Bitmain.  Bitmain's Micree Zhan and Jihan Wu have been struggling over who controls the company for months.  Canaan reported a net revenue loss of nearly $150 million in 2019 and another loss of $5.6 million in Q1 2020.  Listed on Nasdaq, Canaan's share price has more than halved since the bitcoin halving event to under $2 at press time.  Canaan has not yet updated the Securities and Exchange Commission with the changes in senior management.  The last significant filing was the company's annual report on April 15, which still lists the original board of directors.

42384051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0JqH,1594299600,Binance Labs Leads $1M Seed Round in Crypto Tor Alternative HOPR,"Binance Labs, the incubation and seed funding arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has made its first investment this year, backing decentralized privacy startup HOPR.      Announced Thursday, Binance Labs led a $1 million seed round in HOPR, which has also received funding from Focus Labs, Spark Digital Capital, Caballeros Capital and Synaitken. The seed round followed a fellowship award the startup received last year from BinanceX, the exchange’s early-stage developer platform.      The investment in HOPR, which takes data privacy to the next level with a token-incentivized mixnet solution, was a long time in the making, explained Binance Strategy Officer Gin Chao.      “The team from BinanceX met HOPR over a year ago at Paris Blockchain Week, and we have got to know the team,” Chao said in an interview, adding:    “We will be making much fewer investments, and these are the sorts of projects we will be focused on, in areas that we feel have a sort of immediate product-market fit.”  Beyond Tor    Chao said data privacy has proven value in traditional markets as well as crypto, and HOPR also has the right kind of credentials – with a token sale on the way and plans to become a legally recognized decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in Switzerland.      “I think it’s the right type of problem to be solving at this time and HOPR’s solution is a great fit in terms of the ethos of blockchain and having an eventual decentralized organization with a token to address the problem,” Chao said.      HOPR is not another on-chain privacy solution for blockchain transactions, explained HOPR co-founder Sebastian Bürgel, but a general network-layer protocol to allow users to exchange data privately, in the same vein as Tor (the onion router) or a virtual private network (VPN).      The idea to incentivize participants with tokens to enhance the privacy of a network is not entirely new; the Ethereum-based Orchid protocol does this, too.      Read more: Orchid Tops $43 Million Raised in Token Sale for Crypto Tor Alternative      The problem, said Bürgel, is that when any two computers are communicating, many third parties – such as telcos and internet service providers (ISPs) – are privy to that data, not to mention a host of metadata.      Data transmitted via the HOPR network “hops” from one relay node to the next, where each participant mixes that message with other traffic before sending it on.      “Anybody can participate and be paid for the service of relaying traffic and thereby creating privacy for you,” said Bürgel. “You are paid in HOPR tokens similar to how miners get paid ETH on Ethereum.”    Monetizing privacy    In terms of what participants can expect to earn from relaying and mixing on HOPR, Bürgel said this would be difficult to estimate, not the least because the network will not be centrally controlled in any way.      “We imagine this is going to be a kind of marketplace,” he said. “I think it should be something that is comparable to a VPN subscription, which is an order of like $10 a month, so for some reasonable usage it should be in that range.”      Read more: Start9 Labs Pitches a Private At-Home Server. And It Works      Bürgel pointed out that VPNs have a history of leaking private data and also selling and monetizing that data, while Tor’s onion encryption doesn’t really do a good job of metadata privacy, and a particularly large data packet can be tracked going through the Tor network.      “HOPR packets all look the same,” said Bürgel. “There’s a lot of cryptography under the hood, but basically HOPR packets are indistinguishable from one another and we are also mixing packets, so that brings significantly more privacy than Tor could offer.”      The network is still in the testing phase, but a medical data use case has been explored involving data transmitted between a hospital and a cloud provider. Another useful avenue involves regulatory requirements such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and also things like the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule” requirement.      “HOPR is perfectly positioned to deal with GDPR and to facilitate the exchange between regulated custodians, and we have been talking to Switzerland’s OpenVASP about this,” Bürgel said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/09/binance-labs-leads-1m-seed-round-in-crypto-tor-alternative-hopr,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57ac1d931416c4869fd5358d9d2237cab67896a4-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0K47,1594295517,First Mover: Pie Anyone? DeFi Pushes ETF-Style Investing Toward Decentralization,"Entrepreneurs in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance have used cryptocurrency technologies to build automatic systems that might someday challenge or even supplant traditional banks and exchanges.      Now, DeFi is taking on the asset-management industry, and already launching a range of investment products designed to capitalize on its own success.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      One such project is PieDAO, a so-called decentralized autonomous organization conceived and developed by a group of DeFi developers headed by Berlin-based DexLab. Earlier this year PieDAO raised around 2,250 ETH (~$600,000) for digital token DOUGH in a pre-seed round. The network went live in March, just as bitcoin and most traditional financial markets like stocks were crashing due to the spreading global pandemic.      The PieDAO platform, a decentralized application built atop the Ethereum blockchain, produces its own incarnation of digital tokens called “pies.” They work like tokenized investment funds whose value is linked to a basket of other digital tokens, which in turn are sourced from a decentralized liquidity pool known as Balancer.      In April the project rolled out its first pie, called BTC++, which is backed by tokenized versions of bitcoin. And stakeholders in the project have since pushed out a second pie called USD++, backed by U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins.      But PieDAO's first real push toward full decentralization started last month, when investors were allowed to start buying DOUGHs directly from the project in exchange for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, with a minimum deposit worth roughly $500. For now, DOUGHs aren’t publicly traded.      Such tokenized vehicles have been described by analysts as the digital-asset version of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, a type of investment vehicle in traditional financial markets that can be traded like stocks.      “It’s very fascinating to see more experiments to re-invent financial applications we have never seen before,” Soravis Srinawakoon, co-founder and CEO of Band Protocol, a cross-chain data oracle for the DeFi space, wrote in a Telegram message.      PieDAO isn’t the first ETF-like provider for the digital asset space. The Set Protocol, also on Ethereum, allows users to invest or even create their own baskets of assets called “Sets,” which like Pie are fully tokenized. Another option, according to a report Monday from the cryptocurrency analysis firm Delphi Digital, is the sDEFI token from Synthetix.      But PieDAO takes the tokenization concept a step further, since the DOUGHs give holders the ability to influence the investment vehicle’s management - on matters ranging from the weight of the underlying investment indices and methods for asset-rebalancing, to the level of fees charged and when to pay out a cut of those fees.      The issuance and transfer of the DOUGHs works to democratize the governance of the investment vehicle, roughly analogous to the way shareholders can own stock in a money-management company.      So far, only 131 addresses hold DOUGHs, covering the original token holders - including founders, core developers and early investors - as well as new buyers, according to block explorer Etherscan.      DexLabs CEO Alessio Delmonti, who, according to his LinkedIn profile, previously worked as a mobile-app developer, told CoinDesk in a direct message via Twitter the plan is to sell DOUGH tokens currently held in a reserve fund to new buyers. The goal is for 75% of the total supply to be distributed by early 2021, up from just over 50% now, he said.      “Ultimately it is up to the DAO to vote the proposal in for final distribution,” Delmonti said. The project’s white paper still hasn’t been published because it’s still in “active writing and currently under consideration of the community,” he said.      PieDAO’s community members are already holding discussions on plans for new pie tokens, according to Delmonti. There’s a Google spreadsheet that summarizes some of the proposals, including new pies backed by baskets of DeFi-related assets such as tokens from the ChainLink, MakerDao and Compound projects.      “PieDAO is an interesting solution which essentially combines DAOs and DeFi, to create a new way to manage and create crypto index funds,” analyst Alex Gedevani wrote in Monday’s Delphi Digital report.      While still small, DeFi is one of the fastest growing corners of the digital-asset industry. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications – a proxy for how much money is actually put into the systems – has roughly tripled this year to the equivalent of about $2.1 billion, according to analytics site DeFi Pulse.      This market exuberance has contributed to a doubling this year in ether’s price. Lender Compound saw its market capitalization shoot up to $1 billion within a week of its public release last month from less than $10 million initially, according to CoinGecko.      Skeptics of the projects have also pointed to the risks of putting money into these little-tested tokens, which can be prone to malicious exploits along with rampant speculation and mispricing.      The PieDAO tokens already trading have benefited from this year’s gains in cryptocurrency markets; that’s true for BTC++, for example, because its price generally tracks bitcoin.      For now, the project is still tiny even by the standards of the nascent cryptocurrency industry; the market value of BTC++ is about $1.4 million currently, and it’s $2.7 million for USD++. For comparison, bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, has a market value of about $173 billion, and No. 2 ether is $27 billion.      The cryptocurrency industry is replicating businesses long dominated by Wall Street and banks, from margin loans and derivatives trading in digital-asset markets, to blockchain-based payment and lending systems. Asset management is another frontier; the thinking is that many ETF-style investment vehicles will eventually be tokenized for trading in faster, cheaper and more customizable digital-asset markets.      And the cryptocurrency industry isn’t waiting around, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission having thus far refused to approve a bitcoin ETF.      ""Instead of ‘trusting’ a single authority like an asset manager, you are trusting the wisdom of the crowd with these decentralized autonomous organizations,” Srinawakoon said. “Is it proven? No. Is it interesting and can potentially be disruptive? Yes.”    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,368 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,475 | 24-Hr Low: $9,286      Trend: The path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side.      The cryptocurrency is trading near $9,400 at press time, having jumped 2% on Wednesday to confirm an upside break of a falling channel, represented by trendlines connecting June 1 and June 22 highs and June 2 and June 15 lows.      The bearish channel breakout indicates the downward move from the June 1 high of $10,429 has ended and the bulls have regained control. The cryptocurrency has also flipped the widely-tracked 50-day moving average (MA) resistance into support. The MA is currently located at $9,373.      The breakout is backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the 14-day relative strength index. Further, the MACD is now producing higher bars above the zero line, a sign the upward move is about to gather steam.      As such, one may expect bitcoin to challenge the resistance at $9,800 (June 22 high) over the next few days. Acceptance above that level would expose the June 1 high of $10,429.      The bullish case would be invalidated if the spot price drops below the 10-day SMA, currently at $9,373.

42384060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0K2r,1594293518,Bitcoin Option Traders Bet on Bullish Move Following Volatility Squeeze,"While bitcoin has gained 3% so far this week, the overall trading environment remains dull, with volatility hovering at multi-year lows.      Ten-day realized volatility, a historical metric, is now at just 20%, the lowest level for two years. That's ""a low that's only preceded in [September and October] 2018,” the Singapore-based quantitative trading firm QCP Capital said on its Telegram channel.      Back in the autumn of 2018, the low-volatility consolidation ended with a big drop to below $6,000. This time, though, options traders are anticipating a breakout on the higher side.      ""With the rise in one-month implied volatility this past week (on the back of more call buying) resulting in a notable divergence with realized volatility, a similar bang to end the lull is what option traders are betting on (this time with an upside break),"" said QCP Capital.      Bitcoin’s one-month implied volatility has risen from 46% to 55% over the past six days, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Implied volatility is the market's expectation of how risky or volatile an asset will be in the future and is calculated by taking an option and the underlying asset's price along with other inputs such as time to expiration.      Meanwhile, the one-month realized volatility has declined from 78% to 35%. Realized volatility represents the price volatility that has actualized in the past.      The recent divergence between the two metrics is indicative of traders pricing in a transition from a low-volatility to a high-volatility trading environment over the next few four weeks.      Implied volatilities are primarily driven by the net buying pressure for options (calls/puts). The latest pickup looks to have been fueled by increased demand for call options or bullish bets, as noted by QCP Capital.      That is evident from the fact the one-month, three-month and six-month put-call skews are reporting negative values. Put-call skew measures the price of puts relative to that of calls.      The one-month skew has dropped sharply from 11% to -5.4% this week. Negative values indicate that call options (or bullish bets) are drawing higher prices than put options (bearish bets). So, in effect, options traders are leaning bullish right now, with calls in greater demand.      It remains to be seen if the multi-week-long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000 ends with a bullish breakout, as expected.      Also read: London Stock Exchange Parent Assigns Financial ‘Bar Codes’ to 169 Cryptos      The technical charts are also backing that scenario. For instance, the cryptocurrency breached a month-long falling channel on the higher side on Wednesday, signaling an end of the pullback from highs above $10,400 seen July 1.      Further, the MACD histogram, a momentum indicator, has crossed above zero in favor of the bulls.

42384047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0JmV,1594290656,"Ferrari, McLaren and $15M in Crypto Seized as Chinese Police Bust Arbitrage Scam","Chinese police have seized over $15 million in crypto and supercars worth $2 million from the alleged operators of a novel scam that sold counterfeit tokens.      In an article published Thursday, China's Ministry of Public Security, which oversees the country's police forces, said police in the city of Wenzhou has arrested 10 individuals suspected of operating the fraudulent scheme.      The criminal case is the first in China where victims were allegedly scammed using blockchain smart contracts to generate fake cryptocurrencies, the ministry said.      Police seized amounts of the bitcoin, ether and tether cryptocurrencies with a total worth of over 100 million yuan, or $15 million. They also seized cars, a Ferrari and a McLaren, was well as luxury villas owned by the suspects.      The case was first reported to the police by a victim, identified by his surname Li, in April. Li had joined a group on the messaging platform Telegram called ""Huobi Global Arbitrage HT Chinese Community.""      The group had advertised a blockchain smart contract claimed to be able to generate Huobi Tokens (HT), Huobi exchange's own cryptocurrency, that could yield an arbitrage opportunity with a return of 8%, the victim said.      ""Simply put, you send one unit of ETH to a designated address, you will receive 60 HT. And then you can sell it to gain the difference,"" Li reportedly told the police.      The police said in the ministry's report the price of HT on July 3 was at $4, while ETH was at $227. That created a purported $13 profit for every unit of ETH sent by a victim.      However, after Li sent 10 ETH to the ethereum address provided by the Telegram group's administrator, the 600 HT he received were fake tokens and could not be deposited for selling, at which point he reported the case to the police.      To be clear, there is no suggestion the Huobi exchange had any involvement with the scam.      The ministry said the suspects created dozens of similar chat groups with over 10,000 fake accounts to make potential victims believe that the scam was a legitimate arbitrage opportunity.

The police acknowledged this is a new type of crime in China, but did not specify exactly how they located the suspects or if they used on-chain analysis to track down the blockchain transactions that were involved in the case.      In recent months, Chinese police forces have become more experienced in tracking down crypto transactions that may be tainted by illegal activities, such as online gambling, money laundering or economic fraud.

42384049,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0JrX,1594288800,London Stock Exchange Parent Assigns Financial 'Bar Codes' to 169 Cryptos,"It’s not quite a seal of approval, but one of Europe’s largest financial markets is giving cryptocurrencies the equivalent of the bar codes found on soup cans and jam jars.      Late last month, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) added 169 digital assets to its SEDOL Masterfile service, a global database that assigns unique identifiers to financial instruments. The assignees included digital currencies (such as bitcoin), “digital platforms” that allow issuance of multiple assets (such as Ethereum) and security tokens. The seven-digit alphanumeric codes help LSEG’s customers keep track of traded assets from execution to settlement.      The addition of bitcoin and its ilk to the database, in response to customer demand, is a sign that institutional investors are slowly embracing the asset class.      Read more: Introducing the CoinDesk 20: The Assets That Matter Most in Crypto      “Naturally with the gradual institutionalisation of digital assets, a number of our clients were starting to invest in that space, so we felt it was an appropriate time to add these to SEDOL,” said LSEG’s Head of Data Solutions, James Nevin.      He was quick to add that assigning a code does not add any particular legitimacy to any digital asset.      Last year, the company’s main operating subsidiary, the London Stock Exchange (LSE), licensed its Millennium Exchange trade-matching technology to build AAX, a virtual assets exchange based in Hong Kong that went live in November.    Time-tested taxonomy    Market participants use SEDOL Masterfile to identify individual securities across asset classes including stocks, bonds and exchange-traded derivatives worldwide.      The service was created 30 years ago as a registry of codes to identify securities traded on LSE, said Nevin.      Since then, it has grown to include identifiers for over 100 million securities traded all over the world, including U.S. municipal and corporate bonds.      Read more: Crypto Lender Nexo to Enter Prime Broker Race, Enlists Chainlink for Audits      “Within that 100 million, there are about 20 million that are active,” Nevin said.      If a company is liquidated or acquired, it disappears in reality but the SEDOL code is kept active to make sure it isn’t reused, and LSEG can “retain full corporate action history” of those securities, Nevin said.      LSEG worked with data provider Digital Asset Research for the last three years to create a vetting process for cryptocurrencies and the like.    Issuer? What issuer?    Normally, with stocks or bonds, customers have the ability to log in and create SEDOL codes within the system, instantly, said LSEG Senior Project Manager Laura Stanley. For the time being, users will not be able to do the same for digital assets, given that this untamed territory is rife with dubious investments.      “Due to the fact that it is a new asset class, there is an eligibility criteria for inclusion,” Stanley said.      The SEDOL Masterfile is made up of an issuer table, a security table and a markets table that are linked together. Cryptocurrencies are hard to shoehorn into this framework given their leaderless nature.      Read more: Copper Now Enables Funds to Create Complex Crypto-Backed Securities      “Not having an issuer does potentially create some challenges but we have managed to get around that by displaying a digital asset, where it doesn't have an effectual issuer, we display it at the issuer level and at the security level so that it’s easier to locate within the SEDOL Masterfile,” Stanley said.      The digital assets are categorized based on their primary function, Stanley said. Digital Currencies (XA) like bitcoin function as a medium of exchange or store of value, and Digital Platforms (XB) like Ethereum allow the creation of smart contracts to facilitate, verify and uphold an agreement between parties that is then recorded on a blockchain. LSEG has also added Security Tokens (XC) under financial instruments.      “That is the way we have chosen to do that today. In the future, we could increase the granularity based on customer feedback,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/09/london-stock-exchange-parent-assigns-financial-bar-codes-to-169-cryptos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9bfc8918378e9e278c96fa5697deda2c976b281-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Charlotte Campbell, director of Fundraising and Operations at CHUF, the charity first considered accepting crypto donations after one of its donors, Dan Bainbridge, suggested it. Bainbridge also pledged $10,000 in BAT as a donation. In an emailed press release, CHUF said the donations had been made using The Giving Block, a service which enables non-governmental organizations to accept cryptocurrency donations.      CHUF provides support to patients from the Children’s Heart Unit at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital and had first made an appeal for funds online back in April, when the U.K. went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted the charity’s regular fundraising activities. According to Campbell, while the charity had earlier received a one-time bitcoin donation from Bainbridge in 2017, this is the first time CHUF has publicly appealed for donations in cryptocurrency.      “I had a heart operation when I was a baby,” said Bainbridge, saying he received a lot of support from people at the charity back when he was about 18 months old. “I had always thought that if I have any success, I’d like to give back.""      Bainbridge, the founder of a crypto focused venture capital fund BigBirdVC, also said he had helped connect the charity with The Giving Block’s platform.      According to CHUF, apart from Bainbridge’s contribution, another large donation was made by an anonymous donor. The individual donations were matched by the platform’s COVID-19 relief campaign, bringing the total amount donated to about $48,000.      “Even though donations through cryptocurrency are more popular than ever, it is rare to see donations of this size from individual givers,” said Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, in the emailed statement, “We are delighted that this money will be used to help Heart Families in the U.K.”      According to Campbell, opening up to crypto donations has given the charity access to a completely new audience.      “It's given us exposure in the U.S., which we have never had in the past,” she said.      The charity uses the donated money to provide meals for the patients' families, to acquire new medical equipment and to buy toys for the children, among other uses.      Currently, CHUF accepts crypto donations in bitcoin, ether, zcash, Gemini dollar, BAT and Litecoin.",POSITIVE,BAT,BAT | BTC | SPONSORED | ZEC,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/09/childrens-heart-charity-receives-48k-in-crypto-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3cf9ff7c7105b86bf22913a85d75ca57dc8ffd5-1200x765.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBG7h,1594281600,Cannabis and Lending Firm Seeks SEC Permission to Raise $50M in Crypto Sale,"Chicago-based firm Ceres wants to build a ""seed to sale"" transaction network for cannabis on the blockchain using its dollar-backed stablecoin – if the digital security is approved for sale by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Launched in 2017 by West Point graduates and former U.S. soldiers Greg Anderson and Charlie Uchill, Ceres recently filed paperwork with the SEC to conduct a Reg. A sale, seeking permission to sell both a token and a coin. The token would represent an equity holding in the company, but the firm plans to use the coins as an actual transaction tool in its payments network. According to the application, the firm plans to sell up to $30 million worth of its tokens and $20 million in Ceres coins.      In addition to its plans to build a payments network, Ceres also markets itself as a lender for legal cannabis businesses, though Uchill – the company’s chief operating officer – said Ceres has yet to disburse any loans, and is counting on the digital securities sale to raise capital.      The firm’s SEC paperwork also notes that token holders, as a group, shall be entitled to receive 80% of the firm’s net revenues from its loan business and 20% of net revenues from the blockchain-enabled payments system.      “We have been working with the SEC for 18 months,” Uchill said, referring to the process of getting approval to sell the firm’s digital securities. “I tell investors that we lost every battle with the SEC to win the war to have SEC approval.”    Value proposition    As for the firm’s proposed transaction network for the legal cannabis industry, Ceres’ filing claims that its blockchain based network would improve transparency and aid compliance with regulations against money laundering and fraud. But the success of the blockchain network would also largely depend on producers, investors and consumers warming up to its stablecoin.      Uchill said the only time actual dollars would have to be used under the firm’s model would be when consumers paid Ceres to get its coin, and when loans were given out to producers. All of the other transactions among consumers, dispensaries, and producers would involve the firm’s coin.      According to the firm’s SEC filing, upon approval Ceres anticipates that it will target its marketing and sales efforts primarily in the states of Illinois and Washington where the firm “has identified certain strategic business opportunities,” related to its payment network, coins and tokens. Washington was the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijiuanan in 2012, and Illinois legalized it this past January.      The firm’s application also notes that there is currently no trading platform available to sell the company’s tokens, and that it remains uncertain whether one will be available in the future. As an alternative, the firm suggests that it might conduct the sale on its own website.      Awaiting SEC approval for its securities, Ceres hopes to capitalize on the growing legal marijuana industry in the U.S., estimated to be $13.6 billion in 2019, according to Investopedia.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/09/cannabis-and-lending-firm-seeks-sec-permission-to-raise-50m-in-crypto-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cd976b4c241b6638319bd2831e225ca0ce9dccf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
