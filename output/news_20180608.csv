42380798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zU8z,1528489117,The Crypto Community Isn't Sad or Surprised By R3's Reported Woes,"Distributed ledger startup R3 is reportedly running low on cash – and judging by the social media response, the crypto-community isn't showing much sympathy.  Fortune  reported Thursday that R3 is facing a cash crunch, coming just over a year after the company announced a $107 million funding round to ""bring blockchain services to the financial sector"" (though per the publication, $98.2 million of that amount constituted ""new money"").  Charley Cooper, a managing director for R3, ""did not provide any specific figures but told Fortune that the company exceeded its revenue targets last year and will provide an update at the end of this calendar year,"" according to Fortune.  R3 first launched in 2014 with the stated goal of applying the technology underpinnings of blockchain to the finance sector, culminating in the launch of their distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform Corda. Its consortium attracted a number of big-name supporters including Wall Street banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.  But R3 later ran into headwinds, losing JPMorgan and Goldman, among others, as consortium members in 2017, as reported by CoinDesk.  Fortune, citing two former employees at R3, reported that the company could be out of money by early next year even with the recently raised $107 million funds. One of them added that the number was also likely ""overstated"" as it ""included consulting fees from prior years that R3 reclassified as equity under terms of its partner agreements.""  Yet in a tweet published Friday, R3 indicated that its finances aren't a concern.    We're flattered by all the attention, but really, we're fine ☺️ pic.twitter.com/4u9LuInIab        — R3 (@inside_r3) June 8, 2018      What the community is saying  For some observers, the reported problems represent a kind of comeuppance in light of comments from R3's executives about bitcoin.    These are the guys who said ""The Bitcoin experiment has failed""    These are the guys who said ""No Blockchain, because we don't need one""    Again and again, the legacy banking and corporate world will fail to understand Bitcoin's fundamental value proposition.https://t.co/F5XVNcewdA        — Beautyon (@Beautyon_) June 7, 2018        For people new to the space wondering why anyone cares: many of R3's execs aggressively derided bitcoin for *years*, and really spearheaded the backwards ""blockchain not bitcoin"" nonsense. https://t.co/sojfrTJykA        — Dan McArdle (@robustus) June 7, 2018      One observer honed in on R3's alleged big-spending ways.

42380812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUMp,1528485632,Bank of Italy Official: Central Banks Not Ready to Issue Digital Currencies,"Central banks aren't ready – at least in the short-term – to handle the implications of launching wholly digital currencies, the deputy governor of the Bank of Italy said Thursday.  Fabio Panetta delivered the keynote address for the SUERF and BAFFI CAREFIN Centre Conference held at Bocconi University. In his remarks, he became the latest to discuss the possibility for central banks to issue currencies digitally, including those that incorporate elements of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or some of the concepts that underpin blockchain.  At the same time, Panetta began his keynote by distancing the conversation from cryptocurrencies.  He was quoted as saying (according to a transcript of his remarks published by the Bank of International Settlements):  ""In fact - just like banknotes - a [central bank digital currency (CBDC)] would be a liability of the central bank and would be backed by its assets. It would be supported by the credibility of the central bank and ultimately, by the rule of law. Crypto-assets, on the other hand, are a liability belonging to nobody: there is no asset that backs them up and no clear governance structure that can guarantee trust… the value of a CBDC would not suffer from the excessive volatility that affects crypto-assets.""  Of course, by this logic, CBDCs would continue to suffer from the same volatility created by the potential for government intervention on monetary policy, a concern that has been previously linked as a cause for individuals seeking out crypto-assets like bitcoin.  Knowns and unknowns  Panetta did point out other advantages of CBDCs, though.  For example, he highlighted the lower costs of managing digital currency as opposed to a physically distributed currency.  ""Since it would be completely dematerialized, a CBDC would have very few or no storage costs and would be a convenient way for households and firms to keep liquid wealth. Mattresses could be freed from their role of vaults!""  Moreover, CBDCs would be an asset ""free of credit and liquidity risk.""  Such effects in his view would not ""necessarily be disruptive for banks."" However, a number of other key issues surrounding digital currencies very well might.  For example, Panetta asked whether digital currencies should be traceable or ""designed to guarantee, to the extent possible, anonymity."" On this, he raised ethical concern for a future where banks are able to trace all consumer transactions and make decisions on an individual's creditworthiness based on such information.  ""If central banks decided to make an asset – the CBDC – free of credit and liquidity risk, possibly remunerated, and available to anybody at no cost, their role in the economy would fundamentally change… Are central banks ready to play this new role and to deal with the attendant complexities? In the short term my answer is no.""  In the long term, the answer is unclear but Panetta affirmed the benefits of research to uncover the answer are certain and, ""here to stay, independently of whether one day we will live in a world with digital cash.""

42380816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zURr,1528482643,Inside the Sprawling (Ongoing) Vote That Will Decide When EOS Launches,"Almost one week after initiating, one of the largest, strangest experiments in global crypto governance hesitated as it neared its culmination.  While EOS, a new blockchain created by Block.One, which raised approximately $4 billion to build it over the past year, had effectively turned the code over to its users as of last Saturday, into Friday, the fruits of that effort suggest a lack of clear process is holding back progress.  At least two votes that could have ended with a version of the software launching actually took place (based on CoinDesk's view of an unofficial stream of the decision-making). Assembled were candidates vying to become EOS ""block producers,"" or the entities able to process transactions and claim the network's rewards.  The first vote was deemed invalid, but it had enough votes for a ""go."" The second was deemed valid, but it failed to meet the agreed-upon threshold for launch.  Still, expectations are high for the next launch vote in the coming hours.  Here's what we know:  All indications suggest its members are very likely to vote ""go"" at the next meeting, which begins at 1:00 UTC.  That meeting should be livestreamed on EOS GO's YouTube channel, according to EOS New York.  EMLG holds a ""go-no go"" vote at a meeting that happens every 24 hours. The vote to go has to reach a threshold of two-thirds-plus-one of validator candidate organizations present. When a ""go"" vote happens, the network should go live in approximately 12 hours.  The chain will be declared active after 15 percent of token holdings have been voted to establish the first set of 21 block producers.  Changes on the ground  As profiled by CoinDesk, one of the unanswered questions surrounding the project was just how EOS block producers would be chosen and what influence they would have on the process. Already, this has reared itself in surprising ways (with groups jockeying for bigger roles).  The organization leading that launch is the EOS Mainnet Launch Group (EMLG), a coalition of groups who have set themselves up to be block producers.  Once live, EOS holders will vote on which candidates get a spot as a block producer. There will be 21 block producers, and they will be paid out through inflation in EOS tokens (much like bitcoin's miners). But, there may be as many as 200 groups vying for one of those spots.  So, even if the idea competing softwares could be created has been ruled out, there's still a decent amount of uncertainty.  For example, a validator candidate out of Hong Kong posted an update of the call on Twitter last night, which shows some of the other issues discussed before the vote.  In the EOS New York Telegram channel, after the vote, a leader in the group, Kevin Rose, wrote the following:    ""Here is what happened: the voting process was an absolute mess. We need to create a process. Beyond that, Dan [Larimer] introduced doubt when he questioned going live without EOSIO 1.0.2 being released.      Because the voting was a mess, we don't understand what the reasons for 'no-go' were.""    The EMLG held a check-in meeting this morning as it prepared voting for tonight's meeting.  Voting trouble  But while who will be who in this post-EOS world isn't clear, we do have a lot of information about the voting process. Last night's meeting, one of many held over the last week to unite potential global users, lasted roughly three hours.  CoinDesk was watching live through the last hour or so, as the first vote was tallied and the second vote happened amidst discussion. Discussion and voting were never separated, with some participants still asking clarifying questions while the vote took place. As Rose suggested above, there was no clear, pre-established process for verifying that each person who voted was actually a candidate validator nor to make sure that each candidate organization only voted once.  Consensus on the call held that the first vote, to go, was not valid due to confusion by participants. One challenge facing the group is that all votes have to be translated for candidates in non-English speaking areas.  A subset of participants committed to create a sign-in based voting system within the livestream platform they were using, in order to ensure that voting would be straightforward, each organization could only vote once and no non-block producer candidates voted.  New EOS update  Information was also discernible about the role of the company behind EOS.  While Block.One committed to a diminished role in the EOS launch, and to refrain from voting on proceedings with its tokens, founder and CTO Dan Larimer showed up on the EMLG call to answer questions.  He noted Block.One plans to publish an update very soon, bringing the EOS software to version 1.0.2. This was described as a soft update, dealing with issues such as bugs in the whitelist and blacklists for smart contracts. Multiple block producers said that soft updates should have no impact on the protocol in production and in fact it wouldn't matter if some ran on 1.0.1 and others ran on 1.0.2.  But the announcement appeared to engender uncertainty, which Rose confirmed multiple times on EOS NY's Telegram channel.  In a statement also shared on that channel, a block producer candidate wrote it had voted ""no-go"" because its team had found errors with account creation and transfer finality. CoinDesk was not able to authentic these statements.  One group within the EMLG has expressed caution throughout, and the block producer candidate out of Hong Kong, HKEOS, was one of its first members.  That group's Twitter feed affirmed its ""no go"" vote last night, writing:  ""This is short-term pain, for long-term gain.""

42380820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUVd,1528477261,Another Investor Lawsuit Claims XRP Is a Security,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has been named in yet another lawsuit tied to the XRP cryptocurrency, court records show.  Investor Vladi Zakinov filed a class action lawsuit on Tuesday, naming Ripple Labs, XRP II – the company's licensed money services business – CEO Brad Garlinghouse and 25 anonymous persons as defendants. The complaint was submitted to the Superior Court of California in the county of San Mateo.  Zakinov's claim centers around the allegation that the XRP token is a security controlled by Ripple. The suit states that Zakinov bought XRP in January 2018 and ""was damaged thereby.""  He argued in the complaint:  ""XRP, despite its name as a 'token,' is actually a security under California law. In particular: (i) Ripple uses the funds it raised from the sale of XRP to fund its business ventures; (ii) the Company indiscriminately offers XRP for sale to the public at large; (iii) plaintiff and the Class (as defined herein) are effectively powerless to control the success of Ripple and XRP; and (iv) plaintiff and the Class members' investment is substantially at risk and is without nay security.""  The filing went on to assert that Ripple and the other named defendants ""were required to register XRP when offering or selling it,"" but they did not. Further, the suit claims, the defendants ""made a series of improper statements which drove up the price of XRP,"" which helped Ripple receive greater returns from selling the token.  However, the suit continues, the investors lost money – and have the potential to continue losing money – because XRP owners cannot control Ripple.  A spokesperson for Ripple strongly pushed back against the lawsuit's claims when reached.  ""This is just another example of an extortionist bringing forth an opportunistic suit that lacks merit. We feel confident that the claims regarding XRP are completely unfounded both in law and fact,"" the representative said. A request for comment sent to Zakinov's attorneys was not immediately returned.  The news comes just days after CoinDesk reported that former Securities and Exchange Commission officials - chairwoman Mary Jo White and enforcement head Andrew Ceresney - were representing Ripple Labs in another class action lawsuit filed in May by investor Ryan Coffey. That case also alleged that XRP is a security, and court records show that the case is still ongoing.

The exchange may also issue futures products for ICOs, if there is a demand, Afanasiev said, adding ""we're working on a possible structure of such futures now.""

The country's National Tax Service launched an investigation into the firm back in January amid a wider crackdown on crypto exchanges, and has now cleared the company of wrongdoing. However, Bithumb – one of South Korea's biggest exchanges by trading volume – now faces a bill for back taxes that totals around 30 billion won (almost $28 million), according to local news source eToday.  A tax official was quoted as saying:  ""The [National Tax Service] has conducted a tax investigation against Bithumb for the 2014 to 2017 business years. I know that Bithumb has decided to pay the related taxes without any objection to the imposed tax amount.""  ""No charge of tax evasion was found, so prosecution charges against tax portal were not carried out,"" the official continued.  The exchange has reportedly said it is yet to receive a formal notice about the final tax liability.  The South Korean authorities have been intensifying their actions against the country's crypto exchanges since late last year, moves that followed a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September.  The country outlawed anonymous trading in January, and has moved to investigate a number of exchanges over possible crimes such as embezzlement and fraud. Most recently, a local police department said that executives at the Coinone exchange will be charged on grounds that its margin trading service is, in effect, illegal gambling.  While it briefly seemed that a ban on exchange-based trading might also be in the works, that possibility seems to have diminished, alongside regulatory moves to once more allow domestic ICOs under stricter rules.

42380807,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUGX,1528457137,Mastercard Patent Would Put Credit Cards on a Public Blockchain,"Payments giant Mastercard is exploring the use of public blockchains in securely verifying payment cards at the point of sale, public documents show.  According to a patent application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and released on Thursday, Mastercard has come up with a conveyance and retrieval processes to verify users' payment credentials over a ""publicly accessible blockchain.""  The document explains that the two-way method first encodes an image of a payment card and then stores it on the blockchain after encryption with a public and private key. Upon a retrieval request when a payment is being made, the system will use the provided private keys to decrypt the image so it can be verified.  By integrating this system with point-of-sale devices, Mastercard says that transactions would be secure, as the card need not be physically presented, and users need not be concerned about their payment credentials being ""skimmed"" from the payment device.  Mastercard stated in the document:  ""The transaction may be conducted via the display of a machine-readable code to the point of sale device, which may further prevent skimming as the reading of such a code can be more easily controlled via control of the underlying display; the display can be easily shielded and is often obscured when in a pocket or purse.""  Although whether an actual product will arise from the concept, the work marks a notable effort by Mastercard to utilize a public blockchain to potentially improve a common issue with its core card business. According to some sources, card skimming at ATMs and point-of-sale across all providers sees around $2 billion stolen per year globally.  In addition, another blockchain-related exploration by Mastercard was also revealed in yesterday's patent update, which seeks to build a blockchain to allow consumers to broadcast their travel itineraries and reservation requests to merchants.  Since the broadcasted information will remain visible to the public, it gives merchants the chance to bid for potential customers over the blockchain, potentially changing the existing model of hotel and air ticket aggregators.

42380822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUWt,1528454461,Which Way? Bitcoin's Low Volatility May Force Big Move,"Bitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months.  As a result, it's looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000–$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market.  Daily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday – the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of writing, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours.  While all is calm now it may not continue that way for long, as an extended period of sideways action is often followed by a violent move on either side. As technical theory states, the wider the range and the longer the period of the consolidation, the more violent a breakout tends to be.  So, bitcoin could see a speedy $800 move very soon – in either direction.  Daily chart  Bitcoin had looked set up for a major bullish move earlier this week, following an upside break of the falling channel. Now the bull's failure to cross resistance at $7,780 has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback.  As a result, the probability of bitcoin ending the period of consolidation with a downside break is the more likely of the two possibilities. Indeed, prices are starting to drop at press time.  View  A move above $7,819 (50-week moving average) would signal a bullish breakout and would set the tone for a rally to pennant resistance located at $8,880.  On the downside, a break below $7,090 (pennant support) would imply a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC could potentially drop below $6,000 (Feb low).

Dubbed Du Yuzhou – which means ""The Universe"" in literal translation – the game depicts a blockchain-powered space journey where users, by participating in the blockchain, would receive ""elements"" to build their own planet.  The elements – much like token rewards generated by a blockchain – will initially be available through airdrops, according to the game's official website.

42380806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUHn,1528444858,"Binance, NEO Lead $12 Million Investment In AngelList Crypto Spin-Off Republic","Invented to democratize access to funding, it could be argued the crypto token hasn't quite lived up to its goal.  Already gone are the days when any investor could get access to the next big offering (most early issuances, it seems, are now catering to the same stable of Silicon Valley VCs). But one new project is looking to right the narrative, with a token of course.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Republic, a crowdequity platform that can help ICO issuers manage token sales that was spun out of AngelList, has raised $12 million in commitments for a token presale.  Led by Binance Labs, the investing division of cryptocurrency exchange provider Binance, and NEO Global Capital, an affiliate of the public blockchain project of the same name, the round also drew support from East Chain Co., Jeffrey Tarrant and Passport Capital. (Investors purchased both the new crypto token and equity in the company.)  Looking ahead, the initial raise is part of Republic's interest in ultimately raising as much as $92 million total selling its crypto token, with a yet to be announced public sale.  According to Republic co-founder Kendrick Nguyen, the token will be used to incentivize users to take an active interest in their investments, by allowing Republic to potentially provide access to ICO deals and offer a share in the revenue earned by the company as it grows.  As Nguyen told CoinDesk, ""Essentially it's us going IPO without going IPO.""  And that's Republic's whole schtick, offering equity options, including tokens, to any kind of investor. As such, Republic is designing its security token to do the same.  ""We will be doing a combination of Reg D, Reg S and Reg A+ to make sure our tokens are widely available, irrespective of income or net worth in the U.S. and beyond,"" Nguyen said, adding:  ""There's no reason why you have got to be a millionaire to participate in startup investing. Anyone anywhere can and should invest in startups.""  And that mission of democratizing investing worldwide is what piqued the interest of Republic's new investors.  ""Republic brings new investment opportunities for retail investors to participate in well-curated startups,"" Ella Zhang, head of Binance Labs, wrote CoinDesk in an email. ""Binance and the Labs' teams are working towards the freedom of value-exchange, which we believe Republic will shed light on.""  Tony Gu, a partner at Neo Global Capital (NGC) concurred, saying, ""Republic has demonstrated their capability of choosing the best projects and keep the process transparent and compliant with regulation rules.""  And further, East Chain Co.'s Saoud Al-Humaidhi told CoinDesk:  ""We saw the potential of crowd-investing through last year's booming ICO market, and we believe a platform that enables a more curated and legally sound offering is bound to succeed.""  The SAFT evolves  Still, none of the investors have their Republic crypto tokens just yet.  In fact, the precise details of how many tokens there will be, how the incentives and revenue sharing will work and other details are all yet to be disclosed. Those will come when Republic drops the white paper for its ICO.  But, what is known shows that Republic is getting creative with its fundraising model.  For instance, it's using a mechanism it's calling a Simple Agreement for Future Equity and Security Tokens (SAFEST), which will give investors a choice between both tokens and shares in the firm. As the name suggests, the model combines elements of two earlier funding structures – the SAFE and the SAFT.  Here's how the SAFEST works: when the token is ready, pre-sale investors will have the option to take their full investment in tokens or up to 20 percent of their investment in equity. If for some reason Republic fails to launch the token, investors can convert all their investment into equity.  Nguyen explained, ""At the end of the day, many of these projects including Republic, there's an independent value for the company that's uncorrelated with the value of the token, and we think that's how it should be.""  Speaking to the experimentation, Nguyen said, entrepreneurs in the space need to continue being creative with their structures since it's clear not every aspect of ICO model is completely worked out.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This whole ecosystem is so new, and I think it's up to every market participant to be thoughtful and responsible in how they conduct their fundraising.""  Global vision  Considering its goals, it's no accident that Republic looked abroad for backers.  As the company starts preparing for its public sale, it's interested in allowing investors in several markets that haven't necessarily been targeted by ICO issuers in the past or are challenging for a U.S.-based company to tap into.  NGC's Gu said the groups' connections throughout Asia, where retail investors are keen on cryptocurrency, are its key value-add for Republic.  ""NGC believes if Republic does well in the USA, it will easily scale up to other countries and thus, encourage more global investors to join the blockchain ecosystem,"" Gu continued.  Al-Humaidhi of East Chain Co. echoed a similar sentiment, pointing to the Middle East's large pool of young, high net worth individuals as potentially eager investors.  ""We will definitely see great value within the digital economy in the Middle East region over the next 10 years,"" he said. ""We believe that this relatively untapped region holds huge potential,""  Another decision that seems to align with Republic's interest in opening up its crypto token to investors all over the world is its use of Stellar, a blockchain project that's typically been associated with trying to disrupt traditional international remittance companies serving the developing world.  ""One thing a lot of people don't know about Stellar is their impact driven mission,"" Nguyen said, arguing that the project's team prioritizes inclusiveness and diversity – values that could be key as Republic makes its platform a kind of meeting place for any type of investor interested in backing new companies worldwide.  Plus, Nguyen continued, Stellar seems a safer bet over ethereum, where a significant number of ICO issuers launch their tokens.  Speaking to what he sees in Stellar over ethereum, Nguyen said:  ""First and foremost it's a lot cheaper and secondly it's more secure, given that what we do is not heavy on smart contracts. ERC-20 is more susceptible to hacking and security risks.""

The Canadian province long known for its cheap hydroelectric power has formally stopped approving new projects in order to create new rules around which mining firms will be allowed to set up shop in the region, according to the news agency.  Further, Hydro Quebec, the state-owned power producer, hopes to limit the power that can be available for miners to 500 megawatts in total, or just ""a fraction of the 17,000 megawatts"" that miners have requested so far.  Hydro Quebec has also reportedly asked Quebec's energy board to create new rates so as to ""help maximize the energy producer's revenue.""  This is not the first time Quebec has halted approvals for new cryptocurrency mining firms. As previously reported, Hydro Quebec briefly stopped accepting new clients from the space in March, citing the large amount of energy demanded by miners.  At the time, the firm produced a document stating it would be unable to meet demand if every mining project that applied for space was approved.  With new restriction rules, as Reuters reported, Hydro Quebec would be able to choose ""the best among the companies"" vying to develop facilities in the region.  This will in turn help the province grow its economy without resulting in higher costs for local residents, said Hydro-Quebec's distribution president, Eric Filion, in a statement.

Founded in 2004 as AliPay and later rebranded to Ant Financial in 2014, the Alibaba affiliate touts the goal of offering inclusive financial services to the underbanked. According to today's announcement, the new equity financing will be used to develop the firm's technological capacity in artificial intelligence and internet of things, as well as blockchain.  Though Ant Financial has not revealed a concrete roadmap of its planned blockchain development, the announcement is notable given AliPay's status as a prominent payment provider in China, which claims 800 million active users last year.  The announcement also comes just days after a report has indicated the firm is pivoting to technology services.  According to Reuters on Tuesday, as China continues its crackdown on perceived risks to the financial system, Ant Financial is shifting its business focus away from consumer financial services to technology development. Within that, blockchain remains one main focus, the report said.  In fact, both Ant Financial and Alibaba have already started blockchain-related application development. As reported previously by CoinDesk, Ant Financial has expanded the support for its blockchain-based charity donations platform, while Alibaba has rolled out a pilot of a blockchain Food Trust Framework that aims to track international shipments.

42380803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUE1,1528430453,Blockchain's Once-Feared 51% Attack Is Now Becoming Regular,"Monacoin, bitcoin gold, zencash, verge and now, litecoin cash.  At least five cryptocurrencies have recently been hit with an attack that used to be more theoretical than actual, all in the last month. In each case, attackers have been able to amass enough computing power to compromise these smaller networks, rearrange their transactions and abscond with millions of dollars in an effort that's perhaps the crypto equivalent of a bank heist.  More surprising, though, may be that so-called 51% attacks are a well-known and dangerous cryptocurrency attack vector.  While there have been some instances of such attacks working successfully in the past, they haven't exactly been all that common. They've been so rare, some technologists have gone as far as to argue miners on certain larger blockchains would never fall victim to one. The age-old (in crypto time) argument? It's too costly and they wouldn't get all that much money out of it.  But that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.  NYU computer science researcher Joseph Bonneau released research last year featuring estimates of how much money it would cost to execute these attacks on top blockchains by simply renting power, rather than buying all the equipment.  One conclusion he drew? These attacks were likely to increase. And, it turns out he was right.  ""Generally, the community thought this was a distant threat. I thought it was much less distant and have been trying to warn of the risk,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Even I didn't think it would start happening this soon.""  Inside the attacks  Stepping back, cryptocurrencies aim to solve a long-standing computer science issue called the ""double spend problem.""  Essentially, without creating an incentive for computers to monitor and prevent bad behavior, messaging networks were unable to act as money systems. In short, they couldn't prevent someone from spending the same piece of data five or even 1,000 times at once (without trusting a third party to do all the dirty work).  That's the entire reason they work as they do, with miners (a term that denotes the machines necessary to run blockchain software) consuming electricity and making sure no one's money is getting stolen.  To make money using this attack vector, hackers need a few pieces to be in place. For one, an attacker can't do anything they want when they've racked up a majority of the hashing power. But they are able to double spend transactions under certain conditions.  It wouldn't make sense to amass all this expensive hashing power to double spend a $3 transaction on a cup of coffee. An attacker will only benefit from this investment if they're able to steal thousands or even millions of dollars.  As such, hackers have found various clever ways of making sure the conditions are just right to make them extra money. That's why attackers of monacoin, bitcoin gold, zencash and litecoin cash have all targeted exchanges holding millions in cryptocurrency.  By amassing more than half of the network's hashing power, the bitcoin gold attacker was able to double spend two very expensive transactions sent to an exchange.  Through three successful attacks of zencash (a lesser-known cryptocurrency that's a fork of a fork of privacy-minded Zcash), the attacker was able to run off with about more than 21,000 zen (the zencash token) worth well over $500,000 at the time of writing.  Though, the attack on verge was a bit different since the attacker exploited insecure rules to confuse the network into giving him or her money. Though, it's clear the attacks targeted verge's lower protocol layer, researchers are debating whether they technically constitute 51% attacks.  Small coins at risk  But, if these attacks were uncommon for such a long time, why are we suddenly seeing a burst of them?  In conversation with CoinDesk, researchers argued there isn't a single, clear reason. Rather, there a number of factors that likely contributed. For example, it's no coincidence smaller coins are the ones being attacked. Since they have attracted fewer miners, it's easier to buy (or rent) the computing power necessary needed to build up a majority share of the network.  Further, zencash co-creator Rob Viglione argued the rise of mining marketplaces, where users can effectively rent mining hardware without buying it, setting it up and running it, has made it easier, since attackers can use it to easily buy up a ton of mining power all at once, without having to spend the time or money to set up their own miners.  Meanwhile, it's grown easier to execute attacks as these marketplaces have amassed more hashing power.  ""Hackers are now realizing it can be used to attack networks,"" he said.  As a data point for this, someone even erected a website Crypto51 showing how expensive it is to 51% attack various blockchains using a mining marketplace (in this instance, one called NiceHash). Attacking bytecoin, for example, might cost as little as $719 to attack using rented computing power.  ""If your savings are in a coin, or anything else, that costs less than $1 million a day to attack, you should reconsider what you are doing,"" tweeted Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer.  On the other hand, larger cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are harder to 51% attack because they're much larger, requiring more hashing power than NiceHash has available.  ""Bitcoin is too big and there isn't enough spare bitcoin mining capacity sitting around to pull off the attack,"" Bonneau told CoinDesk.  But, while Crypto51 gives a rough estimate, ETH Zurich research Arthur Gervais argued to take the results with a grain of salt, since it ""ignores"" the initial costs of buying hard and software. ""Thus, the calculations are oversimplified in my mind,"" he added.  The solution: a longer wait  Gervais further argues it's worth putting these attacks into context. Though a 51% attack is perhaps the most famous cryptocurrency attack, it's not necessarily the worst in his mind.  He pointed to other malicious bugs, such as one found in zcoin, where, if exploited, a user would have been able to print as many zcoin as they would like. But 51% attacks are still troubling since they can still be worthwhile sometimes, impacting exchanges or whoever happens to be in the crosshairs of the attacker.  ""As an industry, we have to put an end to this risk,"" Viglione said, pointing to efforts on zencash to stop this from happening again.  Either way, one way for users or exchanges to make sure they aren't defrauded is to only accept money that's older, or has been buried by more blocks of transactions, called ""confirmations."" The more confirmations there have been, the harder the funds are to steal in a 51% attack.  Initially, exchanges where bitcoin gold was stolen required only five confirmations, and the attacker was able to reverse all of them with their hashing power. In response to the attacks, they have upped the number of confirmations to 50, which has successfully plugged up the attacks, at least for now.  Because of this, developers and researchers contend bigger blockchains with more hashing power behind them are more secure since they require fewer confirmations.  As bitcoin entrepreneur John Light put it:  ""Remember this next time someone tells you they use altcoins because they're 'cheaper' to use.""

""Decentralized cloud"" foundation Dfinity announced its token distribution plans last week, and revealed in a statement that it will give away 35 million Swiss francs (about $35 million) worth of its DFN tokens to ""hundreds of thousands"" of community members. The company, which purports to be a ""blockchain computer with unlimited capacity,"" will launch its network later this year with the aim of staking a claim in the already competitive market of aspiring blockchain cloud computing services.  Backed  by major tech investor Andreessen Horowitz and crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital, Dfinity is also in the process of conducting a private sale of its forthcoming cryptocurrency, the conclusion of which the company says will push its total funding to nearly $200 million.  Likewise, unlike other companies in the space, Dfinity has eschewed token distribution via an ICO in favor of what might be called a ""compliant airdrop.""  In practice, this means Dfinity community members must undergo and pass a know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) verification process facilitated by AngelList spinoff CoinList before they can benefit from the massive token giveaway. June 8 is the deadline for completing the process.  CoinList previously told CoinDesk that it developed its compliance tool (also dubbed Airdrops) to provide a means for token issuers to conduct airdrops without violating securities laws. Despite this, Dfinity is still excluding U.S. citizens and residents from participating, and cited ""regulatory uncertainty"" as its rationale in a Medium announcement.  Dfinity community members who are able to participate each stand to gain between around $500 to $2,500 worth of tokens, and those who have followed the projects' various community channels longest will receive their tokens first.  Unlike other nascent blockchain projects, Dfinity has not carried out fundraising on the ethereum blockchain, meaning it has not sold ERC-20 tokens as ""placeholders"" until it launches its technology in full. As such, KYC/AML verified community members must wait for the network activation to receive their tokens.  Dfinity expects to launch its blockchain in quarter four.
