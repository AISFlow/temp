42392939,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDTwJ,1690415555,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Post-Fed Rate Hike Fizzles. Will BTC's Recent Low Volatility Last Much Longer?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was trading near $29,300, as momentum stalled after a rally in Thursday's (Singapore time) early morning hours.  Insights: ZkSync Era, a zero-knowledge scaling solution for Ethereum, leads layer 2 landscape in daily active addresses. Interest in its potential airdrop appears to be rising.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $29,477, up 0.9% over the past 24 hours, but still well off its high earlier this month of $31,800. BTC briefly dropped below $29,000 on Monday amid fresh concerns about, separately, Binance and the Chinese economy, but has been largely rangebound between $29,000 and $32,000 since mid June.  In an email to CoinDesk, Stéphane W Ouellette, the CEO of crypto advisory platform FRNT Financial, noted the recent stunted volatility rates, including some BTC readings that have fallen below U.S. stock indices levels. ""Implied volatility rates on options platforms such as Deribit are at or near all-time lows,"" Ouellette wrote.""  But he added: ""This type of environment historically has not persisted for long. Our data analysis suggests that some of the most significant volatility spikes have emerged out of such environments and historically, in albeit relatively short history of BTC, resolves more often than not in a directional move to the upside.""  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,873, also up about 0.8%. Most other cryptos were in positive territory with OGN, the token of the DeFi and NFT platform Origin Protocol, up more than 15% and SOL, the native crypto of smart contracts platform Solana, rising more than 9%. After rising by double-digits on Wednesday (Singapore time) popular meme coin DOGE retrenched by nearly 4%.  Following the rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the bank's openness to raising interest rates again. In an email, Oliver Rust, head of product at inflation aggregator Truflation, wrote that this would be unwelcome news to markets, and also small and medium businesses that are struggling to access capital.""

ZkSync Era, a zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solution for Ethereum, currently leads the layer 2 landscape in daily active addresses, continuing its year-to-date growth.  According to blockchain analytics firm Artemis.xyz, zkSync Era has grown more than 60% to roughly 305,000 daily active users from about 189,000 since the beginning of July, outpacing all other layer 2’s, except Polygon zkEVM which has grown 331% to more than 34,000 daily active users in the same period.  Despite recently launching only in February, zkSync Era has more daily active addresses than Arbitrum and Optimism, the two largest scaling solutions by total value locked, underscoring the rising interest in a potential airdrop from zkSync Era.  “A significant part of usage [on zkSync Era] is likely related to airdrop farming activity,” wrote Artemis Chief Operating Officer Jimmy Zheng to CoinDesk on Telegram. Matter Labs, the company behind zkSync Era, “has raised a meaningful amount of funding for the project and there’s huge speculation that there will be a potential airdrop to facilitate ecosystem growth,” Zheng noted.  Matter Labs hasn’t revealed any plans for token airdrop, and yet, the rise of daily active addresses for zkSync Era demonstrates how a potential airdrop can drive on-chain activity.  “ZkSync Era has benefited from the airdrop narrative. This has fuelled users bridging value [and] using applications in anticipation of a future token,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  Important events.

15329887,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544496,1690412443,Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023,"The Bitcoin halving is arguably the most important event for the blockchain due to its function. As such, it has played a significant role in when the crypto bull market starts and how long it lasts in most cases. Although there have been slight deviations in how it triggers each bull market, pre-halving data over the years suggests that it keeps to quite a tight schedule. Bitcoin Maintaining Historical Trend While most of the year has seen Bitcoin deviate from many historical trends, leading to speculation that the next bull market won’t follow the established trend, the digital asset’s current pattern suggests that these widespread speculations may be wrong. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why In a chart shared on Twitter, pseudonymous crypto analyst @stockmoneyL has presented the argument that Bitcoin could indeed follow the previous bull market trends. The chart shows the number of days between the bottom of the bear market and the next halving event has always maintained a reasonably tight timeline. Going by the chart, if Bitcoin follows this same timeline, then the bull market will actually begin in 2024. With 532 days between the 2022 bottom and the next halving, it fits in with the average 530 days seen between cycles, after which bull markets have often begun. Timeline between BTC bottom and halving event match up | Source: Twitter If this plays out in this instance as well, it would invalidate the expectations of a bull market starting in 2023. It then puts the start of the bull market toward the middle of 2024, similar to other bull markets that have begun following the halving event. Where Does BTC Land In The Bull Market? Over the last couple of bull markets, the price of Bitcoin has always surpassed its previous all-time high by a significant margin. For example, during the 2017-2018 bull market, the price of the digital asset clocked an all-time high price of $19,000. And even though it was significant at the time, it was nothing compared to the next ATH. BTC bulls push toward $29,500 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com In 2021, at the height of the last bull market, the price of BTC reached as high as $69,000, more than triple its previous all-time high. This trend has always endured through all bull markets and if there is a repeat, then it is possible that the price of BTC will reach $150,000 in the next bull. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Now, the exact time frame for this has varied depending on who the forecast was coming from. However, looking at Bitcoin’s previous all-time high peaks, they happen around a year after the halving and start of the bull market. So in this case, it would put the new ATH for the digital asset in 2025.

This followed yesterday's 25 basis point rate boost from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).  Investors also received some fresh economic news to chew on, with the first estimate for U.S. GDP growth in Q2 coming in stronger than expected at 2.4% on an annualized basis. Economist forecasts had been for 1.8%. The GDP price index rose just 2.6% versus 3% expected and down from 4.1% in Q1, confirming the slowdown in inflation that was evident in the previously released monthly CPI data.  See more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is ahead by 0.3%, led by a 2.6% advance for the CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU).  Why is Stellar Lumens (XLM) Surging?  Stellar Lumens' XLM token is leading altcion gainers, rising just shy of 12% over the past 24 hours.  The Stellar Foundation issued a research report detailing its off-ramps on Wednesday. The report stated ""USDC running on the Stellar blockchain is the asset that’s supported by the greatest number of cash offramps, with an estimated 322,000 locations supporting it. XLM, the Stellar blockchain’s native asset, is supported by 26,221 off-ramps."" The second most supported asset in terms of cash off-ramps was bitcoin, said the report.  According to Christopher Newhouse, an independent crypto derivatives trader, the uptick in XLM on Wednesday looks to be caused by traders and speculators digesting the report and picking out ""the narrative of real-world adoption through metrics of things like on and off-ramps and strategic global partnerships.""  ""Once a narrative type trade with organic buying pressure surfaces, momentum often continues in the same direction until we start seeing leveraged trades on the opposite side enter to stall out the move.""  He noted that traders saw the report as an opportunity for a more fundamental based trade/move to continue on the back of the narrative that XLM is one of the most well connected and integrated for USDC cash off-ramps.  Elsewhere, Chainlink (LINK) is ahead 6% and Solana (SOL) 3%. Top metaverse and gaming tokens like SAND and AXS nursed losses even after Meta's Mark Zuckerberg reaffirmed commitment to the Metaverse vision.  Bitcoin Awaits a Catalyst  “On one side, the bulls are waiting for further signals for the Bitcoin ETF SEC decision in August and positioning for the 2024 halving,” Adrian Wang, CEO of Metalpha, told CoinDesk. “On the other side, a lot of profit-takings can occur when the spot is above 30k, while the bears are positioning for another potential drop before 2024 halving, similar to what happened in 2019.”  The Fed announcement ""doesn’t change the story related to crypto,"" said Lex Sokolin, managing partner of Web3 investment fund Generative Ventures. ""We are already in a risk-off environment. Things could maybe get more catastrophic with war or recession, but tech and finance are at a fairly stable compressed valuation, with AI perhaps being an outlier.""  “The market’s response to the Fed’s interest rate hike has been relatively calm, as the hike was largely predicted. It is worth to continue monitoring whether the latest marks the end of the current cycle of rate hikes,” Greta Yuan, Head of Research, at Hong Kong-based digital asset platform VDX told CoinDesk in a note.  “We can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference Wednesday. “We think we’re going to need to hold, certainly, policy at restrictive levels for some time, and we’d be prepared to raise further if we think that’s appropriate.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | XLM,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | XLM,"Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa, James Rubin, Stephen Alpher, Lyllah Ledesma",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/26/crypto-markets-today-btc-eth-doge-ogn-comp-xlm-sol-price-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cee9ae30c81426a9dfc8392e211267a829b5df2-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The DAO’s undoing has already been approved by HEC token holders who, after learning that Hector suffered major losses from the Multichain bridge’s collapse, recently voted to liquidate.  They expected the death to be swift. They anticipated Hector’s once-sizable treasury would quickly be divided up among themselves.  They were wrong, and now they’re angry.  Hector’s unwinding could take “a minimum of six to twelve months” and will involve a liquidator, lawyers and an auditor, according a CoinDesk review of team Discord posts. That is almost certain to whittle away at the project’s remaining $16 million from a treasury that once held $100 million.  Longtime community members and newcomers alike are crying foul over the timeline, a review of Hector’s Discord channel shows. Many feel they were bamboozled, asserting that Hector’s team withheld information when it conducted the vote over the project’s future.  That anger reached a boil Wednesday as Hector shut its Discord server, deleting two years of history and denying community members a place to ask questions of leadership: most pressingly, when they’ll get their money back.  Technicalities  “It would be helpful for everyone to understand the complexity, legal requirements and thus time required to complete the liquidation process on an entity in existence for over a year and a half with multiple services,” Hector’s recently appointed treasury manager, the pseudonymous Farooq, said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  Farooq refused to answer further questions and referred a reporter to Sparring Legal LLP, Hector Network’s counsel. Sparring declined to answer CoinDesk’s questions.  The situation underscores the messiness of operating a so-called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – let alone killing one. These crypto clubs clumsily straddle the thick line between a legal entity and, well, a group chat with a crypto wallet. The first can take an army of lawyers to unwind. But the second needs only a smart contract set up to process redemptions.  In late 2021, Hector’s developers filled their treasury with $100 million from crypto investors who traded ETH, FTM and stablecoins for access to the HEC stablecoin, built on the Fantom blockchain. Their bet was that HEC and its sister stablecoin TOR could replicate Olympus DAO, which paid massive dividends to early backers. They believed Hector’s developers could pull it off in a decentralized style.  Behind the scenes, Hector was anything but decentralized. It operated through a “Hector Enterprises Inc.” in the British Virgin Islands that handled partnerships and contracts, a former employee of the group, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, told CoinDesk. The British Virgin Islands is where Hector’s remaining leaders plan to proceed with liquidation.  But the DAO never approved the creation of this corporation; on the contrary, token holders rejected an effort to centralize Hector as recently as May. (They had previously approved the spinoff of a gaming-focused project).  Hector Enterprises pursued a wide array of endeavors – including a token launchpad, an NFT marketplace and even an “institute” to teach all comers about Hector and DeFi – that stretched far beyond the stablecoin vision.  All-out ambitions distracted the core team from accomplishing any one goal effectively, the former employee said. Instead, the push led to infighting and delays that frayed tempers and ran up the bill – further draining the treasury, this person said. Dissenting opinions outside of what a select few core members agreed on were punished and, eventually, their purveyors expelled.  Hector tried to right its financial ship in March by hiring Farooq, who said he was a Wall Street veteran who also goes by “Qboy,” to manage its finances. In his first months on the job Farooq cut expenses by 85%. But project insiders claim he did nothing to protect the DAO or its dwindling treasury from disaster. Hector declined to limit its exposure to Multichain-linked assets during the rocky month that preceded that bridge’s collapse.  The result cost millions of dollars to the treasury, limiting the cash that’s theoretically left for a distribution. Fees for a team of lawyers from Sparring added to the bleed.  The ragequit  Hector isn’t the first Olympus DAO fork to fail, according to the pseudonymous lilbagscientist, a prominent figure in the Hector community who said they “invested in a lot of OHM forks in 2021.”  “We had over 30 forks of OHM. Some were bound to blow out,” lilbagscientist said, explaining that many of the blow-outs ended life by conducting a treasury redemption where investors swapped their native tokens for more popular cryptocurrencies, like ether or stablecoins (in crypto lingo: a rage quit).  Activist investors had already been pushing Hector to conduct a “rage quit” months before the announcement of liquidation. They had identified Hector as so-called “risk-free value” (RFV) trade, in which individuals coordinate to buy governance tokens of projects whose tokens are trading below the book value of the treasury and then vote for a buyback.  Investors who spoke to CoinDesk said Hector’s budget woes and aborted projects made it a prime place for the RFV trade. These investors claim to only target DAOs that hemorrhage their crypto treasuries at the community’s expense. Holding a buyback, a “rage quit” or an all-out liquidation can get at least some return for regular token holders – and of course a sizable profit for the RFV traders.  Most teams running DAOs object to the activists’ Robin Hood-esque styling and instead view them as governance pirates (the activists’ choice of a Jack Sparrow-looking persona as their front-man for Hector DAO probably didn’t help convince leaders otherwise).  But the investors here succeeded in winning over some members of Hector’s community-staffed governance body, called the Oracles, and forged enough alliances with long-term holders that they felt confident in their direction.  When Hector’s leadership held a doomed vote to centralize the DAO – in so doing completely revoking the community’s claims to the treasury – the activist investors countered with a proposal to hold a rage quit. Hector leadership responded by expelling from the Discord anyone they suspected of conspiring against them.  That Hector is liquidating – or, at least, pledging to hold a treasury redemption in 6-12 months – only after its treasury lost millions of dollars to the Multichain collapse (and likely more to legal fees) comes as no joy to the activists.  “The word of the week is Pyrrhic victory,” one said.",NEGATIVE,ETH | FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FTM | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/26/for-crypto-investors-down-bad-in-hector-the-dao-cant-die-fast-enough,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93b0633711ec24db3c35336022d5e109e8acc76e-1861x1047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15326899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544523,1690405234,Avalanche Foundation Commits $50 Million To Tokenized Asset Purchases,"The Avalanche (AVAX) Foundation has launched a $50 million initiative, called Avalanche Vista, to pioneer the future of asset tokenization. According to the announcement, the foundation will allocate the funds to purchase tokenized assets, often referred to as “real world assets” or “off-chain assets,” minted on the Avalanche blockchain. KKR Fund Tokenization On AVAX The goal of the program is to support and demonstrate the value of tokenization, the process of creating an on-chain digital representation of an asset, item, or thing. Avalanche’s consensus mechanism, subnet architecture, and technical innovation aim to facilitate tokenization with greater speed, scalability, and customizability. Furthermore, Avalanche Vista will consider assets across the full liquidity spectrum, including equity, credit, real estate, commodities, as well as those that are blockchain-native. Related Reading: Singaporean Judge Declares Crypto Is Personal Property In ByBit Case The initiative aims to demonstrate the merits of applying blockchain rails to historically more manual and operationally-intensive use cases, including asset issuance, settlement, transfer, and administration. The initiative follows major milestones in asset tokenization, including Securitize’s tokenization of an interest in a flagship KKR fund on the Avalanche blockchain, marking the first time exposure to one of KKR’s alternative investment strategies had been offered in a digital format in the U.S. Avalanche Vista aims to accelerate the growth of tokenization and its role in on-chain finance (“OnFi”) by unlocking broader access to private market investing. Historically, investments in private markets have been primarily reserved for large institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The initiative aims to enable technologies that create significant efficiencies in these processes and improve the asset issuer and investor experience. According to a report by Security Token Advisors, 77% of capital markets participants believe traditional securities will be digitized within 5-10 years, and the size of the tokenized securities market alone is expected to grow to $20 trillion by the end of 2030. With Avalanche Vista, the Avalanche Foundation is taking a big leap forward toward realizing this future. Avalanche Network Set To Unlock New Frontiers? Tokenization is a powerful technology with a wide range of potential use cases on the Avalanche network. One of the key applications of tokenization is in the real estate industry, where it can be used to represent ownership in real estate assets. By creating digital tokens that represent fractional ownership in a property, it becomes easier to buy and sell these assets, which can be particularly useful in the context of large commercial properties or high-value residential properties. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Shows Positive Moves As Top Coins Land In The Red Another area where tokenization can have a significant impact is finance. By representing financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other securities as digital tokens on the blockchain, it becomes easier to trade and settle these assets securely and transparently. Tokenization can also be used for identity verification, allowing for the secure storage and transfer of digital identities. This has the potential to reduce the need for central authorities in the verification process, making verifying identities easier and more efficient. Other potential applications of tokenization on the Avalanche network include art and collectibles, renewable energy, and charity and non-profit organizations. As the technology continues to develop, it can be expected to have more innovative use cases, transforming a wide range of industries and applications. Despite the potential for tokenization on the Avalanche network, the price of AVAX has remained relatively stagnant over the past few days. Over this period, AVAX has been trading within a narrow range of $13.10 to $13.53. As of now, AVAX is trading at $13.18, which represents a decline of 1.2% over the past 24 hours and more than 5% over the past seven days.

According to Arkham, 3,000 MKR were transferred from Paradigm's crypto wallet to a what was labeled as an OTC (over-the-counter) trading wallet. Paradigm in March did something similar, sending some $20 million of MKR to the same wallet and then transferring the tokens to crypto exchange Coinbase.  Paradigm's move follows Andressen Horowitz's maneuver earlier this week, where it ultimately deposited $7 million of MKR tokens to Coinbase, potentially to sell.  The VC firms' transactions happened as MKR price soared to the highest level since last August, spurred by a new buyback scheme that removes tokens from the market. MKR is currently changing hands at $1,190, up 73% in a month, and vastly outperforming the CoinDesk DeFi Index's 12.7% monthly return.  MakerDAO is one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms and the issuer of the $4.6 billion DAI stablecoin. The protocol is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where those who own MKR tokens can vote on governance proposals.  The development comes as MakerDAO is going through a major revamp under founder Rune Christensen's Endgame vision, which includes breaking up the platform's structure into autonomous units that can issue their own tokens and overhaul MKR and DAI. The plan, while approved by governance vote, also sparked some backlash among community members and investors in the protocol. Delegates and developers resigned from their roles and a16z publicly opposed the changes.  Paradigm and a16z invested early in MakerDAO. Paradigm purchased 5.5% of all MKR tokens in a $27.5 million investment round with Dragonfly Capital late 2019, while a16z acquired 6% of the MKR supply for $15 million in 2018.  The OTC wallet where the tokens from Paradigm landed has a history of receiving MKR and transferring to Coinbase, Arkham data shows. Following Paradigm's $20 million transfer in March, a16z also sent a total of $11.7 million in MKR to the account early July, which then unloaded the tokens to Coinbase.

15325382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544513,1690401604,This AMD Ryzen Bug Can Compromise Your Crypto Wallet Keys,"A new bug called “Zenbleed” affecting specific AMD CPUs has been found that can potentially leak info, such as keys attached to crypto wallets. AMD Zenbleed May Be Exploited To Leak Crypto Wallet Keys As reported by the computer-focused news website Tom’s Hardware, a new vulnerability related to AMD CPUs has been discovered that can compromise sensitive info such as passwords and encryption keys. This bug was independently found by Travis Ormandy, a Google Information Security researcher, who has now made public a documentation of this vulnerability. The Zenbleed exploit works on all products that use AMD’s “Zen 2” architecture. Tom’s Hardware notes that even the AMD EPYC processors in data centers aren’t free from this vulnerability. With this bug, a malicious hacker can potentially get locked information through the CPU and be able to access the user’s login credentials. Naturally, this also means that the keys of a crypto wallet, if installed on the same hardware, may no longer be safe. This vulnerability is so powerful that the attacker doesn’t require physical access to the PC or server; it can be executed through javascript on a webpage, like that inside an ad. AMD has released a new security advisory about Zenbleed that breaks down when the different patches may be released for its various products. According to this information, the consumer CPUs from the Ryzen 3000 and 4000 series, and some from the 5000 line, will not get appropriate fixes until November and December of this year. This would suggest that these home-computer processors might not be protected until the end of the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Only Slips Further Despite Price Decline “AMD’s processors used in the PS5, Xbox Series X, and S, and Steam Deck are all also powered by Zen 2 chips, but it remains unclear if those are impacted,” explains Tom’s Hardware. Which Digital Asset Wallets Would Be Affected? Any crypto wallets the user would directly install on their PC could be vulnerable to this exploit. However, keys stored on dedicated devices like hardware wallets should be safe. Encryption keys stored on locked-down computers (that is, those disconnected from the internet) should also be unaffected by the vulnerability.

Recently, there has been a push towards self-custody in the crypto sector, as investors have slowly become aware of the risks related to centralized platforms after established players such as FTX have gone down during the past year. However, Bugs like these showcase that although self-custodial wallets may be safer than keeping coins on centralized platforms, some types are less safer than others. For example, the hot wallets that need to be connected to the internet can potentially fall prey to such vulnerabilities.

15325441,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/worldcoin-attracts-hundreds-of-users-in-hong-kong-yet-wld-drops,1690401600,"Worldcoin Attracts Hundreds of Users in Hong Kong, Yet WLD Drops","Following the launch of the highly anticipated Worldcoin project on Monday, Hong Kong witnessed hundreds of sign ups, but the WLD token slightly pulled back. How Worldcoin Kicked Off On July 24, a digital identity verification provider called Worldcoin officially started the rollout of its services. The launch of the project was long-awaited in the crypto community and has been talked about since 2021. Worldcoin was co-founded by ChatGPT creator Sam Altman and aims at using the blockchain technology to tackle some AI-related issues. The main platform’s product is World ID, sort of a “digital passport” that can prove that a user online is a real person and not a bot. To get a World ID, one needs to have their iris scanned by a company’s device called Orb at one of the offered locations. So far, Worldcoin made their Orbs available in 35 cities across 20 different countries, with 124 open locations in total. According to the data of the first project’s day, the largest number of people visiting Orbs was registered in Hong Kong. It was reported that around 600 people visited Orbs (200 per one of the three locations) in Hong Kong on Monday, with at least another 500 showing up on Tuesday. Heatherm Huang, co-founder of the Measurable Data Token blockchain firm, one of the three Orb operators in Hong Kong, said that nearly half of the total sign-ups for Worldcoin on Monday was recorded in Hong Kong. That means that around 1,000 people in total had their iris scanned by an Orb on the Worldcoin’s launch day. Compared to the number of 2 million pre-signups for World ID which was achieved on July 13, 1,000 Orb visits on the opening day doesn’t seem like a lot, although it might be too early to draw any conclusions. To encourage more users to register for World ID, the company even promised to give away 25 WLD (equivalent to around 60 USD at the time of writing) to anyone who visits an Orb. So, after getting their iris scanned, one can get both a World ID and 25 WLD in their World App wallet. Worldcoin Faces Criticism Despite all the perks and seemingly good intentions behind the project, Worldcoin has received its share of backlash lately. Many have expressed their concerns over the level of privacy and security World ID can offer. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin named four main risks related to the Worldcoin’s system, while the UK watchdogs said they would be “making further enquiries” regarding the project. WLD Awaits a Catalyst to Gain Value The WLD token started off at a price of $3.3 on Monday, dropped to $2.1 on the next day, and still hasn’t grown much since then. It looks like the coin needs a push to surpass its $3 mark again. WLD is currently trading at $2.33 according to CoinMarketCap. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392930,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDSrd,1690401335,Bitcoin Mining Computing Power May Drop as Much as 30% After Halving: Experts,"Computing power on the Bitcoin network, known as hashrate, could drop by as much as 30% as unprofitable miners shut off their rigs after the next halving event, expected in April 2024, experts said in a Twitter Spaces on Wednesday hosted by CoinDesk as part of its Mining Week 2023.  Lucas Pipes, Managing Director at investment bank B. Riley Financial, estimated a 15% to 30% decline in Bitcoin's hashrate. Colin Harper, head of content at mining services firm Luxor Mining, said a 20% drop was possible.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  Roughly every four years, the bitcoin rewards the miners receive for successfully mining a block are cut in half in a way of controlling the blockchain's supply economics. This event is known as the halving. The next halving will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC per block from the current 6.25 BTC.  As the rewards get cut in half, the cost to mine a block successfully doubles. Barring major upward swings in bitcoin's price, this would lead to miners that are not profitable to shut off their machines and, in turn, lower hashrates for the network.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  To this end, the miners have been trying to upgrade their fleets to newer generation machines, which require less power to mine a block successfully. Power costs are usually miners' biggest operational expenditure, so minimizing this costs is the key to surviving the halving.  The hashrate has been increasing in the past year as more machines are coming online. Meanwhile, the efficiency of machines has roughly doubled every five years.

42392945,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDUGp,1690400966,"Bitcoin is Behaving as the Uncorrelated Asset That Some Investors Want, if Only Its Price Would Increase","Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range, while Tradfi pushes higher.  Short-term holders of bitcoin may be preparing to take profits.  Bitcoin has emerged as an uncorrelated asset, but that hasn’t been such a good thing lately.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has trailed equities and other types of assets that have been surging, most recently amid encouraging early, second quarter earnings.  A Changing Narrative  Bitcoin’s narrative has frequently changed, depending on whom you spoke with and when you spoke with them.  Among other things, bitcoin has served as inflation hedge, providing protection against loose monetary policy, and high beta risk asset, generating surplus alpha relative to tech stocks. An investor's interpretation of bitcoin's current narrative may be driven more by philosophy than economics.  If you’ve invested in bitcoin because you view it as a means of portfolio diversification, with uncorrelated returns, then you’re likely pleased. If you’ve done so over the last three months as a means of generating returns, perhaps not so much.  While traditional financial indices have enjoyed recent success. Bitcoin has been mired in stagnant price action for the better part of the last three months.  The S&P 500, trading at 4567.46 is currently within 5% of its all-time high. Tech heavy Nasdaq is now trading within 15% of all-time highs. Meanwhile, the oft-watched Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is in the middle of its longest winning streak since 2017, rising 12 consecutive days, and within 4% of its all-time high.  Bitcoin sits at just 43% of its all-time high ($67,563), according to CoinDesk Indices data. Ether is trading at 38% of its prior maximum price.  While uncorrelated returns have been lauded as a benefit to owning digital assets, this is likely not what investors meant.  Crypto vs. TradFi Investors  Bitcoin’s decoupling from traditional financial assets certainly rings positive, but its lack of participation in recent market moves may be puzzling to some and could be attributed to differences between digital asset and traditional investors.  Bitcoin investors may view the current macro environment as fraught with risk, while Tradfi investors expect that the economy’s resilience in the face of interest rate tightening is a signal to add exposure.  The 90-day returns of 17%, 23%, and 11% for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and DJIA, compared to the 3% return for BTC over the same period indicate clearly where the current appetite for risk exists.  Oddly, BTC has trailed other digital assets over the identical period. XRP and Solana (SOL), in particular, have delivered stronger 90-day gains than has BTC and ETH.  An application of Julius de Kempanaer’s Relative Rotation Graphs illustrates bitcoin and ether’s weaker performance compared to peers, while using the S&P 500 as the central benchmark.  Still, much of BTC’s lack of performance may be attributable to short term traders. Per on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the percentage of short term traders in profit has declined from 99% to 60% since July 13.  Another item worth monitoring is the transfer volume of coins from short term holders who actually are in profit. Transfer volumes to exchanges has increased 76% since July 22nd, implying that short term traders may be preparing to offload more bitcoin.  All told, bitcoin’s July has been eventful in many ways specific to headlines, but very few in regards to price. While its independence demonstrates a level of asset maturity, its displayed itself in a lack of price growth.

While their price movement sometimes isn’t quite stable, investors switched to the new Pomerdoge (POMD) token. Pomerdoge (POMD) is a revolutionary P2E game and is the next largest meme coin. One of the best forecasts is that it will surge by 4,000%! >>BUY POMD TOKENS NOW Solana (SOL) Works with Coca-Cola Solana (SOL) has been on a bearish run over the previous month because the Solana (SOL) token wasn’t able to break the resistance level of $20. This was mainly because of negative market conditions. On a more positive note, Solana (SOL) partnered with Coca-Cola in Serbia in order to work on an NFT, which has been offered at a large music event. Due to this, Solana (SOL) gained a lot of attention. As a result, Solana (SOL) records a 10.45% increase, and currently, the price of the Solana (SOL) token stands at $22.18. According to crypto experts, if Solana (SOL) makes a breakthrough among foreign investors and stays over $20, then it will remain on a bullish run for a long while. They even forecast that Solana (SOL) will reach $25.56 by the end of 2023. >>BUY POMD TOKENS NOW Tron (TRX) Sends 23,000 ETH to Poloniex After Tron (TRX) spent a lot of time on a bearish run due to negative market conditions, it looks like the Tron (TRX) token is finally on an upward trajectory. In the last 24 hours, the founder of Tron (TRX), Justin Sun, transferred 23,000 Ethereum tokens worth $43 million to Poloniex. Because of this, Tron (TRX) got a price increase of 1.03%, and it now costs $0.07891. Unfortunately, the Tron (TRX) trajectory is still not consistent. Therefore, analysts state that it is possible for Tron (TRX) to drop again. However, if Tron (TRX) continues to grow, it may get a new price barrier in the upcoming week, which is quite positive. >>BUY POMD TOKENS NOW Pomerdoge (POMD) Leaves Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) in the Dust Pomerdoge (POMD) is a new P2E game that already got a lot of investors’ attention. This game promises a lot of fun, along with amazing gains. Pomerdoge (POMD) aims to unite the positive aspects of competitors into a unique product.

Besides this, Pomerdoge (POMD) will enable you to buy, sell, and trade items, skins, and many other objects that the Pomerplace market holds. More so, POMD’s Pomerplace will also come with a battle arena where Pomerdoge (POMD) holders can get better rewards by testing the strengths of their avatars. What’s more, a lot of crypto analysts call Pomerdoge (POMD) ‘the biggest meme-coin of 2023.’ This is because the Pomerdoge (POMD) token is currently worth $0.0000264. As most experienced investors know, investing early in solid projects is where significant gains are often made. In other words, if you invest now, you have the chance to experience the 4,000% surge of Pomerdoge (POMD) by the end of the year. But that’s not all!

The stablecoin offers additional perks to attract new DeFi users to the Aave protocol and creates an additional income stream for Aave. As a prominent DeFi protocol, Aave's native stablecoin could potentially revolutionize the DeFi space. Introduction Initially designed as a hedge against the crypto market's typical volatility, stablecoins are now integral to the portfolios of crypto investors and traders. Stablecoins have grown enormously in market capitalization and currently dominate a significant portion of the total crypto cash and liquidity flow. They exert considerable influence on the broader crypto market - bullish or bearish stablecoin news is capable of sending the crypto market into a frenzy. The current total stablecoin market cap stands at ~$127 billion, with Tether ( USDT-USD ) dominating about 65% of the stablecoin market. Like other crypto industry segments, stablecoins have evolved and undergone various iterations. Early stablecoins, like USDT, were designed with a straightforward fiat-collateralized approach. However, new stablecoins have emerged with alternative approaches to pegging their value to underlying assets. Several leading crypto companies and platforms issue and control their proprietary stablecoins. Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) is issued by Paxos Trust Co., Gemini is behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin Gemini Dollar ( GUSD-USD ), Circle issues and manages the Circle USD Coin ( USDC-USD ), and now-imploded TerraUSD ( UST-USD ) was issued and run on the Terra blockchain. DeFi giant Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is the latest protocol to enter the stablecoin space with GHO (GHO-USD). Stablecoins' Farrago of Missteps Stablecoins, though designed to be safe and stable, have faced challenges, including regulatory squeezes. There have been cases of depeg of stablecoins, where they lose their 1:1 peg value to their underlying asset. These depeg incidents can occur due to protocol exploits, market manipulation, or mismanagement by the stablecoin issuer, resulting in the depletion of the stablecoin's reserves. Depegs could also be caused by a failure of the model or algorithm on which the stablecoin is built and run. The 2022 implosion of the Terra ecosystem and the subsequent overnight depeg of its UST stablecoin is one such instance of a stablecoin fiasco. Another noteworthy depeg incident occurred when Acala USD, a stablecoin issued by the Acala network - a DeFi hub on Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) - lost peg after suffering an exploit . Aave's Game-Changing Native Stablecoin The proposal to launch Aave's native stablecoin has been approved by delegates of Aave DAO. This places Aave in the ranks of DeFi protocols, like MakerDAO and Curve Finance, that have launched a native stablecoin. Aave is an undisputed giant in the DeFi space and the launch of its native stablecoin signals the beginning of a fierce DeFi-native stablecoin competition among leading DeFi protocols. Aave's native stablecoin, called GHO, is a decentralized, collateral-backed, and USD-pegged stablecoin. Aave introduces the concept of Facilitators in its stablecoin. Facilitators are independent entities that can trustlessly mint and burn the stablecoin tokens. Facilitators are assigned a Bucket with a specific minting capacity, and they can decide on which minting strategy to employ in minting the stablecoin tokens. For example, Aave V3 Ethereum Pool, one of the initial Facilitators, employs an overcollateralized model to mint in its Bucket. Another approved Facilitator, say a DAI-based entity, could decide to employ an algorithmic overcollateralized minting strategy in its Bucket. These different strategies help regulate the stablecoin's supply. To maintain true decentralization, Facilitators must be approved through governance votes in Aave DAO, and the limits of their Buckets are also subject to updates through governance votes. This ensures a balanced capacity for each Bucket, favoring overall collateralization and system stability. Setting a minting cap on Facilitators' Buckets helps mitigate the risk of an implosion. Other key ecosystem parameters such as interest and discount rates are also decided by the Aave community through Aave DAO. These rates' configurations are proposed and adjusted accordingly to maintain the stability of Aave's stablecoin. Another notable feature of the Aave stablecoin is its ability to be ""flash minted."" Inspired by DeFi flash loans (popular for granting users instant liquidity and for facilitating arbitrage), Aave's stablecoin introduces the concept of FlashMinting . FlashMinting adheres to the current ERC3156 Flash Loan standard . Similar to flash loans, where borrowing and repayment occur within a single transaction, GHO can be minted (borrowed) and burned (repaid) in a single transaction. How Does This Benefit Aave Protocol? Stablecoins play a vital role in DeFi lending markets, as they provide users with a means to manage volatility-associated risk. Having a native stablecoin pushes Aave a step closer to becoming an all-encompassing DeFi platform, directly addressing every DeFi need of its users. Aave's new stablecoin offers additional perks that will attract new DeFi users to Aave protocol and encourage existing users to stake Aave tokens. One such perk is the implementation of a Discount Strategy mechanism, which allows users who stake Aave in the protocol's Safety Module to access a discount on the stablecoin's borrow rate. In addition to incentivizing new and existing users to participate in Aave's Safety Module staking, the stablecoin creates an additional income stream for Aave protocol - all interest accrued from lending the stablecoin is retained in Aave DAO treasury, to be put into further research and the development of Aave protocol. Risk As with any crypto investment, investing in a DeFi-based platform carries inherent risks. One major foreseeable risk is the possibility of exploitation by attackers. Latest reports reveal that DeFi users have lost ~$400 million to exploits in the first half of 2023. Aave's native stablecoin introduces novel stablecoin concepts like Facilitators and Buckets. Some of the new concepts are somewhat experimental and may not function as intended in the long run. It will take some time before these new concepts prove their capacity to maintain the peg rate and stability of the stablecoin. With regards to regulation, decentralized protocols and decentralized stablecoin issuers have not directly faced regulatory sanctions yet; however, some centralized stablecoin issuers have encountered scrutiny from the SEC. Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, faced an SEC enforcement action earlier this year; the SEC cited a violation of securities laws. The SEC has also made attempts to amend and expand the definition of the word ""exchange."" The expanded definition would encompass alternative trading systems, which might include DeFi protocols like Aave. Takeaway Although Tether, a centralized stablecoin, still holds a significant share of the stablecoin market, the demand for decentralized stablecoins continues to grow. Aave is on the right path to capture a significant portion of the stablecoin market with the introduction of its native stablecoin. If Aave's native stablecoin maintains price stability, capital efficiency, and true decentralization in the long run, it would address the stablecoin trilemma and capture a significant portion of the stablecoin market, making Aave a go-to DeFi platform.",POSITIVE,AAVE,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4620108-aave-protocol-stablecoin-is-nothing-like-the-others?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15324996.jpeg
42392928,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDT1t,1690400314,"FTX’s Bankman-Fried Should Be Jailed Heading Into Trial, U.S. Argues","The U.S. Department of Justice wants FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to spend the remainder of his time before his criminal trial in jail, alleging he has tried multiple times to tamper with witnesses.  Bankman-Fried, flanked by two attorneys, appeared in federal court Wednesday, after the DOJ alleged he shared documents with the New York Times to try and discredit former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, with whom he'd previously been in a relationship with.  Danielle Sassoon, an assistant U.S. attorney, opened the hearing by saying the DOJ was seeking Bankman-Fried's detention.  ""It is the government's view that no set of release conditions can secure the safety of the community,"" she said. ""... it appears to be undisputed the defendant provided the documents quoted [in the New York Times] ... to discredit [Ellison].""  Bankman-Fried has sent more than 100 emails to reporters and had more than 100 phone calls with a single Times reporter (who authored the article in question), she said in court. The DOJ also believes the onetime crypto executive was the source of a previous article about Ellison. The prosecution is also concerned about Bankman-Fried's more than 500 phone calls with author Michael Lewis, who is set to publish a book on FTX near the start of his criminal trial.  While Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the Southern District of New York, declined to jail Bankman-Fried immediately, he set out a rapid schedule for both the prosecution and the defense to make formal written submissions on the matter. The DOJ has until Friday to file theirs. The defense can respond until Tuesday, and the DOJ can file a final response by Aug. 3.  The judge appeared skeptical of the defense attorney Mark Cohen's arguments during the hearing.  Cohen, who said Bankman-Fried was not trying to discredit Ellison, argued that he had not tried to contact reporters himself, but did have a strategy to respond to reporters in an effort to influence the media narrative about him. There have been over a million negative articles about Bankman-Fried, Cohen said.  ""What we have here is a defendant who believes, given the many, many negative stories ... given the literally thousands of stories about his relationship with Ms. Ellison ... that he had the right to make fair comment,"" Cohen said, adding that it may not be ""the best strategy.""  Cohen also argued that remanding Bankman-Fried to jail would make it more difficult to organize his defense, pointing to the volume of documents that are accessible through online tools.  Sassoon said that having a discovery schedule predicated on using these digital tools was ""not a get out of jail"" card.  Wednesday's hearing was not the first time the judge expressed concern about Bankman-Fried's conduct while out on bond. During a previous hearing in February, he told the court he had ""probable cause"" to believe that Bankman-Fried's previous communications with former FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller may have amounted to witness tampering.  Judge Kaplan said Wednesday that he ""still do[es] think"" that the communication with Miller was intended to influence testimony.  ""And now you hear of the extraordinary amount of contact between the defendant, journalists and the author of this report. In light of these new facts, there's probable cause to believe [there's enough reason to revoke bail],"" he said.  The judge ended the hearing by warning Bankman-Fried to take the matters seriously, signing off on an interim gag order banning Bankman-Fried from communicating with press or making other public statements at least until Kaplan has had a chance to review the written submissions on whether or not the FTX founder's bail should be revoked entirely.  Bankman-Fried is currently set to go on trial in October on various charges, including securities and wire fraud allegations. A second trial on additional charges, including bank fraud and bribery allegations, is scheduled for next March.  UPDATE (July 26, 2023,19:46 UTC): Added line about judge's warning to Bankman-Fried.

ENF's CEO, Yves La Rose, recently announced the foundation's preparation to file a lawsuit against Block.one, adding to the growing list of legal actions the latter faces. Accusations and Previous Lawsuits In a July 25 Twitter thread, La Rose informed that Block.one is already negotiating a settlement for another class-action lawsuit, with a proposed amount of $22 million. The firm had previously tried to settle at $27.5 million with the lead plaintiff, Crypto Assets Opportunity, but a U.S. judge turned it down. “You may need to opt out to be eligible to participate in the ENF’s lawsuit,” La Rose noted. Plaintiffs considering opting out of the class-action suit, which was initiated in 2017 and is currently in settlement process, have been advised to contact counsel James Koutoulas. The deadline to claim or opt out is set for Aug. 23, as stated by La Rose. He emphasized, however, that opting out doesn't guarantee a successful claim against Block.one in any other lawsuit. Promise vs. Delivery La Rose alleges that Block.one's inability to fulfill its commitment to the EOS Network and community has resulted in significant challenges for the . ENF, in response, has reportedly been actively collaborating with stakeholders to ensure Block.one is held accountable for its promises. These allegations aren't entirely new. In May 2023, La Rose first raised the call for a class-action lawsuit against Block.one, accusing it of breaching its commitment to channel $1 billion from EOS’ initial coin offering (ICO) to EOSIO developers. “It was broadly understood at the time that B1 was making these commitments that these investments would be made in the EOS Network, [...] and yet B1 has provided minimal real support to EOS Network efforts to develop the network,” La Rose wrote. “B1’s promises during the ICO and after have not been fulfilled,” he added. Block.one raised a staggering $4.1 billion in an ICO back in 2018, setting a record for one of the largest crowdfunding rounds of the time. Block.one hasn't yet responded to these latest accusations from the ENF. Despite the looming legal battles, La Rose remains confident about the potential of the EOS Network. In a tweet, he affirmed that taking steps to hold Block.one accountable for its promises would only enhance EOS Network’s position and the long-term value it offers its participants.

On Monday, July 24, investors watched the price of the premier cryptocurrency retreat beneath the $30,000 mark again. Let’s look at what the on-chain metrics say about this latest fall below the critical price level. 69% Of Bitcoin Holders In Profit After Fall Below $30,000 A data report from IntoTheBlock reveals that roughly 68.96% of Bitcoin holders remained green after the price retreat below the $30,000 mark. There is also an indication of significant buying activity around this price level, with more than 3.4 million wallets acquiring BTC at this zone. Source: IntoTheBlock via Twitter According to the market intelligence platform, the $30,000 mark has often served as a psychological support level for investors. However, it remains to be seen whether traders will hold or opt out of their positions if the coin continues its current bearish form. Interestingly, on-chain data reveals that BTC’s volatility is currently at its historical low, suggesting that a significant price movement is imminent. Related Reading: Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed? Bitcoin currently trades at $29,225, with a slight 0.4% price increase in the past day, according to CoinGecko data. A look at its broader market reveals that the coin has been on a 5% price decline in the past two weeks. Since falling below the $30,000 mark on July 24, the price of Bitcoin is yet to recover above this level as it often has in recent times. Bitcoin Experiences Increased Network Growth And Activity While the recurrent price dip below $30,000 in July may have raised some concern amongst investors, there are positive signs demonstrating Bitcoin’s resilience and overall stability. For instance, the creation of new addresses recently hit a yearly high, suggesting increased user growth, which might positively influence the coin’s price. IntoTheBlock’s New Adoption Rate metric further fuels the optimism around Bitcoin. This metric measures the ratio of new active addresses compared to total activity. According to the analytics platform, there was a sudden spike in the new adoption rate of Bitcoin in July. For context, this rate has been in a range for most of 2023.

42410095,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTKxm,1690396121,Why France Is Emerging as a European Crypto Hub,"The introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation has brought a sense of cohesive direction to the European crypto industry. Where crypto assets had previously existed in a gray area, with firms and investors grappling with varied regulatory frameworks on a country-by-country basis, MiCA now promises widespread harmony.  Expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2024, MiCA regulations will influence and drive the dynamics between governments, communities and projects over the next 18 months as the Web3 scene continues to evolve and innovate. In the lead up to MiCA’s full implementation, we can expect to see the EU – and France in particular, for reasons mentioned below – as a core hub of this progressive movement.  Ken Timsit is the managing director of Cronos Labs.     With Paris recently hosting the sixth annual EthCC, the first since the introduction of MiCA, this year’s iteration also feels especially significant in line with the recent surge in President Macron’s efforts to make France fertile ground for Web3 enterprise. Having already inspired Circle, Binance and Crypto.com to make Paris their base in Europe, France can point to three interrelated trends working in tandem to solidify the country's position as a leading hub of Web3 development. In short, collaborative regulators, a massive talent pool and healthy capital flows are underpinning the country's Web3 industry, and spearheading growth on a global stage.  A progressive regulatory landscape  Even before the introduction of MiCA, France’s attitude toward crypto regulation has been broadly supportive, inclusive and encouraging over the last several years. While other countries have tightened rules around digital assets (with some even banning crypto), President Macron has embraced the sector.  As part of his so-called 2030 plan, France has committed €30 billion to create the next “high-tech champions of the future.” Web3 accordingly is “an opportunity not to be missed,” and should be part of France's attempt to be a ""leader of the future generations of the web.” Among the most beneficial policies Macron has passed have been tax cuts on crypto profits and a simplified registration processes with financial watchdogs.  This softer stance was seen during the build up to the EU’s vote on MiCA, when France started softening their approach to crypto licensing to give operators more time to cooperate with any new Europe-wide standards. The resultant flexible two-tier regime for registration leaves the decision to be fully licensed at the discretion of the registered company.  It's worth noting, these advances also came at a time when the U.K. announced plans to regulate crypto, marking a notable conscious push to distance itself from Europe and the pervading hostilities in the U.S.  When MiCA was passed, it was immediately welcomed by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), France's top financial overseer, who cited increased competitiveness and investor protection as obvious benefits to introducing sane crypto policies. The AMF soon after began to consider a fast track system that would get registered firms approved under the new rules.  See also: SocGen Becomes First Company to Secure French Crypto License  In an industry like crypto, where everything is constantly progressing, major players will seek to set up shop in a place with firm foundations. France’s readiness to welcome, introduce and adapt to ever-evolving regulatory frameworks presents them as an attractive option and is already being noted by industry players.  A vibrant Web3 community  Another factor that could see France lead the charge in Europe’s Web3 advances is the fact that it has a notably dynamic community with an increasingly rich pool of talent.  From Paris Blockchain week to NFT Paris and the recently concluded EthCC, France is home to many community-wide and industry-leading events that set the direction for the wider sector. This inevitably fosters ideas, relationships and activities within local Web3 communities.  France has also emerged as one of the top countries attracting blockchain talent, ranking sixth in the world for most blockchain developers per country. The country has benefitted not only from its existing pool of top engineering and tech talent, but also from the flow of talent migrating to crypto-friendly jurisdictions.  Favorable funding environment  Another key component of France’s growing dominance in Web3, is the favorable funding environment. Crypto in France benefits from France's wider tech scene – the country counted 32 unicorns (private companies with at least $1 billion valuations) as of March 2023.  At a time when U.S. VCs are pulling back from crypto, France is seeing a rekindling of sentiment – at least seen anecdotally at events. By the numbers, the pacing of venture funding in France slowed in Q1 2023 but bigger deals were being made overall.  For crypto specifically, at least €1.3 billion has been raised for blockchain projects since 2017 – with little sign of slowing. Last year, Cathay Innovation and crypto wallet startup Ledger partnered up to launch an early-stage fund dedicated to Web3 with a target size of €100 million – the country’s first-ever fund dedicated to the sector. More recently, France's Ministry of Culture pledged €150 million to promote ""French cultural sovereignty"" in virtual environments.  All of these investments speak volumes of the tenacity of France’s capital markets – even amidst a crypto winter, it has remained resilient and abundant.  Going forward  As different regions around the world try to establish themselves on the tech and crypto playing fields, each will need to vye for attention. France, being a culture center of the world, does not want in that department. While many were attracted to Portugal for its lax tax policies, France offers other ineffables that will always attract a certain type of young and hungry developer. But for the industry to truly blossom, the government and Web3 communities will inevitably have to work in tandem.

42410109,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLY9,1690394643,Federal Reserve Hikes Fed Funds Rate by 25 Basis Points,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its two-day policy meeting Wednesday by resuming rate hikes after a one-meeting pause, raising its benchmark fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a targeted range of 5.25%-5.50%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed at $29,300 in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.  Today’s move is a resumption of tightener monetary policy by the Fed, which at its meeting six weeks ago had paused what had then been a 15-month sting of consecutive rate hikes. The hike was fully anticipated by markets, with the CME FedWatch tool – which relies on pricing in the short-term interest rate markets mostly affected by Fed actions – for the last week showing a near-100% chance of such an action.  ""Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,"" said the accompanying policy statement. ""The extent of these effects remains uncertain,"" the statement continued. ""The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.""  At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said no decisions about future rate hikes or pauses had been made, and stressed that the central bank will be highly data dependent going forward. He noted, for instance, that the Fed will have two additional employment reports and two additional inflation reports to mull over before its next rate-setting meeting in September.  Powell also said that the Fed staff was no longer anticipating a recession. This is notable as the staff's forecast for the past few months had been for a mild recession. The comments briefly knocked bitcoin lower by about $150, but the price quickly rebounded.  While a recent Reuters survey of 106 economists showed that most expect today’s hike to be the last one this cycle, the Fed’s own projections suggest otherwise. Matt Kunke, a research analyst at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, noted to CoinDesk Tuesday that the central bank’s June Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median forecast among Fed officials was for two more rate hikes this year. “Markets haven’t fully bought into this view and continue to imply that one hike (~65%) is more likely than two (~27%),” said Kunke.  Following a fast 20% rally beginning in mid-June mostly thanks to excitement surrounding BlackRock’s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, the price of BTC has stalled during July – at least in part due to the realization that the Fed would indeed begin lifting interest rates again. After trading as high as $31,800 earlier this month, the crypto dipped to a one-month low below $29,000 on Monday.

The colorful release, featuring reinterpretations of the platform's iconic ""Snoo"" character, is titled ""Retro Reimagined"" and is meant to inspire ""warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia."" The collection features designs from 100 independent artists and popular NFT collections like Cool Cats. The Polygon-based NFTs in the collections range in price from $2.49 to $199.99.  The Reddit team learned from its previous drop in April, implementing anti-bot measures such as CAPTCHA to ensure a smoother rollout. In addition, the team is launching ""initial access"" for the first day of the release, which looks at your account age and ""other metrics"" and limits the number of collectibles you can purchase in one swoop. Collectors can spend up to $1,000, with a one-purchase per collectible avatar limit during this time. Initial comments in the r/CollectibleAvatars posts post-launch are mostly positive, though there were some complaints about glitches and confusion with prices.  ""These purchase constraints are meant to act as an extra layer of protection against bad actors and bad bots,"" a Reddit admin wrote.  Once the initial access period ends, these restrictions will be lifted, though a $3,000 daily purchase limit will remain.

15322414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544490,1690394414,Compound (COMP) Bulls Strengthen Market Control With 13% Rally,"COMP, THE native token of Compound Finance, has seen its market price rise significantly on Wednesday, emerging as the top gainer of the day. According to data from CoinMarketCap, COMP is up by 13.24% in the last 24 hours as the bulls increase their control of the market. Initially, COMP began the week with a bearish trend, declining by 16% to trade at $59.14 on Tuesday. However, after touching this price level, the token began showing signs of recovery moving its market price to $62.34 at the close of Tuesday’s market. In the early hours of Wednesday, COMP gained over 11%, hitting a price of $69.84, and has since been hovering around that price region. Looking at its broader price movement, COMP has recently been among the most popular tokens, gaining over 90.55% in the last four weeks. COMP Price Analysis And Prediction According to Compound’s daily chart, its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below its signal line, indicating a bearish trend may soon occur. Based on its current price movement, COMP is currently consolidating around the $69.70 price zone. Related Reading: Compound (COMP) Token Rallies Over 100% After CEO Quits – Details If COMP bulls are able to significantly strengthen their grip on the market, the DeFi coin may break out of this zone, trading as high as $78.67. This indicates a potential 12% on its current market price. On the other hand, if the bears reassume market control, COMP is expected to retest at $55.72, which marks its imminent major support level. However, with significant selling pressure, COMP could trade as low as $22.97. It is worth stating that traders should watch out for the impending Fed interest rate announcement, which may likely play a role in the token’s short-term price movement. At the time of writing, Compound is changing hands at $69.41, with a 0.89% gain in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is valued at $186.71 million, having gone up by 31.28%. With a market cap of $541.25 million, COMP ranks as the 71st largest cryptocurrency. Compound (COMP) Trading At $69.70 On The Daily Chart | Source: COMPUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Fed Interest Rate Decision Approaches In other news, the crypto space and the general financial markets are anticipating the interest rate decision by the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday. It is widely expected that the American apex bank will announce a 25 basis points rate hike, bringing the current interest rate to 5.5%. This would mark the 11th rise in the Fed’s interest rate since early 2022. Related Reading: Upcoming Interest Rate Hikes Could Be The Next Big Challenge For Bitcoin, Here’s Why An increase in interest rates is generally executed to combat inflation. However, interest rate hikes are also known to produce a negative effect on cryptocurrency prices as it reduces spending and investment ability. Following the last interest rate hike by the Fed in May, Bitcoin dipped by 1%. In April, the market leader significantly declined by 3% after the Fed announced a similar 25 bps rate increase. So another hike will likely lead to a further decline in price.

42410094,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTKuT,1690392740,Twitter Is Dead. Long Live Crypto Twitter?,"I spent a few moments this morning exploring my Twitter archive. I’m reflecting on what the social media site has meant for the world of cryptocurrency – and contemplating what the possible end of “Crypto Twitter” means for the future.  It’s time for that reflection because Twitter as we knew it is now officially gone, with the sudden rebrand this week to X.com. That followed months of palpable decline in the site’s vitality, thanks to an extortionate subscription drive meant to replace cratering advertising revenue.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Now, Elon Musk seems to have lost all interest in the actual social media product, announcing that Twitter would become the core of an ill-defined “everything app.” (Explaining these impulsive moves is beyond my scope here, but there is one compelling thesis I would invite you to contemplate.)  This appears to have been my first tweet about Bitcoin, sent on April 4, 2013.  (For the youths, this was before “retweets” were a hardcoded feature, so you just typed “RT” before copy-pasting someone else’s tweet. I should also say it’s impressive that Twitter’s – sorry, X.com’s – nearly two-decade archive still works as well as it does. We’ll see how long that lasts.)  Scrolling back through these ancient scribblings, I also found a timeline of the evolution of my own thinking about crypto. That was driven by conversations and interactions with people smarter than me, starting with Andreas Antonopoulos.  I connected with Andreas and many other vital thinkers largely via Twitter, and it continues to function as both a better version of LinkedIn and an archival rolodex of practically all the smart people in crypto I’ve ever interacted with. Right at my fingertips, I have a catalog of experts on various topics, whose expertise I’m confident in because I’ve communicated with them for weeks or months before I tap them for help with a story.  My experience is just one small node in a constellation of similarly productive connections made through Twitter, including important debates, but also hiring, strategic alliances and dealmaking. That utility is unlikely to disappear completely, but moves like limiting direct messaging for non-subscribers seem almost certain to reduce it.  The decline of Twitter has had crypto types eyeing alternatives for months. Once enough people head for the exits, we could suddenly find that the real Crypto Twitter is no longer actually on the site formerly known as Twitter.com.  What comes after Crypto Twitter  There are about a half-dozen sites attracting refugees from Twitter/X.com. They all have some appeal, but after months of widespread taste-testing, there are a few clear winners – and some that seemingly aren’t going to make it.  The winners  Bitcointalk.org – The most venerable and important discussion board in the cryptocurrency ecosystem has never gone away. Yes, it’s almost exclusively focused on bitcoin (BTC), but it and other old-school forums deserve a revitalization as Twitter drains users. Not only does it feature a historically invaluable archive of the foundational discussions that created today’s crypto world, its solid reputation system helps clarify who’s worth listening to. More generally, the forum format of threaded discussion encourages reasoned and detailed debate rather than engagement-farm shouting.  Nostr – Many bitcoiners seem to be congregating here. Nostr is a true decentralized protocol that uses a familiar (to coiners) public-private keypair system, and a network of relays that doesn’t rely on a central server to distribute content. It has been broadly praised by no less a crypto titan than Jameson Lopp, though it’s not without its shortcomings. This seems like a necessary add for the most serious cypherpunks in crypto.  Bluesky – Bluesky is shaping up as the most attractive Twitter alternative for people who are Smart and Normal. Its user experience is effectively identical to Twitter’s, though with fewer features. It has already attracted a critical mass of the coastal media and policy establishment that first made Twitter great (and who Elon aggressively alienated with his verification changes). This is where I foresee myself spending the most time in a worst-case future (davidzmorris.bsky.social).  Discord – The shift of the crypto world to narrower and less public Discord servers began long before Twitter’s decline, but it seems almost certain to accelerate post-Elon. That tracks what could be a broader shift of internet discussion to more private and exclusive settings, which I see mostly as a net benefit to the formation of strong communities rooted in deep understanding and longer-term relationships.  See also: Blockades and Blockchains: What the Reddit Boycott Has to Do With AI | Opinion  Reddit – Reddit remains an incredible place to talk seriously about almost anything, including crypto. Like Bitcointalk and other forums, its reputation system and format are ideal for nuanced discussion. That said, it’s important to remember that each subreddit has its own mods and agenda, exemplified by the generational feud between r/Bitcoin and r/BTC.  The losers  Mastodon – “You think you want it, but you actually don’t,” encapsulated as a social media network. Mastodon’s “federated” model embodies some ideas that crypto types should love. But reports from users have generally found the experience clunky, and while it’s interesting, the federated server model seems a bit too isolating, limiting the potential for networking.  Threads – While Mastodon may be too technically wonky for many, Threads seems flawed in the other direction: too accessible, and too limited. Perhaps above all, the requirement of associating a Threads account with an Instagram account makes pseudonymity more difficult, a huge negative for crypto users. By many accounts, the quality of Threads content is also very low, and seems likely to stay that way for structural reasons.  However, Threads does offer one silver lining – it could be a very appealing home for influencers, bots and scams, which rely on a huge pool of susceptible targets. That could mean that they get separated from more robust and grounded crypto discourse, which would be a good thing.  Bottom Line: There’s no real replacement  The variety of attractive options for Twitter emigres strongly suggests that there will be no single, easy replacement for Twitter. The features and infrastructure of services like Bluesky and Nostr matter when you’re forced to choose a new social platform. But no feature can compete with the multitude of connections built up over many years, the follows and followers known as your “social graph.”  That may be enough to keep a critical mass of Crypto Twitter active on the new X.com. Elon has certainly managed to degrade the experience and alienate users, but it might remain just slightly better than any of the alternatives, simply because most people are already there, and will stay. I am personally still most active on the former Bird App.  This also drives home a larger point, one that should be no surprise to crypto adherents: this kind of public infrastructure should not be so easily co-opted and dismantled by one very rich guy. If there’s one huge upside to the fall of Twitter, it may be that the general public starts thinking more seriously about data portability and other issues that we’ve been shouting about for a solid decade.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,David Z.

The court likened crypto to fiat money, and since fiat passes as personal property, crypto should pass as one, too, the court reasoned. Genesis Of The Case Judge Philip Jeyaretnam made this declaration in a case that had earlier been brought by crypto exchange Bybit against a former employee named Ho Kai Xin. Bybit alleged that Ho had transferred around $4.2 million USDT from the crypto platform’s account to her accounts. Related Reading: LayerZero Crosses This Significant Milestone, But Is An Airdrop Coming? In what was the most expected outcome, the court ordered Ho to transfer the money back to Bybit. However, what caught the crypto community’s attention is the status that the Judge placed on cryptocurrencies. The Judge referred to the USDT tokens in question as a “property.” And despite these tokens not being physical, the judge opined that “We identify what is going on as a particular digital token, somewhat like how we give a name to a river even though the water contained within its banks is constantly changing.” Total market cap jumps to $1.4 following Wednesday recovery | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com He was also quick to debunk the notion that crypto doesn’t have any “real” value, as, according to him, value is “a judgment made by an aggregate of human minds.” Judge Jeyaretnam further classified crypto as personal property when he referred to it as “things in action,” which means any personal property one has the right to sue for recovery. This mostly pertains to money. The judge also highlighted that he wasn’t referring to USDT as personal property because holders can redeem its physical equivalent. Instead, he believes that this feature isn’t required of a crypto asset for it to be classed as a “thing in action.” Status Of Crypto In Other Jurisdictions This ruling is, however, not the first time that digital assets are referred to as ‘personal property’. In 2022, a London Court ruled that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) represent “private property.” Related Reading: Fundstrat Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $180,000 In 2024, But What’s The Catalyst? The UK Law Commission, earlier this year, also recommended that a new category of personal property should be created to accommodate digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Furthermore, a Montana Bill classifying crypto as personal property was also approved by the House of Reps earlier this year in April. Given this, it looks like it will not be long before crypto is finally stamped as personal property in major jurisdictions.

Crypto Crimes in South Korea Are on the Rise In a report of July 26, South Korea announced the launch of a multi-agency investigation unit as part of the effort to handle crimes related to digital assets in the country. The Joint Investigation Center for Crypto Crimes will begin operations at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office, equipped with 30 investigators from seven government agencies and bodies, including the prosecution, the Financial Supervisory Service, the National Tax Service, and the Korea Customs Service. The establishment of the investigation team has to do with a huge spike of crypto related-crimes in South Korea. According to the recent reports, the financial damages of illegal crypto activities grew by 118% in the last five years and summed up to about 5.3 trillion won (~ 4 billion USD). The crimes included illegal cross-border transactions, price manipulations, and ponzi schemes. Moreover, the Prosecutors' Office highlighted that the number of suspicious transactions across local digital currency exchanges surged by 1,263% only in the past 18 months (66 in 2021, 900 in 2022, and 943 in the first half of 2023). The new investigation unit is expected to focus primarily on highly volatile digital assets as well as the cryptos that are being delisted due to illegal trading practices, tax evasions, unauthorized foreign exchange transfers, concealment of criminal profits, and money laundering. The Prosecutor's Office commented on the launch: “Virtual assets, which are traded over 3 trillion won (~$2.35 million) every day, with more than 6 million participants, are already investment products comparable to stocks, but the laws and systems are not complete, so market participants are practically left out from the protection of the law.” Crypto Regulation in South Korea The launch of the interagency probe team is just one of the steps South Korea has taken towards strengthening crypto regulation in the country. The news comes shortly after the National Assembly passed pioneering legislation aimed at safeguarding crypto investors that is set to take effect in July of next year. Earlier this month, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced it would mandate all companies that own or issue digital assets to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024. Besides, the South Korean Prime Minister, Han Deok-soo, also asked high-ranking public officials to disclose their crypto holdings back in May of this year. Last year, the South-Korean crypto market experienced a 66% reduction in market capitalization due to various domestic and global events. One of the incidents that must have had a major influence on the South-Korean crypto industry was the crash of Terra Luna in 2022.

42410101,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLHc,1690388261,"Bitcoin Mining Is an Oligopoly, and Proof-of-Stake Isn't Any Better","When I first read Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, I fell in love with its idealism. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system is inclusive. It empowers people to have control over their money. Coming from Brazil, I saw hyperinflation first-hand, so I knew the value of having optionality and not relying on one single government-controlled central bank or large banking corporations.  At a glance, proof-of-work (PoW) sounds like something righteous and fair: It gives power to whoever does the work. In Bitcoin’s case, that means the miners. Unfortunately, words can be misleading. Although it seems like PoW empowers actual people to make money, today the power is really in the hands of companies that run massive node operations.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Breno Araujo is the founder and CEO of Boto.  There is a real incentive to centralize the mining operations that run and secure the Bitcoin network, due to economies of scale. The larger the miner’s operation is, the more cost-efficient it will be, maximizing its rewards. And smaller miners are pushed out. Of course, bitcoin mining's evolution from something you can do on your laptop, to the dominance of graphics processing units (GPUs) and later ASICs (or application-specific chips) is well known.  This centralization can be seen in the numbers. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, at one point in October 2021, 10% of the miners controlled 90% of the Bitcoin network, and .01% controlled about 50% of the network. 50% is all that is needed to take control of the network. Even today, it's likely the same few dozen miners that have dominated bitcoin mining for years, even though many have been routed by the bear market.  The whole thing starts to resemble an oligarchy. Are bitcoin miners just oligarchic technocrats?  Proof-of-stake is a plutocracy?  None of this is meant to excuse proof-of-stake, the supposedly eco-friendly option when it comes to securing blockchains. When moving from PoW to PoS, the Ethereum Foundation cited the environmental benefits of the move as one of the key arguments for the change. It's hard to deny the Merge helped reduce Ethereum's carbon footprint, but it's worth noting who really benefited – after all fees barely budged, and now Ethereum's rich are only getting richer if they stake their capital.  It's no reason why so many call proof-of-stake a plutocracy. Money talks. With Coinbase holding 11.5% of all staked ether (ETH), it effectively has a 11.5% say on what happens to the network. Imagine if a single company had 11.5% of the votes on what the Federal Reserve should do (not to suggest that the Fed is democratic). You might say you trust Brian Armstrong more than Biden. And might even describe the U.S. economy as a plutocracy. But at least the U.S. rule by elites is informal, not enshrined as the official voting mechanism like Ethereum did.  Alligning incentives  Governance is about power, and power is all about incentives. I am a firm believer that if you want anyone to do anything, you need to align their incentives. And the more we can incentivize all players towards the same goal, the better. It may not always be possible to achieve equilibrium with incentives alone, but with so many things including crypto here are ways to design non-zero-sum games.  Today PoW and PoS blockchains have conflicting interests between miners/validators and network users. Users would benefit from faster and cheaper transactions, but in general, this will increase costs to miners and validators, reducing their profits. A version of this conflict came up during Bitcoin's Blocksize War, where some argued to increase the amount of data in a mined Bitcoin block, theoretically making transactions faster and cheaper. The corresponding cost for miners would be higher with bigger blocks, but fees would be lower. Who won out?  Conflict is not inherently bad, as it can lead to good outcomes. But when power is exercised unilateral, it's important to be aware of the potential conflicting interests that can lead to unfair outcomes. Of course, bitcoiners would say the small blockers were democratic, and that keeping the cost of running a node down is ultimately beneficial for Bitcoin's decentralization, as more people would be able to validate the network.  But the two sides of the debate always reminded me of the Prisoners' Dilemma though experiment in game theory, where two criminals are being questioned by authorities and each can either lie or confess. In this case both are incentivized to act selfishly and blame the other, leading to a sub-optimal outcome for both parties.  Are we doomed?  Thankfully there are more options than just PoW and PoS, and other consensus mechanisms are being explored. At a fundamental level, the most important thing blockchain developers can do is find a way to align incentivizes between miners and users.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Has a Superpower | Mining Week 2023  Going back to the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi's crownng achievement may have been solving the Byzantine Generals Problem – another popular game theory experiment – for a digital cash system. In short, Satoshi discovered that a distributed pool of miners could be incentivized to agree on a single truth (in Bitcoin's case, which ""block chain"" is canonical) without having to trust a centralized authority, through the laws of economics.  What we've since discovered however is that those same fundamental economic laws mean that too often miners win when users lose. I don't know if there is a sustainable way to turn mining into a non-sum-game, but I imagine we might again learn something from politics. Wouldn't it be nice if we took money out of democratic systems, and wouldn't it be nice miners/validators were incentivized by something other than direct monetary rewards?",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | MINING,Breno Araujo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/26/bitcoin-mining-is-an-oligopoly-and-proof-of-stake-isnt-any-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1cbb3c5ee972b05a2823461ba269600107766658-1960x1102.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While top coins painted charts red with bearish moves, MKR added over 3% in the last 24 hours, bringing its price to $1,139.92 at 9:25 am EST. This bullish momentum coming amid a bear market trend suggests that special factors might be behind it. Maker (MKR) Soars Amid New Governance Proposals Maker made the top gainers’ list on Wednesday, July 26, closely behind Compound (COMP) with 3.18% 24-hour price growth and XDC Network with an over 16% seven-day gain. Related Reading: Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed? Maker’s price saw a boost due to increased ecosystem activities as the Maker Governance votes to approve or reject the new Spark Protocol changes commence. This vote was a result of Phoenix Labs’ proposed key adjustments to Spark Protocol DAI market parameters to enhance user experience. Among Phoenix Labs’ recommendations is the adjustment Wrapped Ether (WETH) Variable Rate Slope from 1% to 3%. This adjustment is touted to encourage a healthy utilization of the DAI market, enhancing supplier return and incentivizing deposits. It also proposed to set the DAI market loan-to-value and liquidation threshold (LTV/LT) to 0.01% and adjust the WETH market reserve factor to 5%. The adjustments will reduce the protocol fee on the ETH market and give suppliers a larger APY. If approved, the proposed changes will raise Spark D3M’s debt ceiling to 200 million DAI and set DAI Market LTV/LT to zero. Given the potential benefits these changes could provide DAI borrowers, market activity would increase, boosting MKR’s demand as the Maker protocol utility token. The voting started on July 24 and has attracted much attention from Maker community members. Maker’s trading activity has increased as community members hurry to participate in the poll before the deadline on Thursday, July 27. Moreover, as the governance token of the Maker protocol and MakerDAO, the ongoing poll has increased trading activity and demand for MKR. The increased MKR trading volume confirms this assumption. Whale Alerts Draw More Investor Attention To Maker As of July 26—9:25 EST, MKR’s trading volume stood at $121.71 million, an over 47% rise from the previous day’s value, according to CoinMarketCap data. MKR traded at a high of $1,172.12 and a low of $1,118.93 over the past 24 hours. Lookonchain also observed a significant exchange inflow and outflow on July 25. According to the on-chain sleuth, a whale dumped 1,598 MKR, worth approximately $1.8 million, after amassing chunks of tokens since June 22, when prices were below $1,000. The whale withdrew 2,760 MKR, approximately $2.5 million, from Binance from July 7 to July 17 at an average value of $918 per token and discharged them when the price increased. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised For A Major Breakout – Which Way Will It Go? While the whale effect pushed MKR’s price down 2%, it also reflected the massive investor interest in the token and drew more attention to MKR. As such, the token soared higher in the days following the transaction and continued bullish with the governance vote. This demonstrates the high demand for the token given that it soaked up the supply from the whale without issue.

42410116,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLrz,1690387200,A Wall Street (Crypto) Analyst’s Take on ChainLink: Crypto Long & Short,"Old habits do indeed die hard, it seems. I used to work as an equity analyst, conducting research and initiating coverage of different companies within the small-cap, oil-and-gas industry.  The process was relatively straightforward:  select a firm to cover  research the firm  build a financial model and investment thesis  publish a report for the public  The fifth step may or may not have been “hope for an investment banking relationship shortly thereafter,” but far be it from me to be cynical.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  At any rate, as part of our ever-expanding efforts to provide value at CoinDesk, I’m resorting to past practices and expanding my crypto coverage universe. What follows is my first attempt to write an equity analyst–style report on a digital asset. Given the often-opaque nature of this space, I think it’s necessary, to a certain extent. Honestly, outside of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the general public may have trouble discerning the use case for one versus another.  Keep in mind that this is not financial advice, and, as such, I will refrain from assigning price targets for tokens. It’s essentially an initiation and declaration of asset coverage, using a combination of fundamental, technical and on-chain analysis.  Over time, and as coverage continues, the goal is to provide periodic updates when something pertinent or impactful to the asset occurs.  The first asset, ChainLink (LINK), is a member of the CoinDesk Indices Computing sector and recently appeared on a moving-average screen whereby its 10-period exponential moving average crossed above its 100-day moving average.  ChainLink (LINK/USD)  Coverage Date: July 26, 2023  Price: $7.53  Market Cap: $7.5 Billion  Circulating Supply: 538 Million LINK  Max Supply: 1 Billion LINK  Comparable TradFi Market Caps: BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ), $8.61 Billion; Southwestern Energy (SWN), $6.9 Billion  Summary  ChainLink is a “decentralized oracle network” (DON) that seems to serve as a bridge between on-chain and off-chain data, essentially linking smart contract platforms with external data sources. Examples of transmitted data often include – but are not limited to – price feeds, along with payment confirmations.  LINK tries to solve the “oracle problem,” which it defines as a blockchain’s “inability to natively pull data from or push data to an external off-chain system.”  Read more: What Is an Oracle?  ChainLink’s network consists of multiple independent, decentralized oracles that facilitate the retrieval and validation of data between on-chain and off-chain sources. The desired result, and ultimately its value proposition, is that the ChainLink network will help developers build better and more efficient blockchain applications that users will benefit from. Security and reliability of data appear to be core tenets of ChainLink.  Its native token, LINK, serves as the payment mechanism on the network itself. ChainLink users pay LINK to access oracle services. Holders of LINK are also able to stake the asset itself for additional returns on various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  Bullish Considerations  On a technical basis, LINK prices have been in an uptrend since June 20, following a 40% decline between April 19 and June 19.  Prices have appreciated approximately 5.7% since its 10-period moving average crossed above its 100-day moving average on July 13. In prior times such a crossover has occurred, LINK has gained 16.4% on average over the next 30 days.  Its current RSI of 59 has, in the past, preceded 30-day increases of 11.6% historically.  ChainLink has seven primary areas of focus:  undefined  The result of ChainLink’s efforts has led to an expanding network of oracles, meant to increase the reliability of data transfer.  One timely feature that ChainLink boasts is its “Proof-of-Reserves” (PoR) offering, meant to bring transparency and verification of third-party reserves. (In other words, proving that firms really have the assets they claim to have.) Paxos, TrueUSD and BitGo are among ChainLink’s PoR customers.  Bearish Concerns  Proof-of-Reserves may not be all that it’s cracked up to be. As reported by CoinDesk’s Sam Kessler, ChainLink’s PoR offering relies heavily on self-attestation. That means projects using the PoR service provide the reserves data. It’s not difficult to see where the potential for conflicts of interest may arise.  To ChainLink’s credit, they are forthright about this on their website. Additionally, they require that attestation methods be publicly disclosed.  The general public may miss this fact, however, which could cause reputational concerns for ChainLink if the attestations are faulty, even if ChainLink isn’t to blame.  Technically, LINK has a long way to go as its price remains a great deal away from its all-time high of $52.  Despite the recent crossovers and current RSI, prices have retraced over the most recent three days, indicating short-term profit taking. Sans a new catalyst, there may be a dearth of new buyers entering the market for LINK.  Finally, LINK’s most-recent breach of its upper Bollinger Band indicates that prices could retrace as well.  A strategy that some traders may consider is to monitor whether LINK’s price declines toward its 20-day average of $6.92 before increasing and/or decreasing their holdings.  All told, this is the first of a number of assets that we plan to expand coverage on. As we do so, communication with the wider ChainLink community is valued as well, as we attempt to provide our readership with insights about the digital-asset landscape.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  XXX: Look, nobody can reasonably look at dogecoin (DOGE) and say, “Yeah, that’s how money normally works.” And for some people, that’s the good news. They want this – a currency (and affiliated sports car) emblazoned with a dog’s face. For everyone else, even people amped up about crypto’s future, the appeal of a meme coin like DOGE is tiny, at best. And, yet, you can make a case that the future of DOGE is the future of crypto as a whole. CoinDesk’s Helene Braun kinda makes that argument here, noting that Elon Musk overhauling Twitter – turning it into an everything app called X – could be good news for crypto. Musk loves DOGE and you’d have to be asleep to not notice he likes doing outrageous things. Making DOGE and other cryptocurrencies an integral part of his planned payments platform feels like a natural move for him. And maybe that drives crypto toward the elusive goal of mainstream adoption.  FED UP: Moving money from point A to point B in the U.S. is bizarrely slow compared with how it works elsewhere. Americans still sometimes write paper checks! (Crypto could improve that, but much of Washington seems opposed to embracing crypto, so let’s ignore that for now.) The Federal Reserve just (finally) opened its FedNow service that promises instant payments. Some crypto fans worry about this. They view it as a gateway to a digital dollar that could impede crypto’s growth in the U.S. Officially, the Fed downplays any link, publicly anyway. Guess we’ll see.  DEFI DEAD? Talk to people who build and think about market infrastructure (the geeks – like me – call it “market structure”), and they get real excited about DeFi. It’s a sandbox where they can, in theory, build a whole new way of doing markets and finance. (I wrote an article that addressed this in my prior life at Bloomberg.) With the caveat that this bill likely is going nowhere fast, here’s a story about a new U.S. Senate bill that seeks to regulate DeFi like it was a bank. That doesn’t have to be a disaster for DeFi, but a clampdown could threaten the decentralized ethos of decentralized finance. Remember, the whole point of DeFi is you write some code that lets people do finance-y stuff in a relatively lightweight manner. But imagine how bogged down that gets if stringent regulations are dumped on top of it. Undermines the appeal, doesn’t it?

42410102,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLKv,1690387200,Crypto Must Take Fraud Prevention Seriously: Crypto Long & Short,"For months, the crypto landscape has been plagued by regulatory uncertainty. Recent events, including the split Ripple decision, the indictment of Celsius’ former CEO and competing congressional bills serve as reminders of the pressing need for guidance.  Rather than passively waiting for ideal regulations or hoping for a regulation-free environment, as we saw with false reports of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler's resignation, it is imperative that we shift our focus towards action grounded in expertise and sound judgment.  Despite the ongoing debate regarding the adoption of a traditional finance (TradFi) framework for crypto, it is clear that regulation looms ahead. This trajectory is evident from enforcement cases in the U.S. and the issuance of prudential guidance notes from Europe and Asia. There is also a growing consensus that crypto users require protection from theft, fraud and manipulation. Addressing these challenges necessitates taking action through due diligence efforts and consensus-driven measures.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  When evaluating a crypto investment in this environment, it becomes crucial to investigate the project’s governance, risk and compliance (GRC) approach, especially with regard to fraud prevention. Due diligence should show a tech GRC program informed by U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) guidelines and smart risk mitigations that reflect planning for what is ahead. By way of example, this includes:  undertaking security audits  adhering to public communication standards  ensuring the team possesses adequate experience and conducts conflicts of interest checks  maintaining standards for confidentiality and adherence to NDAs  conducting global sanctions and new product launch testing  managing a regulatory developments strategy  As Europe, Asia and the U.S. compete to become the global hub for crypto, those who enable regulatory technology (regtech) while avoiding reliance on legacy bureaucratic approaches will be a breakaway leader. The Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) reveals that despite significant investments in GRC programs for traditional companies, effective anti-fraud measures remain elusive. It is time to retire failing legacy regimes and seize the opportunity to innovate using the transparency and agility offered by blockchain technology.  To thrive in the crypto space amid regulatory challenges, proactive steps are vital. By prioritizing due diligence and embracing consensus-driven measures, investors and participants can shape the growth of the crypto ecosystem. Taking the lead in regulatory innovation will lay a strong foundation for the crypto's future. Fraud prevention must be imperative to foster trust and credibility.

The project started in March with wallet design. The first stablecoin was minted in July and the test will run through August, Anson said. The stablecoin will run on the XRP ledger. Ripple, which contributes to the ledger, has been providing technical assistance and personnel, and Palau will also be leveraging Ripple's CBDC platform, a company press release said. In 2021, the country said it would work with Ripple to develop strategies for a digital currency.  ""We’ve been distributing PSC (Palau Stablecoin) for three weeks. Today is our first official press release,"" Anson said in the tweet. A further announcement is due on Thursday.  There's no guarantee the nation of 20,000 people, which does not have a central bank and uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, will continue with the project once the test is over.  ""We will send a report to the president and congress with recommendations whether or not the stablecoin is a good program for Palau,"" Anson told CoinDesk. ""Next steps after that will depend on what the government authorities authorize.""  The country has also partnered with blockchain research firm Cryptic Labs to launch what it said is the world’s first digital residency program, and once people apply for this they will get a non-fungible token (NFT) representing their resident ID cards that gives them access to Palau-based perks like shipping services and a physical address. It is also working on establishing a crypto exchange, Palau President Surangel S. Whipps, Jr. told CoinDesk in a January interview.

42410113,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLlN,1690385601,"Once a Pioneer, Cosmos Blockchain Project Faces 'Existential' Crisis","The early days of the blockchain industry were defined by maximalists. A winner-takes-all mindset pervaded crypto Twitter and blockchain forums, with fans of each new project – be it Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Cardano – hell-bent on convincing others that its chain would be the chain to snuff competitors and take the tech mainstream.  In recent years, this absolutist mindset has fallen mostly out of vogue, with new blockchains launching every day alongside “bridge” infrastructure to help them communicate with one another.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  At the forefront of this shift was Cosmos – the blockchain ecosystem that helped to pioneer the “appchain” (blockchains dedicated to specific applications), shared security, and the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that now powers Ethereum and most newer blockchains.  Cosmos set out to create not one blockchain, but a family of them – each engineered for its own use case but set up to easily communicate and swap assets back and forth. Once considered a technical marvel in the world of blockchain infrastructure, the Cosmos SDK – the software development kit that allows anyone to build a Cosmos-based blockchain – was at one point the go-to toolbox for any developer looking to spin up a network.  But among the blockchain ecosystems that have been hit hardest by crypto’s market meltdown, Cosmos sits near the top of the list.  The spectacular collapse of Terra – at one point one of the largest Cosmos-based blockchains – left a liquidity hole in Cosmos’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem that it has yet to recover from. Politics and infighting – both a feature and a bug of Cosmos’s open-source development model – have been blamed for slowing down development. Now, newer blockchain-in-a-box projects have proliferated, particularly in the Ethereum ecosystem, which put Cosmos at risk of becoming obsolete in a category it once monopolized.  It also can’t help that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission thinks that ATOM, the crypto token most closely associated with the Cosmos ecosystem, is a security.  According to Zaki Manian, a leading figurehead in the Cosmos community and the co-founder of Sommelier, the next year for Cosmos may well be “existential.”  “Cosmos has, I would say, like eight to nine months, maybe a year at most, to kind of find a way to create something unique and distinctive, something that differentiates itself and makes it feel like some coherent thing that's separate from Ethereum or separate from the rest of the blockchain space,“ Manian told CoinDesk this week.  “I think we have the raw ingredients to have a shot.”  Multichain crypto  Every blockchain has limitations. Bitcoin, the first-ever blockchain, can’t do much beyond moving bitcoins from one address to another. It’s a limitation that maximalists say is intentional – making the no-frills bitcoin asset a better candidate to become “digital gold.” However, for traders now accustomed to the flashy NFTs and DeFi apps of other chains, basic bitcoin can leave them wanting more.  Ethereum introduced the world to smart contracts – the blockchain-based computer programs that anyone can create to power those new lending apps and NFT exchanges. However, the network’s high fees (upwards of $14 for a simple token swap) and relative sluggishness (around 27 transactions per second, versus over 1,600 per second on the Visa card system) have left room for newer blockchains to serve particularly demanding use cases, such as gaming.  As the tradeoffs of different blockchain designs have grown more obvious, the blockchain industry – and the Ethereum ecosystem in particular – has gradually coalesced behind the idea of a “multichain” universe, where different blockchains peacefully co-exist to serve different use cases.  The multichain ecosystem of old was plagued with security issues, however. Of particular concern were the cross-chain bridges used to move assets between disparate networks. Bugs in those bridges – or in the blockchains they carried assets to and from – led to high-profile exploits like the Ronin bridge hack, which siphoned over $600 million to alleged North Korean hackers.  Among the first projects to push a solution to the multichain security quandary was Cosmos. Built by a firm called Tendermint (now called Ignite), and now maintained by a wider consortium of developers and companies, Cosmos “appchains” were designed to interoperate from day one – a technical distinction that drastically reduced the surface area for potential bridge hacks. Among Cosmos’s key differentiators were the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which allowed assets to easily flow between chains, and Interchain Security (ICS), which allowed newer blockchains to borrow the security apparatus of existing networks.  Even as IBC and ICS were still in development, Cosmos was one of the biggest beneficiaries of 2019’s DeFi boom and the subsequent crypto craze. As startups raced to build new blockchains during the frothy, low-interest rate funding environment of 2019-2021, they frequently turned to Cosmos’s open-source developer toolkit, or SDK, which was then among the few ways to quickly build a new blockchain network.  “In 2019 there were two toolkits: there was Substrate and then there was the Cosmos SDK,” recalled Manian. “As a practical matter, everyone used the Cosmos SDK.”  Cosmos supplied the building blocks behind Binance’s popular BNB blockchain, the once-massive Terra blockchain, and the Cosmos Hub, the original Cosmos chain, whose ATOM token consistently hovers towards the top of crypto market charts.  As a bonus for using Cosmos, teams could boast environmental sustainability. The two largest blockchains – Bitcoin and Ethereum – used a power-hungry “proof-of-work” model to power their networks. Cosmos chains use “proof-of-stake” – a system that forgoes the energy-intensive practice of crypto mining and has since been embraced by a growing number of different blockchains, including Ethereum.  The Terra problem  Whatever its early advantages, Cosmos has begun losing its grip on developers in recent months.  In the earliest days of 2022’s crypto market crash – while Sam Bankman-Fried and his FTX crypto exchange could still convincingly claim solvency – the Cosmos ecosystem was already beset by catastrophe. In May of 2022, Do Kwon’s “decentralized” digital dollar, Terra USD (UST), fell in price from $1 to below a penny in the span of a few days.  Terra tried (and failed) to use algorithms – rather than collateral – to keep UST at the price of $1. The project was built using Cosmos and was therefore compatible with other Cosmos-based chains. As the market caps of UST and its sister token, LUNA, initially climbed above $40 billion, much of that money flowed into a budding suite of Cosmos-based DeFi apps.  When UST and LUNA crashed, so did Cosmos’s DeFi ecosystem.  Osmosis, Cosmos’s main decentralized exchange (DEX) chain, boasted nearly $1.7 billion worth of liquidity at its February 2022 peak – a sum representing the total value of deposits into the platform for swapping Cosmos-based tokens. By June 2022, a month after Terra’s collapse, Osmosis liquidity had dropped to $150 million. Another year later, it sits even lower, at $116 million. (By comparison, Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum and several other blockchains, dropped from around $7 billion to $3.8 billion since Terra collapsed – a 46% drop versus 93% on Cosmos.)  Less liquidity on Cosmos means less incentive for developers to deploy apps into the ecosystem.  “In many ways, it's faded from people's minds, what Terra meant to the Cosmos ecosystem,” Manian told CoinDesk in February – nearly a year after Terra collapsed. “I think the hit has been massive.”  New competition  Terra doesn’t bear complete blame for deterring developers. Cosmos SDK’s key features – its sustainability, shared security and interoperability – are also no longer as rare as they once were.  Cosmos helped to trailblaze proof-of-stake consensus and continues to claim its low carbon footprint as a key advantage on its website. But proof-of-stake is no longer a differentiator. In addition to serving as the foundation for most newer blockchains, Ethereum – the most-trafficked chain other than Bitcoin – shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022 with its highly-publicized “Merge.”  Shared security was also supposed to be key value-add for Cosmos, enabling upstart blockchains to borrow the security apparatus of other networks. Cosmos introduced the functionality this year with a feature called Interchain Security (ICS), but a buzzy new project on Ethereum, called EigenLayer, has launched with similar capabilities.  Cosmos’s dominance in the chain-building space has also faded with the entrance of new competitors.  Ethereum’s community has looked to expand the ecosystem via third-party scaling networks, called rollups, that allow users to transact more quickly and cheaply than on the main chain, but without losing the base network’s essential security guarantees.  Recently, virtually every big rollup project has opted to release its technology out into the open for other teams to pick up and use. The “blockchain-in-a-box” pitches from Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon and other rollup providers look similar to that of the Cosmos SDK – as do key features like customizability, shared security, low fees and interoperability.  A clear new frontrunner in the blockchain toolkit race is Optimism, whose OP Stack toolkit was used to power – among other new networks – Base, the new blockchain from Coinbase, and Mantle, a new chain linked to the Bybit exchange.  “We were pretty much batting 100 for exchange chains, where every exchange, when they started to ship a blockchain, was using Cosmos SDK,” lamented Manian. “Now, two of the biggest exchanges have picked different technology stacks.”  Even Binance’s BNB chain, which was built using the Cosmos SDK, has begun testing a version of its network that runs using the OP Stack.  Appchain vs. interoperability  Cosmos still has plenty going for it in terms of its technical bona fides.  dYdX, one of the largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, decided last year to move to a new Cosmos chain after finding Ethereum too expensive and sluggish for its use case.  Other projects in the Cosmos community hope that dYdX’s upcoming Cosmos app, which is currently in testing, will replenish some of the users and liquidity that Cosmos lost with Terra’s collapse. The migration has already been helpful: Circle, the company behind USDC, the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, announced plans to mint its coin directly onto Cosmos – a move timed to align with the new app from dYdX, one of USDC’s biggest users.  Cosmos’s boosters also claim their toolkit – though it now lags behind some newer tools in terms of its overall ease of use – still provides more flexibility to builders.  “There’s ‘interoperability’ and there's 'appchain,'” explained Manian. According to the Sommelier co-founder, Ethereum’s layer 2 toolkits only allow for “interoperability” – enabling people to code up new chains that can easily talk to one another and send assets back and forth. These aren’t “appchains,” according to Manian, because they still rely on Ethereum for their security and other core functionality.  Manian says that Cosmos, by contrast, allows developers to “vertically integrate as much as possible,” meaning they can control every facet of how their blockchains are designed – from how quickly they settle transactions, to the rules they use to power their security.  When it comes to Ethereum’s rollup toolkits, Manian argues that “their actual ability to build an appchain is actually at a pretty early stage. They could never have built what dYdX has built.”  Looking ahead  Beyond the technical, Cosmos still has other headwinds.  For one thing, the SEC lumped ATOM in with a list of crypto “securities” in its recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. A securities designation is rarely good news for a crypto project, but Cosmos wasn’t the only project targeted this time around – Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and several others were also listed. Moreover, while ATOM is deeply ingrained into Cosmos’s leading DeFi apps, its core infrastructure doesn’t rely on ATOM to function.  Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman was unwilling to comment on the SEC suits to CoinDesk.  Perhaps a larger problem than technical obsolescence or securities laws is Cosmos’s own community. Even in the raucous world of crypto, Cosmos’s open-source developer community is among the wildest. Its history is replete with mass resignations, lawsuits, and allegations of decentralized voter fraud.  Jae Kwon, one of the ecosystem’s founders, remains one of the more controversial figures in the blockchain world. His return last year to Ignite – the development firm he co-founded to build Cosmos, but left following a leadership dispute in 2020 – was accompanied by layoffs and strategic shifts that have largely backseated Cosmos infrastructure development to other priorities.  As a result, the ecosystem has less of a clear organizing structure than similar projects – with a hodge-podge of non-profits, development firms, and lone-wolf engineers all playing some role in pushing the technology forward.  There are, of course, some disadvantages to Cosmos’s messy politics. Community governance disputes frequently lead to technical setbacks – like when a long-planned, strategically important “revamp” for the Cosmos Hub blockchain was sidelined by a contentious community vote.  “I have often felt that the like organizational drama we've experienced in Cosmos is just the universe's way of giving everyone else a chance to catch up because we were so far ahead,” said Buchman, in a panel discussion on Tuesday.  The politics have also led to some reputational baggage. As dYdX prepared for its shift to Cosmos, its CEO, Antonio Juliano, tweeted “I specifically don’t want dYdX’s brand to be too associated with cosmos.” The rationale behind this statement, according to Juliano, didn’t have anything to do with Cosmos drama. According to the dYdX founder in that same Twitter thread, “[a]pps should transcend any particular technology they are built on,” and “[t]his is not to say we aren’t huge fans of cosmos.”  However, some on Cosmos Twitter interpreted Juliano’s remarks as a veiled critique of the community’s antics – a sign that they would need to tame themselves or risk repelling future builders.  On the other hand, it’s from this chaos that comes some of Cosmos’s beauty. If the Cosmos experiment does succeed, its proponents say it will hold a truer claim to the mantle of “decentralization” than competing projects led by centralized companies or pseudo-decentralized foundations. While Cosmos has its own grant programs and informal hierarchy, its core infrastructure and many of its most popular projects are maintained bottom-up by a passionate base of builders.  “There's this philosophy and set of values that shines through that is really, you know, tuned to the hacker culture of openness and experimentation,” Buchman told CoinDesk. “Those values are going to be true in the long term, and despite all these short-term market setbacks, that's the kind of thing that's gonna win in the end.”  As for what success actually looks like, many of Cosmos’s core contributions to the blockchain space – early models for interoperability, proof-of-stake, and shared security – have already crept their way toward ubiquity, meaning they’ve been validated by the wider industry.  Despite his existential prognostications, Manian said he is confident that Cosmos will continue on in some form. He just hopes its vibrant builder ecosystem doesn’t fade into the background.  “I think the big question,” he said, “is whether or not Cosmos continues to exist as an identifiable, distinct thing, or it just gets swallowed up into: 'Oh, it's just one toolkit that you can use to build an appchain.'”  Correction (July 26, 20:10 UTC): Terra USD is known as UST.",NEGATIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/26/once-a-pioneer-cosmos-blockchain-project-faces-existential-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a13c171a5903ed75bf096932824bbda33611c8a-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15317988,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544435,1690383654,Bitcoin Exchange Supply Only Slips Further Despite Price Decline,"On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin exchange supply has only continued to slip further recently despite the price drop to the $29,200 that BTC has observed. Bitcoin Exchange Supply Has Declined To Just 1.17 Million BTC Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the latest decline in the price doesn’t look to have triggered a severe reaction from the market yet. The relevant indicator here is the “supply on exchanges,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin supply that’s currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are making a net amount of deposits to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why the holders would transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the price. On the other hand, the indicator’s value decreasing suggests the investors are taking coins off to self-custodial wallets, potentially to hold onto them for extended periods. Naturally, such accumulation can have a bullish effect on the asset in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply on exchanges over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has observed a constant downtrend during the last few months or so. This means that the investors have been consistently taking their coins off these platforms during this period despite price declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Red, US Institutions Disinterested? Interestingly, this decline in the indicator continued even when the rally above $30,000 had occurred in the middle of June. Generally, during such sharp price surges, it’s not rare to see the metric rise, as some investors would be looking to harvest their profits. But not only had deposits not occurred in this rally, but the supply on exchanges had also instead plunged especially hard back then, suggesting that there may have been some heavy buying taking place in the market, which would have acted as fuel for the surge. In the past week, Bitcoin has registered a decline towards the low $29,000 level, but the indicator has still only continued to head down, implying that this price drop hasn’t been enough to trigger a mass panic-selling reaction from investors. The current trend in this metric is naturally a positive sign for the cryptocurrency’s value, as it means that at least another selloff may not be probable to take place in the immediate future. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch With the latest downward move in the supply on exchanges, only 1.17 million BTC is left in the wallets of these platforms now. This value is around 12% lower than back during the beginning of May, which is a significant drop. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,200, down 2% in the last week.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said it was basing its proposals on those put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December, which could determine the extent to which the traditional financial system gets on board with blockchain innovations.  “Deposit-taking institutions and insurers need clarity on how to treat crypto-asset exposures when it comes to capital and liquidity,” said Peter Routledge, Superintendent of Financial Institutions, in a statement. “We look forward to giving them this clarity through these new guidelines that reflect industry input and international standards.”  The plans give banks the choice between a more comprehensive formula which differentiates among crypto based on perceived risk, or a simpler but less discriminating option.  In December, international standard-setters proposed to treat unbacked crypto as the riskiest kind of asset for banks to hold, with lenders limited in how much bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) they can hold. Jurisdictions such as the European Union have already taken measures to legislate those changes.

42410103,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLRX,1690382720,Bitcoin Miners Buy Up Rigs as Prices Near All-Time Lows,"The prices of bitcoin mining rigs – hardware machines used to verify and add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain – have slid to near their all-time lows in the past year due to falling profitability, and miners are taking advantage of this opportunity to stay ahead of the competition.  Profitability has been on the decline as a result of bitcoin price volatility, higher energy costs, hashrate growth and increasing network difficulty. When the rigs make less money, the prices of the machines themselves decline, Colin Harper, content head at Luxor Mining, told CoinDesk.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  The newest generation of mining rigs, which use 25 joules of energy or less per terahash (TH) of computing power, including the Bitmain’s S19 XP and WhatsMiner M50S series, have seen prices drop by 66% to $20 per terahash from $60 per TH since July 2022, according to Luxor Mining’s Hashrate Index data. Mining rig prices are often quoted in dollars per terahash of mining power.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Prices for older bitcoin mining rig models are also dropping, according to the data.  Mining rigs are getting cheaper mainly due to a decline in bitcoin’s hashprice, the revenue miners generate per terahash of computing power. This measure of profitability, which factors in Bitcoin’s network difficulty, price, energy costs, block subsidies and transaction fees, has been “choppy and steadily decreasing” in the past year, Harper said.  Read more: The Ever More Efficient Bitcoin Mining Machine  The fall in prices for mining rigs comes as miners are gearing up for the fourth Bitcoin halving, expected in April 2024. A halving is a highly anticipated event that takes place roughly every four years, where the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block is cut in half.  This reduction is designed into the blockchain’s codebase to control its supply economics. Eventually, the rewards reach zero as the number of bitcoins mined approaches its pre-designated 21 million block cap. The next halving is expected to lower the reward to 3.125 BTC per block from the current 6.25 BTC.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  Buying opportunity  The miners, facing almost double the mining cost overnight to achieve the same revenue once the halving occurs, will need more efficient machines to keep down costs.  Currently it costs around at least $10,000-$15,000 per bitcoin to profitably mine a block. After the halving, the cost could rise as high as $40,000 per bitcoin, according to some analysts, making the most efficient machines a necessity.  The drop in prices for the newer-generation models seems to have provided opportunities for some miners to scoop up the machines they’ll need to stay profitable after the halving. For example, in April, CleanSpark purchased roughly $145 million worth of Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive  As the miners come to realize the need to use newer generation machines heading into the halving, prices of these computers - clocking an efficiency of under 25 J/TH – are starting to tick up. According to Luxor data, prices for these rigs have increased 5% in the past month or so.  Luxor’s Harper said miners will opt for newer mining rigs with higher efficiencies and computing power compared to older models.

15316499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544479,1690380041,"LayerZero Crosses This Significant Milestone, But Is An Airdrop Coming?","Cross-Chain communication protocol platform LayerZero has crossed 50 million cross-chain messages, as revealed by the platform on Tuesday, July 25. This significant milestone proves the massive trading activity and cross-chain token swaps that happen across several chains daily. LayerZero’s Impressive Growth The ‘50-million cross-chain messages’ is undoubtedly a testament to how much LayerZero has achieved in the space. Due to the project’s disruptive vision, it has received enormous backing from some of the ecosystem’s biggest Venture Capitalists (VC). Related Reading: Fundstrat Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $180,000 In 2024, But What’s The Catalyst? Three months ago, LayerZero raised $120 million from prominent backers like auction company Christie’s, renowned VC firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, Capital market company Samsung Next, OpenSea Ventures, and Circle Ventures. What is more impressive is that LayerZero was valued at $3 billion during this Series B funding round, almost three times its $135 million valuation during the funding round held back in 2022. This remarkable feat has also come during the lingering crypto bear market when many have felt that the outlook in the industry will be negative. That is why it is easy to share the sentiments of the CEO of LayerZero Labs when he stated: LayerZero is to blockchains what the internet was to computing clusters. LayerZero allows chains not only to build bridges (to transfer assets/value between them) but send and execute arbitrary data just like a packet on the internet. What this means is that you can now build applications that are orders of magnitude more complex than existing applications and do so with a completely seamless experience between chains. Blockchain interoperability remains the foremost issue in the Web3 space. Furthermore, this has greatly hindered some from venturing into the space, and it is well-known that if crypto is to enjoy mainstream adoption, this issue needs to be dealt with. That is why interoperability protocols like LayerZero are key in the blockchain ecosystem. It is common knowledge that the interoperability issue stems from how blockchains have different protocols and standards that make them incompatible. However, platforms like LayerZero bridge this gap by facilitating seamless and direct communication between different blockchain networks, making it easy for users on networks like Ethereum, Aptos, Solana, and SUI to move their digital assets across these chains. “Wen Airdrop?” The question of if LayerZero will carry out an airdrop has been on the lips of many members of the LayerZero community. Although the team has been tight-lipped over whether or not there will indeed be an airdrop to users, the signs are becoming more glaring that one may, in fact, be on the horizon. Related Reading: Worldcoin Founder’s Refusal To Answer Token Distribution Question Sparks Controversy With so much success in the last year and so much money raised, it is possible that LayerZero is already working on its native token. If the platform was looking to reward the users who have supported it all this time, then an airdrop would be the most likely avenue to do so. However, with no talk of even a token launch, it is hard to determine if LayerZero will conduct an airdrop.

The Milano Hub, the Italian central bank’s center for developing innovative ideas in finance, will support the development of the so-called Institutional DeFi for Security Token ecosystem for six months, the press release said. The platform aims to help traditional financial institutions to experiment with security tokens and execute transactions using DeFi rails in a safe, regulated manner.  The initiative comes as central banks globally work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and explore ways to incorporate blockchain technology into the existing payment system. Meanwhile, tokenization has become one of the hottest trends in crypto as TradFi institutions and digital asset firms are placing old-school instruments, including bonds and equities, onto the blockchain.  A Bank of America report said that tokenization “may reshape how value is transferred, settled and stored across every industry,” making transactions faster, lowering costs and creating a more efficient financial infrastructure.

The project will involve Italian banks, asset managers and financial institutions, according to the press release, including the country’s largest banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, with more than $1 trillion (975 million EUR) in total assets under management.  “We believe it is vitally important to create the conditions for DeFi to become a safe and open operating environment for supervised entities as well,” Imanuel Baharier, general manager of Cetif Advisory, said in a statement.

These companies – Core Scientific (CORZ), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Bitfarms (BITF), Iris Energy (IREN) and CleanSpark (CLSK) – have traded up 947%, 442%, 300%, 458% and 212%, respectively. That said, at the beginning of the crypto bear market last year, almost all of these stocks were hit harder than bitcoin.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  This trend has led to the notion that mining stocks act as a high beta bitcoin trade. Beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility.  If we consider the “overall market” to be bitcoin, all the aforementioned mining stocks have seen greater than 1.0 beta (on various lookback time periods) to bitcoin, suggesting they do in fact offer that high beta bitcoin trade (i.e. additional upside or downside on trading bitcoin alone).",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/26/public-mining-companies-offer-better-than-bitcoin-price-exposure-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/560c8907ac26ec8258aeb6d32c3d09b857e31446-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410122,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLvI,1690378761,Bitcoin Mining Machine Efficiency Doubled in Five Years,"Sometimes an idea, stated simply and dramatically, takes hold of the collective imagination and persists. That is why Bitcoin has been associated with consuming more energy than a “small country,” according to the Harvard Business Review, or even “many countries”, according to the New York Times. But five years have passed since this alarming analogy grabbed headlines, and the potency of individual Bitcoin mining machines – aka application-specific integrated circuit miners, or ASICs – has only improved dramatically, leading to greater network efficiency. And for Bitcoin miners, this may also lead to greater profitability.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  ASICs’ competitiveness is “just continually getting better and better and better over time,” said Kyle Waters, senior research analyst at crypto data analytics firm Coin Metrics. These machines' efficiency is measured using hashrate, which is the computational power per second used when mining proof-of-work tokens like Bitcoin. Recently Coin Metrics published a report describing a novel way to ascertain which machines are contributing the most to the network hashrate, leading to what they believe is a more accurate picture of efficiency than the generally accepted calculations.  The researchers found that, network-wide, the hardware efficiency dramatically improved from nearly 89 joules per terahash in July 2018 to 33 j/th this May, a 63% decline in energy use for the same amount of work.  They also estimate that the bitcoin network consumes 13.4 gigawatts (GW) of power, 13% less than the commonly used estimate published by the Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance. By coincidence 13.4 GW is exactly how much wind power capacity the U.S. added in 2021, the latest year of data from the U.S. Department of Energy.  Calling the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index the “gold standard,” Waters said Coin Metrics innovated on its methodology by pinpointing how much of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate could be attributed to specific machines. If newer, vastly more efficient machines dominated the network hashrate, then the efficiency overall would be better than one that didn’t have this dominance factored in.  Specifications from individual manufacturers show that the two newest machines that Coin Metrics tested (Bitmain Antminer S19 XP and MicroBT M50), were twice as efficient as the two machines they tested that were released in 2016 (Bitmain Antminer S9 and Canaan 1066).  “Manufacturing matters a lot,” said Karim Helmy, an independent researcher and lead author of the report who came up with the method for parsing which machines dominated the network overall. “The overwhelming majority of hashrate is currently generated by newer generation Bitmain machines. And the network is astoundingly efficient.”  Anticipating the halving  Aside from the contentious debate over energy use, Helmy’s innovative method allows for a closer look at the competitiveness of individual machines, which matters a lot to miners. “Miners care, they want to be in the top half of most efficient. And the reason for that is [they] want to survive the halving.”  Machine efficiency becomes an almost existential question in the context of the next halving, which is likely to take place next April. The roughly once-every-four-years event will reduce the reward for successfully mining a Bitcoin block by half. Unless the price of bitcoin rises significantly from the current $30,000 level, the halving will double the cost to miners to break even.  Using the data from the Coin Metric report, CoinDesk collaborated to produce machine-specific rankings of efficiency, dominance and profitability, and then use them to determine the overall competitiveness of 11 popular Bitcoin mining machines.  The overall ranking demonstrates how strong the manufacturer and the newness matter. Our top three machines are all produced by Bitmain, and rank in chronological order based on their relative age. “The state-of-the-art machine is far more efficient now,” said Waters.  Overall Most Competitive  Here’s a breakdown of each of the three factors we analyzed and how the 11 machines stacked up.  Most Efficient  Efficiency is a simple calculation based on the manufacturer’s specifications of the machine’s performance based on power drawn. What this shows is that the two most recently manufactured models, the S19 XP and M50, both made in 2022, are the most efficient.  One caveat with this calculation: “We have to take this at the manufacturer’s word. Actually observed performance might not be what they say it is,” said Waters.  Most Dominant  Coin Metric’s proprietary calculations show that in May 2023 the newest mining machine models were not the most-used on the Bitcoin network. The S19j Pro and S19, released in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are by far the most dominant. The takeaway is that the most efficient models that are the most dependable and well-priced will be more dominant than models that are overpriced or unreliable.  Most Profitable  Calculating profitability per machine depended on making several broad assumptions. Energy prices are very specific to a mining operation, and can differ based on location but also what the miner can negotiate with the energy provider. But for the sake of calculation, this model, though global, applied the most recently reported average U.S. average electricity rate for this date in July 2023. This calculation did not take into consideration the initial cost to acquire the machine, however.  The takeaway from all these calculations is simple: the newest machines are the most efficient and profitable. But then to get the bang for their buck, miners need to buy them and use them optimally.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Jeanhee Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/26/the-ever-more-efficient-bitcoin-mining-machine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b420a3ddda3cbbe8a7ce7dc6e7f4b5f15880d25-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410110,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLel,1690378745,It’s Time for Miners to Stop With the Gimmicks,"If we should peg Bitcoin miners for any sins, let it be Wall Street’s most popular fare: marketing gimmicks.  Hive Blockchain (now Hive Digital Technologies) kicked off the public miner listing craze in 2017, after listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The subsequent flood of mining firm listings on U.S. exchanges allows any retail participant to get financial exposure to some 20-plus Bitcoin miners of various shapes, sizes and strategies. For investors not willing to hold crypto directly, these stocks are some of the best ways to participate in the industry’s growth.  Will Foxley is the host of The Mining Pod, and former director at Compass Mining and tech reporter at CoinDesk. This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  While capital is useful, equity markets are not dissimilar to the token markets many miners disparage. Retail investors huddle in Telegram groups, poking and prodding for updates from each firm, urging one another to “hodl” the stock or trust the executives on the ground, only for the leadership team to dilute stocks to worthless drivel, purchase ASICs at the top or fail to hedge energy contracts (believe me, these are not uncommon occurrences). The real vice here: marketing.  Take the extreme case of Nasdaq-listed Sphere 3D’s $1.7 billion purchase of 60,000 NuMiners, a Bitcoin mining machine that seemingly appeared out of thin air in early 2022. Instantly dubbed the “Mountain Dew miner” by online detractors, the machine and company immediately raised eyebrows among mining folks who’d never heard of it.  Nonetheless, on the back of a press release, Sphere3D’s stock instantly pumped 40%. It was all an obvious falsehood, but markets moved regardless. And while we can’t pin down if any specific retail participant was injured, we can look at the data and make a fair argument: markets don’t get mining, and sometimes executives don’t either. The deal was canceled and prices came back to earth.  Read more: Eliza Gkritsi - Riot Platforms at the Heart of Texas' Debate Over Bitcoin Mining’s Effect on the Grid  However, these sorts of gimmicks continue today. See, for instance, how miners have recently been leaning into AI and high performance computing (HPC) hype. It's unlikely that many – if any – of these miners are really within spitting distance of actual HPC practices, as recently stated by CoreWeave CSO Brannin Mcbee on the Odd Lots podcast.  “At the end of the day, they are just very different businesses, both from the type of engineering and developers you employ, to the infrastructure, to the data centers that you sit in,” Mcbee stated. (Mcbee did concede that trying to pivot into HPC was worth the attempt).  It’s time to ask the question: Why aren't miners leaning into education over marketing? There’s a healthy skepticism that points toward easy money as a motivator, given the sub-industries history of vapor over substance. Press releases boasting nine-figure machine purchase orders weren’t uncommon last cycle.  The trouble is that not every Bitcoin miner views access to retail investments in a positive way - i.e. as a chance to gain more capital while more supporters for Bitcoin’s wider purpose. Retail investors instead become a cushion for bad mining practices instead of legitimate partners in the business. All of which sours the whole investment outlook for mining. Dissatisfaction in a bad investment breeds contempt for the wider industry. For every good miner, there’s one that wiped out its equity table.  That’s not to say equity markets can’t be used effectively. In fact, even dreaded stock dilution has its place. As Cleanspark CEO Zach Bradford articulated here, timing dilutive events with ASIC or other hardware purchases actually benefits both parties by increasing the amount of productive assets.  “We’re taking that capital, and we are immediately turning it into cash flow producing assets. And were doing so with assets that we believe produce the best ROI,” Bradford said.  Luckily, there’s slowly a movement toward professionalization in the mining industry that should be encouraged. For example, most public miners have taken to publishing monthly updates, in addition to their SEC-mandated quarterly filings. Most mining firm executives have taken well to discussion around mining strategy, including dilution, on industry media outlets.  Let’s hope this time next cycle, miners eschew the gimmicks and start taking investor education more seriously.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/26/its-time-for-miners-to-stop-with-the-gimmicks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c79d031b4e3981ccecb4ccc68201ed271c7a28c-6720x3780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410107,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLbS,1690376699,Hedgehog Teams Up with CoinDesk Indices to Bring Crypto Sector Exposure to Automated Investing,"What follows is an interview with Colton Dillion, CEO of Hedgehog. The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  CoinDesk Indices, the underlying index provider for this product launch, sat down with Colton Dillion, CEO of Hedgehog, to discuss how advisors can now access crypto sector indices on Hedgehog’s direct indexing platform.  What does Hedgehog do for people who want to invest in cryptocurrency?  Hedgehog makes it easy to buy broad swaths of the cryptocurrency market with a single deposit and automatically manages your portfolio of digital assets in response to market movements. If you hold currency on-chain or at multiple exchanges, Hedgehog can also dynamically respond to these non-custodial holdings, allowing you to keep a balanced portfolio that's a blend between what we can manage for you and what we can't. This is especially useful when you want to manage a portfolio that includes holdings in cold storage without touching them.  How does Hedgehog work?  Hedgehog has a powerful direct indexing engine that adapts to the venues, transaction networks, and assets held in your portfolio. You can customize these portfolios to manage what you hold, what strategy you want to use to balance your holdings, and even set fixed asset allocations. In the case that you want to hold broad market strategies, Hedgehog also provides and recommends a strategy based on your personal financial situation, like our Satoshi stack (bitcoin) or our DeFi stack, which contain every asset we can hold for you that follows a selection rule.  How does this differentiate Hedgehog in light of recent regulatory issues in the US?  Hedgehog is differentiated from other providers of index-like capabilities in a few different ways. First and foremost, we are an SEC-registered RIA that has already completed our exam exit interview with the Commission and believes we have addressed all the feedback they gave us. We don't offer ETFs or publish indexes, but instead offer direct indexing via stacks that follow a strategy that is set to hold the actual underlying asset at a custodian. This means that not only are we able to be more compliant in an evolving regulatory landscape, but we also aim to be forward compliant with potential upcoming SEC rulemakings around audits.  How is Hedgehog helping users by bringing CoinDesk Indices to the app?  Hedgehog is expanding beyond the initial default stacks to include stacks that aim to track market indexes from the highly respected CoinDdesk Indices. These will have holdings as close as possible to the indexes offered by CoinDesk Indices, meaning that our users can benefit from their index experience and research.  Tell us about the offering and the underlying indices.  Hedgehog’s innovative platform for automated investing will soon feature digital asset sectors represented in the following CDI select sector indices, which include computing, culture & entertainment, currency, decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract platform. Notably, Hedgehog will also feature exposure to those sectors through a single market solution. The CoinDesk Market Select Index (CMIS) is the aggregation of all of these five select sector indices noted below into one index.  CoinDesk Computing Select Index (CPUS)  CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Select Index (CNES)  CoinDesk Currency Select Index (CCYS)  CoinDesk DeFi Select Index (DFX)  CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index (SCPX)  The sectors are based on CDI’s Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), which evaluates and categorizes a broad universe of digital assets into distinct sectors. The constituents within these sectors undergo a screening process to meet certain trading and custody requirements. Those that meet these criteria form the crypto sector indices, designed to measure the performance of some of the most important segments in the liquid digital asset market.  Where can people go to get more information?  To learn more and view the crypto sectors via the Hedgehog app and investment platform, please download the mobile application or visit the Hedgehog website.  *Being registered with the SEC as an investment adviser does not imply a certain level of skill or training.

A Bumpy Start To The FDUSD Journey The expected listing of FDUSD on Binance was initially set for July 26, 2023. To incentivize traders, Binance planned to offer zero maker fees for all FDUSD trading pairs. However, due to technical issues encountered by the FDUSD pairs’ liquidity providers, the launch was postponed. Related Reading: Binance Pool’s Litecoin Hash Rate Falls 50%: What’s Next? Trading was halted at 09:45 (UTC), and all pending FDUSD orders were canceled, reflecting the exchange’s commitment to user protection amid these unforeseen circumstances. In response to these technical glitches, Binance rescheduled the FDUSD listing for the same day at 14:00 (UTC). However, the delay caused by the technical issues put a temporary damper on the excitement surrounding the FDUSD launch. First Digital USD: Just Another Stablecoin? First Digital Group, a conglomerate including Hong Kong-based First Digital Trust, a custodian and trust firm, unveiled the plan for the FDUSD stablecoin in June. Backed by FD121, the stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 ratio, promised to be fully backed by cash and cash equivalents held in regulated financial institutions’ segregated accounts. The reserves are said to be under constant audit and monitoring by independent third parties, assuring investors of the coin’s stability. Beyond the initial hiccups, the ambition driving the creation of FDUSD is worth noting. The First Digital Group envisages FDUSD to be more than a simple programmable digital asset. FDUSD is designed to be compatible with Web3 technologies, positioning it to potentially aid in the creation of future solutions. The stablecoin is able to interact with financial smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance protocols without requiring intermediaries. This integration aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies in everyday transactions. Despite Binance’s continuing regulatory challenges, the exchange keeps making headlines for positive developments, such as the listing of the zero-fee stablecoin. Recently, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, revealed plans to dismiss the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) complaint, according to a court filing. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised For A Major Breakout – Which Way Will It Go? This move is a reaction to the financial watchdog’s earlier accusation against the crypto exchange for purportedly breaking derivatives market rules in the United States. Meanwhile, regardless of the few positive developments by the crypto exchange, Binance’s native token BNB has continued to move in a bearish trend. Over the past 24 hours, the native token has plunged 0.3% with a current trading price of $237.7, at the time of writing. Binance Coin (BNB)’s price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart.

42410097,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTLB0,1690376403,Crypto Lender Credix Brings Additional Private Credit Pool on Solana With 11% Yield,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) credit marketplace Credix Finance has opened a new private credit lending pool using the layer 1 blockchain Solana, the firm said Wednesday.  Lenders can capture near 11% annual yield investing in insurance-protected private credit to Colombian farmers backed by receivables, said Credix, which believes the pool could swell to $150 million over the next months based on capital demand in the country.  The new offering comes as DeFi and traditional finance are becoming increasingly intertwined, with crypto native firms working with legacy financial institutions to bring old-school instruments such as private credit and bonds – often referred to as real-world assets (RWAs) – to the blockchain. The tokenization of RWAs could disrupt finance by making capital markets more efficient, transparent and accessible, and could be a $4 trillion-$16 trillion market by 2030, a Boston Consulting Group report said.  Digital asset investor demand for RWAs surged this year to capture rising yields in traditional lending markets. This also came as participants became disillusioned with crypto lending after last year’s dramatic implosions.  Colombia-based fintech firm Clave and its affiliate Liquitech underwrite and originate the loans in Colombian pesos via a bankruptcy remote trust and pledge the receivables as collateral. The underlying private note is settled through the Credix platform in USDC stablecoin. CESCE Colombia, subsidiary of Spanish Export Credit Agency, insures the receivables.  “This groundbreaking initiative not only brings a unique offering to the market but also holds power to make a significant social and economic impact by providing crucial financial support to farmers in Colombia,"" Thomas Bohner, chief executive of Credix, said in a statement.  Accredited investors can deposit USDC stablecoin in the pool and expect a 11% annualized yield (APY). This is significantly higher than the 2.6% APY available for lenders on DeFi protocol Aave, according to DefiLlama.  The first investors of the pool include Solana Foundation, the non-profit organization that supports the Solana ecosystem, and digital asset market maker Keyrock.  Credix’s new offering follows rival credit marketplace Maple Finance’s tax receivables pool introduced earlier this year, which originated $36 million in loans since January.

On Sunday, the entire DeFi market racked up just $1.12 billion in transactional volume, marking the lowest daily total since January 1, according to DefiLlama.  Total value locked (TVL), which measures the amount of capital that is held across all DeFi protocols, slumped from $45.3 billion to $42.9 billion in July as the sector failed to turn the tide against falling asset prices. During this period, ether (ETH) traded down from $1,920 to $1,850 whilst bitcoin (BTC) failed to break through resistance at $31,500.  In July, the biggest loser has been Conic Finance, a yield-generating protocol that lost 1,700 ether in a reentrancy exploit last week. The protocol's individual TVL has plunged 65% to $42 million from $125 million.  Conic was not alone in its exploit-induced plight, on Tuesday zkSync's largest lending protocol, EraLend, was struck by another reentrancy attack resulting in a $3.4 million loss.  Several other DeFi protocols have experienced outflows this month, with liquid staking protocol Ankr, NFT-lending service BendDAO and Arbitrum-based decentralized exchange Chronos dealing with up to a 50% drop in TVL.  The likes of Curve Finance, Blur and MakerDAO have also all lost more than 15% of their respective TVL in the past month.  Despite the majority of DeFi failing to capitalize on a relatively stable wider market, there has been a couple of winners. EigenLayer is generating fresh inflows after it rolled out its restaking protocol, whilst Lybra Finance and Solana-based Marinade Finance continue to show strong growth with their TVL rising by 73% and 45% respectively.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/26/defi-daily-volume-dwindles-to-7-month-lows-as-sector-endures-downswing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ea12870ef38cca8385e4a067b7fe56cc702c4ce-1546x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 10% on Tuesday, registering its largest single-day gain since April 3, according to Binance data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The crypto has gained 25% over the past two weeks amid speculation that it could be used as a payment mechanism on the rebranded Twitter platform. ""As crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer’s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat,” said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport “Musk is on a marketing tour in re-inventing Twitter,"" he added. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, remained near a one-month low just above $29,000 as investors await the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy announcement later today.  Singapore’s High Court has recognized crypto as property capable of being held on trust in a case involving Seychelles-based exchange Bybit and a contractor, according to a court judgment published on Tuesday. Bybit brought a case against Ho Kai Xin, claiming that in breach of her employment contract, she abused her position to transfer over 4.2 million of Tether’s USDT stablecoin to addresses she owned and controlled. Ho also transferred a quantity of fiat currency to her own bank account. “Like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust,” said presiding Judge Philip Jeyaretnam.  Nigeria is changing its eNaira model to encourage more use of that central bank digital currency (CBDC), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Acting Governor Folashodun Shonubi said Wednesday. The West African country has been working to push for broader adoption of its eNaira CBDC, which was introduced in October 2021. As of March of this year, the number of eNaira wallets was just 13 million versus the country’s population of nearly 224 million. To boost the service offering and make it more user friendly, CBN upgraded its eNaira app to enable contactless payments, local news outlet The Sun reported earlier in July. The bank didn't provide details of planned changes to the eNaira model and hadn't responded to a request for more information by publication time.

Offering Wright just 1 British pound ($1.29) in compensation was justified in view of the false case Wright advanced, three judges in the London Court of Appeal in London unanimously agreed in a Wednesday ruling.  In an earlier case, High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain was “clearly right to treat Dr Wright’s lies and deception as ‘disreputable facts that are properly before the court’,” Lord Justice Mark Warby said in a ruling dated July 26. “Where the libel was an accusation of dishonesty, the dishonest conduct of the litigation was relevant for that purpose.”  In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, Wright said he was “disappointed that the Court of Appeal has not given due recognition to the damage caused to me by orchestrated online vitriol” which he said had a “severe impact on me and my wellbeing.”  Rupert Cowper-Coles, a Partner at law firm RPC who represented McCormack, told CoinDesk he was ""very pleased with the outcome.""  ""The Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the 1 pound damages award for Dr Wright after finding that he sought to mislead the High Court enshrines in English law an important principle that a claimant won't be compensated for a reputation they don't deserve,"" Cowper-Coles said in an emailed statement.  Following the judgment, McCormack tweeted that “we must continue with our support for others caught up in this, including our brother Hodlonaut,” referring to another Twitter user who has been sued for libel by Wright.  In an October 2021 judgment, Chamberlain found that McCormack couldn’t prove assertions that Wright was a fraud. The judge awarded Wright only nominal damages, saying he had advanced false evidence, though McCormack was later ordered to pay around 900,000 pounds in legal costs.  In a separate U.K. case, judges ruled on Tuesday that Wright must pay 400,000 pounds in security for legal costs to pursue his claim that crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase are breaching his intellectual property by allowing trading in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  Later Wednesday, a Florida court is set to consider whether Wright has committed contempt of court in a $143 million dispute with former business partner Ira Kleiman, charges which Wright has denied.

CEO Claims “Organizational Development” A spokesperson for KuCoin dismissed the layoff claims, stating that the company has not initiated any “alleged layoff plan.” Instead, they claimed, the company is merely conducting its regular biannual appraisals to stay competitive in the market. While the exchange did not deny some staff changes, CEO Johnny Lyu emphasized that these should not be described as layoffs. Instead, Lyu referred to it as a reevaluation of the organizational structure aimed at enhancing the company's dynamism and competitiveness. He addressed the rumors on Twitter, referring to them as rumors and speculations. He tweeted, “The crypto world changes fast. To stay on top, we regularly evaluate our org structure based on employee performance and company development. So it is not layoffs, and it is all about making the organization more dynamic and competitive.” Layoffs Across Industry The industry has been no stranger to an overwhelming number of layoffs from leading crypto companies. Just in 2023, Binance.US, Crypto.com, and Gemini have had to lay off significant portions of their workforce to counter the unstable macroeconomic conditions in the market. The talk of trouble at KuCoin stemmed from a report by Colin Wu of Wu Blockchain on Twitter. He claimed that KuCoin planned to cut 30% of its approximately 1,000 employees, attributing the alleged cuts to a strict know-your-customer (KYC) policy that impacted the firm's profits. The KYC policy was implemented after KuCoin faced a lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused the exchange of violating securities and commodities laws. KuCoin Revises KYC Process In response to these accusations, KuCoin cited a recent report highlighting the company's growth. The report mentioned that the exchange had added 300 new employees in the first half of the year and also acknowledged the ongoing changes to the KYC practices. The updated policy, which took effect on July 15, required newly registered users to complete the KYC process to access the exchange's products and services. Users who had not completed the process by the deadline faced restrictions on their accounts, limiting certain activities like spot trading, but they could still withdraw funds. Following the announcement of the updated KYC policy, KuCoin experienced a substantial spike in trading volume, reaching $6.8 billion from nearly $500 million the previous day.

42410142,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTShD,1690372800,Crypto Startup Ramp Network Starts Brazilian Unit as First Step in LatAm Expansion,"Ramp Network, a startup offering payment infrastructure to connect crypto and traditional finance, opened a local entity in Brazil in a bid to expand into Latin America.  In the South American country, the company will offer its software development kit (SDK) for clients — including Web2 enterprises, crypto wallets and Web3 games — enabling their users to buy crypto via an end-to-end, non-custodial on-ramp, as well as offering a crypto to fiat off-ramp.  “This year, we are fully dedicated to establishing a strong presence in Latin America, and the reason for that is that this is a very interesting market for us,” Łukasz Anwajler, chief technology officer at Ramp, told CoinDesk, citing latest survey published by blockchain data analytics platform Chainalysis.  He said that Brazil ranked seventh in the list of countries with the highest crypto adoption while Latin America as a region accounted for 9.1% of all crypto value received globally last year, according to the data from Chainalysis.  Recent crypto regulatory clarity in Brazil was one of the reasons for Ramp to open an entity in the South American country, Anwajler stated. In December, Brazil passed a law that creates a “virtual service provider” license, which is to be requested by digital asset companies, including exchanges and trading intermediaries.  Several companies have been expanding into Latin America and particularly in Brazil recently. Earlier this year, giant crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said that it integrated the Brazilian government’s payment system Pix and started allowing crypto purchases with Brazilian reals.  In Brazil, Ramp will look to link up with local payment networks, such as the widely used Pix, which is also hiring in the South American country, said Anwajler, adding that Brazil will serve as Ramp’s hub for Latin America, as the company plans to continue to grow in the region.  One month ago, the company added the Brazilian real and other Latin American currencies to its portfolio, the company said in a statement, detailing that it also allowed the possibility for users in Brazil to purchase crypto through card payments.  In November 2022, Ramp raised $70 million in a Series B funding round that was co-led by Mubadala Capital — an arm of one of United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth funds — and Korelya Capital.  The company allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and provides an integration for websites and applications to do the same. Ramp’s supported payment methods to buy crypto include credit, debit cards, a bank transfer, Apple Pay and Google Pay.  Some of Ramp’s larger clients include Argent, Trust Wallet, Axie, Brave and Opera, according to its website.

15313228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544439,1690371653,Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed?,"The Litecoin (LTC) price decrease was a healthy retracement as it pulled back toward the $92 mark. Such retracements are standard after prolonged upward trends and are often seen as an opportunity for the market to find stability before continuing its upward trajectory. However, in the case of Litecoin, the bears have become increasingly dominant, signaling potential resistance ahead. LTC has been facing a significant price drop, falling below the crucial $90 level to $89.47, as reported by CoinGecko. The altcoin experienced a minor 0.3% increase in the last 24 hours, which hardly compensates for the troubling seven-day slump of 3.6%. This sharp decline has sparked concerns among investors and traders, as the once-promising bullish momentum seems to have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised For A Major Breakout – Which Way Will It Go? Source: Coingecko Litecoin Struggles To Surpass $92 One key factor contributing to the current bearish trend is Litecoin’s inability to climb past the $92 mark. LTC has repeatedly failed to breach this level and has instead posted lower lows, indicating a loss of bullish momentum, as noted in this LTC price report. When a cryptocurrency struggles to surpass crucial resistance levels, it typically shows waning buyer interest and growing selling pressure, leading to a downward spiral. As LTC’s price continues to decline, investors are now concerned about the $87.65 support level. Historically, this level has held firm during previous price declines as a crucial barrier against further downside movements. However, given the recent price behavior and lack of significant buying support, there are growing concerns that the $87.65 support may falter. Litecoin market cap currently at $6.5 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Halving Explained Halving is one of the critical events that have shaped Litecoin’s history and price movements. Halving is a protocol-driven event that occurs approximately every four years in Litecoin’s blockchain. During this event, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. In other words, miners receive 50% fewer LTC for verifying transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain. The purpose of halving is to control the inflation rate of Litecoin and ensure a limited supply, similar to Bitcoin’s halving mechanism. LTC price action in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Will This Bullish Formation Lead To A 25% Upsurge? By reducing the mining rewards, halving makes it more challenging and costlier for miners to add new coins to circulation, reducing the recent supply influx. This scarcity can lead to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of Litecoin. Examining Litecoin’s price action before the upcoming halving event can provide valuable insights into its market dynamics. In the lead-up to the halving, anticipation often builds, driving speculative interest. However, post-halving, the market tends to experience increased volatility as it finds a new equilibrium with the reduced supply. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

Binance the company is facing legal issues, including lawsuits from the CFTC, SEC, and investigations by the DOJ and the IRS. Network metrics for the Binance blockchain are mixed, with DAUs and transactions steady. But network fees have been declining. When I last covered Binance (BNB-USD) for Seeking Alpha in early April , it was fresh off a lawsuit against company Binance and Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Since that article, BNB has traded down over 20% and now finds year to date performance to be significantly lagging the other top smart contract chains in the cryptocurrency market. BNB is one of the few coins among the top in the industry that is actually down year to date: Data by YCharts Ethereum (ETH-USD) is up over 50% year to date. Avalanche (AVAX-USD) is up about 20%. And despite the allegation from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it's an unregistered security, Cardano ( ADA-USD ) is up 25% year to date and well off the post-SEC news low. BNB hasn't been able to get off the mat to the same degree. As it has been roughly a quarter since my initial BNB coverage, in this article we'll go over the latest developments with Binance the company and look at some of the key network metrics pertaining to the Binance blockchain. Fundamental Developments Following the CFTC's March lawsuit against Binance, the organization had until July 27th to respond. We now know Binance is looking for a dismissal of the lawsuit entirely after filing intent to dismiss with an Illinois district court on July 24th. In the document , Binance is asking for permission to exceed the permitted page limit for a brief due to the number of arguments made and the complexity of the CFTC's complaint. In addition to the CFTC lawsuit earlier this year, Binance was also sued by the SEC in June for, among other things, alleged comingling of customer assets. Elsewhere, the company is also under investigation by both the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service for alleged money laundering. Beyond the clear problems facing Binance on the legal front, the company has also laid off employees, exited markets, and seen key executives depart in recent weeks. According to the Wall Street Journal , Binance recently laid off roughly 1,000 employees across various departments. Over 1,000 people have been fired in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the moves. The exercise, which is continuing, could result in Binance losing more than a third of its staff, the person said. It apparently isn't just involuntary departures that have led to a headcount reduction at Binance. The company has also seen several key executives resign in recent weeks. According to Fortune , those former executives include general counsel Hon Ng, chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann, SVP for compliance Steven Christie, and former IRS agent Matthew Price who oversaw investigations and intelligence. Hillmann verified his departure on social media but indicated he was doing so on good terms. However, Fortune's article seems to place blame for the executive exodus on CZ: According to a person at Binance familiar with the situation, the executives chose to depart over Zhao’s response to an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice. Several outlets have reported that the investigation, underway for more than a year, relates to Binance’s alleged attempts to bamboozle U.S. regulators as well as alleged money laundering and sanctions violations on the company’s platform. Given the amount of bad news surrounding Binance the company, it may not be surprising to see Binance the coin struggling against the native assets of notable smart contract peers in recent weeks. Network Metrics As far as the Binance blockchain is concerned, some of the key network metrics are actually holding up okay despite the problems facing Binance the company. Daily active users of the blockchain have held firm near 1.3 million over the last three months. After dipping well off highs during the November 2021 cycle top, daily transactions on Binance Smart Chain appear to have somewhat stabilized in the 3 to 4 million range. Binance Daily Transactions (BSCScan) However, despite this apparent stabilization in daily transactions, the fees earned by validating those transactions have declined in recent months from $20.5 million in March to just $13.3 million in June according to data from Token Terminal. Monthly Fees vs PF Ratio (Token Terminal) As July approaches a close, fees are still under $10 million for the month. What's important to mention is July 2023 fees are still well ahead of the $5.4 million in fees during July 2022. But even with the decline in the price of the BNB token, the reduction in network fees over the last several months has pushed the fully diluted price to fees ratio up to nearly 330x. This could be considered an indication that BNB is still overvalued even after the recent decline in the token's price. BNB TVL (DefiLlama) From a DeFi standpoint, Binance remains one of the largest smart contract chains as evidenced by its $3.3 billion in TVL. That said, the broad trend in TVL is still down even when adjusting for the declines in native coin price. Measured in BNB, TVL on Binance has dropped from a high of over 39 million coins two years ago to under 14 million today. And the trend in stables on-chain hasn't been positive either. There we observe a reduction from $12.9 billion last summer to $5.3 billion currently. Binance Exchange Data Shifting back to Binance the company for a moment, the exchange data shows asset balances are roughly in line with where they were when I last covered the BNB token in April. According to Nansen, Binance controls a little over $63 billion over several different blockchains: Binance Exchange Holdings (Nansen) In the last three months, Binance's token weighting to BNB has declined from 5.3% to 4.4%. We've also seen Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings increase from 23.6% of assets to over 27%. Another interesting move has been in the balance of stablecoins on the exchange: Binance Stablecoin Flow (Dune Analytics/xihablock) According to data from Dune Analytics, July is on pace to be the first month since November where stablecoin net flow hasn't been negative. Of course, the month isn't over yet and this could change between now and August 1st. But the larger point is there appears to be a slowing in stablecoin outflow in recent months. Risks As I mentioned in early April, there are a lot of questions around how exposed to BNB Binance truly is. I think it's interesting seeing Binance now moving to get the CFTC lawsuit dismissed after there was a reasonable market expectation of a settlement just a few months ago . Despite the recent Ripple ruling and the optimism that has resulted from it in the United States, the battle with US regulatory bodies for Binance is likely far from over. Unlike exchange competitors like Coinbase ( COIN ), Binance has historically been very active in the IEO market and that is something that could put further pressure on Binance domestically. Summary Recognizing that crypto is a global phenomenon, even with potential problems in the US based company, Binance can certainly survive outside of the United States if ultimately forced to leave the market entirely. But it's difficult for me to see how that would be a long term benefit to the company or the Binance blockchain specifically. I think the recent departures of so many executives is generally a bad sign. And I'd be very cautious about buying the dip in BNB. There's a lot of heat on this brand right now. There may come a time when longing BNB makes sense. But I personally don't think we're there yet.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4619881-binance-fight-the-urge-to-buy-the-dip?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15312951.jpeg

The move follows a retrenchment from markets including Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, and as its U.S. arm is sued by regulators for operating an unregistered exchange.  “Binance confirms that it has proactively withdrawn its BaFin application,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “The situation, both in the global market and regulation, has changed significantly. Binance still intends to apply for appropriate licensing in Germany, but it is essential that our submission accurately reflects these changes.""  In June, Finance Forward reported sources saying the company was set to be denied a license by BaFin, but a Binance spokesperson at the time said it was continuing discussions with officials.  Binance has also given up its registration with Cyprus' securities regulator, decided to quit the Netherlands after a failed attempt to register, and has been ordered to halt operations in Belgium.  Earlier in June, Chief Executive Officer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has said France remained Binance’s flagship center in Europe, in spite of a money laundering probe there, and European Union laws set to take effect in 2024 will allow crypto service providers to operate across the bloc with a single license.

Our model only valued RIOT at a $1bn market cap post-halving despite its ambitious expansion plan due to the Bitcoin halving event. Although RIOT may still trade in tandem with the Bitcoin price, exposure to RIOT and Bitcoin mining companies, in general, poses extreme risks without sufficient support from fundamentals. Introduction: The Missing Puzzle About a month after our previous coverage , we've finally gotten a critical piece of the puzzle to evaluate Riot Platforms (RIOT) intrinsic value. That missing piece of the puzzle was RIOT's expansion guidance beyond 2023. In our previous coverage, the lack of guidance beyond 2023 is one of the big nos that prevented us from giving RIOT our buy rating. The lack of guidance beyond 2023 could also be one of the reasons why RIOT trailed behind other Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining companies in this rally. Data by YCharts Now, RIOT has guided investors that it expects to expand mining capacity from the current 12.7 EH/s to 20.1 EH/s by mid-2024 and further option to expand to 35.4 EH/s by the end of 2024. To put this into perspective, this expansion plan will make RIOT the biggest Bitcoin mining company in the industry in the future, surpassing Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) (Table 1). It will now be up to MARA whether to take on RIOT and retain its share in the Bitcoin network. RIOT MARA CLSK Expected Capacity 20.1 EH/s(Mid of 2024) or 35.4 EH/s (End of 2024) 23.5 (End of 2023) 16 EH/s (End of 2023) That being said, this ambitious expansion plan has 2 major implications on feasibility and its valuation. The objective of this article is to discuss the feasibility of this expansion plan and the resulting RIOT price targets. Implication 1: Operational Feasibility It is rather risky that RIOT's mining operation is centered in Texas. Operating in Texas presents a major problem. We detailed Texas' energy woes by showing the fragility of the Texas power grid and its process to climate. During the winters , Bitcoin miners in Texas risk curtailment due to winter storms; During the summers , Bitcoin miners in Texas risk curtailment due to heat waves. On the other hand, Bitcoin miners could also suffer curtailment when power demand is high. For instance, RIOT's Bitcoin production dropped 32% in June due to high temperatures and power demand. With July and August being the hottest months in Texas, we should expect more severe curtailment to come over the next 2 months. This observation is not a one-off event but is consistent with past observations in 2022 where RIOT's Bitcoin production also declined in 2022Q3 . Hence, there seems to be a pattern of curtailment during the summers. Furthermore, RIOT is not the only Bitcoin mining company affected. In short, what we're trying to say is that the capacity of RIOT might not matter if it is eventually going to get curtailed. Recall that Marathon, is one of the largest (if not the largest) Bitcoin mining companies, and many Bitcoin mining companies are also located in Texas. Competition between other Bitcoin mining companies could put more strain on the fragile power grid and risk further curtailment. Implication 2: Financial Feasibility RIOT is required to purchase about 100,000 M56S++ from MicroBT to add 23 EH/s mining capacity. Since each M56S++ machine costs around $7000 , about $700mil is required to fund this expansion. RIOT primarily sells Bitcoins mined and issues new shares to fund mining operations and expansion . So the first thing that came to mind is how much is RIOT going to dilute shareholders to achieve this. Let's make a rough estimate. Based on the 2023Q1 financial report, RIOT is cash flow positive (~$30mil) due to the liquidation of Bitcoins mined. Since Bitcoin is trading rather flat in 2023Q2 and 2023Q3 so far, we should also expect cash flow to be similar for the 2 quarters. Assuming Bitcoin to trade flat in Q4, we expect RIOT to receive additional $90mil cash from operation in 2023. On the other hand, RIOT also has about $150mil at the end of 2023Q1. The $50mil worth of deposits were not included as we expect it to be used to get RIOT to 12.5 EH/s. Therefore, we estimate RIOT to have about $240mil by the end of 2023. $240mil is likely to be sufficient to get RIOT to 20.1 EH/s by mid-2024 (estimated cost = $220mil) but is unlikely to be sufficient to get RIOT to 35.4 EH/s (estimated $450mil additional cash required) by the end of 2024. Fortunately, we are optimistic towards Bitcoin in 2024 where we expect Bitcoin to reach $70,000 by April 2024 and $100,000 by April 2025. We estimate the Bitcoin price to average about $50,000 in H1 and $75,000 in H2. We also estimate RIOT's capacity to average 16 Eh/s (deployed) in H1. RIOT's gross profit margin is about 50%. These assumptions translate to roughly $100mil additional cash flow from operation for 2024H1. Under these assumptions, RIOT only has to raise the remaining $300mil from equity offering (or about 10% shareholder dilution) in 2024H1 to get to 35.4 EH/s capacity by the end of 2024. This looks to be a good deal right? Not quite. Price Targets At 35.4 EH/s Capacity Here's probably where we'll receive heated debates, but hear us out: We expect RIOT to mine fewer Bitcoins even at 35.4 EH/s due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024. By the end of 2024, we expect the Bitcoin network to break 1,000 EH/s as it has been growing by 93% CAGR . A 35.4 EH/s capacity represents about 3.5% of the Bitcoin network and is expected to produce only 5,800 Bitcoins after the halving. Although RIOT is operating cash-flow positive, RIOT is still making losses. RIOT's all-in business cost per Bitcoin averages about $41,700 . Based on our Bitcoin thesis (considering a Bitcoin bear market in 2025), we expect Bitcoin to trade average between $60,000 - $80,000 in 2025. So we'll use $75,000 as the baseline Bitcoin price for 2025. Under these assumptions, RIOT could only make $197mil profit annually. With a P/E of 5, our model values RIOT only at a $1bn market cap while RIOT is currently trading at a $3.11bn market cap. We're aware that Bitcoin mining companies trade in tandem with the Bitcoin price and are often more volatile than Bitcoin itself. But without proper support from the underlying fundamentals, HODL-ing Bitcoin mining companies is extremely risky. Consider this, even when Bitcoin is trading at its current all-time high, Bitcoin mining in 2021, Bitcoin mining companies are hardly profitable. Unless Bitcoin outperforms our expectations, we could see severe value destruction across the Bitcoin mining sector. Even with an ambitious 35 EH/s expansion plan, we don't think that RIOT could mitigate this risk. Data by YCharts Verdict We started this analysis on RIOT in a positive light but it did not turn out the way we expected. If you're shocked by our model's price target for RIOT, we were equally shocked as well. However, we do think that this price target makes sense after connecting the dots. The next Bitcoin halving cycle is going to put the entire Bitcoin mining sector at risk. The 2024 Bitcoin halving will double the sector average total business cost per Bitcoin or cut Bitcoin mining revenue by half. The sector average total business cost per Bitcoin ranges from $30k-$60k while the currently known Bitcoin all-time high is only $69,000. Many Bitcoin mining companies might not survive a 50% cut in Bitcoin mining revenue. Q ('CY') CLSK MARA RIOT 2023Q1 $33,276 $32,100 $46,200 2022Q4 $30,500 $44,400 $53,000 2022Q3 $35,627 $91,200 $55,000 2022Q2 $37,600 $81.683 $35,300 2022Q1 $42,800 $31,700 $30,800 Unless Bitcoin outperforms our Bitcoin thesis, we don't see any way where the Bitcoin sector can come out unscathed. Even with RIOT's ambitious 35 EH/s, our model suggests that Bitcoin needs to trade above $98,000 to justify RIOT's current valuation (post-halving). Therefore, we do not recommend any exposure to the Bitcoin mining sector even though we're bullish on Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4619872-riot-platforms-ambitious-expansion-to-be-overshadowed-by-2024-bitcoin-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15312202.jpeg
42410132,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSuR,1690369009,Bitcoin Risks Deeper Price Losses Below 50-Day Average: Analysts,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently dived below a multiweek trading range and may suffer deeper losses if buyers fail to defend key support, according to technical analysts.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell over 3% on Monday, confirming a breakdown of a three-week long-range play between $29,500 and $32,000. Since then, the downside has been capped around the widely tracked 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $29,140.  According to Fairlead Strategies' founder and managing partner Katie Stockton, the outlook could worsen if the that support level gives away.  ""Two consecutive daily closes below the 50-day MA (~$29.0K) would increase downside risk back to long-term support near $25.2K,"" Stockton said in a note to clients late Monday.  Unlike stock markets, cryptocurrencies trade 24/7, which means there is no daily close price as such. Chart analysts, however, consider the last traded price at 23:59 UTC as the daily close to confirm the reliability of technical breakouts/breakdowns.  As Stockton notes, the weekly chart indicators suggest potential for a move below the 50-day average.  ""A breakdown appears likely given an overbought downturn in the weekly stochastics. Also, the weekly MACD is pinched towards a 'sell' signal in another possible setback if it confirms,"" she noted.  Traders use the stochastic indicator to gauge overbought and oversold conditions. On the weekly chart, the indicator has turned down from an overbought, or above-20, reading, confirming what is known as overbought downturn, often a precurser to price pullbacks.  The MACD histogram is used to gauge trend changes and strength. A crossover below zero is said to confirm a sell signal or a bullish-to-bearish shift in sentiment.  Alex Kuptsikevich, the senior market analyst at FxPro, says the market seems to have found an equilibrium ahead of the major central bank rate decisions, but risks of deeper drawdown persist.  ""The market has found its temporary equilibrium as it awaits the decisions of three major central banks – the Fed, the ECB, and the Bank of Japan – later this week. Their actions and comments will likely complete the market consolidation and set the trend for the coming weeks,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email on Tuesday.  ""If bearish pressure intensifies [below 50-day SMA], the next significant support level would be $27,000, the lower boundary of the rising channel from the November lows and the 200-week moving average,"" Kuptsikevich added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/26/bitcoin-risks-deeper-price-losses-below-50-day-average-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeba155cba7639714a1fb932de3d82e07a4cf9f6-3164x1319.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Super low volatility Bitcoin is either on the brink of the cliff, or it is on the launchpad. Most analysts appear to be going with the cliff theory, given that bitcoin has not been able to break through the huge resistance at $31,000, which it has been trying to do since March of this year. Volatility is incredibly low. Bollinger bands are as tight as they’ve ever been and something has to give. As the bands tighten further around bitcoin it has the effect as though someone is squeezing a bar of wet soap with more and more force until it suddenly bursts out like a projectile. The current state of play To describe the scene, bitcoin is sitting on very strong support at around $29,200. On the daily timeframe it is also resting on the 50-day moving average. Below, currently at about $27,000, is the upwards trendline which defines this bull market, and just below that is the last bastion of defence in the 200-day moving average. It must be said that if bitcoin were to fall through the entirety of all this support, what we all thought was the start of the next bull market may turn into the most deceiving bear market rally. A bearish short term? Likely bearish news is due as soon as later today. The Federal Reserve is in the midst of its latest FOMC meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make an interest rate announcement, that is very widely expected to be another 25 basis point rise to the upside. Of course, the market has already priced this in, as well as the other possible quarter point rise that the Fed has said it wants to make before the end of the year. Be that as it may, there is bound to be a lot of volatility around the time of the announcement, and also afterwards when Powell may make some hawkish utterances in order to further quell the market. When all is said and done bitcoin does appear to be demonstrating much weaker price action and the widely expected plummet to the downside could certainly take place. However, the bull market trendline and the 200-day moving average are both waiting below so look for bitcoin to make a strong bounce from these supports. Bullish medium term Looking further ahead, this bull market trendline is converging with the $31,000 resistance, thereby forming an ascending triangle.

The whale, a term for an influential holder of any financial asset, moved all of their 1,037.42 bitcoin to a new address ""bc1qtl"" in the wee hours of Wednesday. “The whale received 1,037.42 $BTC($5,107 at that time) on Apr 11, 2012, when the price was $4.92,” on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain pointed out.  Such large movements from early participants are typically uncommon. This movement could mean the holder is preparing to sell tokens, stake on an exchange, or diversify their holdings for other tokens.  The movement is the latest in a line of old wallets moving tokens such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) to exchanges this year.

15310316,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544415,1690364427,Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised For A Major Breakout – Which Way Will It Go?,"Binance Coin bulls have shown signs of sluggishness, leading to a concerning dip below the crucial $240 support level. This downward movement suggests that bearish forces may be gaining dominance in the near-term market outlook. Currently, BNB is shaping an intriguing chart pattern known as the inverted flag. Amidst the recent market turbulence, BNB’s price has experienced a 0.2% dip in the past 24 hours and a seven-day decline of 2.1%. The coin is currently trading at $237, figures from crypto market tracker CoinGecko shows. As the former high of $261.9 seems to be a distant memory, investors are keenly observing this bearish continuation pattern and its potential implications. Source: Coingecko Understanding BNB’s Inverted Flag Pattern The inverted flag pattern is a technical chart pattern that signals a potential downtrend continuation. It is formed when a sharp decline in the price of an asset (the flagpole) is followed by a brief period of consolidation, represented by a downward-sloping channel (the flag). This pattern suggests that the price will likely break the lower support trendline after a temporary relief rally and continue its downward trajectory. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Will This Bullish Formation Lead To A 25% Upsurge? With a loss of 2.0% in the last week, the BNB price is approaching the lower support trendline of the inverted flag pattern. As BNB’s bearish continuation pattern takes hold, the chances of the price breaking this dynamic support become more significant. A daily candle closing below this trendline would signal a strong possibility of the downward trend resuming. BNB market cap currently at $36.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Binance Coin: Potential Reversal At Support However, there is hope for BNB holders as signs of a potential reversal emerge. If the coin price shows resilience and starts to rebound at the bottom support trendline, it would indicate that buyers are actively defending this critical level. Related Reading: Cardano TVL – A Crucial Factor For ADA Price Revival? Such a reversal could prolong the ongoing relief rally and push the BNB price back toward the overhead trendline, currently sitting near $265. A bullish breakout from this resistance could invalidate the bearish thesis and trigger a sustainable recovery for BNB. BNB price action in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Investors should exercise caution as the inverted flag pattern unfolds and closely monitor the price action around the lower support trendline. A confirmed break below this level would confirm the bearish continuation pattern, prompting some investors to consider cutting their losses or adopting a defensive stance. On the other hand, a clear rebound from the support could present a buying opportunity for those anticipating a reversal. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

The west African country has been working to push for broader adoption of the currency, which was introduced in October 2021. Even though the number of eNaira wallets jumped more than 12-fold to 13 million between October 2022 and March this year, that's a small number for a country with a population of close to 224 million.  To boost the service offering and make it more user friendly, CBN upgraded its eNaira app to enable contactless payments, local news outlet The Sun reported earlier in July. The bank didn't provide details of planned changes to the eNaira model and hadn't responded to a request for more information by publication time.  For many, using the eNaira isn't straightforward. In March, the central bank said the value of eNaira transactions up to that point in the year was 22 billion naira ($48 million at the time). The country has a $220 billion informal economy that thrives on cash and has too few merchants and little infrastructure for extensive eNaira use.

15309350,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544403,1690362014,Dogecoin Price Analysis: What’s Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again at the center of excitement in the crypto space. Over the days, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency experienced a remarkable surge, gaining 25% in just two weeks. As traders and investors closely watch DOGE’s price movements, a combination of technical indicators and on-chain data offer intriguing insights into what may lie ahead for DOGE. Dogecoin Price Analysis According to renowned analyst Ali Martinez, DOGE’s price action has established a crucial support zone between $0.070 and $0.076. Martinez points out that in this price range, a staggering 452,000 wallets acquired a significant amount of DOGE, totaling 51.4 billion coins. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency faces stiff resistance at $0.083 and $0.088, signaling potential hurdles for further upward momentum. On-chain data firm Santiment adds to the optimism surrounding DOGE, highlighting that the average DOGE trader, active in the past year, is now in profit for the first time in 12 weeks, showing a 2.4% gain. This development is considered a significant milestone and could attract more interest from traders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why On the other hand, more traders in profit means that profit-taking is more likely, thus selling pressure could build up. Moreover, the DOGE social dominance indicator has not yet reached the dangerous “FOMO zone,” indicating the possibility of a further upward surge. Undoubtedly, the current price momentum of Dogecoin is due to Elon Musk. The recent price rally can be attributed to speculation that the meme coin may become a payment method on Twitter’s rebranded platform, “X.” Traders seem eager to front-run Elon Musk’s decision on this matter, as he has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Jumps 10% – Here’s Why The Bulls Could Aim $0.085 This has fueled roaring speculation, resulting in a surge in the perpetual futures market tied to DOGE, with notional open interest exceeding $512 million for the first time since April 19. On that day, DOGE traded at $0.0941 and saw a price drop of about 19% over the next three days. While the influx of new money into the market is generally seen as a confirmation of an uptrend, traders should remain cautious. As profit-taking becomes more likely with more traders in profit, selling pressure could build up, potentially leading to a temporary pullback in DOGE’s price. However, at press time, the open interest weighted-funding rates were close to zero, suggesting a balance between long and short positions. DOGE/USD 1-Day Chart As explained in the last chart analysis before the pump, DOGE had formed an ascending triangle formation signaling a trend reversal. As predicted, DOGE broke out above the resistance at $0.075 and initially stalled at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.0785). However, after a brief pause, the Dogecoin price continued its rally and climbed to $0.0839, where the bulls paused for the time being due to resistance. While the daily RSI is still not overbought at 68.5, another push higher seems possible. However, lower profit-taking seems to dominate the market for now, so a retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0785 could be a likely scenario. If the bulls defend this support, DOGE could rise another 20% to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0937. The next target would then be the yearly high at $0.1044 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.1066.

15309180,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/tokenization-will-transform-real-estate-investing-and-ownership,1690362000,Tokenization Will Transform Real Estate Investing & Ownership,"The real estate industry is ripe for transformation through the advent of tokenization, which makes it possible for physical properties to be represented as digital tokens on the blockchain. Tokenizing real estate opens the door to fractional ownership and the possibility of millions of new investors getting involved in the industry. No wonder, real estate tokens have already become extremely popular, accounting for almost 40% of the global digital securities market. The clearest advantage of tokenization is that it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry, enabling small-scale investors to become part-owners of real estate for the first time. What Does Real Estate Tokenization Look Like? Tokenization of real estate is a powerful yet simple concept, where a property such as a luxury beach resort, hotel, condominium or home is represented by digital tokens. The property can be represented by, say, 10,000 tokens, meaning 10,000 different individuals could each own a portion of that asset. By enabling fractional ownership, investors with limited capital can finally get involved in real estate. Blockchain technology is the foundation on which real estate tokenization is built. The decentralized ledger, which also underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, provides a secure and transparent platform for digital assets to be stored and transferred. Smart contracts, which are agreements that execute automatically when specific conditions are met, can be used to streamline the transaction process, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The Power Of Tokenized Real Estate It’s not just that transactions become more efficient. Tokenization can also bring greater liquidity into the real estate market, and make it more accessible. Real estate has traditionally always been an illiquid asset class because of its high costs and the complex transaction process. When real estate is tokenized, this is no longer the case, as individuals can freely buy and sell shares of a property without any intermediary. This ease of buying and selling, combined with the lower costs, encourages greater liquidity for the industry. Small investors especially can benefit from tokenization. Before tokenization, someone would need millions of dollars to invest in high-end real estate. With fractional ownership, that’s no longer the case as individuals can purchase a small share of an expensive luxury resort and become an investor in real estate for the first time. Tokenization has the effect of making real estate more inclusive. Opportunities for small investors already exist. The blockchain-based real estate investment platform LABS Group recently announced that it had successfully distributed the first dividends to investors of the luxurious Kunang Kunang Tent Resort project based in Indonesia. It’s a luxury resort on the island of Java, located in a picturesque destination renowned for its natural beauty, and it has enjoyed big demand since the reopening of tourism in the region following the COVID pandemic. The Kunang Kunang Tent Resort has a commendable 9.6 rating on Booking.com and 9.3 rating on Agoda, and has achieved an average occupancy rate of 58% since it first opened a year ago. According to LABS Group, early investors’ dividends amounted to a yield of approximately 10%. Normally, individuals would need access to millions of dollars to become an investor in a project like the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort, but tokenization has instead made it possible for thousands of individuals to get involved by acquiring non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that represent a share of the property. It doesn’t just lower the barrier to entry though, for tokenization also means increased transparency and transaction efficiency. If an investor decides they no longer want to be involved, they can quickly sell their share of ownership (the tokens they own) on a decentralized, public marketplace. The transaction will be powered by smart contracts and completely transparent, improving regulatory efficiency. New Business Models Blockchain technology can also be leveraged to create new business models involving real estate. For instance, Staynex is a revolutionary vacation membership platform that enables users to acquire the rights to visit resorts on an annual basis. It’s similar in some ways to timeshares, but investors can also earn rewards simply by holding onto their membership. Stays at resorts are tokenized through NFTs that specify the number of nights allocated to each investor at a specific property. The startup calls its NFTs “Staynex Passes”, and they provide the NFT holder with a guaranteed annual stay at the specified resort and the ability to earn rewards from the resort’s business operations. Of course, users are free to sell or gift their NFT to someone else at any time. Challenges For Real Estate Tokenization If real estate tokenization is to gain traction, the industry will need to overcome a couple of challenges. One of the main concerns is the lack of any consistent regulatory framework that governs digital asset markets. Different countries have different laws regarding crypto assets, and this can cause confusion for project leaders and investors. In addition, there’s no centralized reporting system for tokenized real estate transactions, which may cause issues with regulators that want to monitor and enforce compliance in the industry. Another concern has to do with the potential vulnerabilities of smart contracts. If smart contracts can be exploited, investors may be wary of investing too much money into tokenized real estate. However, it’s hoped that as regulatory frameworks for digital assets evolve, the process of tokenizing real estate and transferring these assets will become more secure. A Compelling Use Case While those challenges may hold back adoption of real estate tokenization for now, there seems little doubt that it can be a revolutionary, game-changing concept for the industry. Tokenization and fractional ownership will dramatically increase accessibility, giving millions of people an enticing opportunity to diversify their investments. As the number of tokenized properties increases, investing in real estate will become a radically different and more inclusive experience.

The blockchain-based real estate investment platform LABS Group recently announced that it had successfully distributed the first dividends to investors of the luxurious Kunang Kunang Tent Resort project based in Indonesia. It’s a luxury resort on the island of Java, located in a picturesque destination renowned for its natural beauty, and it has enjoyed big demand since the reopening of tourism in the region following the COVID pandemic. The Kunang Kunang Tent Resort has a commendable 9.6 rating on Booking.com and 9.3 rating on Agoda, and has achieved an average occupancy rate of 58% since it first opened a year ago. According to LABS Group, early investors’ dividends amounted to a yield of approximately 10%. Normally, individuals would need access to millions of dollars to become an investor in a project like the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort, but tokenization has instead made it possible for thousands of individuals to get involved by acquiring non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that represent a share of the property. It doesn’t just lower the barrier to entry though, for tokenization also means increased transparency and transaction efficiency. If an investor decides they no longer want to be involved, they can quickly sell their share of ownership (the tokens they own) on a decentralized, public marketplace. The transaction will be powered by smart contracts and completely transparent, improving regulatory efficiency. New Business Models Blockchain technology can also be leveraged to create new business models involving real estate. For instance, Staynex is a revolutionary vacation membership platform that enables users to acquire the rights to visit resorts on an annual basis. It’s similar in some ways to timeshares, but investors can also earn rewards simply by holding onto their membership. Stays at resorts are tokenized through NFTs that specify the number of nights allocated to each investor at a specific property. The startup calls its NFTs “Staynex Passes”, and they provide the NFT holder with a guaranteed annual stay at the specified resort and the ability to earn rewards from the resort’s business operations. Of course, users are free to sell or gift their NFT to someone else at any time. Challenges For Real Estate Tokenization If real estate tokenization is to gain traction, the industry will need to overcome a couple of challenges. One of the main concerns is the lack of any consistent regulatory framework that governs digital asset markets. Different countries have different laws regarding crypto assets, and this can cause confusion for project leaders and investors. In addition, there’s no centralized reporting system for tokenized real estate transactions, which may cause issues with regulators that want to monitor and enforce compliance in the industry. Another concern has to do with the potential vulnerabilities of smart contracts. If smart contracts can be exploited, investors may be wary of investing too much money into tokenized real estate. However, it’s hoped that as regulatory frameworks for digital assets evolve, the process of tokenizing real estate and transferring these assets will become more secure. A Compelling Use Case While those challenges may hold back adoption of real estate tokenization for now, there seems little doubt that it can be a revolutionary, game-changing concept for the industry. Tokenization and fractional ownership will dramatically increase accessibility, giving millions of people an enticing opportunity to diversify their investments. As the number of tokenized properties increases, investing in real estate will become a radically different and more inclusive experience.

The landmark shows the surging demand among users in the crypto space to conduct cross-chain token swaps and transfer liquidity between different chains. What Is LayerZero? Interoperability issues have plagued the blockchain ecosystem. For seamless interoperability between blockchains, projects must implement standardized data formats, secure communication channels, common consensus mechanisms, and secure, scalable interoperability protocols. This is where LayerZero comes into the picture. LayerZero is a cross-chain communication protocol that facilitates trustless, direct communication between different blockchains, supporting prominent players such as Solana, Aptos, SUI, EVM Chains, and others. The communication protocol could potentially revolutionize how blockchains interact with one another, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as bridges and facilitating direct communication instead. LayerZero’s Unique Approach LayerZero uses a unique approach called Ultra Light Nodes (ULNs) to facilitate interoperability. Ultra Light Nodes are essentially lightweight blockchain clients that can validate transactions on other chains without requiring them to download the entire blockchain state. This allows LayerZero to achieve a significantly high throughput, along with low latency during inter-chain communication with blockchains that have different architectures and consensus mechanisms. The Ultra Light Nodes are deployed on chains that wish to communicate with one another and maintain a partial view of the chain they are deployed on, which is then used to validate transactions. Relayers, a type of off-chain service, are responsible for relaying messages between ULNs on different chains. As an incentive, relayers are adequately compensated for each message they transmit between chains. Oracles, another third-party service, are used to pass on the block header to the target chain’s endpoint, following which the transaction proof is submitted. Once submitted, the destination chain validates the proof using its consensus mechanism. The 50 Million Milestone LayerZero crossed the 50 million messages milestone for messages between blockchains on Tuesday. The landmark achievement highlights the high demand among users in the crypto space to conduct cross-chain token swaps and liquidity transfers between chains, despite several vulnerabilities and risks. This is because data from Chainalysis has shown that bridge exploits accounted for over $2 billion in stolen assets in 2022 alone. The news also comes just three months after LayerZero Labs, the entity behind LayerZero raised $120 million in capital from over 33 backers. The list of backers included prominent names such as auction house Christies’ Sequoia Capital, Samsung Next, and Andreessen Horowitz. The Series B funding round was done at a valuation of $3 billion, nearly tripling its valuation from its $135 million round, held in March 2022. Other backers in the latest funding round included OpenSea Ventures, Circle Ventures, and BOND. The funding round also marked a rare funding deal in a prolonged crypto bear market that has seen funding dry to a crisp. Co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs stated, “LayerZero is to blockchains what the internet was to computing clusters. LayerZero allows chains not only to build bridges (to transfer assets/value between them) but send and execute arbitrary data just like a packet on the internet. What this means is that you can now build applications that are orders of magnitude more complex than existing applications and do so with a completely seamless experience between chains.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410120,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSGl,1690360136,"Craig Wright Must Pay $516K to Pursue Case Against Kraken, Coinbase: UK Judge","Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claims he is blockchain innovator Satoshi Nakamoto and owns the concepts underpinning Bitcoin, must pay 400,000 British pounds ($516,000) in security for legal costs to pursue claims against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken.  James Mellor, a judge at the England and Wales High Court, said he wasn’t convinced Wright would be able to fund legal costs, pointing to previous allegedly inconsistent statements about Wright’s financial position in a judgment issued Tuesday.  The evidence “does not persuade me” that Wright or his investment company have liquid assets to meet potentially substantial legal costs, Mellor said, adding that he’ll strike out the action within weeks if security isn’t put in place.  Wright says he owns the goodwill in the term “Bitcoin,” and that Coinbase and Kraken, by allowing trading in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), are damaging the brand of rival cryptocurrency bitcoin satoshi vision (BSV).  Mellor cited statements made by Wright that he had made himself financially “untouchable” by using a trust to shift assets and testimony allegedly inconsistent with that given in parallel U.S. court proceedings involving former business partner Ira Kleiman.  In a Florida case due to be heard later Wednesday, Wright is due to defend himself against charges he should be held in contempt of court for failing to fully disclose information needed to resolve a dispute with Kleiman’s estate over the ownership of $143 million in cryptocurrency. Wright has argued he doesn’t have financial information about his wife Ramona Ang and that his own witness statements filed in UK courts constitute “hearsay.”  In October, an Oslo court ruled Twitter user Hodlonaut had been within his rights to post 2019 tweets calling Wright a ""fraud"" and ""scammer” for saying he was Nakamoto, author of the 2008 Bitcoin White Paper. An appeal of that case will be heard later this year.  In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Kraken told CoinDesk that the ruling “is an important win in our defense against Wright’s claims to control Bitcoin.”  “Satoshi never meant for a single person to control Bitcoin, which is why he released the Bitcoin software under open-source licenses for the world’s benefit,” the spokesperson said.  Coinbase and lawyers for Wright did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

42410130,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTSnp,1690358914,Singapore High Court Declares Crypto as Property in Case Involving Bybit,"Singapore’s High Court has recognised crypto as a property capable of being held on trust, in a case involving Seychelles-based exchange Bybit and a contractor, according to a court judgement published on Tuesday.  Bybit brought a case against Ho Kai Xin, claiming that in breach of her employment contract, she abused her position to transfer over 4.2 million USDT (stablecoin issued by Tether) to addresses owned and controlled by her. Ho also transferred a quantity of fiat currency to her own bank account.  “Like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust,” Judge Philip Jeyaretnam, who presided over the case, said.  The judge's ruling also referred to a public consultation response published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 3 July 2023, which “reflect the reality that it is possible in practice to identify and segregate digital assets,” supporting the view that they can be held on trust.  The judge added that “the holder of a crypto asset has in principle an incorporeal right of property recognisable by the common law as a thing in action and so enforceable in court.” He acknowledged that this conclusion might have an “element of circularity” about it, it is “not strikingly different from how the law approaches other social constructs, such as money.”  “It is only because people generally accept the exchange value of shells or beads or differently printed paper notes that they become currency,” Jeyaretnam said.  “While some people are sceptical of the value of crypto assets, it is worth keeping in mind that value is not inherent in an object,” he added.  The exchange sought a declaration that Ho was holding both the USDT and fiat currency on trust for Bybit. Ho blamed her cousin Jason Teo for stealing the assets from ByBit without her knowledge, claiming that only he owned and controlled those addresses.  The judge accepted on a balance of probabilities that “Jason does not exist (or at any rate did not play the role asserted for him by Ms Ho),” and ordered that Ho transfer assets back to Bybit.  CoinDesk has reached out to Bybit for comment.

According to a representative from the company, the latest fundraise gives it a valuation of at least $1 billion. Details Of The Fundraise The Series B round was led by San Francisco-based firm Paradigm and marks a shift from current trends that have seen venture capitalists pivot towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the crypto space. According to a statement from the Cayman Islands-based Flashbots, the financing was raised through an event called the “beauty contest for decentralization” that enabled the selection of investors based on their reverse pitches. Additionally, the funding round gives the Ethereum software infrastructure provider a valuation of at least $1 billion, cementing its Unicorn status. On the 21st of July, Flashbots had filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it had raised around $30 million of the total amount it wished to raise. At the time, the company was hoping to raise anywhere between $30 million and $50 million at a valuation of $1 billion. More Securities and Exchange Commission filings are expected in the near future and will shed light on the total amount raised during the funding round. The company added that the Series B funding round included several leading venture capital firms apart from Paradigm, along with leading decentralized exchanges, apps, Layer 2 networks, and angel investors. Paradigm was the lead investor during the Series B round and was also the lead investor during the company’s seed stage funding round in 2020. Funding Earmarked For SUAVE Flashbots creates software that helps to reduce the negative impacts of MEV or Maximal Extractable Value. MEV refers to the profit made by blockchain operators over and above the fees paid by users and can be extracted through several ways, such as front-running transactions. In front-running transactions, users can pay fees to move ahead of other users. The new and updated technology is called SUAVE (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression). Through SUAVE, Flashbots aims to offset potential risks associated with Maximal Extractable Value by facilitating a more transparent and decentralized approach. The funding raised during the latest round has been earmarked for the development of Flashbot’s SUAVE platform. The SUAVE platform has been designed to enable users to transact more securely, privately, and at considerably reduced costs. Charlie Noyes, Paradigm General Partner, noted in a statement that he expected Flashbots to deliver on some of the most promising aspects of blockchain technology. “The future of MEV is the future of crypto. We’re proud to continue supporting Flashbots in its mission to develop Suave and ensure crypto remains transparent, efficient, and equitable.” Sweeping Personnel Changes In June, Flashbots underwent significant personnel changes, with several new hires joining the team and several prominent members exiting the company.

This technical pattern is characterized by higher lows, converging with a horizontal resistance level. The current price of SHIB stands at $0.00000789, experiencing a meager 1% in increase in the last 24 hours and recording a modest seven-day gain of 0.6%, data from CoinGecko shows. However, the real excitement lies in the potential breakout that could lead to a fresh prolonged recovery for the cryptocurrency from this ascending triangle pattern. Source: Coingecko Shiba Inu Ascending Triangle Pattern Explained An ascending triangle pattern is a technical chart formation characterized by higher lows and a horizontal resistance line. Traders often interpret this as a potential bullish signal. As the price approaches the flat resistance line, it indicates that buyers are becoming more aggressive, creating higher lows. This pattern suggests that a breakout to the upside is more likely than a breakdown to the downside. Related Reading: Cardano TVL – A Crucial Factor For ADA Price Revival? Currently, Shiba Inu’s price is hovering near the neckline of the ascending triangle at $0.00000788. A bullish breakout from this neckline at $0.00000845 could trigger a significant price surge for SHIB. This could set the stage for a fresh and prolonged recovery, potentially enticing more buyers to enter the market.

Musk, known for his influential tweets and interest in cryptocurrencies, has hinted at potential collaborations and projects within the crypto space. The billionaire has recently ditched the iconic Twitter blue bird and replaced it with “X.” With SHIB being a meme-based token that gained popularity partly due to its Shiba Inu dog logo, any association with Musk’s plans could attract more attention and buying momentum. The impact of #SHIB will be felt at X if Elon will give Shiba INU instead of FIAT for ad revenues .

15306507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544376,1690354807,Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Buy Signal With 78% Accuracy Flashes,"After Ethereum (ETH) once again failed to break the $2,000 level in the 1-day chart, the price has been on a downward slide in recent days. However, this could now change, as a historically accurate trend indicator shows. Crypto traders and analysts constantly seek reliable indicators to navigate the turbulent market. One such indicator gaining attention is the Tom Demark 9 (TD9), which has flashed a buy signal for Ethereum (ETH) on the daily chart. Renowned analyst Joe McCann shared his insights via Twitter, revealing an intriguing success rate of 78% for ETH’s historical TD9 buy signals. Ethereum (ETH) Buy Signal Joe McCann’s tweet brought the spotlight on ETHUSD’s TD9 buy signal, which occurred after the asset dropped 8.7% from its recent high. The TD9 indicator, an indicator that also measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, similar to the RSI, aims to identify potential trend reversals. According to McCann, historical data showcases the TD9 buy signal’s remarkable accuracy for ETH, with a win rate of nearly 78%. Possible price targets include the July open at $1,933, the August 2022 bear market rally high at $2,031, and the year-to-date 2021 high at $2,142, according to the analyst. Digging deeper into the data, McCann highlights the impressive performance of ETH following TD9 buy signals. The statistics reveal that, on average, the asset surged by over 2.6% in the seven days following the signal, with a median return of almost 5%. These figures alone could pique the interest of traders looking for an edge in the crypto market. Related Reading: Fidelity Backs Ethereum: Wall Street’s Biggest Players Bet On Crypto’s Number 2 To provide a more nuanced picture, McCann narrowed the data to examine the year 2019, a period he deems analogous to the 2023 crypto market cycle. The results are even more captivating, showing a remarkable win rate of nearly 90% for TD9 buy signals during this period. However, if we trim the data back to starting in 2019 (a year very similar to 2023 in terms of crypto market cycles), ETH has a win rate of nearly 90% with the average return over +7%. But, as with any indicator, there are exceptions and occasional inaccuracies. McCann’s data shows several instances where the TD9 buy signal failed to predict ETH’s price movement accurately. Noteworthy is March 13, 2018, when the ETH price slid massively after the buy signal. The ETH price plummeted by 19.3% within seven days and by as much as 34.8% within the next 14 days. The signal was similarly bad on May 8, 2018, after which ETH fell by 22.1% in the following seven days and 26.7% in the following 14 days. On the other hand, the TD9 buy signal has predicted some massive rallies. For example, on December 10, 2018, following the signal, ETH initially rose by 3.7% in the first seven days, but then came a fabulous 53.0% rise in 14 days and 64.5% in 30 days. The most recent TD9 buy signal on March 11, 20223 delivered a price increase of 18.8% in the first seven days and 29.9% after 30 days. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH In general, it can be seen that the accuracy of the TD9 indicator decreases over time. While the indicator has a success rate of 78% in the first seven days with an average 7-day forward return of +2.65% and a median return of almost 5%, the success rate falls in the subsequent period of time. After 14 days, the TD9 indicator has a success rate of only 55.5% (mean 3.8%, median 5.7%), after 30 days of 63.0% (mean 6.9%, median 3.8%) since 2018. Federal Reserve Meeting Looms While the TD9 buy signal paints a positive picture for ETH, the crypto market remains vulnerable to external factors, including the upcoming FOMC meeting today. There is a 98.9% probability that there will be a 25 basis point rate hike. But the big question is whether this will be the last hike in this cycle. McCann writes: July 26th is the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell is expected to hike rates another 25 bps. Will Jerome Powell ruin the party for the ETH bulls at the press conference? At press time, the Ether (ETH) price stood at $1,859.

The cryptocurrency has gained 25% in two weeks amid speculation that the cryptocurrency could be used as a payment mechanism on the rebranded Twitter platform.  ""As crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer’s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat. Musk is on a marketing tour in re-inventing Twitter,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said.  Traders seem to think the same, as evident from the pick-up in the perpetual futures market tied to DOGE.  The notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures contracts, has topped the $500 million mark for the first time since April 19, per data tracked by Coinglass. The tally has more than doubled in two weeks. In DOGE terms, open interest has surged to 6.2B, nearing the peak of 6.43B reached on April 8.  A combination of an increase in open interest alongside a rise in price suggests an influx of new money into the market and is said to confirm an uptrend.  However, at press time, the open interest weighted-funding rates have dropped to zero, suggesting a balance between bullish long and bearish short positions.  Perhaps, DOGE may see a bull breather after the recent market-beating performance.

15299137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544360,1690336839,Binance Pool’s Litecoin Hash Rate Falls 50%: What’s Next?,"As of July 25, on-chain data indicates that the hash rate dedicated to the Litecoin network for mining from Binance Pool, a platform focused on improving miners’ income, is down by over 50% in the past seven months. In crypto mining, hash rate is the cumulative computing power funneled to a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Monero. These public networks rely on miners distributed across the globe for security, decentralization, and transaction confirmation. Binance Pool Hash Rate To Litecoin Drops By 50% Presently, Binance Pool is allocating approximately 28 TH/s of hash rate to the Litecoin network, a decrease from the average of around 69 TH/s recorded in January 2023. Consequently, Binance Pool has lost its standing as one of the dominant Litecoin mining pools as of July 2023. As of July 25, Binance Pool is ranked 7th in the Litecoin mining pool scene, accounting for approximately 3.6% of the total hash rate share. In comparison, competitors like Poolin, F2Pool, and viaBTC occupy higher positions, indicating that despite Binance Pool being backed by Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, miners are opting for other pools, some of whom were among the first mining pools in the globe. Related Reading: Ducati Partners With Ripple, Prepares To Launch NFT Collection On XRP Ledger At the moment, it cannot be immediately ascertained as to what the cause can be. However, Binance faces legal challenges in multiple countries, especially in the United States. Two of the country’s top regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have sued the exchange, accusing them of violating securities laws. Based on the hash rate, viaBTC currently controls the lion’s share in Litecoin mining, carving out 33% of the total Litecoin network hash rate. F2Pool follows with around 17.2% share, while antpool ranks third with a market share of 13%. Litecoin Pool and Poolin also channel more computing power than Binance Pool. Given the increasingly competitive mining landscape, individual miners must pool their resources and dedicate hash rate through a mining pool. Despite the drop in rankings and hash rate over the last seven months, Binance Pool still plays a critical role in proof-of-work mining networks, including Bitcoin. Halving Incoming, Will LTC Rally? Litecoin currently offers miners 12.5 LTC and transaction fees for each block mined. However, this reward will be halved in the upcoming weeks. The halving even will impact block mining revenue. Nonetheless, a price increase could encourage miners to upgrade their equipment and deploy miners with higher hash rates. Related Reading: Fundstrat Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $180,000 In 2024, But What’s The Catalyst? Presently, Litecoin has a total hash rate of approximately 780 TH/s, with the network releasing 7,200 LTC to miners daily. However, with the expected supply shock, how Litecoin prices react is yet to be seen. If past cycles guide, Litecoin may rally. According to Litecoin daily price charts, LTC has a resistance at around $115 but is trading below $100. At this level, it is down 23% from July 2023 peaks.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, which was trading near $29.2, has resisted the influences of recent macroeconomic events, but may find its missing catalyst in a possible spot BTC ETF, says Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of custodian Cobo.  Insights: Even as bitcoin shrugs off macroeconomic events, at least one indicator is pointing up, writes CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams. Also, Tribe Capital's Boris Revsin sees a DeFi resurgence.

Bitcoin is up 0.2% to $29,167, according to CoinDesk data, while ether is up 0.4% to $1,856.  “At present, the cryptocurrency market is in a phase lacking a coherent narrative logic, heavily influenced by macro and regulatory factors. One significant influencing factor is the application of traditional institutions for a Bitcoin ETF,” Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of custodian Cobo told CoinDesk in a note.  Grayscale's influx of US dollars sparked a Bitcoin rally in 2021 and 2022, and with traditional financial institutions likely to receive approval for cryptocurrency spot ETFs by Q1 of 2024, he said in the note while anticipating that the launch of one or two ETFs with substantial liquidity, reestablishing compliant funding channels in North America.  “When a large number of ETFs are approved, from the perspective of traditional asset allocation or risk aversion, directly purchasing ETFs from these brokerage banks means a substantial amount of funds will flow into major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum,” he said.  “This will be a crucial event.”  Vivien Fang, head of financial products at Bybit, said that liquidity volatile and uncertain “it’s still too early to call for a bull market in digital assets.”  “This is because many central banks are still tightening, and China’s policy is still unclear,” she continued. “However, these ranges represent excellent accumulation zones for those with a long-term outlook.”  Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that in the last 12 hours, $15.45 million of shorts have been liquidated in comparison to $10.73 million in longs.

Consider the two most recent U.S. central bank interest rate hikes in May and March. They resulted in relatively mild price moves of 1.13% and -2.87%. The reaction to recent inflation and GDP data was similarly tame, with BTC moving just -0.74% and 1.16% respectively. All told, crypto markets have likely priced in Wednesday’s anticipated move. More interesting for traders is BTC’s price declining below the lower range of its Bollinger Bands, indicating that its price could move higher – albeit just slightly. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that tracks an asset’s 20-day moving average, and plots price levels two standard deviations above and below the average. As an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time, a breach of the external bands is statistically significant. Traders may be eyeing an upside target of $30,000 level, above the current support of $29,000.

The sector lost its allure amid the crypto winter. Now can DeFi recover some of its former glory? Boris Revsin, managing partner of Tribe Capital, an investment firm with over $1.6 billion in assets under management, thinks it can as more infrastructure gets developed in more open markets outside the U.S., making it easier to create new projects. “I expect DeFi to have a major resurgence towards the end of this year or early next year,” Revsin told CoinDesk during a recent interview.

15297658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544348,1690333257,"Tezos (XTZ) Loses Steam In Q2, Market Cap Drops 30% Following SEC Crackdown","According to a recent report by crypto research firm Messari, Tezos has been progressing in its roadmap development, with several new features and upgrades being introduced to the network. The platform’s core developers have announced a strategic shift to hybrid optimistic/zk rollups, with multiple teams committed to building rollups that will enable the platform to process more transactions per second (TPS) and enhance scalability. Tezos DeFi Ecosystem Booms Per the report, the recent launch of the 14th network upgrade, Nairobi, has brought improvements to the platform, new rollup functionality, and enhanced attestations. In addition, Tezos core developers have unveiled the Data Availability Layer (DAL), which operates in parallel with Tezos Layer-1 and ensures data availability while scaling bandwidth and storage capacity. Tezos has also been experiencing growing traction in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space, with the Total Value Locked (TVL) nearly doubling in the past year. The platform is seeing the launch of several new DeFi protocols, including novel DEXs, lending protocols, and perps protocols. To further support the growth of the Tezos ecosystem, the XTZ Ecosystem DAO has been introduced to manage and distribute XTZ, Tezos’ native token, to support community initiatives. Nevertheless, despite experiencing a strong Q1 2023, with market capitalization surging from $0.66 billion to $1.03 billion (+55%), outperforming the broader market by 9%, the platform saw a 30% Quarter-over Quarter (QoQ) drop in Q2, ending the quarter with a market capitalization of $0.72 billion, primarily following the SEC’s complaints against Binance and Coinbase. Related Reading: Here’s How Crypto Offers A Lifeline For This Bahamian Payment Company Furthermore, the total crypto market capitalization during Q2 increased by 2%, driven by Bitcoin and Ethereum, which saw a 7% and 6% rise, respectively, propelled by the introduction of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). On the other hand, Tezos’ revenue, measured by total gas fees spent (excluding storage costs), experienced an 82% QoQ decrease in Q2, primarily influenced by a 79% decrease in the average transaction fee. The reduction in the average transaction fee was attributed to the decline of the XTZ price and a slowdown in NFT front-running bidding activities. Fixed Inflation Rate And Burn Mechanisms Tezos’ native token, XTZ, serves multiple functions within the network, including staking, governance, and payment for gas fees. The token has a fixed annual inflation rate of 4.4%, with a total supply of 965 million XTZ. The report notes that Tezos has implemented burn mechanisms by creating new accounts or smart contracts and imposing penalties on misbehaving validators. Moreover, During Q2, Tezos displayed consistent usage levels compared to previous quarters. The network recorded an average of 53,000 daily smart contract calls and 41,000 daily transactions, indicating a 7% decrease and a 1% decline in QoQ, respectively. However, NFTs remain the key driver of activity on Tezos, while DeFi applications continue to see greater adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Red, US Institutions Disinterested? Conversely, Tezos’ ecosystem experienced mixed activity, with NFTs and gaming remaining relatively flat, while DeFi continues to see increased activity. Regarding decentralization and staking, Tezos has a globally distributed validator set with a high staking rate relative to other base-layer protocols. Looking ahead, Tezos’ strategic shift in its roll-up roadmap, continued developments in the Data Availability Layer, and the anticipated activation of the Hybrid Optimistic/ZK Rollup hold promise for further growth and innovation on the network. Overall, Tezos remains a promising player in the blockchain space, with a robust ecosystem and a growing community of developers and users. Currently, the price of XTZ is $0.810801, representing a 0.41% price decline in the last 24 hours and a 2.06% price decline in the past 7 days. The 24-hour trading volume for XTZ is $15,383,765.48, indicating significant trading activity on the Tezos network.
