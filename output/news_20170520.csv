42379487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8887l,1495317324,Securities Laws Aren't the Only Rules Token Sales Have to Consider,"Peter Van Valkenburgh is director of research at Coin Center, a Washington, DC-based cryptocurrency think tank, and the author of the new report, ""The Bank Secrecy Act, Cryptocurrencies and New Tokens: What is Known and What Remains Ambiguous.""  In this opinion piece, Van Valkenburgh discusses regulatory issues surrounding cryptographic token sales, arguing US regulators could come to dramatically recast their historical relationship to value transmission by aggressively moving to limit the nascent funding form.      There is a dangerous hole in our current understanding of federal regulation of token sales, and it's not what you may think. Several lawyers, myself included, have previously sounded the alarm with respect to securities laws. But there is another issue: federal financial surveillance laws.  Better known as ""AML/KYC"" rules, these are laws that require businesses to collect and report information about customers. Uncertainty surrounding the application of these laws to token sales is at least as pronounced as the uncertainty surrounding the securities laws. The regulator on point has already fined one company in the space for selling tokens.  Worse, the regulatory guidance thus far released to explain who is and isn't on the hook is hard to parse and — at times — contradictory.  The background  A federal law, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), mandates that ""financial institutions"" (a broad category of businesses offering financial services) must collect and retain information about their customers and share that information with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau within the US Department of the Treasury.  The emergence of bitcoin and decentralized crypto-tokens has raised an important question. When do businesses dealing with these new technologies fit the definition of ""financial institution"" and become obligated to surveil and report on their customers?  For bitcoin businesses, the question has been largely answered, but the law is not clear with respect to new token sales.  Several issues remain unresolved and carry tremendous potential liabilities for innovators. These include:  Are BSA obligations triggered when the developers of a new decentralized token protocol sell that token to US persons?  Do these sales fit into the definition of ""money transmission"" under financial surveillance regulations?  Are sales to US persons without engaging in KYC violations of those laws?  In some of its administrative rulings, FinCEN has suggested that selling bitcoins or tokens from your own account (eg tokens you own) is not money transmission.  For example, when a miner sells the fruits of their mining efforts for dollars, or an investor decides to close their position in a token.  The XRP example  But in other contexts, particularly in the settlement agreement they reached with Ripple in 2015, FinCEN has suggested that selling a token you own (XRP in the Ripple case) is money transmission, and to do so without registering with FinCEN and complying with its regulations is a serious offense worthy of a major monetary penalty ($700,000 in the case of Ripple) or else time in jail for company management and even potentially shareholders.  This is a highly consequential legal uncertainty that lies like a trap for innovators dealing with US persons — many of whom have a good faith belief that they are doing nothing wrong. But this isn't just about how to structure a token sale so that it's legal. American competitiveness, jobs and the future of innovation on our shores is also at stake, as are our fundamental rights to privacy and free speech.  For the non-lawyer, the argument can be phrased in simple English.  Common understanding suggests that ""money transmission"" is an act performed by an intermediary; a person who stands between two parties accepting money from one and transmitting it to another.  When a person transacts directly with another person, giving them money for any reason — as a gift, a payment, a donation, a grant, a tip — she does not play this intermediary role. She does not hold herself out as a trusted third party. She is engaged in private, personal transactions rather than being engaged as a third party to the transactions of others.  A person who invents a new decentralized token and sells it to another person is not playing an intermediary role; they are engaged in a private transaction selling the fruits of their ingenuity and labor.  Balancing privacy and security  Congress made the policy choice long ago to deputize third-party intermediaries to surveil users on behalf of the government, and it's one that carries risks to individual privacy but also potential benefits to national security and peace.  However, mandating the same kind of surveillance from individuals who are not intermediaries — who are merely transacting on their own account with another citizen — is a considerable recalibration of the balance between privacy and security. It tips the scales against personal privacy and may even be unconstitutional.  This is not a recalibration that should be made merely by issuing administrative rulings or guidance, the approach thus far taken by FinCEN when dealing with these questions. Instead, FinCEN should clarify that selling decentralized virtual currency on one's own account does not constitute money transmission, regardless of whether the purpose of that sale is to pay a merchant, to sell tokens received through mining or — indeed — to sell one's own newly invented decentralized token.  Should FinCEN or Congress wish to regulate this activity for financial surveillance purposes, that change should be the subject of a larger, more public debate within a notice and comment rule-making or an amendment to the statutory law itself.  Only those formal processes can enable necessary debate over financial surveillance and the constitutionality of warrantless search.

42379500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888O7,1495306230,"History is Made: Bitcoin Prices Top $2,000 to Set New All-Time High","The price of bitcoin surpassed $2,000 for the first time in history today, pushing the cryptocurrency to a fresh, new record amid rising trader interest.  The currency's price rose as much as 2.62% during the session, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) to hit a press time high of $2,019. By rising above $2,000, bitcoin's price has surged more than 100% this year and nearly 125% since hitting an annual low of $891.51 in late March.  Now that the the digital currency has surpassed this key, psychological level of $2,000, it could experience some significant tailwinds, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.  High hopes  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that should bitcoin prices ""convincingly"" surpass $2,000, ""the rate of price appreciation will accelerate dramatically"".  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, also weighed in on the importance of this price level, stating:  ""As a psychological level, bitcoin hitting $2,000 is an important milestone and will generate further interest that could boost the price further.""  Speaking of interest, analysts generally agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 could spur significant attention from the media. Hayes offered similar sentiment, stating that a sustained rise above $2,000 would prompt every major financial media outlet to cover bitcoin.  In spite of all this visibility, Hayter cautioned that sometimes, the ""lack of sophistication"" that goes along with mainstream media coverage ""can be dangerous as it snowballs momentum.""  Interestingly enough, Google Trends data has thus far shown that online searches for the word ""bitcoin"" have still not recovered to the all-time high they set in December 2013, but they are getting closer. While a figure of 100 represents the highest point for these searches, the metric stood at 85 at the time of report.  While many agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 would spur greater media coverage, the factors that drove the currency's price above this level seemed a bit more complex.  Growing trader interest  One development that has coincided with bitcoin's sharp price gains over the last several months is the rising interest of traders, as measured by trading volume at major exchanges. Earlier this month, both Kraken and Poloniex announced that they were experiencing surging transaction activity.  Kraken indicated that on 5th May, trading volume across all digital assets surpassed $178m, setting an all-time high and beating the prior record by 25%.  Poloniex expressed similar sentiment, saying in a statement that:  ""We have never seen such enthusiasm for trading blockchain tokens as we have in the past few months. Since January, we've seen an increase of more than 600% active traders online and regularly process 640% more transactions than we did merely [four] months ago.""  Another factor that has helped drive bitcoin prices is the rising influence of Japan in the bitcoin markets, where the technology is now regulated. The Japanese yen is the single largest currency being exchanged for bitcoin, accounting for more than 45% of the money flow into bitcoin at the time of report, according to CryptoCompare data.  The US dollar came in a relatively distant second, making up approximately 30% of the money flowing into bitcoin, according to additional CryptoCompare figures.  This increase in the use of the Japanese yen comes after Japan moved to formally recognize bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting 1st April. The country's lawmakers enacted legislation that both classified the cryptocurrency as a type of prepaid payment instrument and also caused it to fall under anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules.  Scaling dilemma fades  Bitcoin prices have even been rising sharply in spite of the cryptocurrency's ongoing scaling dilemma, an ongoing issue with its transaction capacity that members of the bitcoin community have been trying to resolve.  Developers could address this problem by increasing block size, increasing the number of transactions that can fit into an individual block through Segregated Witness, or both. Thus far, the bitcoin network has failed to rally the support needed to bring about any such changes.  Still, bitcoin markets seem unhindered by the scaling dilemma, and Hayes spoke to this development:  ""It appears the scaling issue is forgotten. The positive momentum and publicity continues to attract new capital into bitcoin.""

42379490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888AH,1495301699,Anonymous Login? Civic Goes Live With Blockchain Authentication Service,"To log on to a website today, users must remember usernames and passwords: complex strings of ever-changing numbers and numerals.  But determining why this process is necessary is a bit tricky. After all, all most websites want to do is verify that there is a real person behind the keyboard, and sometimes that that person is who they say they are.  Announced today at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York, blockchain identity startup Civic is unveiling a new service that aims to rethink how trust relationships are established between consumers and websites.  Styled as a decentralized counterpart to existing identity products like Facebook Connect, the difference is that Civic will enable users to prove their uniqueness – without sharing that information with a website.  In the eyes of Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft, these next-generation relationships will be less formal and onerous than those that dominate our online experience today.  In a demo at CoinDesk's New York offices, Lingham explained how a user wanting to visit the Palo Alto city website, may want to prove that they live in the city, but share no more personal information as part of that experience.  Toward this goal, Civic will offer three levels of access: anonymous or private, where no information is shared, then two levels with which users can selectively make certain data available.  Lingham explained:  ""The website doesn't want to know who you are. They just want a unique identifier. But later on, if you've been using the app, they could send a request so they can get more information. This is good for apps that want to sign users up.""  Civic works by leveraging blockchain-linked private keys, which are stored on consumers' mobile devices. Its technology then provides an attestation service that would serve as a layer between someone seeking to establish certain information about a person and that end user.  Instead of information being exchanged, a website that wanted to know if someone was 18-years-old, could verify that this was true against hashes on a blockchain, in this case bitcoin, that are verified by Civic's technology.  ""Instead of us being in the middle of the transaction and knowing what's happening, we replace us with the blockchain. The site checks the blockchain and we don't know that the transaction happened,"" he said, adding:  ""Our focus is on data privacy, we allow people to have peer-to-peer connections with websites.""  The launch follows Civic's first fundraising effort in 2016, then as a startup aiming to tackle identity theft. Users of that service will have to again enroll as part of the new service launched today.  Developers and consumers  In this way, Lingham likened Civic's first product as an ""appetizer"", one that would enable it to sign up thousands of users to learn how to verify identities using blockchain-based systems and cryptographic keys.  Now, the firm's going a step further – opening up its ecosystem to developers and consumers as part of a closed beta. Any website can now integrate Civic as its API docs are live.  From here, Lingham hopes that ""crypto enthusiasts"" will become early adopters, telling their friends about the service and how it enables people to visit various websites without providing their personal information. Businesses, in turn, will pay for the verification in line with increasing demand, he said.  Still, Lingham hinted at a larger vision with value propositions for other parties that could turn the service into his latest startup success following the sale of Gyft to First Data.  He concluded:  ""A bank has got 20 million customers. Can we get their customer IDs to be used on other websites? And give them a piece of the action?""

42379488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8886V,1495296456,Bitcoin Miner Canaan Acquires Blockchain Notary Service,"Bitcoin mining hardware firm Canaan has acquired document timestamping service Proof of Existence.  Founded in 2013 by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano, the service lets users verify the existence of documents by linking them to transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.  As part of the deal, Araoz will join Canaan as an advisor, working on new product initiatives at the startup. Canaan said it plans to keep Proof of Existence operating, with Araoz providing input on potential changes and improvements in the months ahead.  Other details of the deal were not immediately disclosed.  ""I'm really happy to close this deal with Canaan. First and foremost because they understand blockchain technology,"" Araoz said in a statement. ""They've been around for years, and they expend hard dollars to build the chips that secure the blockchain. I'm looking forward to enhancing the product, and exploring other blockchain services.”  The announcement closely follows word that Canaan raised $43m in financing to support its push into the artificial intelligence space, among other initiatives.  In statements, Canaan indicated that the Proof of Existence acquisition forms part of a broader strategy to expand into other areas beyond mining hardware, including the AI push.  ""We make the hardware that secures the blockchain; and now with the acquisition of Proof-of-Existence, we will also build services on top of the tamper proof features of the blockchain,"" Xiangfu Liu, Canaan’s co-founder, said.

42379498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888KL,1495287607,"'Spiritual Experience': Hot, Wild Ethereal Summit Is Sign of the Times","Sweltering, crowded, and filled to capacity.  If there were a sign that blockchain may be overhyped, or that the industry is in the midst of a massive bubble, the Ethereal Summit may well have been it.  As if an effort to seize the moment, the one-day event, hosted by ethereum startup and incubator ConsenSys, squeezed 32 panels and presentations into a grueling 10-hour day. The talks, held in two buildings across the street from one another in Brooklyn, continued back to back, without the usual mid-morning and mid-afternoon coffee and networking breaks one might expect from such events.  If you stepped away, you were sure to miss something, or worse, return to find your seat taken.  Oversold?  By late morning, people wanting to enter the main hall were repeatedly told, ""We are over capacity,"" and directed to go across the street to the ""green building"".  Meanwhile, outside temperatures hovered around 90 degrees, and an overflow of people lingered in the lobby area, where there was no air conditioning, or went to find cooler seating across the street.  According to one source, the event, which featured 50 speakers in mostly panel discussions, was put together in a mere five months. Six hundred people registered online, paying $600 for a ticket, while many more showed up the morning of to registered at the door.  Attendees were drawn for various reasons. Many came to learn more about ""this blockchain stuff,"" some sent by their employers. Some were launching their own blockchain companies, while others were speculators, hoping to get in early on a hot technology or an initial coin offering (ICO).  One person referred to the event, as a ""spiritual experience.""  The talks themselves covered topics that ran the gamut from health, government, energy, real estate, trade and art, with the overarching theme being that blockchain has become the hope, the savior and the salvation for all things.  At times, things got emotional.  On a panel about the supply chain, Brian Iselin, president of Slavefreetrade.org took off his pants to make a point about how blockchain could potentially remove slave labor from the supply chain.  ""I'm tired of people suffering and dying for the things that we buy,"" he said, standing on stage in his boxer shorts.  Elsewhere, on a panel about the token economy, Jalak Jobanputra, founding partner at Future Perfect Ventures, spoke of how cryptographic, blockchain-based tokens would the open doors for people all over the world to support companies they personally believed in.  ""We are going to see better companies. We are going to see a better world emerge,"" she said.  On the same panel, Brock Pierce, co-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, dressed in sparkling red pants and wearing one gold and one silver tennis shoe, encouraged people to consider investment opportunities.  He said:  ""Every asset is eventually going to end up here. The thing to think about as investors is market timing. A lot of ideas might be right, the question is, where are they in the cycle?""  Pragmatism  Meanwhile, some took a more conservative approach to the market.  Brad Burnham, co-founder and partner at VC firm Union Square Ventures, recalled living through the ""Netscape era,"" a reference to the IPO that infamously kicked off the dot-com boom two decades ago. He referred to the period as a time when there was ""an enormous amount of enthusiasm and no infrastructure.""  He pointed out that during the pre-Broadband period, smart investments were made in companies that laid the tracks for the early internet. And similarly, right now, he stressed, the focus should be on infrastructure first – particularly, wallets.  He told the crowd:  ""Until we get wallets in more people's hands, we are not in a position to really build applications and get them properly distributed.""  At the end of the day, Joseph Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys and co-founder of ethereum, took the stage and delivered his 30-minute closing talk, bringing to conclusion the speaking part of the event.  After that, those who were left (and there were many) went across the street to the 'Green room'. Wine and beer flowed, appetizers were served — and the real party began.
