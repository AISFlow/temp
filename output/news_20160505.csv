42426834,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAZh,1462484993,Australian Government Outlines Three Solutions to Double Bitcoin Tax,"In March, the Australian government released a multi-faceted policy statement on financial technology that included items on both digital currencies as well as broader blockchain applications.  Included in the policy statement was a declaration from the Australian Treasury that it would seek avenues to reduce the goods and service tax (GST) effectively applied twice to bitcoin users in the country, both when they purchase digital currency from a seller – an event that triggers GST – and again if they go on to use it to make a purchase.  Earlier this week, the government released a discussion paper that outlines possible fixes to the situation. Produced by the Treasury, it draws insights from a report prepared by the Australian Senate.  One option, according to the government, is to make digital currencies an ""input taxed financial supply"" – similar to to how the trading of shares and loans is taxed.  The report states:  ""Making the supply of digital currencies an input taxed financial supply would mean that no GST is required to be collected and remitted on their supply, eliminating the ‘double taxation’ of consumers. Digital currency suppliers (such as a digital currency trader) and financial institutions would likely not be entitled to full input tax credits for acquisitions related to these supplies.""  A deeper change would involve treating digital currencies in the same category as money – a move suggested by the Australian Senate last year.  ""Making digital currency equivalent to ‘money’ for GST purposes would mean that the payment of digital currency in exchange for goods or services would generally no longer constitute a ‘supply’ for GST purposes,"" the report explains. ""As such, no GST would be required to be charged or remitted on the digital currency provided, although GST may still apply to the supply of the goods and services that the digital currency is exchanged for.""  Lastly, the government said that it might simply deem digital currencies as completely exempt from GST – though this option, the paper states, would grant ""preferential treatment"" that could ""distort markets in other ways"".  At this stage, it’s too early to say which avenue is most preferred – though the Senate’s support for the second option could swing favor in that direction. However, the move is likely to be welcome for Australian digital currency advocates, who have been calling for such changes to be implemented.  The Treasury is seeking public feedback on the suggested proposals, with the comment period set to end on 3rd June.

42426838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAfh,1462480842,Winklevoss Brothers Own 'Material' Amount of Ether,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have revealed that they have personally invested in ether, the digital asset that powers the Ethereum blockchain.  The announcement follows on the heels of news the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said it will allow the brothers to add an Ethereum trading product to their digital currency exchange, Gemini.  In interview, Tyler Winklevoss said he wanted to make clear their investment as part of the disclosure surrounding next week's launch.  Winklevoss told CoinDesk:  ""We are invested. We own ether.""  Winklevoss said he and his brother began acquiring ether earlier this year. Though they aren't currently sharing the exact amount they’ve purchased, Winklevoss said it was a ""material"" number.  The brothers entrance into the Ethereum market is notable as in April 2013 it was widely reported that they owned 1% of all bitcoins in circulation. The number was the estimated to be 108,000 BTC, which at today’s value would be worth about $48.6m.  Early exploration  The digital currency first came to the brothers' attention last year as it rose in popularity among members of the digital currency community. Then, customers of the Gemini exchange began to ask for the asset to be added as an option, Winklevoss said.  During their exploration of Ethereum as an asset class, the brothers were attracted to what Tyler described as its distinguishing attributes. Namely, that it includes a Turing-complete computer language and that it can be used as fuel for performing different smart contract-related tasks.  Though Tyler Winklevoss said he and his brother still believe in the value of bitcoin as an asset class in its own right, these distinctions inspired them to make their own investment and open up the exchange to help others do the same.  ""We looked at the people in both communities and the people putting time into it,"" said Tyler Winklevoss, adding:  ""We see them as taking different paths, not cannibalizing each other.""  Market shake-up  But, there's more at play here than just the addition of a new investment tool.  At press time, Gemini is currently trading about 811 BTC per day (roughly $360k), a figure that's below other regulated US competitors itBit and CoinBase, which are trading about 3,000 BTC and 5,000 BTC, respectively.  Still, Tyler Winklevoss told CoinDesk the company’s trading volumes are in alignment with their expected growth and distinguished his company from some competitors.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We're not comparing ourselves to exchanges that have been out there longer than we are and we’re not comparing ourselves to people who are doing business in other countries or are unregulated.""  Ether trading is scheduled to begin on Gemini at 9:30am EST on Monday.

42426836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAbh,1462476610,Consensus Blockchain Standards Panel: Industry Should Take Action,"The last day of CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 featured a deep dive on enterprise standards for blockchain applications, a topic that drew a capacity crowd to the Wednesday event.  Featuring author William Mougayar; Barclays blockchain and distributed ledger lead Simon Taylor; and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, the session featured an open-ended question-and-answer session that ultimately morphed into a back-and-forth conversation on the nature of standards.  Early on, Buterin drew a distinction between the standardization drive of business executives and managers – and the potential standards needs of developers actually working on technology applications.  He told attendees:  ""Standardization is one of those things that people, and business people especially, like to talk about. It's a bit removed from the standardization needs of developers. I sometimes think, 'Okay, where do we even start? How do you even know what kind of standardization are people looking for?'""  The subsequent question-and-answer (Q&A) session raised concerns about interoperability, competition, the process of tailoring standards to specific industries and what exact components should go into any kind of proposed standard.  One common topic that emerged was the desire on the part of participants to avoid ""reinventing the wheel"", or moving to develop standards that may mirror or reflect existing standards already in place for other technologies.  Equally as vital, those who attended the workshop say, is the need to avoid putting in place any kind of standard that would create burdens for developers and startups that could dampen that work. This point was raised both during the question-and-answer session as well as later breakout group presentations.  ""We need to give the technology time to evolve, and give developers time to create their products,"" said one participant.  Other areas of interest included developing standards regarding the relationship between open and closed blockchain networks, programming languages, privacy and applying standards to specific elements such as smart oracles.  Ultimately, the panel concluded with the sense that more discussions and debate are needed. Although, according to a number of participants, any long-term solutions for blockchain standards are better off emerging from the industry itself.

42426835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAXh,1462470421,Winklevoss Bitcoin Exchange Gemini to Launch Ether Trading,"Gemini, the bitcoin currency exchange operated by investors Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss, has received approval from the state of New York to offer trading for ether, the native token of the Ethereum network.  The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced the approval today, a move the department said was necessary given that the agency has the mandate to review any material changes to the services offered by industry firms.  The exchange, approved to open last October, had received the greenlight to operate as a limited purpose trust company from the NYDFS, though it is not regulated under the BitLicense, the state's industry-specific licensing regime.  Yet the exchange has struggled to capture the attention of bitcoin traders since then. According to figures from Coinmarketcap, Gemini saw 811 BTC (or roughly $360k) in trading over the past 24 hours. Such figures are below competitors such as Bitfinex and Coinbase, which traded 8,686 BTC and 5,331 BTC, respectively, over the last day.  In a statement released by the NYDFS, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the move is in line with the state’s efforts to support ""new innovations and emerging industries"", remarking:  ""With robust regulatory oversight, we are maintaining our status at the forefront of this technological revolution and ensuring that users have a safe and secure experience.""  The forthcoming launch of ether trading, scheduled for Monday, the NYDFS said, represents its first approval for a digital currency-related service beyond bitcoin.  However, the NYDFS told CoinDesk that such activity was already ""permissible"" with their existing charter.

42426853,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxB5h,1462468701,Global Expansion is Next Act for Bitcoin Cash App Abra,"Bill Barhydt talks fast, often in big, sweeping terms that pass with the frequency of mile markers.  ""We are basically preparing Abra to go global as quickly as possible,"" he says in interview.  On the phone with CoinDesk, Barhydt even sounds as if he’s flying through space and time, the wind rushing around him audibly as we kick off a conversation about Abra, the peer-to-peer ""digital cash"" startup for which he has served as CEO since 2014.  While Barhydt exudes velocity, the language he employs seem a far cry from his startups muted public presence.  While the company has raised $14m in two funding rounds, its blog has been updated just a few times since last September, and announcements have been few and far between. Today, Abra is live in only one market. To Barhydt, this is the calm before the storm.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You will see Abra live in lots of places this year, with some really cool partner announcements and availability announcements. The organized chaos of Abra is moving at a very rapid rate.""  Barhydt is just as quick in describing the process of Abra’s forthcoming expansion, even with all its complexities. Somehow he reduces balancing acts like signing up global merchants to bootstrap a global cash app, enlisting money services businesses in this network and navigating local regulations into a fairly short series of sentences.  All of this comes even while he refers to Abra as a company that could create the first ""viable consumer experience"" with blockchain technology – one that, at scale, aims to provide users around the world with abilities never before offered by payments firms.  Last-mile concerns? Liquidity management? Barhydt believes Abra can put these challenges in the rearview.  Materials provided to CoinDesk back up this ambitious scope, indicating that Abra told investors it plans to launch in Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and throughout the Americas, a total of more than 20 countries, by November 2017.  But if this all seems a little fast, Barhydt believes it’s anything but. He stresses that Abra is already the product of two years of work.  ""The Philippines is a domestic microcosm of what you should expect to see at a much larger scale. It gives us the ability to test on a small scale with no marketing,"" Barhydt said, adding:  ""That’s going to change fairly soon.""  Single market focus  But what's going on with Abra in the Philippines? That seems hard to say. Abra’s Google Play app has 70 or so reviews, and while it has a four-star overall rating, some of the higher ones are from users on the waitlist for the app.  The more negative ones point out an issue Barhydt seems eager to address, the current inability for users to send value abroad. But, he says, the app works the same in the Philippines as it will at scale, and that the experience has been valuable for the young company.  ""Our goal has been to leverage tests to make sure that everything is able to scale well once it’s working in dozens of countries,"" Barhydt said. He expects the Philippines to become a “major corridor” for Abra, the term evoking a remittance company, though Abra prefers to refer to itself as a peer-to-peer network.  Today, Barhydt said, the Abra network allows users to cash out digital currency to any bank account in the country, while four banks enable buying. The Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Metrobank and UnionBank of the Philippines are three that allow Abra users to convert fiat funds to digital cash.  As for whether Abra has direct relationships with these banks, Barhydt suggested that engagement with financial institutions might not be a core part of his strategy.  ""The relationship is simple, we’re using third-party partners to act as payment gateways and we make that process as transparent as possible,"" he said. ""Abra itself does not have to enter into formal relationships.""  Building a network  But, banks are just one piece of the puzzle. Merchants, Barhydt acknowledges, are as “key” to the company’s future as they are to modern-day cash networks.  ""We believe that Abra’s ability to do cross-border commerce, person-to-person or person-to-merchant, is a big competitive advantage,"" he said.  In this respect, Barhydt asserts, Abra is also seeking to make both its merchant and consumer wallet applications operate similarly. During a transaction, merchants and consumers can receive funds in any currency using Abra's smart contract technology.  Acquiring merchants could prove challenging, though, given that they are historically picky about their preference of technologies. The chip-card technology EMV, for example, took years to reach widespread adoption in the US, and still sees complaints from merchants and consumers who have had their decades-long point-of-sale experiences disrupted.  But Barhydt sees the biggest potential impact for Abra in online commerce, where he says users will be able to type their phone number into a web page, receive a push notification, and then send the funds to the merchant’s address through the bitcoin blockchain. This, he says, will be beneficial for high-risk transactions.  How all this works is complex, though. For instance, Abra needs consumers and merchants to buy and hold digital currency, and for tellers to see a market in providing this service to these two parties as a business opportunity.  Master tellers, in turn, need to join the network to provide compliance and oversight to tellers, and to interact with exchanges to turn funds into fiat money. Exchanges would then hold bank accounts on behalf of the tellers, merchants and master tellers.  For all the intricacies, the front-end user experience aims for a minimalistic simplicity.  ""From a merchant’s perspective, these are cash transactions that settle in near-real time in local currency, that have no chargeback risk and no foreign exchange risk,” he continued.  Experience first  As with fellow payments industry startup Circle, user experience is key, as Barhydt believes consumers are unlikely to adopt a new technology like digital currency outright, instead preferring to keep funds in government-backed money.  ""We understand why it’s cool, but we think that’s the wrong perspective,"" he said.  It’s this part of the company’s strategy that many observers in the space have questioned its ability to execute. Yet Barhydt asserts that the company has figured out the solution.  “Think of the currency a consumer or merchant is holding with Abra as a synthetic fiat currency that is effectively a hedged digital currency. It’s hedged bitcoin, but that’s extremely difficult to do correctly. From my knowledge, we’re the first to figure it out,” he said.  Documents reveal Abra’s system works by borrowing bitcoin from mining pools, which is then sold on an exchange, creating a short position that it says provides liquidity for Abra. Covering the short, the company says, doesn’t generate liquidity risk, as Abra tellers will eventually need to sell bitcoin.  The company has indicated that US dollar shorts could even become one of the ways that, long term, help make the company profitable.  User strategy  How much of this process is being disclosed to users is unclear, though Barhydt indicates that users don’t need to understand how their value is managed, just as they don't need to understand how text messages are routed around the globe.  ""Once Abra is live everywhere, we have the first p2p payment app that will work across any two phone numbers. There’s no other app on the planet that does that. It’s WhatsApp for payments,"" he said.  From there, Barhydt said, Abra has an opportunity few of its competitors do: the possibility that its product could go viral. But, how long this will take is a matter that only time will tell.  It's fitting then the conversation with Barhydt seems to hit a pause. The wind sounds are suddenly gone and it’s silent around him. It appears for now, Barhydt has reached at least one destination.  As for when he will be able to say the same for Abra, that’s less certain.  “I don’t know if the hockey stick will happen, but we have a high chance it could happen,” he said, adding:  ""We’re chomping at the bit.""

42426850,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAxh,1462462120,BNP Paribas Works With Blockchain Startup to Open Source Law,"The complex and fragmented legal arena could use some standardization, at least according to 35-year veteran lawyer, Jim Hazard, the founder of blockchain smart contracts startup, CommonAccord.  CommonAccord, which was recently selected by BNP Paribas' new FinTech accelerator, L’Atelier, is developing global text codes for transferring legal documents via distributed ledgers.  The idea first came about in the 1990s when Hazard was trying to automate legal processes using Microsoft Word during the development of Linux, one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software development. By engaging the whole development community to build upon each other’s work instead of hiring a small team of developers, Linux was built more quickly and more efficiently than other technology stacks.  The legal industry could benefit from the same type of industry collaboration on standardizing legal text, Hazard believes, which is why CommonAccord’s code is completely open.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Through open source, we could get the same efficiency as software developers were getting.""  Hazard argues this is now possible due in part to the momentum for open source collaboration that was pushed forward by the inception of bitcoin.  ""The critical thing that has happened, that bitcoin moved along, is the open sourcing of transacting,"" he said.  Multi-protocol approach  But CommonAccord’s work isn’t relegated to one protocol, and instead is being designed as a generative element for recordkeeping, leaving the protocol choice open.  CommonAccord has gained significant support and help from Primavera de Filippi, a research fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society and co-founder of COALA, an open group researching how distributed ledger technologies can reduce legal uncertainty.  In 2014, after Hazard participated in an MIT legal hackathon, de Filippi noticed a connection between codified legal text and smart contracts.  A smart contract in itself is not a legally binding contract in that lawyers and other entities do not see these digital functions as binding. But by wrapping the smart contract code in well-defined legal text, the industry might accept these new solutions.  By designing a standardized text for legal work, documents could be transacted on a peer-to-peer basis without concern over legal repercussions since the short and sweet text attached to the smart contract could be opened into the full legal document.  BNP support  Now CommonAccord is getting help from one of the largest banks in the world through its accelerator program of which the company was one of eight startups selected. The advantage to working with BNP, says Hazard, is insight into the activities of the bank and in what areas it has pain points.  ""[The bank] sees operational efficiencies in managing legal text like code ... and they support the vision of codifying legal documents for the benefit of the public good,” says Hazard.  But BNP is also interested in how the system can be reiterated to work for other verticals, such as wealth management and insurance, he adds. And these other use cases might be more intriguing to BNP, which set up the accelerator to develop prototypes for the bank.  For instance, Hazard continues, if a startup used a data model like CommonAccord’s it would be easier for the investor – BNP’s client – to know what was going on financially within the startup. In this scenario, the bank could offer the data model as a wealth management feature to investor clients.  According to Marylène Groult, program and content manager at L’Atelier, the bank is still deliberating on where a proof-of-concept with CommonAccord can take place.  ""We’ll try to do a proof-of-concept with one of those business lines, but it will be difficult to work on something right away because...people didn’t know at the beginning of the year they'd have to work on CommonAccord’s project,"" Groult said. ""So the insurance and private banking [business lines] lack the resources to do something.""  The other startups selected for the program were chosen based on pairings with specific business lines at the bank, while L’Atelier choose CommonAccord without a use case in mind.  But, Groult has no doubt the smart contracts application for legal documents could create greater efficiency within the bank.  ""I know that the way [BNP is] managing legal contracts will have to be changed soon because they can’t manage so many documents on so many different systems; the system now is too complex,” she said. “That’s why we’re interested, as a prospective solution.”  Development roadmap  CommonAccord has a long way to go until reaching this goal, as the startup is just now working towards the first vision of open source law.  It's shorter-term and more accessible goal is to get a few companies using the text internally or in small consortia as a document assembly and management system.  Broader standardization is on the horizon with encouragement from the investor space. For instance, Y-Combinator set up a sample document with CommonAccord because the accelerator is interested in standardizing the legal documents startups send in for its review.  Standardizing these documents would make it easier for Y-Combinator to inspect plus the open source document could be inspected by a community of people.  Opportunities abound in other industries as well. Hazard says, standardized text for transacting could also be applied to medical and business records and online merchant receipts and records.

42426842,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAlh,1462454553,Craig Wright Won't Provide More Proof He Created Bitcoin,"In a stunning reversal, Craig Wright – the Australian academic who on Monday sparked a media frenzy with his efforts to prove that he is the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto – now says he will not provide any more proof as previously indicated.  Two days ago, Wright said that he planned to prove his identity by demonstrating control of bitcoins mined early in the digital currency’s lifecycle – a move that would have specifically meant moving BTC in and out of an early address ostensibly under his control, according to a representative.  The controversy began on Monday when the BBC, The Economist and GQ published interviews with Wright, who sought to back his claim to the Satoshi identity. Once the news first emerged, critics quickly cried foul, with some alleging that Wright was perpetrating fraud following further analysis of the evidence made public thus far.  Now, Wright has said that he will provide no further evidence, indicating that his decision was driven by ""new allegations"" against him.  In the new blog post, Wright wrote:  ""I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.""  He went on to write that he fears the move will cause ""damage"" to those who helped him engage with the press, naming Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis and former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen specifically, each of whom penned blog posts in support of Wright.  ""I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now,"" Wright went on to say. ""I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.""  The two other blog posts – including a more recent one that pointed to the plan to move early bitcoins – have been removed.
