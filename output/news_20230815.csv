16089329,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547375,1692140452,Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020?,"Bitcoin price has mostly maintained the $29,000 level for the better part of the week. This points to low activity and momentum in the market, as well as a reluctance to engage in the digital asset at this point. One reason for this reluctance is the expectation that the Bitcoin price will see another crash before the bull market resumes. However, this crypto analyst explains why expectations may be dashed this time around. Bitcoin Price May Not See A Repeat Of 2019-2020 Before the 2020-2021 bull market kicked in, the Bitcoin price had seen a rollercoaster year. Mostly, the bear market had ravaged the digital asset causing it to fall more than 80% below its all-time high price at the time, and the crashes would continue well into 2020. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Given the tendency of the Bitcoin price to follow previous trends, investors are understandably expecting a repeat of this trend. But pseudonymous crypto analyst “Tony The Bull” took to X (formerly Twitter) to use the ‘recency bias’ to explain why this may not happen. In the post, the crypto analyst used an analogy of a town that had not had a flood before, suddenly experiencing a flash storm rainstorm. Given that it had not happened before, businesses were caught unaware without flood insurance. However, going forward, the businesses begin to expect another flood and as such, they get flood insurance. The analyst explained that even though measures would be put in place to decrease the chances of such as flood happening again, people continued to operate with the knowledge of the impact of the flood. “It is the brain’s way to going with the most easily accessible information, which is the one that has most recently impacted you in a significant way,” the analyst said. “This is what’s called recency bias.” BTC movement over the last five years | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com This recency bias, when applied to Bitcoin, shows investors are expecting a repeat of 2019-2020 because it is the most recent bear market. Hence, investors are operating with the knowledge of the most recent impactful event. “But much like the flood never happened before, we had a once in a lifetime pandemic. The probability is rather low we’ll see the same price action as 2019 and 2020,” Tony The Bull explains. BTC Price Sticking To Previous Trends? The analyst’s position is backed up by the fact that the Bitcoin price has continuously deviated from historical trends during this cycle. One example is that while the digital asset’s price did fall to around 70% below its $69,000 all-time high, it recovered to almost 50% below its ATH. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? However, a similar trend was recorded in 2019 when BTC’s price recovered above $11,000 toward the middle of the year. But by the end of the year, had lost about half of those gains. With the rest of the gains being wiped out in early 2020. If BTC does end up following the previously established trend though, then the digital asset’s price could fall as low as $12,000 before the next bull run begins. However, it is now a waiting game to see what ends up happening.

16086113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547414,1692133255,THORSwap (THOR) 300% Surge In A Week: What’s The Secret Behind Its Thunderous Rise?,"In recent weeks, the native token of THORSwap, THOR, has experienced a surge, with its value increasing by nearly 300%. This surge has attracted attention within the crypto community, prompting an exploration of the factors contributing to THOR’s rapid growth. THORSwap, a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator built on the THORChain network, has been pivotal in driving this surge. THORSwap Emerges As A Leading DEX? According to a report by crypto analytics Messari, THORSwap stands out among other automated market maker (AMM) protocols by offering a range of distinctive features. As a DEX aggregator, it leverages the underlying THORChain network to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for bridging or wrapped assets. The report claims that THORSwap’s cross-chain DEX aggregation feature sets it apart by tapping into multiple liquidity sources and supporting a wide range of digital assets. Related Reading: This Event Causes Bitcoin Traders’ Sentiment To Rise, Will BTC Surpass $30,000? By integrating with 1inch and assessing liquidity from over 50 sources on Ethereum, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain, THORSwap becomes an “unparalleled aggregator of aggregators,” offering users an extensive selection of native assets to swap, according to Messari. Moreover, the THOR token functions as the native utility token for THORSwap, offering traders numerous incentives. THOR holders can benefit from yields, revenue fee sharing, and trading discounts. Moreover, THORSwap adopts continuous liquidity pools (CLPs), an innovation pioneered by protocols like Bancor. According to the report, CLPs create trustless pools of liquidity that eliminate the need for matching buyers and sellers, promoting a “well-functioning” decentralized market with limited volatility and price manipulation. Additionally, THORSwap offers Impermanent Loss Protection (IPL) to safeguard liquidity providers from potential losses, ensuring they are better off providing liquidity than holding the underlying assets. THORChain recently introduced Synthetic Assets (“Synths”) to address the challenges of interacting with multiple blockchains. These fully collateralized representations of assets, backed by THORChain’s liquidity pools, enable cost-effective and instant settlement without the risk of impermanent loss or liquidation. The introduction of Synths has increased demand for THOR tokens while simultaneously boosting the network’s Total Locked Value (TVL). THORChain’s Performance Reflects Growing Interest? THORChain has reached significant milestones, solidifying its position in the industry. The report noted that the Total Value Locked metric stands impressively at $218.80 million, showcasing the trust and confidence users place in THORSwap and THORChain’s cross-chain liquidity provision capabilities. Furthermore, the Total Volume of $11.60 billion represents the cumulative value of trades executed on the THORSwap platform. This figure reflects the increasing trading activity and demand for cross-chain swaps facilitated by THORChain’s protocol. These statistics highlight the influence and adoption of THORChain within the DeFi space. As the demand for cross-chain liquidity continues to surge, THORChain’s protocol and THORSwap’s user-friendly interface can potentially position them as industry leaders. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens As the THORChain ecosystem continues to evolve and demonstrate its value, the growth of the THOR token highlights the platform’s increasing adoption and recognition in the market. Investors and crypto enthusiasts seem to recognize THORChain as a critical player in the DeFi space, leveraging its protocol to harness the benefits of cross-chain liquidity provision. As of the current market data, THOR is trading at $0.339695. Although it has experienced an 11.6% decrease in the past 24 hours, it has maintained substantial gains over the past seven and fourteen days, with impressive increases of 307% and 330%, respectively.

42392681,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgALrb,1692133200,Crypto Mining Gets Its Own Lobbying Voice in Washington,"Crypto miners are establishing a new voice in U.S. policy, starting up the Digital Energy Council to lobby for friendly policy as regulators and Congress are wrestling with the next steps in crypto regulation.  The member group will be advocating for policies “that promote responsible and sustainable energy development, grid resilience, maintain United States competitiveness, and protect national security,” it said in a Tuesday statement.  The miners are already in a difficult position with President Joe Biden’s White House, which has been calling for a punitive, 30% excise tax on mining operations for the “harms they impose on society.” Miners have also been facing steady criticism from Democratic lawmakers who say the companies threaten the environment.  “The focus on how both the digital asset mining and energy industries can collaborate and work together to bolster energy infrastructure, increase resilience and support energy sustainability and efficiency has been lost in policy conversations,” said Tom Mapes, the new organization’s founder and president, who worked on energy policy at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a wider crypto advocacy group.  Mapes, who had also served as a chief of staff in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of International Affairs, said in a statement that “it’s important that energy and digital asset mining communities, both key stakeholders in our nation’s grid, have a real voice at the federal level.”  Based in Washington, he’ll initially be the organization’s sole employee. He said a top priority is “to highlight that digital asset mining is a real-world tool that can be utilized to meet the United States energy goals.”  “The Digital Energy Council is the only group in Washington, D.C., that is uniquely focused on the intersection of mining and energy abundance,” said Zach Bradford, the CEO of one of DEC’s member companies, CleanSpark (CLSK), a firm that’s been steadily expanding during the crypto winter.  “Politics is a team sport, and the broader our coalition and the more dedicated the efforts, the better,” Bradford said in an emailed statement.

Leading the CoinDesk Market Index's (CMI) 1.3% decline were altcoins such as Ripple's (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot's (DOT), Polygon's (MATIC) and Uniswap's (UNI), each sporting losses of more than 4% over the past 24 hours.

According to recent data, institutions have been getting their hands on the cryptocurrency at a steady rate, as reflected in the digital asset fund flows report. Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly In the days following Ripple’s partial victory in the SEC lawsuit, XRP volumes and prices rose dramatically as crypto traders rushed to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of a continued bull run. However, price metrics from Coinmarketcap show that the euphoria has subsided, with XRP now down 13.39% in a monthly time frame. On-chain data has also shown whales dumping the token to take profits, increasing the selling pressure on the token. Related Reading: Here’s Why This Former SEC Lawyer Thinks A Spot Bitcoin ETF Isn’t Coming On the other hand, the tide is turning for the once embattled crypto among institutional investors as inflows into XRP digital asset funds are increasing steadily. According to the weekly report on the digital asset fund flows by CoinShares, XRP saw $0.5 million in inflows last week. Over the past 16 weeks, XRP has seen consistent inflows into crypto investment funds, making up 12% of all digital assets under management. In total, XRP’s assets under management have risen 127% since the beginning of the year, outpacing the growth of other popular altcoins like Polygon and Cardano. XRP price returns to $0.6256 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Investor Attitude Toward Crypto Funds Is Growing Crypto funds, in general, have seen a shift to positive sentiment from investors. In the first week of the month, digital asset investment products saw outflows, with investors taking profits in recent weeks. Bitcoin alone saw outflows totaling $111 million, its highest since March. XRP, however, did witness inflows of $0.5 million during this period. The latest report would see digital asset investment products receive inflows of $29 million throughout the week. Bitcoin would also return as the primary focus, seeing $27 million of inflows after three prior weeks of $144 million outflows. Related Reading: Winds Of Change: Bitcoin Miner Riot Sees Substantial Increase In BTC Holdings With the recent inflows, institutional investors are signaling their faith in XRP’s future by increasing their asset holdings. In July, many digital asset funds saw a 57% increase in their XRP Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Fineqia, for instance, saw its XRP AUM increase from $49 million to $76.8 million. The price of the token appears to have weakened in momentum in recent weeks, much like the rest of the crypto market. At the time of writing, XRP is down by 0.60% in the last 24 hours and is trading at 0.625. Even so, the mood around XRP feels decidedly more optimistic as investors expect a final decision in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit.

42392701,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAM1r,1692126411,Republican Lawmakers Demand Gensler Tell Them How Prometheum Got SEC Approval,"Republicans on the U.S. congressional committee that oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are demanding agency Chair Gary Gensler explain how Prometheum Inc. won its unique approval as a broker-dealer for crypto.  The 23 House Financial Services Committee lawmakers who signed the letter, led by Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), questioned how the previously unknown firm beat out other applicants to obtain the SEC registration as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital assets, and also what determined the timing of that conclusion.  “The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities,” the letter said. The lawmakers also sent a letter to the head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) – an industry-funded group that sets and enforces securities standards under the SEC’s watch.  The letters raise “serious questions” about whether the SEC championed Prometheum as a poster firm to represent Gensler’s position that no new laws are needed to regulate and police crypto in the U.S., just as McHenry’s committee was about to send digital assets legislation to the House floor. For its part, Prometheum’s executives have insisted that they’ve been going step-by-step through the registration process like any other firm, and co-CEO Aaron Kaplan has argued that his firm will demonstrate the right way to build a crypto platform that’s compliant with current rules.  “Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws,” the company said in a Tuesday statement in response to the lawmakers' campaign. “This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.”  The lawmakers are just the latest to call for more information or investigations into the sudden Washington presence of Prometheum – a company that hasn’t yet done any trading. Other Republican members of the Senate and House have also pursued more scrutiny on the situation, and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) – a Democrat on McHenry’s committee – has requested an investigation of the SEC.

16082927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547382,1692126039,Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens,"Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, created Bitcoin in response to the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to government-controlled money. Since then, Bitcoin has gone to spearhead the crypto industry, with many investors calling it digital gold. Now, renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has argued that Bitcoin price could reach $100,000 soon and go as high as $1 million. Bold Prediction On Bitcoin Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his bestselling book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ is known to make very bullish predictions on the price of Bitcoin. In a recent post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Kiyosaki tweeted of Bitcoin reaching 100,000 soon, calling it the “people’s gold.” However, a stock and bond market crash could see Bitcoin reach $1 million. Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors Kiyosaki also shared his predictions on gold and silver, calling them “GOD’S money.” According to the finance educator, gold and silver can reach $75,000 and $60,000 respectively if the world economy crashes. BITCOIN to $100k. Saying for years gold&silver GOD’S money. BITCOIN peoples $. Bad news IF stock & bond market crash gold&silver skyrocket. WORSE NEWS IF world economy crashes BC $1 million Gold $ 75K silver to $60k. SAVERS of FAKE US $ F’d. DEBT too high. Mom, Pop & kids in… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) August 14, 2023 He explained that if the economy collapsed, the value of government-issued currencies would drop drastically. As people lose faith in fiat money, many would turn to Bitcoin and precious metals as an alternative store of value. The increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin, would cause the price to skyrocket. Earlier this year, Kiyosaki made a similar claim regarding Bitcoin, touting a price of $500,000 for each Bitcoin by 2025. Michael Saylor, another big name in the finance sector, predicted a similar price of $1 million for BTC in the next few years. What Is The Basis For The $1 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction? Kiyosaki’s recent predictions about the US dollar, in particular, have come on the heels of the BRICS alliance, which is now gaining traction. BRICS, which is an alliance between the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has gained ground in its campaign to support the reduction of transactions in the US dollar and the promotion of trading and settlement in local currencies. As a result, many names in finance have seen this as a plan to de-dollarize trades in the BRICS countries, with reports of Saudi Arabia and possibly Mexico and Japan joining them. Reports are also that the BRICS alliance is working on creating a new currency backed by gold to settle global trades.

The rise in this metric could hint at a shift in the narratives influencing BTC’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 – Can It Happen? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,300 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency saw similar action pushing other assets in a similar direction or no direction as the sector flatlines in the short term. Bitcoin ETF Becomes Dominant Narrative In Crypto Market? In a recent market update, crypto analysis firm Blofin pointed to an uptick in market sentiment. Coupled with a rise in volatility, market participants are reacting to the potential announcement from the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) around a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Commission is set to rule on asset manager Grayscale’s petition to transform their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The decision was supposed to come out today, Blofin stated, but it could drag on until this Friday, August 18th. If the SEC postpones the decision for any reason, as it did with Ark’s petition, the market will likely keep moving sideways. In that sense, development around the ETF decision is gaining strength over macroeconomic dynamics. This change in dynamics is more evident in the derivatives sector, with options traders becoming more bullish for the coming months. Blofin noted the following on this dynamic: (…) The news above (on the Bitcoin ETF approval) has promoted the rapid rise of short-term bullish sentiment and uncertainty in the market (…). It appears that investors are waiting for good news related to the spot Bitcoin ETF. And “smart” traders are positioning accordingly. The report notes that the open interest for options contracts is skewed to the call (buy) side.

Coupled with the rise in Open Interest skewed to the call side, the chart above shows that traders are betting on a Bitcoin rally above $30,000 to $40,000.

42392692,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAMC7,1692120447,The 3 Things Coinbase Says Will Determine the Future of Crypto,"Despite fighting what must be an incredibly cost-draining battle against the top U.S. securities regulator, Coinbase (COIN) is in a period of fluttering activity. Last week, the biggest publicly traded crypto company launched a new blockchain, Base, which has seen a surprising amount of uptake largely due to a couple viral apps. And today it announced the formal founding of Stand With Crypto, an “independent nonprofit organization for advancing pro-crypto legislation.”  At a time of low crypto volumes, meaning low cash flows for a company that historically has derived almost all its revenue from trading fees, Coinbase has started talking more and more about what the future of crypto adoption will look like. First, notably, as transaction fees have slipped Coinbase has seemingly found a more sticky revenue source with a subscription model.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  CEO Brian Armstrong talked about the three pillars of adoption during the company’s recent public earnings call, including blockchain scalability; utility, meaning non-financial crypto use cases; and righting the wrongs of incomprehensible crypto regulation in the U.S. Or lack thereof, a topic it knows only too well. Considering Coinbase is one of the few companies ever to actually leap over the trust and knowledge gaps keeping people out of crypto, it’s worth tuning in.  In a sense, the first two “themes” are two different sides of the same coin. Or, at least, they are ways of addressing issues that are closely related. Armstrong seemed especially bullish on current scaling solutions, including Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and its own Ethereum scaler Base. No surprise there, especially considering the company has been signaling a Lightning integration ever since Bitcoin NFTs clogged up the chain — but it still attracted attention.  See also: Coinbase Exec: 'There's No Playbook' as Public Company to Launch a Blockchain  Blockchain scalability and utility are tech issues, and technologists can easily imagine technical solutions. It’s possible the crypto industry, in its 13 years of existence, has over-indexed that type of thinking about infrastructure — the “build it and they will come” type of jazz. But in a real way, non-financial use cases for crypto were largely out of reach for years, with blockchains being a seesaw where any time there’s a meaningful influx of users transaction fees rise and price most people out.  That could change with L2s like Arbiutrum and Optimism for Ethereum, which, as Armstrong noted, have seen meaningful adoption over the last six months. When making predictions all I can offer is counterfactuals or affirmations, but we’ll see. Build a longer or better seesaw and more people can fit without immediately spiking txn costs, and with people will come demands for message services, social media, and so on.  The last point I’ll make is that when coming up with examples for non-financial uses, Armstrong did immediately go to decidedly financial examples: “Things like stablecoins for payments, DeFi, NFTs, these have already gotten substantial traction. But I think with Layer 2 solutions coming online, these can get much, much bigger,” he said.  And later: “But if we can make the utility that much better, the payments faster and cheaper globally, more and more people will use crypto every day, and that's how indirectly it will just help our business grow. So I'll leave it there.”  Given that tech issues likely have tech rather than social solutions, crypto’s main hurdle is Armstrong’s last pillar: regulation. During the call, Armstrong made several references to the Stand With Crypto working group Coinbase has been spearheading.  Stand With Crypto, like many blockchain lobbying groups, will seek to influence the direction of U.S. laws covering and designed for crypto. This is important for two reasons. One, there are two live bills that, if passed, could transform the industry — i.e. the crypto market structure bill (officially FIT21) and the “stablecoin bill,” both passed by the House Financial Services Committee and the House Ag Committee with bi-partisan support and are heading before the Senate. And second, there’s a growing chorus of crypto advocates who think crypto’s existing lobbying network in D.C. has largely failed the industry.  Look around at the lack of crypto regs and legislation and you might agree, but then it’s not an easy job selling crypto especially after the market gouging we had. Coinbase may have better luck with an aligned lobbying group rather than funding others, or it might be entering at a more opportune time. There are certainly going to be more chances to mold crypto regs going forward than five years ago.  See also: Don't Pop the Champagne on U.S. Crypto Bills  But the world of politics is perhaps even less predictable than tech adoption, and it remains to be seen what rules the U.S. will have. There are two imperfect models ahead: crypto reforms in Canada that have started to drive out businesses, and the European Union, which recently passed the bloc-wide MiCA regulatory package that is seemingly turning Europe into a crypto hub. There’s obvious problems with the comparison, including that Canada is a much, much smaller market than the U.S., and Europeans have greater tolerance for government oversight than we do. But the point holds: Which way USA?  It’s easy to overstate Coinbase’s role in the history of crypto adoption, and it’s not always clear the company will always be as prominent given its legal issues and the lackluster demand for crypto. Then there’s the fact that as the company itself noted “on-chain is the new online” meaning crypto is moving away from centralized companies to actual blockchains. But it's still a bellwether for the future prospects of crypto.  The headwinds are a-blowing, but, if built on solid enough pillars, that bell will continue to ring.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/15/the-3-things-coinbase-says-will-determine-the-future-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d447bf888d578f472f7ce70c628c2371fa8c8a0f-1165x655.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, some subtle signs are popping up that could suggest that a bullish Bitcoin trend is beginning to take shape. Make Friends With Strong Trends “The trend is your friend” is one of the most famous trading quotes, highlighting how capturing as much of the prevailing trend as possible can lead to the most profitable results. For this reason, in technical analysis, trend-following tools are among the most successful. But what is an investor or trader to do when there is a clear absence of any discernible trend? The answer is “to wait for the trend to appear” but that’s easier said than done. This is why specific tools have been created to tell when assets like Bitcoin or even stocks are trending or not. One such tool is starting to rise after several weeks of sideways price action, and it suggest that the underlying trend is strengthening. The Average Directional Index | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bullish Bitcoin Is Building Muscle The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a trend strength measuring tool, created by the father of technical indicators, J. Welles, Wilder, Jr. Other tools Wilder built include the Parabolic SAR, Average True Range, and the Relative Strength Index. A reading above 20 on the ADX means a trend is developing. The more it turns up, the stronger the trend. After weeks of sideways, the trend is starting to strengthen again. The tool also includes two Directional Movement indicators, the DI+ and DI-. The DI+ is currently above the DI-, showing that bulls in control of the underlying price action. All that’s left is for the ADX to strengthen further and Bitcoin could finally break out of this range and begin trending. What Bitcoin bulls ultimately want to see next is for the ADX to grow even steeper, similar to what we can see in late 2020 and into early 2022. The lack of another strong trend at the second 2021 peak was a warning that something was off. Will the bullish trend continue to strengthen, or will bears regain control? #Bitcoin 1W Average Directional Index is turning back up above 20 — this is the signature of a strengthening trend DI+ is above DI- which shows bulls are in control Trend-following tools may soon prove more useful with a trend growing pic.twitter.com/9nAUEVIcL3 — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) August 14, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

In a recent tweet, Chiliz unveiled its plans to enhance the functionality of its smart contracts, showcasing the company’s ongoing commitment to providing a seamless and efficient experience for its users.

The factory contract will still need to be deployed by a whitelisted deployer.#ChilizGovernance ⚡ $CHZ pic.twitter.com/zyBTqzAhTJ — Chiliz ($CHZ) – Powering Socios.com ⚡ (@Chiliz) August 14, 2023 As the platform gears up for these improvements, the question on everyone’s mind is whether these upgrades will play a role in boosting the price of CHZ, Chiliz’s native cryptocurrency. Chiliz Upgrades On The Horizon The first of the upcoming upgrades focuses on streamlining the deployment of factory contracts. In a bid to improve efficiency, Chiliz plans to enable such contracts to be deployed without the need for whitelisting as deployers. This move is expected to simplify the process while maintaining a level of security by ensuring that the factory contract is still initiated by a whitelisted deployer. By reducing friction in the contract deployment process, Chiliz aims to enhance user experience and attract a wider range of participants. The second upgrade revolves around staking pool contract enhancements. Chiliz aims to address issues related to the accuracy of voting power displayed for validators and the calculation of delegated amounts. Chiliz is currently trading at $0.0748. Chart by TradingView.com To rectify this, the Chiliz team has indicated that a temporary downtime for the delegated and undelegated features will be necessary during the upgrade. While this may temporarily inconvenience users, the improvements are anticipated to provide a more accurate and transparent staking experience. Impact On CHZ Price As Chiliz enthusiasts eagerly await these upgrades, the impact on the price of CHZ remains a topic of interest. At the time of writing, CHZ is in the red in all timeframes, and priced at $0.074903 according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have seen a decline of 1.2% in its value, while the past seven days have witnessed a decline of 1.5%. These fluctuations underscore the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. CHZ price action today.

42392684,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgALmT,1692117000,G20 Set to Crystalize Global Crypto Rules as India Wraps Up Presidency,"Behind closed doors, global economic leaders called for global coordination on crypto regulation, rat her than have nations attempt to ban the industry.  The meeting, held under Chatham House rules, took place as India wraps up its presidency of the Group of 20 nations.  Leading economic officials pushed for greater global coordination of crypto regulations during a recent roundtable discussion held during a G20 meeting.  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva opposed the idea of an outright ban, likening crypto to water: ""You try to plug it from one side, it will find some hole and come out.""  At the same meeting, key U.S. Treasury official Jay Shambaugh said drafting global crypto rules wouldn't normalize the sector's disasters, much like how mandating seat belts didn't normalize car crashes. The roundtable, which was hosted by India as the current G20 president, was conducted under Chatham House rules and thus closed to the media.  An individual present for the discussion shared details with CoinDesk, saying the metaphors shared were public knowledge and a robust discussion about global crypto rules could benefit from learning about these viewpoints.  Both Shambaugh’s and Georgieva’s office did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The comments contributed to a sentiment that stalled one part of India’s plans – putting forward its own presidency note on crypto.  The note was intended to reflect a roadmap for crypto regulations and show an appreciation of India’s role in shaping it, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Local reports confirmed India’s intent, but other G20 members pushed back, asking for changes. They said that given India is currently the G20 president, it represents the collective voice of the G20, and thus anything it puts out should be after consultations with members.  India published the note on August 1, almost two weeks after additional discussions around its contents. The note assumes significance as it's an official document that voices India's recommendations for global coordination around crypto regulation.  Synthesis paper  In its presidency note, India announced that an anticipated ""synthesis paper,"" which will be jointly produced by the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), is expected by the end of August.  The paper will focus on the global macro implications for crypto, and is expected to include the recommendations from India's presidency note, as well as recommendations from other standard-setting bodies.  India’s push for an inclusion of concerns around macro-financial implications and risks specific to Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is likely to be accommodated and is seen as an achievement by local officials, individuals familiar with it said.  India is hoping to celebrate its efforts in pushing for a globally acceptable framework for crypto rules during the leaders’ summit in early September, and a ready synthesis paper would exemplify that effort, the individuals familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  It is even possible that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will tout the creation of global crypto rules under India’s presidency during his address at the G20 leaders' summit, the same people said, seeking anonymity as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.  FSB deadline  An FSB paper recommending a framework for crypto assets included a de-facto deadline to implement its framework for jurisdictions.  “The FSB will, by end-2025, conduct a review of the status of the implementation of these two sets of recommendations (for crypto assets and stablecoins) at the jurisdictional level,” the paper said.  Effectively, this means FSB member nations will have to bring in individual rules or legislation that implement the recommendations by end-2025.  Does this mean India will bring its first crypto bill by then? Not necessarily because India has taken steps to bring crypto under its overview and may deem that to be enough.  “India has already brought in anti-money laundering rules, a tax structure for crypto, and other plans to include Web3 are afoot in relevant ministries,” one of the people said.  Potential bans  One of the major questions in India is whether welcoming the FSB recommendations could mean it’s legitimizing crypto and thus ruling out a ban.  Ajay Seth, one of the senior officials from the Indian Finance Ministry speaking at the G20 media briefing, hinted that the broad approach of the G20 does not rule out any member country banning crypto within its own borders, saying “any jurisdiction which wants to be more stringent based on its own circumstances, should be doing so.”  At the same briefing, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said “the FSB report recognizes that individual jurisdictions have the choice to prohibit crypto if they so desire.”  The RBI is not the decision maker on whether India will bring crypto legislation, even if it’s perhaps the most important in framing financial legislation. Given Modi’s party has a comfortable majority in parliament, the decision would lie with his office and the Finance Ministry. “India could choose to maintain the status quo or bring legislation, either way we meet the FSB’s end-2025 deadline,” said one of the individuals.  “The Finance Ministry has not made its position public on whether it wants to ban crypto or not. But given its role in framing global crypto rules as G20 president, it’s unlikely it will choose the path of banning crypto, despite RBI’s strong desire for [a ban].”  During the G20 deliberations, one of RBI’s written requests from the FSB and the IMF was to include the word “ban” in forthcoming reports including the synthesis paper, one of the people said.  ""RBI wanted the phrase ‘including ban’ to follow the word regulation but the standard setting authority said ‘regulation by definition includes a range of options, including banning so why put it in,’” one of the people said. “But there is no global acceptance for a ban. A ban has not been favored in any of the G20’s crypto roundtables or seminars. In fact, the overwhelming view nations noted is that a ban would be costly and ineffective.”  The RBI did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

Particularly, this dispute underscores the intricate interplay between traditional financial frameworks and the evolving dynamics of digital assets. In a tweet posted earlier today, DeFiance Capital CEO shed new light on their ongoing legal tussle with 3AC, suggesting a turn in the tide. Statement and Update on Dispute with Three Arrows Capital Limited (3AC) We are very pleased to share a positive development on our end with the public. It is well-known that for the past year, we have been locked in a dispute with the 3AC estate who are claiming that the assets… — Arthur (@Arthur_0x) August 15, 2023 DeFiance Capital: A Year-long Struggle Almost a year ago, the disagreement between DeFiance Capital and the 3AC estate took center stage when the estate contended that the assets held by DeFiance Capital should be used to square off the debts of 3AC. Related Reading: 3AC NFTs Sale To Commence Soon Due to Liquidation Countering this claim, DeFiance maintained that they had complete authority and rightful ownership of their assets. This stance, they assert, aligns with common industry perceptions and is supported by available evidence. The debate took a geographical turn when the liquidators insisted on settling the dispute in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). DeFiance Capital, which was managed from Singapore alongside 3AC, found this choice of jurisdiction puzzling. They argued that the primary evidence and witnesses were based in Singapore, making it a more apt location for the hearing. Their persistence bore fruit last week when the High Court of Singapore agreed to their jurisdiction preference, subtly undermining the liquidators’ earlier narrative that DeFiance’s stance held no ground. The Road Ahead: Seeking Effective Resolutions Despite these disagreements, DeFiance has shown a willingness to collaborate. They have extended assistance to 3AC’s liquidators in understanding the position of DeFiance and even offered help in identifying 3AC’s assets. The intention, as expressed by the CEO & CIO of DeFiance, was to minimize the resources spent on deciding the hearing location and instead concentrate on the core issues at hand. However, the journey hasn’t been without its hitches. The liquidators faced setbacks in the US while trying to hold Three Arrows Capital Co-Founder Kyle Davies accountable in a US court. This effort was thwarted when it came to light that Davies was no longer a US citizen, an information oversight that resulted in unnecessary legal expenses. Blossom Hing, representing DeFiance, highlighted the significance of the recent jurisdiction decision. Emphasizing that the Singapore International Commercial Court could address issues pertaining to BVI law, she expressed optimism about an efficient resolution that benefits all parties. Related Reading: Crypto Hedge Fund 3 Arrows Capital (3AC) Files For Bankruptcy Hing noted: We welcome the decision by the Singapore Court as it will ensure that important evidence located in Singapore would be available for the purposes of resolving the dispute in a just and efficient manner. Coupled with the fact that the Singapore International Commercial Court can hear arguments on and decide on BVI law issues, we believe that having the dispute heard in Singapore will result in considerable savings of costs and time for all parties.

The company reduced its average cost of mining Bitcoin by ~26% YoY, and earned $13.5 million in power curtailment credits. Profitability remains a challenge for Riot Platforms, with a net loss of $(27.7) million for Q2, and reliance on secondary offering of shares to raise additional funds, leading to equity dilution. Thesis Bitcoin mining companies operate in a challenging and volatile environment, and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is no exception. Despite making some good progress by increasing its Bitcoin production by 27% and decreasing the average Bitcoin production cost, RIOT's persistent struggle to achieve profitability casts a shadow over its future outlook. The net loss incurred in Q2, combined with a negative Return on Equity and a low gross profit margin, highlights the difficulties RIOT face in generating positive returns from its investments. Additionally, RIOT's reliance on issuing common stock for financing raises concerns about equity dilution that could impact shareholder value. Given these factors and the unpredictable nature of the crypto industry, Riot Platforms' financial challenges could intensify. In this analysis, we'd look at why caution is warranted in holding this stock in your portfolio. Q2 Recap Riot Platforms' Q2 earnings report unveils significant achievements and some shortcomings. The company registered a total revenue of $76.7 million, representing a YoY growth of 5.2%, although falling short of estimates by $8.76 million. RIOT surpassed expectations in its GAAP EPS, reporting -$0.17 which beat estimates by $0.03. RIOT's Q2 achievements include a reduction in the average price of mining bitcoin and earning $13.5 million in power curtailment credits. RIOT's main challenge remains profitability. The company reported $408.4 million in working capital, including $289.2 million in cash on hand and $221.4 million in unencumbered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) (BTC holdings that are not used as collateral for loans or other financial obligations, making them free from encumbrances). Increased Mining Capacity and Efficiency Earnings reports of Bitcoin mining companies for Q2 have shown that since the start of this fiscal year, mining companies have incurred significant operational expenses in procuring hardware to increase their mining capacity and operational efficiency. It is no different in the case of RIOT. The company plans to reach a 12.5 EH/s self-mining hash rate capacity by Q4 and has been making significant investments in this regard. Despite challenges posed by a severe winter storm in December 2022, affecting Buildings F and G at its mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, putting out 17,040 mining rigs early this year, Riot Platforms weathered the storm, mining 1,775 Bitcoin in Q2 as compared to 1,395 Bitcoin in Q2 last year, a 27.22 YoY increase. The company reduced the mining cost per Bitcoin by ~26% YoY, averaging $8,389 per Bitcoin produced, in contrast to $11,316 per Bitcoin mined in Q2 2022; this is an indication of operational efficiency. Profitability Is Not In Sight Riot Platforms' financial report reveals a net loss of $27.7 million for Q2, which is a significant figure that contrasts with the company's revenue and operational growth. This net loss includes various non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $66.2 million, and non-cash charges of $5.6 million related to the adjustment in the value of its held BTC assets. These non-cash charges severely impacted Riot Platform's bottom line, presenting a challenge to achieving profitability. RIOT's reported cash from operations and cash from investing were both negative. While negative cash flow from investing can be overlooked in the short term because of the company's recent investments to increase its mining capacity and operating efficiency, negative cash flow from operations (which means its primary business activity - Bitcoin mining - has not been profitable) poses another legitimate concern about Riot Platforms' profitability. RIOT Profitability Factor Grades (Seeking Alpha) RIOT scores poor factor grades for profitability. RIOT's gross profit margin of 16.40% is significantly lower than the sector median of 47.89%. Despite the injection of funds through the issuance and sale of secondary shares, Riot Platforms' Return on Common Equity ( TTM ) exhibits a concerning trend. The reported negative RoE of -48.54% starkly contrasts with the sector median of 0.03%. This underscores the company's struggles in converting equity capital into positive returns. As I pointed out in my other analysis of a peer company (Marathon Digital) that just reported Q2 earnings, profitability could be a major problem for Bitcoin mining companies in the coming months as the Bitcoin halving event approaches (est. April 2024). The halving event can lead to mining difficulty, prompting procurement of more powerful hardware, which in turn leads to higher energy costs and other OpEx. Stock and Equity Dilution On its cash flow statement, Riot Platforms recorded a total cash from financing of $173 million for Q2. This injection of capital from external sources is advantageous as it provides the company with additional financial flexibility. However, a closer look at the cash flow statement shows that 100% of Riot Platform's cash flow from financing came from the issuance of its common stock. In the earnings call, Riot Platforms revealed that it entered an At-The-Market ( ATM ) offering in 2022, that allows the company to offer and sell up to $500 million worth of its common stock. This, in my view, has serious implications for shareholders as their ownership stake is diluted and the value of their holdings is reduced. Reliance solely on the secondary offering of shares to raise capital could prove unhealthy for RIOT's finances. Traditionally, most Bitcoin mining companies stash mined Bitcoin and do not sell them immediately, waiting for a price increase before they liquidate their holdings, to offset potential losses. Based on insights from independent research , miners held an average of 75% of their total mined Bitcoins between January 2022 and June 2023. While it might seem like a great strategy to hold on to Bitcoin holdings and sell at a higher price in the future (while generating financing through other means like secondary share offerings), in my view, this is a risky strategy because an increase in the price of Bitcoin, though likely, is not guaranteed, and is largely based on speculation. RIOT Valuation P/CF (Seeking Alpha) RIOT's current P/CF ratio of 297.25x indicates that investors are valuing the company at a very high multiple of its cash flow when compared to its sector median of 19.45x. The stock is trading at a substantial premium compared to its actual cash generation, based on several qualitative factors already highlighted in this analysis. With a P/S ratio of 9.43x, significantly higher than the sector median of 2.72x, the stock appears overvalued relative to its current revenue. Moreover, the Forward P/S ratio of 8.3x implies cautious market expectations for future revenue growth. RIOT's levered free cash flow stands at -$127.87 million. The combination of RIOT's negative levered free cash flow of -$127.87M and its high P/CF ratio of 297.25x creates a situation where the stock's valuation is significantly disconnected from its cash flow reality. Riot Platforms' high valuation multiples, when coupled with Bitcoin's inherent volatility, make things quite tricky for this stock. In my view, RIOT is overvalued. Conclusion In conclusion, Riot Platforms' Q2 performance reflects both progress and challenges. The company's increased mining capacity and operational efficiency efforts have yielded positive results, evident in higher Bitcoin production and lowered mining costs. However, the struggle to achieve profitability remains a real concern. The reliance on stock issuance for financing raises serious questions about its equity dilution and financial health. The reported working capital of $408.4 million suggests RIOT's ability to meet its short-term obligations. The dynamic between the company's working capital and cash flow highlights the intricate nature of Riot Platforms' financial health. While a strong working capital suggests an ability to cover short-term obligations, the negative cash flow indicates the need for careful consideration of the sources and uses of funds. Balancing these two aspects will be crucial for Riot Platforms as it navigates its path toward sustained profitability.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4628601-riot-platforms-increased-capacity-less-profit-more-dilution?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16077838.jpeg

The $0.0000011079 support level on the daily chart acted as a price pivot for the gains in the last few days, indicating an attempt to enter the buy zone. PEPE’s previous attempts to break above the $0.0000015440 resistance zone between July 19-24 were unsuccessful. However, the bulls are in control, driving PEPE to attempt another break above the $0.0000015440 resistance. Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors The rally in the past 7-days indicates a momentum shift for PEPE to a more positive outlook as the bulls attempt to seize control again. PEPE Bulls Forcing Another Rally, But Bears Still Active Price volatility is evident when comparing price data for PEPE on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. It trades at $0.000001348 on August 15 with a 6.03% price drop in 24 hours, while it has dropped 17% on the monthly time frame. However, PEPE shows a more positive outlook on the weekly timeframe, although traders must tread cautiously as a price drop remains a possibility due to volatility. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is 55.71 in the neutral zone reflecting traders’ indecision in the market. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the signal line, confirming the return of the bulls. However, the size of the candles indicates low trading activity despite the gains making the price action moving forward quite tricky. The close of the August 15 candle will bring confirmation of the next price direction. PEPE Shows Resilient Above $0.00000120 As Whale Comes Onboard In recent days, there has been a resurgence in PEPE’s performance. This trend is attributable to substantial investments from prominent investors and a rise in social engagement. According to Lookonchain data, there is a significant surge in whale attention to the PEPE token. The data shows a whale spent $ 1 million to acquire 807 billion PEPE tokens at $0.000001239. This whale involvement will likely have positive impacts on the price of PEPE. Another instance of this type of Whale involvement occurred on August 7. A holder of PEPE tokens sold a substantial amount of 2.26 trillion tokens at the price of $0.000001121 per token. Unfortunately, this action resulted in a significant decrease of $707,000 in the token’s overall market capitalization. Such contrasting maneuvers taking place in a short period might carry potential consequences for individual investors over an extended duration. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 – Can It Happen? Meanwhile, the asset has been experiencing a notable resurgence, attracting investors’ attention.

As investors eagerly accumulate, the token’s price exhibits a roller-coaster ride of volatility. While optimism fuels the anticipation of a price rally, caution is advised as HBAR’s Bollinger Bands cast a shadow of uncertainty over its immediate future. At the time of writing, HBAR’s price is recorded at $0.071 according to CoinGecko, reflecting an 8.1% rally over the past 24 hours. Impressively, the token has experienced a seven-day surge of 21.3%, underlining its significance in the market’s recent performance. Hedera price action today. Source: Coingecko Hedera Price Roller-Coaster And Its Indicators The token’s recent performance showcases its resilience amidst market dynamics, but investors should be prepared for its volatile nature. Bollinger Bands, a widely-used technical analysis tool, serve as a flashing signal of HBAR’s ongoing turbulence. A price analysis notes that token is currently trading above the upper band of the indicator, implying a potential overbought situation. Moreover, the notable disparity between the upper and lower bands accentuates the prevailing high volatility. This discrepancy warns of an imminent correction, underscoring the capricious nature of HBAR’s market behavior.

This latest endorsement follows a series of positive strides for Hedera.

16073333,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547324,1692104410,Singapore Wraps Up Stablecoin Framework: Pathway to Global Adoption?,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has unveiled the features of a new regulatory framework aimed at ensuring a high degree of stability for stablecoins in the country. This is the outcome of the central bank’s public consultation, which commenced in October 2022. Feedback from this public consultation was considered during the design of this new set of stablecoin rules in Singapore. According to MAS, these rules will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any G10 currency – including the US dollar. MAS Releases “Key Requirements” For Stablecoin Issuers In Singapore In a media release published on Tuesday, August 15, the Monetary Authority of Singapore outlined key requirements for issuers of single-currency stablecoins in the country. The new regulatory framework for stablecoins consists of various provisions relating to value stability, base capital, redemption timeframes, and disclosure. Related Reading: US Congresswoman Raises Concerns About Paypal Stablecoin In The Absence Of Regulation The central bank stated that reserve assets – of a stablecoin – will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody, and audit, to give a high level of assurance on value stability. Meanwhile, issuers are required to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to lower the risk of bankruptcy. This is to also facilitate an “orderly wind-down” of business – if the need arises. Additionally, SCS issuers in Singapore must refund the equivalent value of the stablecoins to holders within five business days after a redemption request is submitted. Finally, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has mandated all stablecoin companies to provide appropriate disclosures to their users. Some of the information they are expected to disclose to their customers include SCS’ value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of SCS holders, and the audit results of reserve assets. The MAS noted that only issuers that fulfill all requirements under this new regulatory framework can apply for their stablecoins to be recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins.” However, the financial regulator also warned issuers against misrepresenting their tokens as MAS-regulated stablecoins, as it may result in penalties under the revised stablecoin regulatory framework. MAS’ Stablecoin Regulatory Framework – A Positive Sign For Global Adoption? In the press release, the MAS defined stablecoins as digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one of more specified fiat currencies. “When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the “on-chain” purchase and sale of digital assets,” it added. Meanwhile, Ms. Ho Hern Shin, MAS’ deputy managing director, reacted to this development in a statement: MAS’ stablecoin regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. We encourage SCS issuers who would like their stablecoins recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins” to make early preparations for compliance. Taking these statements into account, this new regulatory framework represents a positive attitude by the Singaporean authorities towards the use of stablecoin as a trusted means of payment. Moreover, it is expected to provide the needed clarity for stablecoin companies to operate in the country. It is worth mentioning that Singapore is not the only country making positive strides in terms of stablecoin regulation. There have also been discussions on regulating these digital payment tokens in the United States. Related Reading: Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT? In what was dubbed a “momentous move”, the US House Financial Services Committee recently advanced a bill titled “Clarity for Payments Stablecoin.” This proposed bill, if passed, will regulate the issuance and use of payment stablecoins in the United States.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  London-based Jacobi Asset Management has listed Europe's first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Euronext Amsterdam nearly two years after it was first approved. The Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) and will trade under the ticker ""BCOIN."" Custody for the fund is provided by Fidelity Digital Assets and trading firm Flow Traders operates as market maker, Jacobi announced on Tuesday. Jacobi first won approval for the fund in October 2021 with plans to list it in 2022. However the firm opted to push back its plans due to the difficult crypto market conditions last year.  The investment case for bitcoin (BTC) could be compelling as investors look to navigate some of the current uncertainties in the global macro landscape, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Thursday. The structural factors affecting inflation are changing with the advent of new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), and this may herald a new era of loose monetary policy, the report said. Coinbase notes that government spending in the U.S. has increased, keeping economic growth stable but boosting the cost of servicing the country’s debt over the next few years.  Bitcoin and ether remained little-changed on Tuesday, trading at $29,350 and $1,840, respectively. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has struggled to find directional momentum over the past few weeks, trading in an exceedingly tight range. A possible catalyst for shaking the market up would be a spot bitcoin ETF. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may or may not make a decision soon, analysts are expecting a court to deliver a verdict – perhaps as soon as today – in Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC over its plans to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to an ETF.

The bank notes that 316 qualifying companies mentioned AI, with 106 explicitly citing fundamental business improvement from using AI or machine learning.  ""29 quantified the revenue opportunity, 36 quantified a cost or productivity gain, 12 discussed customer service and in-housing as the lowest hanging fruit, 8 saw efficiency and in-housing of creative advertising, 82 other comments referred qualitatively to revenue or cost gains,"" analysts led by Edward Stanley wrote.  The ""lion’s share"" of this activity occurred in the U.S., the note said.  The three most significant trends among non-tech company earnings were ""biopharma gains from AI applications from strain selection to regulatory filings; large-cap banks discussing costs savings and onboarding from autonomous and in-house customer service; legal use cases from summaries to drafting appeared across the spectrum of reporting companies,"" the bank said.  The bank’s analysis covered global companies with a market cap greater than $10 billion, which reported results since July 1.  Rival Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS) said AI adoption will likely have a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy sometime between 2025 and 2030.

The blockchain's native token SEI also went live today on exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Huobi, among others.  The focus for Sei is to create a chain that offers users the ability to exchange assets easily, said the team behind the blockchain. Whether this means assets for social platforms, games or NFT’s, Sei is hoping to offer the smoothest experience.  Read more: SEI Token Could Reach Nearly Half a Billion Market Cap on Binance Debut  “Most layer 1s look to solve a technical problem whereas our mission is to solve the problem with exchanging assets easily,” said Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “There is a misconception that Sei is a decentralized finance (DeFi) focused chain, but we have more of a focus on social platforms, gaming, and carbon credits,” added Feng. “There are plenty of other places to trade DeFi assets,” he said.  Sei prides itself on its speed compared to other chains. According to co-founder Jay Jog, Sei is 10x faster than Solana and can achieve transaction finality in as little as 250 milliseconds with a 100 millisecond buffer to ensure protocol stability.

16071387,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547314,1692100232,Low Bitcoin Volatility Mirrors 2016: A Bullish Breakout On The Horizon?,"In today’s micro update from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin’s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout. “Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,” Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent. Bitcoin Breakout Imminent? While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. “If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,” the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, “a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.” Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit On the fundamental front, Bitcoin’s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate. The imminent decisions on several Bitcoin ETF approvals could potentially disrupt the current low volatility phase. “An approval could cause a break from the current low volatility range. Best not to pre-empt this though, as these decisions often get pushed. Confirmations are key to mitigate risk,” Edwards cautions. Diving deeper into the technicals, the report highlighted two key observations: Since 2010, Bitcoin’s historic volatility has only been lower than today in 2016. Suggesting a big price move is on the horizon when volatility expansion (reversion to the mean) occurs. Bitcoin’s $30K breakdown has (so far) failed to follow through… A close back into the Wyckoff structure at $30K would signify a failed breakdown and therefore be a very positive technical signal. BTC On-Chain Indicators Are Neutral Capriole’s Bitcoin Macro Index, a comprehensive tool that amalgamates over 40 Bitcoin on-chain, macro market, and equities metrics into a machine learning model, currently scores at -0.36, indicating “Contraction”. This suggests that while the short-term outlook remains neutral, the long-term perspective appears bullish. Remarkably, this strategy takes long-only positions in Bitcoin. In slowdowns and contractions, cash is held. “The Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors,” the report elucidated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By Thin $40 Million Bid Pool, But For How Long? A noteworthy addition to Capriole’s analysis toolkit is the “Bitcoin Production Cost” model, which evaluates the cost of mining a Bitcoin based on global average electrical consumption. Currently, this model indicates that Bitcoin is trading within a long-term value region, with the report speculating, “I would be surprised if this holds into 2024.” In conclusion, the analysis from Capriole paints a picture of potential long-term value amidst the current bearish technicals. Drawing parallels with 2016, the report suggests that Bitcoin’s current low volatility phase could be a precursor to a bullish breakout. “All else equal, Bitcoin is like a beach ball submerged underwater. Nonetheless, we remain in a technical breakdown. We don’t know how long that hand will hold the ball underwater for. Prudent risk-management will await a technical confirmation before acting.” With the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s expansion and contraction cycles, only time will tell if history will indeed repeat itself; especially with the backdrop of a totally different macro environment. At press time, the BTC price remained stagnant, trading at $29,445.

This time around, prosecutors are coming after the former CEO for allegedly using customer funds to buy the favor of politicians. SBF Used Customer Funds For Campaign Contributions The latest indictment filed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) details how Bankman-Fried embezzled customer deposits and used these stolen funds towards various ventures, including funding the political campaigns of several politicians in the Democratic and Republican parties. Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum According to the filing, SBF did this to lobby for crypto regulations that could favor him and his company. His plan was to get Congress and regulators to make laws and regulations that make it easier for FTX to accept customers’ deposits, consequently allowing his embezzlement to continue without getting noticed. SBF also apparently broke several campaign finance rules to maximize his influence on politicians by using straw donors as some of these political contributions were allegedly made in the names of FTX executives. The founder also made to conceal the fact that the source of these donations was customer funds, as he directed that the customer deposits be paid into the executives’ bank accounts, who then made the donations in their names. SBF had been publicly known to make contributions to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. He previously admitted that he made “significant” donations to both parties before the midterm elections last year. At the time, the funds he reportedly donated totaled over $40 million, making him the seventh-highest political donor between 2021 and 2022. However, the latest indictment filing reveals that he could have well been the second-highest political donor with over $100 million in political contributions. While SBF made these donations and portrayed himself as the “savior of the cryptocurrency industry” (in reference to SBF bailing out crypto firms that were struggling financially), there were gaps in FTX’s finances resulting from his alleged misappropriation. FTT Token struggles as SBF case intensifies | Source: FTTBUSD on Tradingview.com Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Seven Counts Of Fraud Despite this latest revelation, prosecutors will no longer be charging SBF with violation of campaign finance rules. This decision was made to protect the US government’s extradition agreement with the Bahamas as the latter “did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count.” Related Reading: Here’s Why This Former SEC Lawyer Thinks A Spot Bitcoin ETF Isn’t Coming According to the latest indictment filing, SBF now faces seven counts of financial fraud. These charges cut across his misappropriation of funds that belonged to FTX customers and Alameda Research Creditors. He is also charged with money laundering. Last week, a US Judge ruled that SBF be remanded in the infamous Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), known for its unfavorable living conditions. This ruling came after SBF was found to have tampered with evidence, and he is expected to remain in custody until his trial set for October 2.

42392715,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAQKZ,1692094493,The Secular Investment Case for Bitcoin and Crypto Adoption Remains Intact: Coinbase,"The investment case for bitcoin (BTC) could be compelling as investors look to navigate some of the current uncertainties in the global macro landscape, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Thursday.  The structural factors affecting inflation are changing with the advent of new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), and this may herald a new era of loose monetary policy, the report said.  Coinbase notes that government spending in the U.S. has increased, keeping economic growth stable but increasing the cost of servicing the country’s debt over the next few years.  “We believe the combined effect of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies should support bitcoin long term as a hedge against fiat debasement and profligate spending,” wrote David Duong, head of institutional research.  Artificial intelligence is expected to have a major impact on the global economy. AI and the accompanying technology will be transformational across industries and will be one of the most important secular investment themes over the next 10 years, said Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley (MS) in a report last week. Rival investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) predicts that AI adoption will likely start to have a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy sometime between 2025 and 20230.  “Bitcoin is not only a technologically innovative instrument but a financially innovative one,” the note said, and what distinguishes BTC as a financially innovative instrument is that it is a “globally accessible, decentralized supranational asset with a fixed supply.”  Furthermore, cryptocurrency allocations can diversify fund managers’ exposure to unusual sources of risk in a traditional balanced portfolio, the note said.  “The secular case for bitcoin and crypto adoption remains intact,” the report added. A secular investment theme is a long-term trend that isn’t tied to market cycles.

The listing means Europe will see a spot bitcoin ETF traded before the U.S., despite dozens of applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the last few years.  London-based Jacobi Asset Management has listed Europe's first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Euronext Amsterdam nearly two years after it was first approved.  The Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) and will trade under the ticker ""BCOIN."" Custody for the fund is provided by Fidelity Digital Assets and trading firm Flow Traders operates as market maker, Jacobi announced on Tuesday.  Jacobi first won approval for the fund in October 2021 with plans to list it in 2022. However the firm opted to push back its plans due to inopportune circumstances elsewhere in the digital asset market such as the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX.  Exchange-traded notes (ETNs), often referred to by the umbrella term exchange-traded products (ETPs), are commonplace in Europe, however Jacobi's offering is the first ETF.  ETF shareholders own a portion of the product's underlying shares, while ETN investors own a debt security. Jacobi has said its ETF cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, unlike ETNs.  The listing means Europe will see a spot bitcoin ETF traded before the U.S., despite dozens of applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the last few years, all of which were rejected.  However there has been renewed hope that the regulator would approve a spot bitcoin fund, after asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) led a flurry of new applications featuring ""surveillance-sharing"" agreements designed to guard against market manipulation.

16067875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547291,1692092428,Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 – Can It Happen?,"On August 14, Kevin Kelly, Co-founder of prominent crypto research firm Delphi Digital provided some interesting insights on Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. According to Kelly, the crypto market moves in consistent cycles, and we are currently in the initial stages of a new cycle based on market evidence. Using the premier cryptocurrency as a benchmark, Kelly states a crypto cycle usually begins with Bitcoin attaining a new all-time high (ATH) value, followed by an 80% loss in the next year. Thereafter, BTC would experience a market recovery over two years before embarking on a bullish run to attain a new ATH. The Interplay Between The Crypto Cycle And Macroeconomic Signals Based on Kelly’s analysis, a typical crypto cycle occurs within four years, and its events are triggered by some factors in the bigger macro business cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Relatively Muted – What Could Trigger A Sharp Decline? The analyst noted that, for example, Bitcoin usually attains new price peaks at the same period as the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Index – an economic indicator that tracks the manufacturing sector’s health in the United States. He said: BTC price peaks occur around the same time the ISM shows signs of topping out. Active addresses, total transaction volumes, total fees – they all peaked alongside tops in the ISM too. As the business cycle shows signs of recovery, so too does network activity levels… Due to this similarity in market movement, Kevin notes that turning moments in a typical business cycle have proven to be a favorable period to increase one’s exposure to risk assets such as Bitcoin. Source: Delphi Digital Bitcoin Poised To Attain New ATH By Q4 2024, Kelly Says Interestingly, Kevin Kelly stated in his analysis that the ISM is currently heading toward the end of a two-year downtrend, indicating that BTC’s prices may soon start surging in the coming months. To back his long-term bullish price prediction, Kelly highlights several other factors, including the Bitcoin Halving event coming up in April 2024. The Delphi Digital Co-founder stated that the last two Bitcoin halvings had occurred 18 months after BTC’s price tanked and 7 months before rallying to a new ATH. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit Based on this historical data, BTC could well attain a new ATH by Q4 2024. However, as with all predictions, Kelly stated that are certain risk factors involved. Firstly, he predicted that the BTC market is likely to soon witness a modest selling pressure or price consolidation, especially following the market’s strong recovery in the last 9 months. In addition, he also highlighted the possibility of the business cycle presenting a false bearish end – as seen in March 2020 – or not reaching its bearish end as soon as predicted. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading around $29,333.89, with a 0.12% decline on the last day.

16065799,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547284,1692087908,"Voyager Sells 1.4 Trillion Shiba Inu, But There’s Good News For SHIB","In a recent revelation, Lookonchain, the on-chain analysis service, reported that Voyager Digital, the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform, has been offloading its crypto assets on Coinbase in recent days. Over the past four days, the defunct lender has sold 49 different crypto assets, netting approximately $63 million. For the SHIB army the most notable sale was the 1.4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, which amounted to nearly $14.4 million. Beyond SHIB, Voyager’s sales included significant amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), and Decentraland (MANA). “Voyager has been selling assets on #Coinbase for the past 4 days and has sold 49 tokens for ~$63M. Including: 781 BTC ($23M); 9,570 ETH ($17.6M); 1.4T SHIB ($14.4M); 234,660 LINK ($1.74M); 1.87M MATIC ($1.27M); 3M MANA ($1.1M);”, Lookonchain tweeted. The sales have significantly reduced Voyager’s crypto holdings. However, they haven’t entirely emptied their coffers. The on-chain analysis service further detailed Voyager’s remaining assets: “Voyager currently holds $11.3M worth of assets, including: 52.4M VGX ($8.27M); 55 BTC ($1.62M); 537K KNC ($371K); 1.18 FTM ($286K); 20.7M STMX ($140K); 4.85M GALA ($111K).” Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Golden Cross – How Will Prices React? While the sales have drawn attention, there’s a silver lining for the SHIB community. According to Lookonchain’s data, Voyager’s SHIB holdings have been completely liquidated. Thus, Voyager’s SHIB holding have gone to zero, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure on the Shiba Inu token in the future. Shiba Inu Price Shows Resilience Despite the massive sell-off by Voyager, SHIB’s price remained resilient. The token has seen a surge of over 14.2% in the past week. This bullish momentum is largely attributed to the forthcoming Shibarium mainnet launch at the Blockchain Future Conference, starting today. Investors seem optimistic about SHIB’s potential, believing that if the layer-2 scaling solution delivers on its promises, the SHIB token could witness even more substantial gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges At press time, the Shiba Inu price stood at $0.00001019 after finding support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00001007). The key resistance on a daily basis is currently the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00001121. Should a breakout occur, SHIB could rise 21% from its current price to follow through to the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Major resistance is expected at this price level ($0.00001235). The RSI on a daily basis has been in an ascending trend since the annual low on June 10 and was at 65 at press time. This leaves the SHIB bulls with further room to run. For an explosive double-digit move, the RSI should enter deep overbought territory. For investors, today’s or tomorrow’s Shibarium launch should be taken with a grain of salt. As usual for the crypto market, it could be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, as the impact of the launch might only be seen in the long term over the coming months. In this case, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000938 will be a key support to defend for the bulls.

Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at $1.455. Chart: TradingView.com Bollinger Bands, represented by gray bands on the chart, indicate the volatility of both daily and weekly price actions. A wider gray area signifies higher volatility, emphasizing the market’s response to Toncoin’s price shifts.

16056752,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547256,1692068414,"Cardano Whales Rapidly Accumulating, ADA Bull Run Incoming?","There are encouraging on-chain activities in Cardano. According to Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, on August 14, there were 25,294 wallet addresses with at least 100,000 ADA, the highest in over 16 months. The uptick could signal interest, especially considering that prices are under pressure looking at the performance in the daily chart. ADA Whales Accumulating Looking at Santiment trends, it appears that ADA whales began accumulating as early as June 2022, and the number has been rising steadily ever since. However, amid this encouraging “bullish” signal, ADA prices have fluctuated, edged lower, and diverged with whales’ actions in the past 16 months. ADA is changing hands at around $0.289 at spot rates, down from $0.465 when whales began loading up in mid-June 2022, as seen below. There are over 25,000 whales with at least 100,000 ADA of writing in mid-August, up by over 3,000 since June 2022. Overall, and as aforementioned, this is a vote of confidence for Cardano and may signal optimism in how ADA’s future prices could pan out. Related Reading: Michael Burry’s Massive $1.6 Billion Short: Is A $DXY Collapse The Catalyst For A Crypto Bloodbath? In crypto, token holders closely monitor whale activity, as their actions often influence market sentiment. Their continued accumulation, for example, of ADA, is an endorsement of a project’s potential and could ignite demand, lifting prices. Conversely, when they offload, it could trigger a sell-off, forcing asset prices lower. ADA whales are buying more of the coin when Cardano’s market capitalization has been pulling back from 2023 highs. At spot rates, the project’s market cap is down by at least 35%, dropping from $15.76 billion to $10.1 billion as of mid-August. Even so, ADA is one of the most liquid coins looking at the average daily trading volumes and position in the leader board. Cardano Building, ADA Resilient But Weak Presently ranked eighth, Cardano is ahead of Solana and Tron but trailing XRP and Dogecoin in the top 10. ADA is trading at $0.289, down roughly 10% from August 2023 highs. While ADA remains within the June to July 2023 trading range, ADA buyers hold an advantageous position looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Despite recent lower lows, sellers have not yet reversed the gains of July 13, a conspicuous bar that shapes the immediate price action.

16053405,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547215,1692061229,Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit,"According to Bloomberg, a recent research report from Sanford C. Bernstein has shed light on the potential impact of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market dynamics. Related Reading: Silent Bitcoin Storm: Glassnode Uncovers What Lies Beneath The Surface Potential Surge In Bitcoin Market Value Sanford C. Bernstein’s research indicates that should the US green-light a fund investing directly in spot Bitcoin, ETFs could constitute roughly 10% of Bitcoin’s market value within the next three years. Such a shift could amplify Bitcoin’s presence in traditional financial portfolios and potentially foster more significant institutional adoption. According to Bloomberg, Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, highlighted the rising probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the report. In a separate report, this same analyst had recently disclosed that the SEC believes that a Bitcoin Spot ETF may be “unreliable” since crypto exchanges (such as Coinbase) aren’t under their oversight, leading to concerns about potential price manipulation and unreliability. While the speculation on the SEC approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF continues, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently holding about 4% of all Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg, a direct investment, ETF could more than double this figure, potentially aiding the growth of the crypto investment landscape. The “Growth Flywheel” Effect Once regulatory approval is in place, Bernstein anticipates a “growth flywheel” effect propelled by retail and other institutional inflows. Such a cascade effect would be reminiscent of other financial markets where introducing new financial products spurred fresh investments and liquidity waves. Notably, to understand the significance of this, one only needs to consider the broader ETF market’s growth trajectory. Since their inception, ETFs have grown exponentially, with assets under management surging across various sectors and asset classes. Introducing a Spot Bitcoin ETF would mean integrating a highly liquid, decentralized, and increasingly accepted asset into this mix, further validating Bitcoin’s place in the financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price is struggling to break above the $30,000 mark after slipping below that price range last week. As of this writing, the asset trades at $29,623, recording a slight increase of 0.5% over the past 24 hours. Alongside its struggling price, BTC’s market capitalization has increased by more than $10 billion in just the past week. The asset market cap has surged from a high of $560 billion earlier last week to a current cap of $573 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators The top crypto’s trading volume has also followed closely with its surging market cap and has seen a significant spike from last week’s daily trading volume.

The last of these tokens recorded a 17% increase over the past hour and at the time of writing alone. As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other significant cryptocurrencies trend sideways, traders are attracted to riskier and volatile assets. In addition, these tokens experienced more volatility as they possessed less trading volume and liquidity. In other words, smaller traders can influence the price action on some of these assets. While on Bitcoin, and even Dogecoin (DOGE), traders need billions of dollars to influence the price action. When Will The Bitcoin Price Move Again? But how long can traders in the memecoin sector benefit from a low volatility environment? Per a recent update from Bitfinex Alpha, the current status quo is bound to persist.
