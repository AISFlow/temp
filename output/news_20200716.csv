42432329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBwzh,1594938282,What Does the Twitter Hack Mean for Bitcoin? Crypto Reacts,"For five hours, all of Twitter became Crypto Twitter.      Wednesday, one of the biggest digital hacks in recent memory went down. A hacker, likely a Bitcoiner, gained access to Twitter’s administrative functions and began a crypto-scam campaign. Some of the world’s most notable accounts on the site started offering to double their investments if they sent funds to a Bitcoin wallet.      It’s the type of scummy behavior Twitter promised to address back in 2018. A federal examination is likely. So, too, is a permanent stain on Twitter’s reputation. What’s unknown is how this incident will affect perceptions of Bitcoin, blockchain and the crypto space, which is once again thrown into the news cycle for all the wrong reasons.    Click here for CoinDesk’s full coverage of the Twitter hack.    CoinDesk convened a panel of experts to discuss what the long- and short-term consequences of this scandal may be for crypto, and whether it’s a watershed moment to finally decentralize our social media.    Anil Lulla co-founded Delphi Digital, a research and consultancy firm specializing in crypto assets  Donna Redel is board member at New York Angels, an angel investment firm and frequent speaker on the crypto conference circuit.  Steven McKie founded the venture capital firm Amentum and built a Handshake compatible web browser in his free time.  Brekkie Von Bitcoin – A crypto influencer of sorts, Brekkie is known for relentlessly advocating for the coin.  Matt Hill is CEO of Start9 Labs and an advocate for digital sovereignty.  Vinay Gupta, inventor of the Hexayurt, is now pursuing the radical startup, Mattereum, which is attempting to create a digital twin for all physical items, so humanity can better manage and distribute increasingly scarce natural resources.    Their responses have been edited and condensed.      Will this increase in the attention to Bitcoin be good for crypto in general? Or will this attack/taint the image of Bitcoin?      Lulla: I believe there are some positive benefits to Bitcoin. Anyone who works in crypto got messages from friends and family asking what the scam is all about. They were curious to know when they saw the word ""Bitcoin"" on TV. So maybe this is an opportunity for us to explain how Bitcoin works. We can outline that this isn't a Bitcoin scam and it was not hacked; Twitter got hacked. Obviously, it is going to increase attention, though whether that's good or bad is up in the air. These little things shouldn't really affect the fundamentals of Bitcoin.      See also: Jack Dorsey: Mass Crypto Adoption Will Transform Square’s Business      Redel: From my perspective, the short-term and long-term impact on Bitcoin from this hack is irrelevant since the emphasis should be on the illegal activity and breach of security. Twitter should be concerned about its short-term and long-term reputation.      McKie: I think it’s not going to bring much attention to Bitcoin, aside from the general discourse for the next week or two. There’s just so much going on.      Von Bitcoin: As someone who believes that Bitcoin is our best shot at a more prosperous future for everyone. … I’m personally only concerned on whether the increased media attention is good for Bitcoin, not crypto in general. But at this stage, I think the adage still holds that all press is good press for Bitcoin.      Hill: The increased attention to Bitcoin might be good for crypto prices in general, but no amount of attention is going to save most of the projects out there from total collapse.      Gupta: It’ll be a few stories about Bitcoin in the papers, but I don’t think it’ll spur adoption.      Will this reinforce existing biases against crypto being associated with criminals?      Lulla: This is a wider topic. People have predetermined biases. Most people in the space by now have been open-minded enough to understand this. Of course, there's always gonna be a subset of people who always look for information that will always support their biases or their positions. But at the end of the day I don't think it fundamentally changes anything. It really hasn't changed anything so far.      McKie: I don’t really think anyone will care. It’s Bitcoin. It doesn’t do anything to make it more infamous for those that already didn’t like it.      See also: Crypto Criminals Have Already Stolen $1.4B in 2020, Says CipherTrace      Von Bitcoin: Well, it didn’t do us any favors with regards to that common bias. There are already plenty of people calling this a “Bitcoin Hack"" when obviously that is not the case at all. I am hopeful though that the fallout will be limited. Take this personal anecdote for what it is, but yesterday I spoke to my father about the hack, and despite the fact that his knowledge of Bitcoin is limited, he understood that the criminals were merely using Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin itself hadn’t been hacked.      Hill: For some, yes. But I think most people are smart enough to know there were plenty of criminals before crypto.      Gupta: Yes, it’s a stuipd mess, and it’s going to be widely understood as a stupid mess – yet more fuel for the people who want to believe crypto is for scammers.      Could you speculate into the hacker’s motivations?      Lulla: It's still early to say because we're still learning about what happened with the hack. Twitter is going to be really impacted by this because there's gonna be a lot more scrutiny on how this happened and what exactly happened here. The whole motivation of the hacker was to get Bitcoin, but the damage could have been worse.      Redel: First, the hack into people’s emails is an illegal activity. Secondly, the impersonation of individuals asking for transactions in bitcoin is simply another version of other illegal “scams” that ask people to send dollars to bank accounts or other locations.      See also: How to Spot a Crypto Scam      McKie: I’m not quite sure. They probably got access that they weren’t expecting and realized they had an opportunity and did something without planning. It’s really a test of why they didnt do anything with Donald Trump’s account, which would guarantee an immediate shutdown of whatever process they were exploiting.      Von Bitcoin: Should I put my tinfoil hat on before I answer? On the surface it seems like the hacker just wanted to steal bitcoin. As others have noted, the hack itself appeared very clumsy, but if that clumsiness was intentional… then there may have been an ulterior motive. Perhaps it was a bad actor with other vested interests trying to discredit Bitcoin or Twitter, but I think it’s too early to say.      Hill: I can only say what I hope their motivation was: to expose the fragility of centralized systems.      Gupta: Well, if the goal was to make money from a massive Twitter 0-day, I have to say there were probably more effective ways of doing it. I was really surprised there was no political messaging, either!      Is this a wake-up call to decentralize our communications systems?      Gupta: Decentralized systems aren’t necessarily any more proofed against these kinds of exploits – protocol bugs are just as bad, when they occur.      McKie: I don’t think Twitter can do a damn thing. When you have internal social engineering by nefarious actors, taking advantage of admin tools that are there for a particular reason, that’s just the nature of a centralized organization. There’s employee churn, there’s a lot of varied levels of security and accountability, there’s absolutely nothing you can do. There’s no security organization, anywhere in the world, you could have paid to prevent this sort of internal attack. You just have to accept that. Does that build the case for decentralized web? Yeah, sure. But no one immediately will think that, except for the people already in our crypto echo chamber.      See also: In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win      Lulla: People need to understand that Twitter got hacked – a centralized system got hacked. At the end, it is an issue with Twitter. It can take the shape of a wake up call for people. If this didn't happen for instance there might be some people in the world who would never even imagine a situation like this. This is adding support for our community rights and decentralized systems of communication.      Redel: Safeguarding privacy is important and should be a high priority for all.      Von Bitcoin: At the very least it’s a wake-up call about vulnerabilities, and I think that Twitter is already taking it very seriously. Jack [Dorsey, the CEO]has hinted at wanting to decentralize Twitter, so I imagine this event might fast track those plans. Unfortunately there is a chicken and egg problem with trying to decentralize communications, and frankly for some use cases, centralization means a more efficient system.      Hill: It is yet another wake up call. And like most wakeup calls, it will be greeted with a snooze button and a growing sense of anxiety.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,"Vinamrata Chaturvedi, Daniel Kuhn",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/what-does-the-twitter-hack-mean-for-bitcoin-crypto-reacts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7b82f53211cab20a71660ef4f2298ebec963368-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432323,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBwvh,1594936381,"In the Aftermath of Hack, Lawmakers Blame Twitter, Not Bitcoin","Wednesday's Twitter hack would seem to spell regulatory doom for Bitcoin, which is widely distrusted in Washington. Some lawmakers – and U.S. President Donald Trump himself – associate it with crime.      In 2019 Trump tweeted he is not a fan of bitcoin and that “unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior.” He also reportedly told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “go after Bitcoin.”      But immediately following the hack, lawmakers seemed more focused on Twitter's security problems rather than cryptocurrency's role in the hack.      On Wednesday, high-profile accounts belonging to Elon Musk, Kanye West, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, cryptocurrency exchanges and many others were co-opted into a bitcoin scam that netted the hackers at least $100,000. Twitter struggled to resolve the issue, even temporarily blocking verified accounts' abilities to tweet and reset their passwords. Security experts said the hack was likely deep in Twitter’s system, and therefore is not a quick fix.      Lawmakers were quick to respond.      See also: CoinDesk’s full coverage of the Twitter hack      Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a vocal critic of tech platforms, fired off an open letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey soon after the hack went mainstream. The event, he said, “may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself.”      Hawley also asked whether there was a risk that President Trump’s account could have been hacked and how many users might have had their data stolen.      Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) revealed he had met with Dorsey privately in 2018 and discussed implementing end-to-end encryption of users' direct messages, which could contain sensitive information and may have been vulnerable during the hack. Wyden says Dorsey told him at the time that Twitter was working on encrypted DMs, but two years later it hadn’t delivered.      Read more: Twitter Hack 2020 Was Probably Done by a Bitcoiner – But Not a Savvy One      “This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms. If hackers gained access to users' DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact for years to come,” Wyden said in a statement.    Focusing blame    Meanwhile, some crypto supporters in Washington, D.C., aren’t worried the hack will cause lasting damage to the industry.      Coin Center Director of Communications Neeraj Agrawal noted that while Twitter was compromised, Bitcoin (or crypto) was not. And if the hackers’ goal was to make money, they failed miserably: Only a scant $123,200 in bitcoin flowed through the wallet listed, and it’s likely some of those funds were recycled through by the attackers.      The incident shines a spotlight on centralized points of failure, such as one individual on a single platform being able to compromise numerous accounts.      “Somebody who has limited access to the admin panel on Twitter was able to do so much damage because Twitter is a centralized server,” Agrawal said.      Agrawal doesn’t think the incident will have a huge impact on how lawmakers approach crypto.      “Even though maybe it's been broadcast to more people than ever before, the kind of people who are watching it closely, like policymakers for example, see this and ... they're not surprised by the capability for this,” he said. “I hope that they see this, and they know that there's nothing new here, there's nothing to react to when it comes to Bitcoin policy.”      It remains to be seen whether the White House or senior administration officials decide to weigh in, but so far the response from lawmakers has been promising, said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.      See also: After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever      She pointed to a tweet from Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) as one example, noting he explicitly said centralized control was the issue behind Twitter’s hack.      “I would say 99% of policymakers are not thinking about blockchain or cryptocurrency. And so anytime that you have national headlines that deal with a hack of this size and magnitude, and Bitcoin is sort of involved in the process, for the uneducated it’s a bad association because they then think that Bitcoin is sort of a preferred tool of criminals. Those of us that work in the industry and know it, study it, the policymakers who spent the time to learn about it, know that that's not the case,” Smith said.      Wednesday’s hack may prove to be a teachable moment for the crypto-skeptics, she said. Blockchain analytic firms are already watching the address the scammer used, and exchanges have begun blacklisting it, preventing potential victims from sending any funds to the account.      Agrawal said he hopes there is a conversation about the potential benefits of using crypto, such as by Russian political activists or in trying to avoid currency freezes.      Read more: Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn’t Like It      “We got lucky, because hackers have unprecedented access to a massively important system where so much damage [could have happened]. I mean, it's mind numbing the amount of payoffs they could have caused in a few minutes. But instead they went for bitcoin,” he said.    Criminal opportunities    James Comer (R-Ky.), head of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, also sent a letter to Dorsey demanding the committee be briefed on everything from how quickly Twitter alerted the FBI to whether the hack was conducted by a foreign adversary. Comer, too, expressed concern over where direct messages were vulnerable.      “Twitter’s failure not only created an opportunity for criminals to perpetrate a crime broadcasted to millions of Twitter’s users, but the hackers’ potential breach of Twitter’s security poses broader risks regarding hackers’ access to private direct messages,” he said in the letter.      Senate Commerce Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) also sent Dorsey a letter, though it was less strident than Hawley’s. He said he was concerned about the potential for disinformation to be spread through such a hack, especially via high-profile accounts.      Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said in a statement shared with CoinDesk the hack could have had “major consequences” on elections, calling on Twitter to “get to the bottom of the hack and implement necessary safeguards” to prevent a repeat.      Read more: Twitter Hack: Chainalysis and CipherTrace Confirm FBI Investigation      On a local level, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the state to conduct a full investigation into the hack.      “With more than 300 million users, Twitter is a primary source of news for many, making it a target for bad actors. This type of hack by con artists for financial gain can also be a tool of foreign actors and others to spread disinformation and - as we've witnessed - disrupt our elections,” said Cuomo in a statement.

Fees on the Ethereum network are now higher than they have been in a month, as the price per transaction crept up to 0.003691 ether Thursday, according to data from aggregator Blockchair. Ethereum is the backbone behind most DeFi platforms, and the rise in fee price means increased demand for the network as well as the possibility of constraints in the near future.      “Due to the hype around DeFi, the gas fees on the Ethereum network are in the higher range in the past month, reflecting a strong network demand,” said Johnson Xu, head of research and analytics at TokenInsight. “Further strong growth of DeFi could be restricted by the Ethereum blockchain network bottleneck.”      Johnson is optimistic that scaling solutions will allow DeFi to continue growing, however. “Multiple solutions to scale the Ethereum network, the slow but progressive ETH 2.0 development, the layer-2 proposals, will add significant value to the Ethereum ecosystem, lifting the limit on how the DeFi ecosystem can grow in the future.”      Read More: OKCoin Joins Coinbase in Supplying Oracle Feed for Compound    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Thursday.

42432313,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBwhh,1594929177,Bitcoin Cash Is the Only Fork Underperforming Bitcoin This Year,"Bitcoin cash is the only forked cryptocurrency underperforming bitcoin in 2020, according to data from Messari. The inaugural fork is only up 9% year to date.      Although most alternate cryptocurrencies (or “altcoins”) have rallied over the past few months, bitcoin cash – the only fork around today that traded throughout the 2017 cryptocurrency bull market – has been left behind. Bitcoin cash only started underperforming bitcoin in May, but two months was enough time for the forked cryptocurrency to underperform bitcoin by 18 percentage points so far this year.      It’s common for altcoins to outperform bitcoin during bullish market cycles. Altcoins with low or medium market capitalizations often experience higher volatility than bitcoin, which may yield higher returns should bitcoin’s price also appreciate.      Bitcoin cash, on the other hand, has simply experienced more of a volatility compression compared to the other forks, especially bitcoin sv, which has a market capitalization closest to bitcoin cash, said Dan Koehler, liquidity manager at OKCoin.      “Bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond remain in a much smaller market cap bucket and thus could be experiencing higher volatility and returns as a result,” he added.      See also: With Bitcoin Stuck in the Doldrums, Altcoins Continue to Rally      Another, more fundamental possible explanation for bitcoin cash’s lackluster performance is that the protocol’s ecosystem – including developers, investors and entrepreneurs – has “unraveled,” according to Zach Resnick, managing partner at Unbounded Capital, a BSV-long fund. Bitcoin underperforming other forks like bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond is not surprising due to their characteristically high volatility, he told CoinDesk.

42432327,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBx1h,1594928781,"Maybe It Wasn’t About the Money - Few People Fell for Twitter Hack, Data Indicates","Even though Wednesday’s Twitter hack grabbed the world’s attention by taking over a host of prominent accounts including those belonging to Elon Musk, Uber, Apple and Barack Obama, transaction data for crypto wallets associated with the attacks shows the hackers didn’t make out like bandits. It raises the question: Why not?      With the attacks, millions of people saw the same scam-type message shared on their feeds, soliciting bitcoin with the promise it would be doubled and sent to a group called “Crypto for Health.”      Crypto-analytics firm Chainalysis told CoinDesk that it had identified and was monitoring four crypto wallets associated with the attack, three of which received bitcoin and one was for XRP but hadn’t received anything by press time.    The most prominent bitcoin address registered 372 incoming bitcoin transactions, and nine withdrawals from the wallet had been made by press time, according to data reviewed by CoinDesk.   The secondary BTC addresses registered a total of 100 transactions and received about $6,700 in bitcoin, Chainalysis said. While over 400 transactions were registered on the wallets in total, the attacks appear to have yielded a relatively marginal amount of $123,200.   According to Chainalysis, part of the scam relied on the hackers moving their own crypto between the wallets to create the impression that many people were participating in the offer. While 156 wallets appear to have given away more than a $1, it’s difficult to parse which one of the transactions could belong to the hackers.   Some people were clearly duped, however, with 17 wallets having given away more than $1000, including a Japanese wallet that gave $40,000 away, to a Twitter scam that rivaled in sophistication to an email solicitation from a “Nigerian prince.”   So considering the hackers had access to the Twitter accounts of some of the most influential business people in the world, the lack of sophistication of the bitcoin solicitation may indicate the perpetrators had other goals besides money.   For instance, the profit from yesterday’s massive attack contrasts sharply with the more than $240,000 yielded in 2000 from a hack on just one mid-sized tech company.   In that instance, a former employee of a press release distribution company accessed that company’s system to issue a false release on behalf of Emulex Corp., a networking firm, the shares of which he was short. That release, which purported to disclose financial irregularities at Emulex, cost shareholders about $110 million after the fake news disclosure initially wiped out more than $2 billion off Emulex’s market cap.   So clearly the effects of Wednesday’s hacks could have been significantly worse, perhaps even catastrophic.   It’s possible yesterday’s attack was more about the vanity of the hackers rather than any serious attempt to get rich.

42432328,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBx3h,1594927287,Twitter Hack 2020 Was Probably Done by a Bitcoiner – But Not a Savvy One,"A cyberattack against Twitter has sparked widespread debate about tech industry regulations and borderless money.      So far the scam has garnered $120,000 worth of bitcoin by tweeting about a fake giveaway campaign. Verified Twitter accounts briefly lost the ability to post Wednesday, which inspired one New York magazine columnist to tweet that making cryptocurrency “illegal” would “prevent this sort of thing.”    Click here for CoinDesk’s full coverage of the Twitter hack.    Missouri Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley promptly published a public letter to CEO Jack Dorsey, saying Twitter should work with the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to address security issues. By Thursday morning, many authentic Twitter accounts were no longer able to tweet bitcoin addresses at all, although QR codes still worked.      “As much as I can tell by the evidence I see right now, the attackers did not understand the value of the information that they had,” ClearSky CEO Boaz Dolev told CoinDesk. “We need to find a way to build a more resilient audience that won’t believe anything they see in a certain format is true. It’s a new era where we need new tools to understand what is true.”      That said, with an audience reach of over 375 million followers, the hacked accounts only ensnared 421 bitcoin transactions, with only 17 of those transactions valued above $1,000. Roughly half of the transactions hailed from North American exchange accounts.      Whoever is behind the Twitter Hack of 2020, which collected bitcoin by hijacking the accounts of everyone from Barack Obama to Elon Musk, Dolev said it doesn’t appear to be a state actor or a terror group.      So far the evidence suggests the attackers were well-versed in crypto culture, using inside jokes like spending up to 6.15 bitcoin, a popular meme reference, and tweeting about paid Telegram groups.      “Based on the history of the first destination address of the CryptoForHealth scam addresses, the scammers have a history of gambling on BitMEX and Coinbase usage,” said the privacy-centric team behind Samourai Wallet.    Misinformation    And yet, despite clearly being a crypto veteran, the attackers didn’t use some of the best bitcoin privacy tech available.      Samourai Wallet said so far none of the 12.8 BTC appear to have been mixed with the firm’s WhirlPool tool nor any other non-custodial CoinJoin software. Instead, the evidence suggests the hackers have used centralized exchange accounts, like BitMEX, in the past.      The crypto startup CryptoQuant tweeted “4.8 BTC went into the mixer.” But evidence from the analytics firm Quantstamp shows the illicit funds have not been used with any non-custodial mixing or CoinJoins. To Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma, this suggests an unsophisticated attacker because it will be hard to liquidate these funds.      “The hacker used a single address, which likely reduced the hacker’s earnings by making it easier to trace,” Ma said. “Many exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini have already blacklisted the address as well as the derivative addresses as the hacker seeks to exit with the funds.”      CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju promptly responded to a direct message from CoinDesk clarifying this blockchain data may suggest use of a “centralized mixing wallet.”      “The transaction patterns look like mixing because this wallet has multiple unknown tx inputs from one-time used wallets,” he said. But after further investigation, he replied again that it was a mistake.      “I sincerely apologize for giving the wrong info,” Young Ju said in a message.      Only a sophisticated user would notice this data about “the mixer” was described incorrectly and that the hack was not affiliated with any popular mixing wallets or software projects. Bálint Harmat, co-CEO of the Wasabi Wallet maker zkSNACKs, said, “We took a quick look at the addresses. They are not related to Wasabi CoinJoins as of now.”      Even using the same bitcoin addresses, experts may incorrectly interpret the data. Both Ma and the Samourai Wallet team described the bitcoin transactions as simple, sometimes even a single hop. In the end, all parties agreed there is no evidence of mixing.    Broader implications    As Twitter users struggle to regain full access to the platform and protect their data, there’s no way for the social media company to prioritize millions of issues at once. Legacy brands and celebrities may have the resources to manage public broadcasts but few citizen journalists do.

There aren’t really any alternatives for the firm’s product in the current market, he said, “which is why a product like this is so crucial to the success of the industry.”  According to Alex Bashlykov, CTO of Zerion, a fintech firm based in Moscow, Alchemy’s product has helped better identify errors on the Zerion platform and has provided “new insights into the health and performance” of its products.

42432321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBwrh,1594924544,Bitcoin Miner Supply Sent to Exchanges Fell to 12-Month Lows in Q2 2020,"Bitcoin miners curtailed their supply to exchanges to the lowest level in 12 months during the second quarter, revealing their long-term bias on the cryptocurrency.      The daily miner selling activity, as measured by the percentage of bitcoin sent to exchanges, fell to a 365-day low of 15% on May 20, according to data provided by Chainalysis. The metric remained in a declining trend throughout the April to June period.      Bitcoin miners operate on cash and are constant sellers in the market, liquidating at least some part of their holdings every day in order to cover their operational costs.      “It seems miners, at least, expect to be able to sell bitcoin higher in the coming months,” research analysts at CoinDesk noted in their quarterly report while discussing implications of the drop in the daily miner selling.      Indeed, bitcoin miners, like any other seller, are governed by the law of supply, which states that other factors being constant, price and quantity supplied of a good are directly related to each other.      See also: Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Drops 3 Directors in Possible Boardroom Coup      They tend to hoard coins when prices are expected to rise and are willing to sell more at higher prices. This is because mining profitability is heavily influenced by the gyrations in bitcoin’s price.      As such, the decline in daily miner selling observed in the second quarter could be considered a sign of bullish price expectations among those responsible for making coins.      It should be noted that miners reduced supply even though bitcoin’s price rally stalled following the May 11 halving. The cryptocurrency bounced back from $3,867 to $10,000 in the two months leading up to the event and has struggled to establish a strong foothold above $10,000 ever since.      The data appears to validate bullish price forecasts made by prominent analysts over the past few months. Bloomberg analysts predicted in May the cryptocurrency could challenge the record high of $20,000 by the end of December.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New Record High 2 Months After Halving      However, not all analysts consider miner hoarding a bullish sign. Charlie Morris, founder of data source ByteTree, told CoinDesk in March that miners tend to build inventory when they think the market lacks strength to absorb extra supply. After all, mining pools account for the lion’s share of bitcoin mining and account for the highest percentage of total bitcoin flowing into exchanges. Hence, they have to be extra careful while boosting supply because their actions can lead to exaggerated sell-offs.      So far, bitcoin has failed to capitalize on decreased miner selling. The cryptocurrency continues to trade in the multi-week range of $9,000 to $10,000, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Meanwhile, the derivatives market isn’t so optimistic.

But whoever it was is deep into the cryptocurrency space, with the BitMEX receipts to prove it, according to preliminary analysis from Samourai Wallet's research arm, OXT Research. (A pastebin can be found here.)      “Confirmed, no signs of mixing. Majority of funds spent 1 or two hops and [are] now parked,” Samourai said in a Twitter DM to CoinDesk. “Really curious what their cash-out plan is.”      As of 14:00 UTC, the funds in at least one address are already under the control of Coinbase, Samourai added.

No coin-mixing involvement (yet)    Overall, Samourai says the hacker only used three Bitcoin addresses and has not sent any funds through a mixing service, as data provider CryptoQuant had previously tweeted. (CryptoQuant has since told CoinDesk it no longer believes the funds have been mixed.)      ""Always a possibility the address is an unlabeled mixer, but I don't see any hints, and one-time use addresses are very common in general and not a definitive pattern for mixers,"" Ergo told CoinDesk.      Those addresses, however, linked to other addresses that Samourai tracked to the popular crypto derivatives platform BitMEX.      “Everything from the first address is being spent to this address 1Ai52Uw6usjhpcDrwSmkUvjuqLpcznUuyF, which looks to have been first funded via BitMex,” Samourai said.

BitMEX did not return requests for comment by press time.      “At best investigators can subpoena any relevant account info including IP addresses[;] from there, they can glean some additional info from on-chain data including source of funds,” Ergo said in a private message.      Coinbase, on the other hand, has very strict KYC policies. Ergo said the best chance of identifying the hacker comes from Coinbase.

You need only look at the pressure companies felt (and the greediness and misaligned incentives of management teams) to increase stock prices by spending billions of dollars of idle cash on stock buybacks, only to be left with no rainy day funds during a three-month pandemic.      See also: Jeff Dorman - What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars      This, of course, led to trillions of dollars in bailouts at society’s expense; a negative externality that will affect multiple generations for decades. Joe Biden recently said, “It’s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism – the idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That’s simply not true and it’s an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their country. That isn’t a new or radical notion.”      Independent of political leanings, companies are feeling this pressure more than ever. Not just from Washington, but from society. Is there a way to cater to shareholders while also catering to society and your customers? As usual, we can look at Amazon as an example.      More than 150 million people have an Amazon Prime membership, and everyone pays the same price for it. However, a much smaller percentage of people own AMZN shares. You might argue that most AMZN shareholders probably have a Prime membership, but it is certainly not the case that most Prime members own AMZN stock. The Venn diagram might look like this:      When you buy AMZN stock, you know exactly what you are getting – a share of the company’s profits and a “claim on future cash flows.” However, when you buy a Prime membership, you have no idea what you are getting. At first, purchasing an Amazon Prime membership only gave you faster and cheaper delivery. But over 10-plus years, Prime membership has been rewarded with additional benefits like music, movies and now discounts at Whole Foods.      As a Prime member, you have reaped the benefits of good management and network growth, but it made no difference whether you were the first Prime member or the last to join because you pay exactly the same price as everyone else and receive the same rewards. The same cannot be said for AMZN shareholders, where the price you pay depends on when you purchase.    This is the only path where capitalism and socialism can converge, and we’re seeing it happen in real time.    Had Prime membership been tokenized, this Venn diagram of ownership would have overlapped much faster. As an early adopter, you would have gained both financially from the increased demand for Prime membership (driving token price higher) and still gained utility as Prime membership benefits were enhanced.      Further, you would have become a strong evangelist for the brand, as you would be financially incentivized to get others to join Prime faster. Both Amazon shareholders and Amazon Prime members have been rewarded, but one could argue both would have done even better had the incentive structure been tweaked through tokenization.      As Arca sees it, this is the only path where capitalism and socialism can converge, and we’re seeing it happen in real time. Debt, equity and tokenized digital assets will all have a place in an investor’s portfolio, and more importantly, in customers’ portfolios. The lines are likely to blur as investors become active participants in the bootstrapped growth of the companies they love.      The best example of this to date is Binance and its BNB token. At first, owning the BNB token simply gave you discounts when you used Binance’s services. Today, BNB’s use cases have expanded to:      Referral program staking – If a person holds 500 BNB or more, they receive double the referral bonus, as well as a portion of the trading      See also: Jeff Dorman - If Crypto Is Anything Like Fixed-Income, It’s Going to Need a Fatter Textbook      IEO staking – The number of tickets you can claim depends on the amount of BNB you hold.      Discounted Trading fees – Binance discounts transaction fees by 25% (decreasing to 12.5% in July) whenever a transaction fee is paid for in BNB.      Assist network transactions using BNB on Binance DEX.      Voting power – The more BNB you own, the more votes you have regarding which coin should list on Binance.      Like Amazon, Binance’s business lines and revenues have exploded. Unlike Amazon, Binance’s customers have benefited financially, in addition to benefiting from enhanced services. As a result, Binance’s Venn Diagram might look much closer to this:      It may sound terrifying to invest in something like a digital asset without knowing exactly what rights you are receiving for your investment. That token designs can change, and features can be added or subtracted, may give you pause as you wonder what your rights are as a token holder.      But when you dissect this, it’s no different than what you do as a shareholder. Those who bought AMZN stock in the early days of the company thought they were investing in an online bookstore. When you back good management teams, it doesn’t really matter what your rights as a shareholder or a token holder are, what matters is that you and management saw the potential before others did. The flexibility of a token’s use cases is just as exhilarating as it is terrifying.      The best token designs will, therefore, be those that incentivize customers to take a risk in adopting a new platform before it is clear that it is worth it, and they will be rewarded via increased token prices that will have future value based on how much token holders contribute to the company’s growth. As communities form around these network effects, token holders may be incentivized even further to evangelize on the company’s behalf, thanks to “ownership” rights and a sense of community involvement.      Tokenized ownership may be an effective way to reduce monopolies while still encouraging development and innovation. While companies and politicians fight, the solution may already be here.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/amazon-prime-membership-should-have-been-a-tokenized-asset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39fc292179e37d8bb52c0ecb062e5d0960893887-1700x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432331,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBx5h,1594918540,"Blockchain Bites: Twitter Hack Fallout, A New Way to 'Yield Farm' and a Hurricane-Proof CBDC","A Twitter hack, a new way to ""yield farm"" digital collectibles and why stablecoin use is on the rise in Hong Kong.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Dissent & Stablecoins Stablecoin usage has spiked in Hong Kong following the imposition of the national security law, which aims to quell opposition to China’s ruling class by giving the Communist Party power to freeze and confiscate assets from people or organizations. Crypto assets and encrypted communication tools are a way to resist financial surveillance and internet censorship. “Many people don’t believe they can trust the government or banks to keep their assets safe anymore,” said Brian Yim, a university student in the U.K. whose family is still in Hong Kong.      A Billion in Crime Over $1.4 billion worth of cryptocurrency thought to be tied to Ponzi schemes, dark web transactions and hacks have moved onto global exchanges from January to June, according to blockchain analysis firm PeckShield. Huobi, Binance, OKEx, ZB, Gate.io, BitMEX, Bithumb and Coinbase were among the exchanges analyzed. “The problem of the inflow of tainted cryptos has not been entirely put under regulation with strict enforcement,” the firm wrote in the report. “So anti-money laundering is considered as an important issue and then there’s no real follow-up. … But it’s a matter of time, not if, [until] the regulatory hammer will come [down].”      Hurricane-Proof Currency The Bahamas’ central bank said it is “progressing” toward the full launch of a mobile phone-based digital currency (CBDC) it’s betting can withstand the battering of a Category 5 hurricane. The move comes in the wake of Hurricane Dorian last September, which devastated the island’s banking and financial infrastructure, according to the report. “Mobile phone coverage, by contrast, was generally restored within a few days after Dorian,” it said. The central bank’s CBDC effort, known as Project Sand Dollar, is currently in the testing phase on the island of Abaco.      Not a LEND, a Raise Framework Ventures and Three Arrows Capital announced Wednesday a $3 million investment in Aave, the firm behind the third-largest lending platform in decentralized finance (DeFi). The two funds purchased Aave's native LEND tokens directly from the company. LEND has appreciated 1,200% on a year-to-date basis. ""We believe there will be a significant market shift of private borrow/lend activity moving to decentralized money market protocols,"" Framework Ventures' Michael Anderson said.      Farming Digital Collectibles Rarible, a dapp that enables users to create and market non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will begin keeping track of all transactions on the site in order to reward users each week with its new governance token: RARI. Approximately 60% of the total supply will go to Rarible users who make trades, and anyone who holds NFTs now will be able to claim some. This move opens the door to yield farming digital collectibles on the Ethereum blockchain. “Yield farming has turned decentralized finance (DeFi) into the juggernaut of crypto earnings here in mid-2020, but one non-DeFi startup believes its users will also be interested in earning a new governance token for making trades,” CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports.    Quick bites  Microsoft partners with Waves to tokenize industrial assets, which might include anything from heavy machinery to basic office equipment.  Man charged with defrauding $4.5 million in crypto to fund gambling habit.  The big read    All that for 12.9 BTC.      Wednesday, a coordinated hack hit Twitter, compromising the primary bullhorn of political, cultural and economic thought. Beginning with an assault on known crypto trader @AngeloBTC asking for bitcoin to join a private Telegram channel, the attack spread to other prominent crypto institutions.      More prominent crypto accounts followed. Binance, Gemini. Coinbase, CoinDesk and Justin Sun, among others, were hit, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. Emboldened, the crypto scam, went mainstream, affecting a litany of high-profile Twitter users, including some who wield tremendous political power and others who are responsible for our exuberant stock market.      The attack sowed the seeds of confusion, even if it wasn’t financially successful. As of Thursday morning, a Bitcoin address associated with the hack has only brought in less than $120,000 from 378 transactions, many of which are believed to be sent from the hacker itself, in an obvious attempt to create the illusion of activity.      Not much is known about the hacker, who reportedly goes by the handle “Kirk,” or his access point to Twitter. Vice reported the attacker gained access to an internal Twitter tool, which enabled him to send tweets and reset the associated email addresses of affected accounts.      Twitter, in a message broadcasted two hours after the initial hit, called it “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”      That much is known. What’s unclear is the hacker’s motivations. Nic Carter, a prominent crypto personality, said over a Telegram DM, “There’s so much we don't know yet, but I’m inclined to apply Hanlon’s Razor and assume they were just trying to make some dough.”      “The delta between the damage wrought and the apparent financial gain is shockingly large though,” he continued.      From at least one known address, only 87 transactions were larger than $1. Only 69 were larger than $10. Only 24 were larger than $100. Only eight were larger than $1000, according to CoinDesk’s Adam B. Levine. He crunched the numbers and found if you compare the number of addresses that sent more than a dollar against President Obama's 120 million followers alone, the success rate was a piddling 0.0000000725.      With numbers like that, many are asking, What was the point? At this point, it can be safely assumed the attacker was familiar with the crypto community. The use of a new SegWit address, repeated transactions to empty the wallet down to 6.15 Bitcoin – a known meme – as well as several renamed wallet addresses with cryptic messages like “1BitcoinisTraceabLe…, 1YouTakeRiskWhenUseBitcoin and 1WhyNotMonero…” point to the possibility of this being an elaborate troll.      Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and the former chief security officer at Facebook, told the New York Times the hacker “made rookie mistakes.” The biggest was that by sending identical messages it was easy to identify and neutralize the scam posts.      Stamos also noted that in choosing Bitcoin, which creates a public record of all transactions, the attacker basically nullified its ability to cash out.      So what does this mean for Bitcoin? Well. It’s part of the public conversation again, for one. Prominent New York Magazine reporter Josh Barro tweeted, “You know, we wouldn’t have to worry about this sort of thing if cryptocurrency was illegal.”      While this take reinforces existing biases against crypto being associated with criminals, it is shared by other mainstream publications and a swath of the public. Stephen Colbert, tweeted, “Thankfully, my Twitter was not hacked, because of the rock-solid cyber-security I recently purchased for just $12,000 in bitcoin and my social security number. Thanks @cyberscambelarus!”      Within the crypto industry, some say this could be neutral to good for crypto. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, told First Mover: “Even if there is a small percentage of bitcoin that is used for illicit activity, investors now understand this is no different than cash, except that digital currencies are much more traceable.”      And the strong measures taken by exchanges like Coinbase to blacklist the address early, does show how far the industry has come to meet the basic demands of the traditional financial system.      The larger question is less about crypto itself and whether Bitcoin is mainstreamed as a payment or reserve system than about its ideological underpinnings. This hack, like the Equifax one before it, is one movement in a leitmotif running through the public consciousness: Why do we trust centralized, near-immovable authorities to shape our lives?      “A hack like this demonstrates how desperately needed privacy and data security legislation is needed in the U.S. Securing one's network is not a profit maker, it's a loss leader, and companies won't do it right until there is some liability attached to not doing so,” Gigi Sohn, a former counselor at the Federal Communications Commission, said via email to CoinDesk.      As Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal put it: “If this happened because someone got access to Twitter’s admin tools, that means it’s not a cryptocurrency incident. It’s a centralized point of failure incident.”    Market intel    Volatility or Bust Bitcoin’s characteristically high volatility could return soon, giving exhausted traders an end to months of abnormally calm price action. A new metric for on-chain activity makes this prediction by measuring exchange volumes and on-chain transaction volume together to derive a signal for inflection points in bitcoin volatility. Published to popular charting interface TradingView on Tuesday, the volume ratio aims to derive market sentiment as a function of both types of volume. When overlaid with price data, high on-chain transaction volume dominance over exchange volume frequently corresponds with imminent, significant price movements, or volatility.      Options: Grim Still, short-term sentiment in the options market has flipped bearish. Bitcoin fell to $9,070 this morning, reversing the 2.5% rise to $9,450 seen last week, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Reflecting the downward trend, the one-month put-call skew for bitcoin options, a metric that measures the price of (bearish) put options relative to (bullish) call options, has risen to 4.9%, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.    Tech pod    DeFi Oracle OKCoin has launched a new API feed for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space that has already been picked up by lender Compound. The San Francisco-based exchange said Wednesday that OKCoin Oracle would provide on-chain data for DeFi products and features. Rival oracle system ChainLink works broadly along the same lines, although it rewards third-party entities with LINK tokens for providing accurate data, and takes them away again when they don't. San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase unveiled its own price feed plugin for the DeFi space in April.      Privacy Fork Privacy coin Zcash has successfully hard forked in the planned network update “Heartwood.” With the update, miners can receive coinbase transactions right to a private address, effectively adding privacy to the blockchain’s security protocol. The hard fork occurred on July 16 at 10:58 UTC at block height 903,000, according to the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the for-profit development house behind the project, which was also supported by the Zcash Foundation. The fork also adds support for lightweight clients that verify transactions.    Opinion    Democratizing Digital Dollars Transparent Systems’ Chief Legal Officer Patrick Murck and Global Head of Policy Linda Jeng reflect on the democratic possibilities a digital dollar can open by reducing economic inequality. “Beyond governance, community-based ownership would allow the economic gains of the network to be equitably shared among all participants and not reserved for those who have access to capital and connections,” they write.

42432312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBwdh,1594914550,ConsenSys Accused of Stealing Payment Startup’s Code for Rival Service,"An Ethereum-based payments project claims in a new lawsuit that ConsenSys abused its position of trust as an investor to access trade secrets and create a rival offering.    BlockCrushr filed a complaint Tuesday alleging ConsenSys misappropriated its intellectual property to create a rival version of its payments system that allows recurring transactions, such as monthly payments, on the Ethereum blockchain.  A ConsenSys spokesperson told CoinDesk they did not usually comment on ongoing legal proceedings but expressed ""severe disappointment that such baseless claims are even being filed.""  Per the filing, ConsenSys Ventures invested $100,000 into BlockCrushr and invited the firm to participate in that year's Tachyon Accelerator program.  As part of the agreement, BlockCrushr said it shared its intellectual property, including 120,000 lines of source code, to help ConsenSys guide and support it.  Between October 2018 and February 2019, BlockCrushr said, ConsenSys had requested over 20 meetings to talk in depth about the payments system.  BlockCrushr, which is based in Canada, shared information because it was promised further investment, the filing states.  The startup said Vincente Hernandez, a developer with Token Foundry, another ConsenSys project, was present at many meetings.  The complaint alleges Hernandez put some of BlockCrushr's publicly available code in his own GitHub.  He is said to have became a founding member of Daisy Payments (now CodeFi), another recurring payment system, a few weeks later.  In February 2019, ConsenSys allegedly ceased communications with BlockCrushr and didn't return its calls.  As ConsenSys was still an investor, BlockCrushr says it informed the company privately that its payments system would launch on Aug. 23, 2019.  On Aug. 22, ConsenSys launched Daisy Payments, which BlockCrushr claims is a near-identical offering to its own.  BlockCrushr claims it was forced to cancel its own launch as a result.  CodeFi is now used as the foundation for ConsenSys' new staking service.  According to the filing, ConsenSys employees, including CEO Joe Lubin, said there was a firewall issue and that some of BlockCrushr's proprietary information may have been used by other teams.  However, BlockCrushr said no action was taken and communications stopped soon after.  The startup is now formally accusing ConsenSys of two counts of misappropriating trade secrets and one count of a breach of contract, and is suing for damages.

In an announcement emailed to CoinDesk, the firm said Fabric Ventures and a former member of the German national soccer team, Andre Schurrle, had also invested in the firm.      Using the Ethereum blockchain, Sorare generates unique digital trading cards representing professional soccer players that can be traded by users. A user plays as the team manager and can use their five cards to compete in the weekly league competitions.      Recently, Sorare announced licensing partnerships with the U.S. soccer league, MLS, and the South Korean K-League, bringing both leagues onto its platform. According to the firm’s CEO, Nicolas Julia, the two agreements helped the firm add about 3,500 new users to its platform.      Read more: US Soccer Players Can Be Collected, Traded in Tokenized Fantasy Game      ""We've had major traction, essentially targeting the 'crypto-enthusiast' potential users,"" said Julia, noting that over the next few months the firm would focus on building a better free-to-play experience and also improve the platform for fiat users. ""It's important for us that they can play without needing to install MetaMask and buying ether,” he added, referring to a popular wallet extension.      Users on Sorare’s platform can also buy tokens representing other soccer players to improve their team and – depending on how the players perform in real life – they might receive rewards in ether or more trading cards.      “When COVID hit, we thought that it would be the end of something like Sorare,” said Max Mersch, co-founder of Fabric Ventures, pointing out how the platform largely depends on live soccer games which were suspended as different countries went into lockdown. Fabric Ventures has also previously invested in Ethereum-enabled virtual reality game Decentraland.      Read more: The People of Decentraland Will Greet You Now      Introduced to the platform first as a player himself, Mersch said the firm’s replay model, allowing players to reenact matches from past seasons, helped keep players gaming. He added that it was also quite impressive to see the amount of money people were willing to spend to get these digital cards. According to Sorare, sales on its platform touched $350,000 in June of this year.      “I was immediately impressed with the vision for the future of football collectibles: digital cards of football players,” said Schurrle in the emailed statement. Part of Germany’s World Cup-winning team in 2014, Schurrle was removed from the German soccer club Dortmund’s squad recently, according to a report by The Sun.      According to Sorare, the scarcity of its tokens is what makes the tokens valuable, and they are likely to appreciate in value if a player performs well.      Counting on the growing traction blockchain-enabled games have been receiving recently, Julia said the firm would use the money raised to expand its team and get closer to its ambition of getting “the top 20 leagues with all their clubs licensed"" onto its platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MANA | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/blockchain-enabled-fantasy-soccer-firm-sorare-raises-4m-in-seed-fund-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54ba741c1b53efcf5a99dda35b3f2a422a4f7943-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBx9h,1594904595,"After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever","CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on public blockchains. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      The dust is still settling, but July 15, 2020, already looks to be one of the worst days in Twitter’s 14-year history. A devastating hack, apparently taking advantage of internal tools, enabled hackers to take control of dozens of high-profile accounts and solicit bitcoin donations. Noteworthy was the delta between the scale of the attack and the financial reward; the hackers brought a $28 billion company to its knees but appear to have collected a paltry $120,000 in bitcoin.      The real fallout will be reputational. Details are still fuzzy, but one must imagine that the hackers may have had access to private communications for accounts that they penetrated. The contents of these DMs could easily be weaponized, either for extortion or embarrassment. While this particular crew of hackers seems to have operated in a fairly haphazard manner, starting with accounts on crypto Twitter and moving up the supply chain to Bill Gates and Elon Musk, a more sophisticated and determined group could have wreaked absolute havoc had it wanted.      Read More: Full Coverage of Twitter Hack 2020      And the hits just kept coming. Twitter’s response was slow and shambolic. The period of anarchy lasted several hours. Twitter personnel were undoubtedly aware but were either unable or unwilling to shut down the platform during the turmoil, as they should have. Verified accounts were unable to post for hours afterwards.      The blows to Twitter’s reputation are multifaceted. High-profile accounts were embarrassed and associated with scams, regardless of any security measures they may have taken. If Motherboard’s reporting that the hack relied on assistance from an insider is accurate, Twitter’s controls look exceptionally weak.    'Trusted third parties are security holes' isn’t just a slogan; it’s a concept that millions of people will have intuitively grasped for the first time yesterday.    Twitter will undoubtedly face questions from governments over this failure. Already, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley has demanded answers from CEO Jack Dorsey. The Trump administration will likely see another means to apply pressure to Twitter, aggrieved by Twitter’s aggressive fact-checking. From now on, many users will not feel comfortable sharing information via DM, mindful of potential future hacks. It’s ironic that the same day as the hack, Twitter rolled out new DM features designed to make the experience more akin to Facebook Messenger.      And perhaps most damning, leaked screenshots revealed more information about Twitter’s secretive abilities to control accounts and narratives on the site. The leaked internal dashboards (evidence of which Twitter is aggressively deleting from the site) contain keywords like “trends blacklist” and “search blacklist,” seemingly an admission that Twitter does exercise some editorial judgment when it comes to which concepts receive algorithmic boosting and which don’t.      The hack plainly illuminates issues that cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 enthusiasts have been raising for years. “Trusted third parties are security holes” isn’t just a slogan; it’s a concept that millions of people will have intuitively grasped for the first time yesterday. The sheer centralization at play evidenced by the godmode key is striking.      One wonders why it’s even possible in the first place for Twitter employees to commandeer any account on the platform. Everyone knows that Twitter is the political discussion platform of choice for world leaders. Had the attacker been more inclined towards chaos rather than entrepreneurship, they could have used their access to contrive an international incident among hostile nations. While hacks of centralized services are standard fare these days, rarely are they broadcasted in such a direct, explosive manner in real time.      Additionally, the accidental reveal of Twitter’s long-rumored deboosting tools will intensify the view among critics that Twitter is a partisan, editorializing service rather than the neutral one it claims to be. The gradual insertion of more discretion into the internet’s most vibrant discussion forum is a recipe for disaster. As many have pointed out, it invites governments to pressure or infiltrate the platform to obtain efficient tools to control speech. These aren’t conspiracies; it’s a matter of public record that former Twitter employees have been caught spying for Saudi Arabia and that a current Twitter executive also happens to work for the British Army’s information warfare unit. How many more Twitter employees are proxies of foreign states seeking to gain enormous leverage by nudging the platform in a favorable direction?      Ultimately, there’s no assurances Jack Dorsey can provide to guarantee his platform will be free from future interference or capture. He has simply created too big a honeypot. Twitter is a platform with well over 300 million monthly active users globally. It has also been aggressively pursuing more controls alongside algorithmic (rather than chronological) timelines, more fact checking and more direct intervention in trending topics. All of these measures constitute an efficient toolkit to control speech. What more could a despot intent on censuring discourse want?      In response, many, including myself, have argued social media handles, as well as user-contributed content, ought to be understood as property. This contrasts with the established model in which the platform controls and owns everything, and retains the discretion to both monetize user-contributed content and kick users off the platform for any reason. The digital squatters rights argument holds that users generating the value for the platform, and by enclosing a handle and mixing it with their labor, should be entitled to a lasting and well-codified claim. Censorship and bans are better understood as expropriation and eminent domain.      Read more: Nic Carter - Your Property Rights Should Extend to Social Media      Mindful of the current balance of power between users and platforms, such an arrangement is unlikely to emerge within the current crop of internet oligarchs. Instead, it’s more likely that a wholesale reimagining of social platforms will need to take place.      For once, this use case represents a non-monetary application for public blockchains that makes sense. Social systems that piggyback on top of Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to genuinely own their online selves through public key cryptography. This is more fragile at the individual layer, since key loss is a threat, but far more robust globally.      It’s impossible to compromise every Urbit or Blockstack user because the actual user registry is stored on-chain and users custody their own keys. The Urbit philosophy, in which users can freely associate and disassociate with – but not ban – other accounts, allows for the coexistence of mutually rancorous individuals without relying on top-down censorship.      Granted, such blockchain-based social systems are still immature despite years of work and advocacy, so their flaws are not yet fully evident. But as of yesterday, we can no longer claim they are a solution searching for a problem. A user-owned and operated social internet built on a public key infrastructure is an absolute necessity, if we are to resist tyrants both in the public and the private sector.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/16/after-the-twitter-hack-we-need-a-user-owned-internet-more-than-ever,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77c10bb26d890c27a1c4558fb6bed5c1c52c8cf4-1700x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But a new report suggests bitcoin's original core payments function might be increasingly fulfilled by a competing faction of digital tokens – so-called stablecoins like tether and USD coin, which have values linked to the price of the U.S. dollar.      Stablecoins, invented five years ago, have expanded rapidly this year, doubling in the past four months to an outstanding supply of about $12 billion.      Cryptocurrency traders use them as the de facto form of liquidity in digital-asset markets, to move money between exchanges and park cash on the sidelines. Investors can lend out the dollar-linked tokens for yields up to 13%, more than 20 times the level on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. Some holders might simply want U.S. dollars as a safe haven as the coronavirus roils the global economy.      Recently, though, more people might be using stablecoins to send each other payments, according to a report this week published jointly by cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp and research firm Coin Metrics.      The analysts noted that the daily transfer value of stablecoins recently surged past $2 billion, while bitcoin's slid to just below $2 billion. Global remittances and cross-border payments are a ""natural use case for stablecoins given their ease of international transfer,"" they wrote.      ""It feels like a little bit of a paradigm shift, especially now that stablecoins are exploding,"" Nate Maddrey, a senior research analyst at Coin Metrics, said in a phone interview.      The sudden popularity of stablecoins could raise knotty questions over the utility of bitcoin, which is the oldest cryptocurrency, at 11 years, and the biggest by far, at a market capitalization of $170 billion.      Maddrey believes bitcoin's value proposition has changed over the years: Many investors are buying it because they see the cryptocurrency as a store of value, similar to gold, and as the linchpin of the world's most secure blockchain network. Because of its capped supply, bitcoin is often posited as a hedge against inflation and central-bank money printing.      ""I don't really see a path where bitcoin becomes a true medium of exchange,"" Maddrey said.      The rise of stablecoins marks a new chapter in fast-moving and ever-evolving cryptocurrency markets. A thousand flowers are blooming as entrepreneurs unveil semi-autonomous ""decentralized finance"" projects, financial firms prepare to tokenize traditional assets like U.S. Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange contracts, and Facebook pushes forward with its own digital token, Libra. PayPal, the payments company, has told the European Commission it's developing cryptocurrency capabilities.      Countries around the world are developing their own tokens, known as central bank digital currencies, or CDBCs, which could eventually provide another option for peer-to-peer payments. Just this week, reports have emerged that both Japan and the U.K.are considering digital versions of their currencies.      While the Federal Reserve has yet to unveil its own version, some countries with exchange rates pegged or closely linked to the dollar might be able to create CBDCs that work like proxies for the U.S. tender.      That might curb the appetite for stablecoins, many of them issued by upstart companies with scant corporate transparency and untested creditworthiness.      ""Would you rather I sent you a stablecoin or a CBDC backed by a sovereign nation whose currency is pegged to the dollar?"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Diginex, said in a video interview. ""I'd rather receive a sovereign-backed CBDC.""      Blockforce Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm based in San Diego, wrote Wednesday in a monthly investor update that, at least for now, there's good money to be made from lending out or depositing stablecoins.      ""Stablecoins are proving their utility in the digital-asset ecosystem,"" according to the email. ""Our traditional finance friends are often shocked to hear that as interest rates sink lower and even negative in some cases, we manage to earn close to 8% as we lend out stablecoins to high-quality counterparties.""      On the other hand, holding stablecoins is essentially the reverse of betting on assets that are denominated in dollars, from stocks to bonds to oil and bitcoin. The Federal Reserve this year has pumped nearly $3 trillion of freshly created dollars into financial markets, propping up asset prices.  ""Holding dollars is no fun when assets are mooning,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in an email.      But, hey, maybe some people might just want to send stablecoins to a pal.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,085 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,253 | 24-Hr Low: $9,048      Trend: Bitcoin is edging lower on Thursday, with the four-hour chart indicating a failed breakout and fresh bearish lower-highs setup.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,080, representing a 1.3% decline on the day.      A falling channel represented by trendlines connecting June 1 and 22 highs and June 2 and 15 lows was breached to the higher side on July 8. As such, the cryptocurrency was expected to chart a minor rally toward resistance at $9,800 (June 22 high).      Instead, the cryptocurrency has ended up charting fresh bearish lower highs, as represented by the trendline connecting July 8 and 13 highs (yellow line). In addition, prices fell back inside the bearish channel early on Thursday – a sign of failed breakout. Chart analysts consider failed breakouts as strong bearish signals.      Indicators, too, are beginning to realign in favor of the bears. The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, is producing deeper bars below the zero line. It indicates the downward move may gather pace. Meanwhile, on the daily chart, the histogram has crossed into bearish territory below zero.      Bitcoin may dive below $9,000 and test support at $8,830 (June 28 high). On the higher side, a high-volume move above $9,350 is needed to revive the case for a rally to $9,800.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/first-mover-boring-bitcoin-shrugs-off-twitter-hack-as-stablecoins-co-opt-satoshis-dream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a34c42cefd545d4695952d7a80ac21f54908df2-1500x882.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to $9,070 soon before press time, reversing the 2.5% rise to $9,450 seen last week, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  Prices are now closing on the lower end of the multi-week-long trading range of $9,000–$10,000.  Reflecting the downward trend, the one-month put-call skew for bitcoin options, a metric that measures the price of (bearish) put options relative to (bullish) call options, has risen to 4.9%, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  The positive number indicates short-term put options are drawing higher prices than calls.  Traders, the data suggests, are making speculative bets to the downside or are hedging against a potential bearish move (that is, buying puts against long positions in the spot market), Shaun Phoon, senior trader at QCP Capital, told CoinDesk.  The one-month skew was hovering at lows below -7% a week ago, indicating stronger demand for call options – a sign of bullish bias in the options market.  While the one-month skew is now more bearish, the six-month skew remains below zero or bullish.  Demand for call options expiring in December is still higher than that for puts.

42432289,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBrzh,1594897192,Zcash Latest Hard Fork 'Heartwood' Makes Mining Private,"Privacy coin zcash has successfully hard forked in the planned network update “Heartwood.” With the update, miners can receive coinbase transactions right to a private address, in addition to other new features.      The hard fork occurred on July 16 at 10:58 UTC at block height 903,000, according to the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the for-profit development house behind the project. An uncontentious hard fork, Heartwood was supported by both the ECC and Zcash Foundation.      Read more: Zcash’s Funding Vote and the Woes of Decentralized Governance      The update includes two Zcash Improvement Proposals (ZIPs). The first, “Shielded Coinbase” (ZIP 213) brings long-sought privacy solutions for Zcash (ZEC) mining while ZIP 221 “Flyclient” adds support for lightweight clients that verify transactions, the ECC said in a March blog.      As a hard fork, the updates are backward incompatible, meaning all nodes must sync to the new software in order to use the Zcash blockchain.      Heartwood is the privacy coin’s fourth hard fork since the network launched in late 2016. Zcash last hard forked in December 2019 with “Blossom.”      ""The Zcash Foundation is excited to support the Heartwood Zcash upgrade alongside the ECC, and thrilled that users will soon be able to connect to the Zcash network using Zebra, an alternate, consensus-compatible Zcash implementation built by the Foundation,” Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati said in an email to CoinDesk.      (Zebra is an alternative Zcash client written in Rust).    Private coinbase transactions    Shielded coinbase transactions allow miners to claim coinbase transactions – the reward for processing transactions – directly to Zcash’s shielded addresses. Shielded addresses obfuscate information such as amounts, addresses and the encrypted memo field.      Implementing private coinbase transactions has been on the Zcash roadmap since the project’s early days. It was made possible by earlier technical updates found in 2018’s Sapling hard fork, according to the ECC.      “With this feature, when a mining pool or solo miner chooses to move coinbase rewards, [its] now private. For example, a mining pool can perform shielded payouts to miners in a shielded transaction,” ECC CTO Nathan Wilcox said in an email to CoinDesk.    Flyclient    Flyclient allows users to verify transactions with the smallest amount of information possible. Similar to Bitcoin Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes, the spec proves the knowledge of a transaction using only the block header, rather than the full content of the block.      The ZIP has a few positive consequences for developers: It gives easier access to cross-chain interoperability, such as with the Ethereum network, and provides protection for light clients. The ECC announced plans to build interoperability projects with the second-largest blockchain by market cap, Ethereum, at DevCon 5 this past October.      Read more: Zcash Will Get a Gateway Into Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem      “Right now, you need a Zcash full node to get full privacy.

The top 10 crypto exchanges to have received these ""high-risk"" assets include popular platforms Huobi, Binance, OKEx, ZB, Gate.io, BitMEX, Bithumb and Coinbase, the China-based firm said in a report released Tuesday.      “The data highlights the current compliance challenge crypto exchanges face,” according to the report.      PeckShield said its analysis was based on over 100 million blockchain addresses it has labeled and tracked over the course of a year, including top-5 crypto assets including bitcoin, ether and tether.      Among these addresses, the firm identified many associated with Ponzi schemes, dark web transactions and hacks, as well as illegal online gambling operations that use cryptocurrencies as funding rails.      The analysis suggests that various cryptocurrencies – equaling 147,000 bitcoin or over $1.4 billion in value at press time – have ended up in wallets on global exchanges.      Separately, as of June 30, nearly $1.6 billion worth of crypto assets from these high-risk addresses have entered cryptocurrency mixer services, after which they may end up at exchanges. Coin mixers obfuscate the source of transactions on-chain.      In a followup report released Thursday, the firm revealed a chart with its data that shows Huobi, Binance and OKEx received the bulk of the tainted crypto transactions.      ""The problem of the inflow of tainted cryptos has not been entirely put under regulation with strict enforcement,"" the firm wrote in the report. ""So anti-money laundering is considered as an important issue and then there's no real follow-up. ... But it's a matter of time, not if, [until] the regulatory hammer will come [down].""

The San Francisco-based exchange said Wednesday that OKCoin Oracle would provide on-chain data for DeFi products and features.  As a liquid and regulated trading platform, OKCoin said its cryptographically signed price feed would be accurate, adding it would also verify and guarantee the data's reliability.  San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase unveiled its own price feed plugin for the DeFi space in April.  Like Coinbase's, OKCoin's feed has been incorporated into the oracle system launched last August by Compound.  Known as the Open Price Feed System, Compound's oracle relies on data providers to effectively share data on-chain.  Rival oracle system ChainLink works broadly along the same lines, although it rewards third-party entities with LINK tokens for providing accurate data, and takes them away again when they don't.  OKCoin was founded by Star Xu in 2013; the crypto exchange OKEx spun out of it in 2017.

A criminal complaint filed July 9 at the U.S. Attorney's Office charges Douglas Jae Woo Kim, who is based in New York, with wire fraud, alleging he conned three investors out of more than $4.5 million worth of bitcoin and ether.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) claims Kim told investors he was a cryptocurrency trader and asked for loans for a low-risk investment he claimed he had already invested $300,000 to $400,000 into.  The DOJ alleges that after receiving the funds, Kim sent either all or a substantial amount to offshore crypto gambling websites, Nitrogen Sports and Fairlay.  Between October 2017 and May 2020, the complaint says Kim convinced three investors to transfer a total of 123 bitcoin (~$1.1 million), 15,252 ether ($3.5 million), as well as approximately $30,000 in USD.  Although Kim promised loans would be repaid with high-levels of interest, the DOJ says that most of the bitcoin and all of the ETH has yet to be refunded.  Only one investor, so far, has been fully repaid.  Per an affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), none of the investors had any idea their money was being used on gambling sites.  The FBI also says Kim has been trying to convince new investors for loans since February 2020.  The DOJ has charged Kim with one count of wire fraud; he appeared before magistrates to face the charge on Wednesday.  If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 penalty.

Starting with cryptocurrency firms like Coinbase, Gemini and Binance – and even CoinDesk – and moving on to big names including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Elon Musk, the hackers were somehow able to post from the accounts offering a fake crypto giveaway.  Twitter has yet to provide a breakdown of how the mass attack was carried out, but says it's working on it.  Speaking to CoinDesk's managing director of content products, Joon Ian Wong, Binance's CZ said that while the bitcoin giveaway scam was rudimentary in its approach, it was a sign of how important strong security is for the industry.  CZ, whose account was also breached, said Twitter offers ""limited security options"" and the options that are available are a ""little weak.""  He said he became aware of his own account being compromised after other high-profile accounts came under attack.  Twitter does provide two-factor authentication (2FA), but that seems to have been bypassed in the attack. Many of the affected accounts, including CoinDesk's, had 2FA activated.  In the event of a hack where crypto funds are stolen from either individuals or exchanges, Binance seeks to blacklist the attacker's addresses in coordination with other exchanges in order to deter future thefts, according to CZ.  Everyone in the community needs to work together and collaborate in order to ""fight back"" against bad actors in the space, he said.  Despite the hack of his and Binance's accounts, CZ said Twitter is still his preferred social media platform due to its design and reach.  He had not yet regained control over his Twitter account at time of the interview.

42432305,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBsPh,1594872709,Twitter Hack Used Bitcoin to Cash In: Here's Why,"Someone hacked Twitter Wednesday – and used bitcoin to capitalize on it.      Why?      Bitcoin is an alternative money system based on the value of censorship resistance. In other words, Bitcoin was built from the ground up to evade third-party interference (think banks, governments and law enforcement), making it a natural tool in the hands of a world-class hacker.      Read more: Why Use Bitcoin?      Bitcoin’s value proposition can be broken into a few categories, all based on the technology under the hood.    Once the hacker gets it, it’s theirs    Bitcoin is electronic. A popular meme for bitcoin is “magic internet money,” which, in a sense, it is. Bitcoin operates natively online – you can send bitcoin from your phone or computer to anyone else, just about anywhere in the world, in a few clicks, without anyone being able to stop you. And once you’ve sent it, you can’t get it back.      Read more: Twitter Breach Reactions: Security Professionals Offer an Early Assessment      That feature – or in this case, a bother – is a prime reason the Bitcoin blockchain exists. Bitcoin relies on what are called Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions so it can't be confiscated by middlemen such as law enforcement. Once the coins are in someone else's wallet, count them as good as gone.    Bitcoin is pseudonymous    Like many Twitter handles, Bitcoin is pseudonymous. We can’t link an address to a personal identity very easily.      Stolen U.S. dollars (USD), on the other hand, would be near impossible to get into and out of a bank account without being flagged. Traditionally, money is moved from one account to another through a third party.      Legacy systems have the upside of being able to reverse transactions and attach identities to them. That is clearly a disadvantage to hackers. (Notably, reports surfaced of the hacker running a similar campaign on CashApp for USD). Bitcoin transactions, by comparison, are a lot harder to control.    Bitcoin is liquid    Bitcoin is also traded online in a lot of places. Holding bitcoins in your wallet wouldn’t be worth much without people to swap dollars for bitcoins. Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the most established and most highly traded digital asset. It’s also available on popular financial apps such as CashApp or PayPal.      Read more: Is Bitcoin Legal?      “It’s common sense that the attackers would choose bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most censorship resistant and liquid asset in existence,” Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in a private message.      All this to say the Twitter hacker chose the right cryptocurrency to get U.S. dollars.    But bitcoin can be tracked and traced    Addresses can be tracked, however. And they can also be blackballed by others. By nature, the Bitcoin blockchain is 100% transparent. That means the ins and outs of transactions from one party to another are viewable for all to see with a little know-how.      For example, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase would not allow users of its service to transfer funds to the Twitter hacker’s address.      Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis says the 12 or so bitcoins (worth about $110,000 at the time) the hacker netted are already on the move. But we can see where they are going. Some firms are even able to match “meatspace” identities with blockchain ones based on small details hackers overlook.      Having said that, there are tools available to people who really want to obfuscate their transactions, and whoever perpetrated this particular heist seems to be prepared to take measures to protect their loot.      At the end of the day, it’s important that people be wary of promises of free money on the internet – whether that comes in the form of dollars, pounds or bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/16/twitter-hack-used-bitcoin-to-cash-in-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/637588fc815b8d03266c1f9ab0932d0bf06cd41a-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A mass takeover of big-name celebrities including former Vice President Joe Biden, former U.S. President Barack Obama, Kanye West and Elon Musk saw their accounts compromised, starting at 19:00 UTC.  Twitter said in a series of tweets that hackers targeted ""some of"" its employees who had access to internal tools, which they used ""to take control of many highly visible (including verified) accounts and [t]weet on their behalf.""  The social media platform is looking into what else was impacted, while restoring accounts to their users.  Motherboard, VICE Magazine's tech section, said it spoke to two sources who took over accounts, who claimed they paid a Twitter insider to manage the takeovers.  Twitter being ""highly centralized"" led to the hack, said Ben Sigman, CTO at blockchain startup Make Sense Labs.  Twitter employees have ""godmode"" access to create tweets from any user, Sigman claimed.

Chainalysis told CoinDesk it is monitoring four wallets associated with the attack.  The most prevalent address received $120,000 in bitcoin from 375 transactions. Secondary addresses received $6,700 in bitcoin from 100 transactions. An XRP wallet netted nothing.  So far, a wallet whose associations are not yet known has received five bitcoin ($46,055) in total. “We are collaborating with our customers to find leads from this wallet,” Chainalysis spokesperson Maddie Kennedy said.  Part of the scam relied on hackers churning their own crypto between wallets to inflate the number of people who appeared to be chipping in, according to Chainalysis. The firm called the tactic “unsurprising.”  A Japanese wallet that sent scammers $40,000 in bitcoin appears to have been the single largest victim of the still-unexplained hack. International exchanges were generally the source of victims’ bitcoin, Chainalysis said.  No BTC has been cashed out to fiat just yet, the crypto-sleuthing firm added.
