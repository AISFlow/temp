42399459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDHd,1478287085,Overstock’s Blockchain Business Reports $3 Million Loss,"E-tailer Overstock.com reported a $3m pretax loss for the third quarter of this year tied to its ongoing work building a blockchain-based stock exchange.  Overstock reported a pre-tax loss of $3.9m for the third quarter, of which $3m arose from Medici, its blockchain-focused division. The figure was included in the firm’s Q3 results, released yesterday. Overall, the company said it incurred a net loss of $3.1m for the quarter.  The Utah-based company reported $441m in revenue, up 13% from the same period last year when the firm said it earned $391m.  The news comes just over two years after Overstock began setting the stage to launch tØ, the trading platform it formally unveiled in August 2015. The company would ultimately spend $8m that year on blockchain projects.  According to founder and CEO Patrick Byrne, the latest expenses were ""well worth it"".  He noted in a statement:  ""Our Medici business cost us $3m pre-tax this quarter, but that was well worth it as we achieve real progress in our blockchain and fintech initiatives that others have yet to demonstrate.""  Overstock has been pushing ahead with its plans, announcing this week that it has tapped Connecticut-based investment bank Source Capital Group, Inc to serve as dealer-manager for its planned stock offering via blockchain.  At the time, Overstock said it will sell as many as 1 million shares using the technology.

42399453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDCi,1478280909,Stolen Bitcoin? Anti-Theft Feature Gets Second Life on Sidechains,"At its core, bitcoin is about giving users better control of their money.  Often called ""programmable money"", bitcoin has scripts that limit how future bitcoin transactions can be spent (and that control variables like who can spend them). One such script ensures the correct person is spending the bitcoin by checking if the correct signature was used before unlocking and sending the funds.  This week, Blockstream core tech developer Russell O'Connor revealed he's been testing a couple of new scripts on an Elements Alpha sidechain (which is pegged to the bitcoin testnet) that could add new functionality.  Called ""covenants"", the new style of scripts potentially opens up possibilities for how bitcoin users can control, or restrict, spending of their money — possibly for their protection. (This is an idea that was previously explored by researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gun Sirer).  One use case for these scripts is to help users rein in their coins in the case of a hack (an all too common occurrence in bitcoin).  When asked what he thinks of the new covenant work, Eyal said it was potentially a boon to bitcoin users who may be worried about losing their bitcoins or otherwise having them compromised or stolen.  Eyal told CoinDesk:  ""It's also going to increase user-side security in a way that's invaluable.""  Extending bitcoin's scripts  The idea is notable as a script that can limit how bitcoins can be spent hasn't been implemented in bitcoin before, a fact noted by Eyal.  In particular, there are two new covenant scripts that Blockstream explored, each of which take parameters and outputs whether the script is valid, or whether or not the transaction is currently spendable based on its restrictions.  It's worth noting that bitcoin’s scripting system is currently quite simple for security's sake. There aren't limitless rules in bitcoin right now because new additions can be potentially dangerous and developers note that they take time to test.  This is where sidechains may come in handy, although they are not yet pinned to the main blockchain.  Bitcoin startup Blockstream has been working on these interoperable blockchains for experimenting with new features that could potentially be added to bitcoin since June of last year, and this is an example of how these new chains can be used to test new features.  These new proposed opcodes may work as the foundations for new functionalities, ones that could even come to help stop bitcoin exchanges and users from losing stolen funds.  Use cases  But while Blockstream is running with the idea, it began with researchers at Cornell.  In February, researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer proposed the idea of bitcoin vaults (implemented with their own version of covenants) where users could pull bitcoin back in the case of a hack. (It then gained new life following the hack on Bitfinex, in which the exchange lost nearly 120,000 BTC).  ""If the attacker can't gain control of the money, it takes away the motivation for stealing it in the first place,"" Eyal explained.  But he noted that these two requirements are often conflicting: if a user creates new keys to avoid losing them, that means it's easier for them to be stolen. Meanwhile, if you create a smaller number of total keys, it's easier to lose them.  While Blockstream tested vaults as a potential use case, there might be other future uses for the covenant scripts, including lending.  The idea seems to have been dormant for a while and developers were debating its viability even just a couple of months ago.  But these sidechain tests might mean a step towards implementation.  And while covenants and vaults had drawn some skepticism before (Peter Todd has questioned whether such a functionality should be built in the infrastructure layer of the code at Scaling Bitcoin), there seems to be optimism that it could work.  When asked if the new scripts were safe, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell responded:  ""Trivially so if implemented correctly.""

The China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), founded in the early 1990s, functions directly under the auspices of the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. As such, it functions as the platform for interbank trading between Chinese banks and those based abroad.  As part of the consortium, CFETS officials will work with other financial institutions worldwide on blockchain development initiatives.  Zaiyue Xu, executive vice president of CFETS, said in a statement:  “CFETS is committed to establishing technical standards and improving the ecosystem of China interbank market, and we have noticed that blockchain is an emerging technology with great promise to reshape the market.”  CFETS is the latest Chinese financial institution to join the R3 consortium this year. In May, Ping An Insurance Group became a member, followed by China Merchants Bank in September.

Zhong An Online P&C Insurance Co. announced today that it was creating a new technology-focused subsidiary that will develop products and services in the areas of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and blockchain. The firm has been described in the media as China's first online-only insurance company.  The new subsidiary will be building on progress that already exists today. Zhong An said that it is developing a platform for insurance transactions using ethereum as a basis. Further, Zhong An said it was working with local firms in Shanghai as part of the Shanghai Blockchain Industry Development Research Alliance.  The company said that is is also working with the Fudan University School of Computer Sciences and Technology on additional research efforts. Zhong An said that it would co-found a research and development lab alongside Fudan University staff, with a particular focus on security.  Zhong An CEO Jin Chen said in a statement:  ""Not only will we develop technology, but our aim is to make technology become a commercial driving force, to put it at the core of our business ecosystem.""  The launch is perhaps another example of the insurance firm flexing its financial muscle. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Zhong An was looking to raise as much as $2bn by going public. Zhong An was reportedly valued at $8bn in a then-recent funding round.

Overstock announced today that Connecticut-based investment bank Source Capital Group, Inc. will serve as dealer-manager for its planned blockchain-based stock offering.  In March, the e-commerce giant said that it would issue its own stock via blockchain, utilizing its tØ blockchain platform to facilitate trades. During an event last month, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said that trading of the stock could begin as early as mid-December.  Now, the company has divulged new details. According to Overstock, the e-commerce company is planning to offer as many as 1 million shares. Each of those shares, the company said, will have preferential rights to a 1 percent cumulative annual cash dividend. The subscription period for the share offering is set to begin on 15th November.  Overstock further explained:  “Overstock intends to offer up to 1 million shares of its preferred stock, and will give shareholders the opportunity to subscribe for shares of its Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred. Stockholders will also have an opportunity to subscribe for an alternative series of its preferred stock which will be economically identical to the Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred but will trade in the over-the-counter market.”  In statements, Byrne praised the team at Source Capital Group.  “The immediacy with which Source grasped the value of what we’re doing, from not only a business but from a historical point of view, made it clear that we’d found the right partner to take us through this offering,” he said.

42427139,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzY9h,1478261640,ICOs and Appcoins: A Blockchain VC's View,"Travis Scher is a bitcoin and blockchain investor at Digital Currency Group, and a former attorney working on M&A and corporate finance transactions.  In this opinion piece, Scher gives his personal view of the lately popular ICOs and appcoins, and offers a warning for potential investors.    Forward-thinking investors have thrown their support behind the movement, thought leaders have proclaimed that ICOs are turning the traditional venture capital model on its head, and bitcoin industry veterans have launched hedge funds to invest in blockchain tokens.  I expect this discussion and activity to gain momentum in 2017, but I remain skeptical.  As the most active investor in blockchain startups, we at Digital Currency Group are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growth of ICOs. So, over the course of 2016, I've taken a close look at what is actually happening in the market.  I've had conversations with dozens of entrepreneurs who have either considered or actually raised money via token sale, and I’ve spoken with many of the leading investors in these projects.  And, while I’m excited about blockchain’s long-term potential to enable new models for both financing and operating organizations, I believe that ICOs and appcoins are, broadly speaking, not an attractive investment nor are they likely to become one in the near-term.  Background    For the uninitiated, an ICO is a crowdsale of cryptographically secured blockchain tokens to fund the development and operation of one of three types of blockchain projects:      A platform-layer blockchain (such as ethereum or Lisk)  An organization that operates on a blockchain (known as a decentralized autonomous organization ('DAO'), or a centrally organized distributed entity ('CODE')  A decentralized application ('dapp') that runs on a platform-layer blockchain.      A token that fuels a dapp is sometimes referred to as an appcoin, while tokens that fuel DAOs and platform-layer blockchains are simply known as tokens or cryptocurrency.    In a typical ICO, new tokens are issued in a crowdsale in exchange for bitcoin or ether, and then, if sufficient demand exists, digital currency exchanges will make a market so they can be traded.    This new fundraising approach, while still in its infancy, is being hailed as a way to decentralize and disintermediate venture capital, creating new sources of funding for entrepreneurs and new investment opportunities for individuals.    Some blockchain entrepreneurs have been able to raise larger sums of money (with much less effort) via an ICO than would have been available to them in the venture capital market. Moreover, the broad distribution of a token can incentivize early investors to become advocates for, users of, or developers on a blockchain platform. Not surprisingly, more companies we are speaking with are considering a token sale to fund their businesses.    These are exciting developments, and ICOs and decentralized organizations may very well transform industries long-term.    However, in the midst of all this excitement, I believe it is important to be clear about what reality looks like today. And in my diligence, I’ve repeatedly encountered four issues that make investing in new tokens – at least for now – very unappealing compared to traditional VC investing:  Regulatory uncertainty  High valuations/over-capitalization  Lack of controls  Lack of business use cases.    I’ll touch on each in order.  Regulatory naivety    Firstly, the creators of these new tokens seem to broadly underestimate the regulatory risks associated with ICOs.    They often pay lip service to regulatory compliance, and unanimously proclaim that they are ""speaking with lawyers"" and will ""make sure"" their offering is compliant. But the reality is that most don’t seem to be taking the legal risks seriously.    Few of the entrepreneurs launching ICOs actually understand the Howey Test, which is used to determine if a transaction is a “security” subject to the SEC’s registration requirements. As an example, many falsely believe that incorporating outside of the US will place them outside of the scope of US law enforcement. And few have convincing answers as to why a new token, rather than bitcoin or ether, is necessary for their project to operate (and thus why their token is not merely crypto-equity).      The folks I've spoken with have been broadly dismissive of and naive about these risks. But unregistered ICOs may very well be deemed broadly illegal. I appreciate the ethos of asking for forgiveness rather than permission, but that does not mean investors should stick their heads in the sand.    While the limits of unregistered ICOs have not yet been defined, financial regulators tend to expand their jurisdiction where they can, and the scammy and opaque nature of some of the projects is likely to draw their attention. Having recently released the rules governing unregistered equity crowdfunding, they will likely be quick to clamp down on structures that they believe violate these rules.    Certainly if these blockchain projects turn out to create tremendous value without unreasonable risk to unsophisticated investors, the laws should adapt. But anybody who follows financial regulations knows that these laws usually do not evolve as they should.    Thus, investors in these tokens should understand that they could lose most or all of their investment in these projects with the swipe of a regulator's pen.  Easy money    Secondly, the implied ""valuations"" that these DAOs are raising at are, in my view, unjustified, and the amounts being raised in these token sales are alarming. Founders with ideas that would struggle to raise a $500,000 seed round from experienced venture capital funds are raising millions in token sales.    Some may view this as a good thing, with entrepreneurs able to cut out the elitist VC gatekeepers and get voluntarily funded by perfectly sovereign individuals who understand the entrepreneur's vision. I view it as a sign that the market is out of whack.    The only buyers in these token sales seem to be overly enthusiastic early bitcoin and ether holders who feel like they are playing with house money, and have no basis for determining the value of these projects or how much money they will need.    This situation may stabilize over time, but, at the current moment, this is not a market I would want to participate in. Even the most promising projects are likely to be massively overvalued and overcapitalized.  Lack of controls    Thirdly, I've been shocked by the lack of controls governing how the decentralized organizations issuing new tokens can use the proceeds of ICOs, and how revenues and/or profits associated with the projects are to be shared with token holders.    In many cases, it is totally unclear what rights the token holders have.  Promoters of these token sales probably have no legal fiduciary duties to use the proceeds of an ICO for the benefit of token holders, and they rarely lay out in advance how such proceeds will be used. Several of the companies I've spoken with are sitting on millions of dollars raised via ICO that they unilaterally control.    In most cases, nobody is really monitoring the use of funds, which might be held in fiat currency in a private bank account or in cryptocurrency in a multi-sig wallets. Fraud and scams are inevitable. And even the promoters with the best of intentions will be swayed by their self-interest and distorted incentives.    Some take solace in the notion that investors rights are ""coded"" into the project , but in practice the original promoters generally have the power to single-handedly alter or fork the code for their own benefit.    Corporate forms have weaknesses, but they have evolved over hundreds of years in conjunction with markets and common law to balance stakeholder incentives and manage agency problems.    I accept that DAOs can implement workable governance structures in theory, but it remains to be seen if they can do so in practice. A DAO is a smart contract, but is it an actual, binding legal contract between the parties, with sufficient investors protections? I think the answer today is no.  No business case    Fourthly, and perhaps most fundamentally, I have not yet come across a blockchain-based dapp that is providing a solution to a real problem on a significant scale. Is the market really demanding a decentralized Uber or more ways to gamble?    Dapps can theoretically provide lower costs, enhanced privacy, and greater security by cutting out middlemen. But privacy and security won’t drive mass adoption.  In my view, to really go mainstream, these dapps must provide meaningfully lower costs without compromising user experience – and providing a first-rate user experience will be extremely challenging without a normal organization consisting of responsible employees. Wikipedia has demonstrated that this is possible, but adding the blockchain adds another layer of complexity that must be tackled.    Even the rare dapps that have put forth a plausibly compelling value proposition have been marred by an overly complicated set of rules that may be inherent to the project’s decentralized nature.      This is not to say that a wildly successful dapp will never materialize. And failure, learning, and iteration will all come before success. But the current reality is that no dapp has resonated with real consumers, and many of the attributes that make blockchains fundamentally revolutionary also make it much harder for them to achieve mass adoption.    Conclusion    In spite of all the risks mentioned above, I might seriously consider a token sale if I were a blockchain entrepreneur today – ICOs are an easy way to raise money, and the broad distribution of one's token can create powerful momentum for your product.    Furthermore, I believe that open-source blockchain protocols may be transformative over the long-term, and am excited to witness and contribute to this development.    However, none of this will happen if the issues of regulation, valuation, and controls are not addressed, or if blockchain entrepreneurs fail to use these new protocols to solve actual problems in a user-friendly way. The reality is that these coin issuances are tremendously flawed today, and investors interested in ICOs and appcoins should proceed with caution.
