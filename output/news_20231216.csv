Based on this analysis, there is a feeling that things could soon begin to look up for MATIC. Polygon Could See Significant Rally Soon In a video shared on the Cheeky Crypto YouTube Channel, crypto analyst JB noted that MATIC has declined following Bitcoin’s pullback. However, this move is unexpected as he believes that the crypto token’s decline to the particular retracement area sets it up nicely for an upward move. Based on his projection, MATIC could rise to between $0.87 and $1.36. Related Reading: Bitwise Reveals Two Major Triggers That Will Send Bitcoin Price To $80,000 JB also factored in other things that could suggest that an upward move is imminent. He alluded to the stochastic level, which had initially suggested an overbought condition. However, it has sharply corrected indicating that there could be another push to the upside for MATIC. On the other hand, the crypto analyst was also wary of factors that could spell a move to the downside. One of them happens to be the volumes that are seen across various cryptocurrencies. JB stated the current volumes aren’t great, and this has weakened the prices of these crypto tokens. This could potentially hinder any projection of an upward move. Another is the possibility of MATIC losing the cross above the 200 EMA, as this suggests that a dump is imminent. Earlier in the video, JB had also emphasized the 5-wave pattern that was forming on different timeframes on the MATIC chart. The analyst seemed uncertain about whether or not the fifth wave was just forming. He noted that a push above $94.5 would suggest that the last wave is still to come. There is also the possibility that it could just be an A, B, and C pattern. Polygon price makes its way above $0.85 | Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com MATIC To $100 Still Possible Still analyzing MATIC’s price pattern on the charts, JB mentioned that he was still bullish on the crypto token ahead of the imminent bull market. He had previously mentioned a target of $100 for MATIC in the next bull run, and he is still standing by the projection. In fact, JB noted that a new structure forming on the charts suggests that the crypto token could rise higher than that. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise 800% To $5.5 – The Timeframe Will Shock You As part of this prediction, he sees MATIC being a “powerhouse” in the bull run and being one of the standout altcoins. One of the factors that he believes will contribute to MATIC’s dominance is the potential approval of the pending Ethereum Spot ETF applications. He believes that the crypto token could be a huge beneficiary, considering its role in the Ethereum ecosystem. At the time of writing, MATIC is trading at around $0.85, down over 1%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

21475795,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563986,1702753233,Learn How To Trade Bitcoin,"As a Bitcoin trader, the risks but also rewards are quite high, making it a captivating endeavor for those willing to delve into the world of digital currency trading. Bitcoin’s unique combination of volatility and potential for significant returns has captured the attention of traders globally. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to trade Bitcoin effectively, ensuring you are well-equipped with the knowledge to navigate this dynamic market. From the basics of Bitcoin trading strategies to identifying the best platform to trade Bitcoins, we will cover it all. What Is A Bitcoin Trader? A Bitcoin trader is an individual who participates in the cryptocurrency market by buying and selling Bitcoin with the aim of making a profit. Unlike long-term investors who may hold assets for longer periods, Bitcoin traders often engage in more frequent transactions. This can range from long-term positions, where they hold Bitcoin with the expectation of price appreciation, to a short-term day-trade, where they capitalize on the market’s volatility. Being a Bitcoin trader involves a deep understanding of the market trends, analysis of technical and fundamental indicators, and an ability to make informed decisions based on current market conditions. Successful Bitcoin traders use various strategies like day-trading, scalping, swing trading, and position trading, each requiring different skill sets and levels of market engagement. Moreover, being a Bitcoin trader means staying updated with the latest news and developments in the cryptocurrency world, as these can significantly impact market prices. Also, risk management is a crucial aspect of trading Bitcoin, as the market is known for its rapid price fluctuations. Why Trade Bitcoin? Trading Bitcoin has become increasingly popular for several compelling reasons. Firstly, Bitcoin offers exceptional volatility, which, while risky, provides unique opportunities for substantial profits. Secondly, Bitcoin operates 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets. This round-the-clock trading allows traders to react immediately to market news and global events. Another reason to trade Bitcoin is its potential for high returns. Bitcoin has shown a remarkable ability to increase in value over time, outperforming traditional investments over the past more than 14 years (since inception). Traders who can skillfully navigate the market’s ups and downs stand to gain significantly. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature also offers a degree of freedom from traditional financial institutions. This independence from central banks and governments appeals to traders who seek alternatives to traditional financial systems. Additionally, the increasing mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin by large companies like MicroStrategy or financial service providers like BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have added legitimacy to its trading. As more people use and invest in Bitcoin, its market grows, providing more trading opportunities and liquidity. How To Trade Bitcoin: Everything You Need To Know Trading Bitcoin effectively requires a solid understanding of the market and a well-thought-out strategy. The process begins with setting up a trading account on a cryptocurrency exchange or platform. Once your account is set up and funded, you can start trading. Here’s a basic overview: Market Analysis: Before any trade, it’s crucial to analyze the market. This involves studying price charts, understanding market trends, and keeping up-to-date with the latest news that could impact Bitcoin’s price. Choosing A Trading Strategy: Depending on your goals and risk tolerance, choose a trading strategy that suits you best. This could be day trading, swing trading, scalping, or long-term investing. Risk Management: Decide on your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Effective risk management is key to sustainable trading. Executing Trades: Based on your analysis and strategy, buy or sell Bitcoin. This can be done through market orders (buy/sell at current price) or limit orders (buy/sell at a predetermined price). Monitoring And Adjusting: Continuously monitor the market and adjust your strategies as needed. Bitcoin’s market can change rapidly, and flexibility can be a significant advantage. Learning And Evolving: Always be open to learning. The Bitcoin market is constantly evolving, and staying informed is crucial for successful trading. Bitcoin Trading Strategies When it comes to trading Bitcoin, employing the right strategy is crucial for success. Each trader’s approach may vary based on their risk appetite, investment size, and trading goals. In this section, we’ll introduce various Bitcoin trading strategies that are commonly used in the market. Day-Trade Bitcoin Day-trading Bitcoin is a fast-paced strategy focused on taking advantage of Bitcoin’s short-term price movements within a single trading day. It requires a deep understanding of market trends and the ability to quickly interpret technical analysis, including chart patterns and trading indicators. Success in day trading hinges on prompt decision-making and expert-level knowledge of chart patterns and technical indicators.. Effective risk management is vital, with strict adherence to stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Day traders must also stay constantly informed about market conditions and news to make timely, informed decisions. Bitcoin Scalping Bitcoin scalping is a meticulous trading approach where traders capitalize on minute price fluctuations in the Bitcoin market. This strategy involves making numerous trades over short periods, sometimes just a few minutes, to accumulate small but frequent profits. Scalping demands an exceptional level of market analysis, precision, and quick execution. Scalpers must stay intensely focused, often dedicating several hours to monitoring market movements closely. They rely heavily on technical analysis tools and real-time data to identify profitable trade opportunities, using different scalping strategies. Due to the high frequency of trades, managing fees and maintaining a disciplined approach to avoid significant losses is crucial in Bitcoin scalping. Swing Trading Swing trading in the Bitcoin market involves holding positions for several days or weeks to capitalize on expected directional moves or price ‘swings’. This strategy requires a blend of fundamental and technical analysis to predict potential price movements. Swing traders focus on larger price movements than day traders, allowing for a more relaxed trading pace. The key to success in swing trading is identifying trends and momentum in Bitcoin’s price, which often involves understanding market sentiment and macroeconomic factors influencing the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin traders who utilize this strategy need to be patient, as holding positions for longer periods can mean enduring some volatility. However, this strategy can yield substantial returns if market trends are accurately anticipated. Bitcoin Position Trading Position trading in Bitcoin is a long-term strategy where traders hold their positions for extended periods, often weeks, months, or even years. This approach is less about the short-term fluctuations and more about the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin traders base their decisions on extensive fundamental analysis, considering factors like market trends, upcoming technological developments, and potential regulatory changes in the cryptocurrency landscape. Unlike day trading or scalping, position trading requires less time dedicated to frequent market monitoring but demands a thorough understanding of the broader economic and technological factors affecting the market. Patience and a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential are essential for position trading, as it involves weathering short-term market volatility with an eye on long-term gains. Step-By-Step Guide: How To Trade Bitcoin Trading Bitcoin can seem daunting at first, but by following a structured approach, you can navigate the market effectively. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you start your Bitcoin trading journey: Educate Yourself: Before diving into trading, it’s crucial to familiarize yourself with the basics of blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and its historical market trends. Choose A Reliable Trading Platform: Select a reputable Bitcoin exchange or trading platform. Look for platforms with strong security measures, user-friendly interfaces, and reasonable fees. Consider factors like liquidity, available trading pairs, and customer support. Set Up And Secure Your Account: Create your trading account. Ensure you use strong passwords and enable all available security features like two-factor authentication. Deposit Funds: Fund your account with fiat currency, which you can then use to buy Bitcoin. Develop A Trading Strategy: Decide on your trading style (day trading, swing trading, scalping, or position trading). Consider your risk tolerance and set clear goals. Conduct Market Analysis: Use both technical and fundamental analysis to inform your trading decisions. Stay updated with the latest Bitcoin news and market trends. Start Trading: Begin with small trades to get a feel for the market. You can either place market orders (buy/sell at current prices) or limit orders (buy/sell at a predetermined price). Monitor Your Trades And Manage Risks: Keep a close eye on your trades. Use risk management tools like stop-loss orders to protect your investment. Review And Learn: Regularly review your trading activity and learn from both successes and failures. Adjust your strategies and stay informed about factors that could impact the Bitcoin price. How To Trade Bitcoin And Make Profit Achieving profitability as a Bitcoin trader hinges on a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and disciplined strategy execution. Success involves identifying and capitalizing on Bitcoin’s price movements, underpinned by a robust grasp of market trends and drivers. Key to profiting is the application of advanced technical analysis, incorporating chart patterns and predictive indicators to gauge future price movements. Additionally, astute risk management, characterized by calculated position sizing and the judicious use of stop-loss orders, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding against market volatility. Seasoned traders often emphasize the importance of emotional discipline, avoiding impulsive decisions driven by market euphoria or panic. How To Trade Bitcoins For Beginners (Spot Market) For newby Bitcoin traders, the spot market is an ideal starting point. In the spot market, traders buy and sell Bitcoin for immediate delivery, reflecting real-time supply and demand. The immediate trading activities of traders directly determine Bitcoin’s price in this market. It offers a direct and transparent trading method, with transactions settled instantly at prevailing market prices. Types Of Orders Explained Market Orders: These orders are executed immediately at the current market price. For example, if Bitcoin is listed at $30,000 and you place a market order to buy, you’ll purchase it at the nearest available price to $30,000. Limit Orders: These allow you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell Bitcoin. For instance, you might place a limit order to buy Bitcoin when its price drops to $28,000, ensuring you only purchase at this price or lower. Stop Orders: Often used as a risk management tool, a stop order triggers a buy or sell action once Bitcoin reaches a predetermined price. For example, setting a stop order to sell at $27,000 can help limit potential losses if the market drops. How To Trade Bitcoins On The Spot Market Beginners should select trading platforms known for their ease of use, robust security features, and educational resources. Look for platforms with a high reputation and low Bitcoin trading fees. Navigating the order book can be crucial. The order book is a real-time ledger of all buy and sell orders in the market. It shows the depth of the market, indicating how many orders exist at various price levels. Beginners can use this to gauge market sentiment and potential price movement directions. Beginners should start with small investments to minimize potential losses. Understand the volatility of the Bitcoin market and be prepared for price fluctuations. Use stop-loss orders to automatically sell your Bitcoin if the price falls to a certain level, thus limiting your loss. How To Trade Bitcoin Futures Trading Bitcoin futures primarily involves dealing with perpetual contracts, a distinct type of futures contract without an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, providing more flexibility compared to traditional futures. Here’s a guide on how to trade Bitcoin futures: Understanding Perpetual Contracts: Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, have no expiration date, enabling traders to maintain positions indefinitely. This indefinite holding period is counterbalanced by the funding rate mechanism. Leverage In Depth: Leverage allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, you can control a position worth 10 times your initial margin. While this can magnify profits, it also amplifies potential losses, making risk management crucial. Mechanics Of Liquidation: Liquidation occurs when your position’s value falls to a level where it can no longer support the leveraged amount. For example, in a highly leveraged position, even a small drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger liquidation, resulting in the loss of your initial margin. It’s vital to understand the exchange’s liquidation process and margin requirements. Selecting The Right Exchange: Choose an exchange that offers comprehensive features for trading perpetual Bitcoin futures (e. G. Binance, BitMEX or Bitget), including transparent liquidation protocols, competitive funding rates, and robust platform security. Risk Management: Given the high risks associated with leverage, employing effective risk management strategies is essential. Use stop-loss orders to protect your positions, and consider lower leverage levels to reduce the risk of liquidation. How To Trade Bitcoin Options Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price before a certain expiration date. Here’s a guide on how to trade Bitcoin options: Options Types: Understand the two types of options – ‘Call options’ allow buying Bitcoin at a specific price, while ‘Put options’ allow selling it at a set price. Strike Price And Expiration Date: Each option has a strike price and an expiration date. The strike price determines the price at which Bitcoin can be bought or sold, while the expiration date marks when the option becomes void. Select A Trading Platform: Choose a platform that offers Bitcoin options trading (Deribit is the largest). Ensure it provides adequate security, liquidity, and tools for analysis. Premiums: Options are bought for a premium, which is the price paid for the option itself. The premium varies based on factors like the strike price, current Bitcoin price, and time until expiration. Market Analysis: Similar to futures, trading options requires a thorough analysis of the market. Predict whether Bitcoin’s price will go up or down before the option expires. Risk Assessment: Options can be less risky than futures as the maximum potential loss is the premium paid. However, it’s still important to understand the volatility of the market and to use risk management strategies. Strategic Use: Options can be used for various strategies, from straightforward speculation to complex combinations like spreads, straddles, and collars for risk management. Choosing The Best Platform To Trade Bitcoins Choosing the best platform to trade Bitcoins requires considering various factors such as security, user interface, fees, liquidity, and available features. Based on the latest data from CoinMarketCap regarding spot trading volume, here are some of the top cryptocurrency exchanges: Binance: Known for its high trading volume and extensive list of available cryptocurrencies, Binance offers a robust platform with competitive fees and strong security measures. It supports multiple fiat currencies like EUR, GBP, and BRL​​. Coinbase: Popular especially in the United States, Coinbase is known for its user-friendly interface and strong regulatory compliance.

Key Criteria Selecting the right platform is a critical step in your Bitcoin trading journey. The best platform for trading Bitcoins not only aligns with your trading style and goals but also offers security, functionality, and reliability. Here are key factors to consider when choosing your trading platform: Security: The platform’s security features should be given top priority. Look for platforms with a strong track record of security, utilizing measures like two-factor authentication, encryption, and cold storage of funds. User Interface And Experience: The platform should offer a user-friendly interface, especially for beginners. It should be intuitive, with easy-to-use trading tools and accessible customer support.

A platform with a high trading volume typically offers better liquidity, leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trade execution. Range Of Features And Tools: Look for platforms that offer a range of features such as advanced charting tools, a variety of order types, and risk management tools. Leverage and Margin Trading Options: If you are interested in trading with leverage, verify the available leverage options on the platform. Be aware that trading with leverage carries higher risks. Regulatory Compliance: Choose platforms that are compliant with relevant regulatory standards in your country. This compliance can provide an additional layer of security and legitimacy. Market Variety: A good platform should offer a variety of markets, not just Bitcoin. How To Trade Bitcoin? Key Indicators Successful Bitcoin trading often hinges on the use of key indicators to make informed decisions. These indicators provide insights into market trends and potential future movements. Here are some essential indicators used in Bitcoin trading: Moving Averages: They smooth out price data over a specified time period, aiding traders in identifying the trend direction. The most commonly used are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It helps identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): This tool identifies potential buy and sell signals by tracking the convergence and divergence of short-term and long-term moving averages. Volume: The trade volume of Bitcoin is a vital indicator of market strength and sentiment. High volumes often signal a strong market interest, either bullish or bearish. Bollinger Bands: These bands provide a graphical representation of market volatility. Narrowing bands suggest low market volatility, while widening bands indicate increased volatility. Fibonacci Retracement: This tool identifies potential support and resistance levels using Fibonacci ratios derived from price changes. Stochastic Oscillator: This momentum indicator compares the closing price of Bitcoin to its price range over a certain period, aiding in identifying potential reversal points. Trade Bitcoin With On-Chain-Indicators In addition to traditional technical indicators, on-chain indicators specific to Bitcoin provide deep insights into the underlying blockchain dynamics, helping traders make informed decisions. Glassnode, a leading blockchain data and intelligence platform, highlights several key on-chain indicators: Bitcoin Network Hash Rate: Indicates the health and security of the blockchain. A rising hash rate suggests increased network security and miner confidence. Active Addresses: The number of unique addresses actively transacting on the network. A growing number of active addresses may indicate increased user adoption and network activity. Percent Of Total Supply In Profit: Observing the supply distribution, especially during bear markets, can signal a large-scale supply redistribution. It indicates when the percent of supply in profit for newer buyers surpasses that of long-term holders. Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: It tracks whether the aggregate volume of realized profits exceeds that of realized losses. When the 30-day SMA of this ratio returns above 1.0, it indicates a macro trend shift towards profitable on-chain volume. aSOPR (Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio): This indicator, especially its 90-day SMA, helps identify profitable on-chain spending, indicating broader market profitability​​. Combining these on-chain indicators with traditional technical tools offers a comprehensive approach to trading Bitcoin, allowing traders to glean insights from both market sentiment and fundamental blockchain data. Trade Bitcoin: Risks And Rewards Trading Bitcoin, like any financial venture, comes with its own set of risks and rewards. Understanding and balancing these aspects is crucial for successful trading. Managing Risks As Bitcoin Trader Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be extremely volatile, leading to rapid and significant price changes. Managing this risk involves setting stop-loss orders, not overleveraging, and only investing funds you can afford to lose. Security Risks: The digital nature of Bitcoin makes it susceptible to hacking and fraud. Use secure trading platforms, enable two-factor authentication, and practice safe storage. Regulatory Changes: Bitcoin’s legal status varies by country and is subject to changing regulations, which can impact its value and legality of trading. Market Knowledge: Lack of understanding of the Bitcoin market can lead to poor trading decisions. Continuous learning and staying updated with market trends is vital. The Reward Potential In Bitcoin Trade High Return Potential: Bitcoin has seen periods of significant price increases, offering high return potential for savvy traders. Market Accessibility: Bitcoin trading is accessible 24/7, offering flexibility and continuous opportunities for traders worldwide. Innovative Market: Being part of the Bitcoin market means engaging with cutting-edge blockchain technology, which has the potential to offer new trading opportunities and reshape financial systems. Diversification: Bitcoin provides an alternative investment option, which can be a part of a diversified investment portfolio. FAQ: How To Trade Bitcoin? How To Day Trade Bitcoin?

Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Confirmed: Largest Bull Flag In Crypto History Just Formed Ripple And SEC To End Legal Tussle In 2024, Alderoty Says In an X post on Friday, December 15, Ripple shared the predictions of Alderoty on policy and US regulations in 2024. The post included three bold forecasts by the company’s chief legal officer, which generally present a dual outlook on the crypto space. Firstly, Alderoty expects the ongoing court case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to come to its conclusion in the new year. The blockchain payment firm already scored a “massive” partial victory over the US regulators when Judge Analisa Torress ruled that programmatic sales of XRP do not qualify as a security offering. While many still expect the SEC to still challenge this decision in the Court of Appeals following a final judgment, Alderoty projects the 3-year legal tussle, which he described as a “misguided lawsuit” by the SEC, will finally come to an end. However, he predicts the commission will continue with its current enforcement action on key players in the crypto space. In addition to Ripple, the SEC has also launched against multiple crypto establishments, including Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, etc. In his second prediction on US crypto regulations, Alderoty anticipates that the judiciary will continue to curtail the SEC’s excesses in terms of regulation of the crypto space. As a result, the Ripple executive believes the commission will continue to record more losses in court, as seen in similar cases against Ripple and Grayscale. However, while this may be interpreted as a positive forecast for crypto enthusiasts, it would eventually lead to an intervention by the US Supreme Court which could result in a plethora of possibilities. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Confirmed: Largest Bull Flag In Crypto History Just Formed Ripple CLO Foresees No Regulatory Framework Yet Alderoty’s final prediction on US crypto regulations centered on legislative action by the US Congress. While the Ripple Executive expects the US lawmakers will eventually unanimously agree on the need to create a crypto regulatory framework, He believes there will be difficulty in taking action stemming from disagreements on the specific measures and regulations to be implemented.

21470761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565677,1702743206,"Decentral House: New Swiss Web3 Hub Unites Cardano, UN, And WTO In Inauguration","In Geneve, Switzerland, Decentral House, a new initiative to unite the blockchain and Web3 space, has emerged. On the night of December 14th, several industry leaders from organizations worldwide discussed how blockchain is transforming the world. Related Reading: Bitwise Reveals Two Major Triggers That Will Send Bitcoin Price To $80,000 Decentral House: Merging The Physical With The Digital In One Spot Decentral House aims to serve as a hub for existing blockchain projects. This will enable them to collaborate, bring their ideas to life, and participate in initiatives supported by major players in the Swiss financial industry. The new hub was created to provide these projects with a place to materialize the discussions and ideas of Conferences and Summits that take place throughout the year. According to Decentral House founder and managing partner at STORM, Sheraz Ahmed, the physical place will integrate with the digital world to drive blockchain adoption. In the silence of this Decentral House, Ahmed believes that builders can speak about their projects and create a deeper connection. During the event, Ahmed told us: Decentral House is a centralized meeting point for the decentralized community. There’s a little bit of irony there. We definitely believe that there’s need to break down the silos that are created within our industry. I mean, a lot of people talk online, they build online, but we never really get the chance to meet in person. Even beyond just having a cocktail, a drink, and the likes, but being able to sit down and speak when there is silence. When you go past the small talk, past the, “Hey, how are you? It’s nice weather outside, which event are you going to next? Ah, that’s great. Okay, see you soon.” And when there’s silence, you can really think and have those deeper conversations (…). Ahmed highlighted the importance of Switzerland for the nascent sector, claiming that while many projects are based on a blockchain, the industry itself is “based on Switzerland.” This is due to the country’s banking system which allows the industry to gain access to capital and a solid legal framework. In other words, Switzerland is considered a “Safe Haven” for the blockchain community. Decentral House will provide a platform for like-minded individuals and events within this sanctuary. More Than A Co-Working Space, A Sanctuary Created as a long-term project running for at least two years, Decentral House will operate as much more than a co-working area. Web3 builders can join the initiative via different tiers and receive access to industry events, specialists in fundraising and compliance, and other services critical for their success in the nascent sector. The initiative is finalizing deals with major companies and organizations within the Web3 space and legacy sectors. Ahmed firmly believes that Decentral House can be a place that will help all actors work towards adoption and innovation: (…) if we can bring everyone around the same table, they can then truly create the innovation that we’re seeking. And so in order to do that, we’re creating a two year program that goes through four phases of ideation, iteration, validation, and execution. So we ideate, we brainstorm, create those ideas, we will then iterate on them, maybe there are some better than others. How can we move them? Then we will validate them, validate them with the board, get the funding. Related Reading: What’s The Metaverse? Meaning, Best Projects And Crypto The latter has been a critical question for many industry projects; many have the team and ideas but struggle during their fundraising phase. Others speed up this process and launch ideas that still require refinement. On the latter, Ahmed said: The fact that they go so quickly today into the real world, they don’t get the funding and the real eyeballs that they need to make it. So they’re going to get that validation from doing the two previous steps. And then once they’re validated, then we will execute on them and activate those proof of concepts, MVPs. And that’s where I truly believe mass adoption will follow. During the event, members of the Cardano Foundation, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) spoke on the impact of blockchain technology and the use cases that can help people in their everyday lives. Let’s continue with the recap! 🎊 Now it’s time to thank the #speakers, who entertained us with fascinating discussions on the future of the digital economy, the coexistence of real and virtual worlds, and how global organisations are using the potential of #Web3. 🌍 pic.twitter.com/G5trBqLAgx — Decentral House (@DecentralHouse) December 16, 2023 This was just the first of many debates, connections, and events that will take place in Decentral House to tear down the physical barriers that will allow the digital space to bloom. Ahmed concluded: (…) people tell me that Washington DC is the UN capital of the world with all the NGOs, et cetera, go there and try to access those people, try to speak with directors of the UN, you will not be able to. You have a barricade of security guards. They also will not want to speak to. (…) So, Geneva and Switzerland break down the barriers. And in order to (encourage) adoption, we need to break down the barriers. We cannot have all of our masks and shields up and try to improve and grow. We need to have those barriers broken down. And that’s why (we picked) Geneva.

Bitcoin is currently in a bullish sentiment, and the price has doubled this year. But according to this fund manager, this sentiment will continue into next year. In a recently released report, Bitwise predicted BTC will hit $80,000 in 2024, identifying two major catalysts that will send the crypto soaring. Related Reading: Osmosis Rally Intensifies With 77% Increase – Will OSMO Hit $2 This Month? Bitwise Predicts $80,000 Bitcoin In its report, Bitwise laid out 10 things to look out for in the crypto industry in 2024, one of which included the crypto’s price trajectory. The world’s largest crypto has outperformed other asset classes in terms of price performance this year. Data shows Bitcoin is currently up more than 125% this year, and many analysts think this growth isn’t stopping soon. For comparison, the S&P 500 returned 21% this year. 2023 was a great year for crypto. But we see even brighter things ahead. In this must-read report, the Bitwise research team lays out ten bold predictions for 2024. https://t.co/d8Pa4NkzJU — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 13, 2023 In its first prediction, Bitwise predicted Bitcoin would trade above $80,000 in 2024, setting a new all-time high. A major catalyst for this growth is the highly anticipated launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. A spot ETF would allow mainstream investors to gain direct exposure to the coin through traditional investment companies. Bitcoin has mostly reacted positively to various news surrounding spot ETFs this year. The launch is poised to be the most successful ETF launch, with many analysts estimating that a spot ETF could push Bitcoin over $100,000 in its first year. Bitcoin slightly above the $42K level today. Chart: TradingView.com The other potential catalyst is the next bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry. The next Bitcoin halving is set for April 2024, reducing mining rewards from its current 6.25 BTC to 3.175 BTC per block. According to Bitwise, at the current price of Bitcoin, the next halving will lead to a $6.2 billion reduction in new Bitcoins entering the market every year until another halving. The halving, coupled with the anticipated frenzy after spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, is expected to significantly tip the balance between supply and demand. We could even see the price of Bitcoin surge as the halving approaches, as investors buy in hoping to get ahead of a price rally.

21463225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565649,1702728496,Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise 800% To $5.5 – The Timeframe Will Shock You,"Popular crypto analyst EGRAG crypto has dropped what looks like the most bullish price prediction for XRP. XRP has been subjected to various price predictions in the past few months from EGRAG and other crypto analysts, as the crypto now has free rein on its price movement. This time, the analyst claims XRP is ready to explode 800% in just two weeks, rocketing from under $0.65 today to over $5.50 in just 14 days. EGRAG’s analysis pointed to price movement and the Fibonacci indicator, indicating XRP is gearing up for a huge rally. Related Reading: Osmosis Rally Intensifies With 77% Increase – Will OSMO Hit $2 This Month? Massive XRP Price Surge In A Short Time EGRAG took to social media platform X to reveal his latest prediction about XRP. The prediction came as an update to the analyst’s earlier prediction in May, where he shared that XRP’s price was at the final wake up line. The Final Wake Up Line was drawn from XRP’s all time high of $3.40 in 2018, sloping downwards as the crypto continued to form lower highs. At that time, XRP was trading at $0.4639 and EGRAG gave three price targets of $0.85 to $1, $5.5, and $6.1 in the coming months. The analyst also drew a bottom (Atlas) line on higher lows since 2021 to form a symmetrical triangle. #XRP Mid-Term Target (0.85c – $1 – $5.5 – $6.4): The ‘Final Wake Up Line’ is gauging the next #XRP breakout.

As a result, XRP went on a price growth that led to a spike over $0.93 against USDT on various crypto exchanges. According to EGRAG, his first target of the $0.85 to 1$ was completed amidst the price spike. XRPUSD currently trading at $0.6231 territory. Chart: TradingView.com A look at the price chart shared by EGRAG reveals XRP seems to have formed a support around this final wake-up line. Now, the next target is around $5.5, a measured move of the symmetrical triangle formed between the final wake up and atlas line. EGRAG claims we could see XRP trade at this price point in just two weeks. #XRP 3 Targets 🚀🎯: Curious about the specifics?

XRP has since fallen below the analyst’s first target of $0.85. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.62, down by 9.59% in a 7-day timeframe. EGRAG argued that the recent price correction could make investors jump ship, but HOLDing is still the best decision at this moment.

EGRAG clarified in a comment that the prediction wasn’t based on the next two weeks. Instead the rally to $5.5 would be completed in just a two week timeframe.

This comes at a period when the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been shedding a portion of its recently-accrued gain. Interestingly, a popular crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has carried out a detailed evaluation of ADA’s recent price action, providing insight into the Cardano price performance in the near future. Is ADA Price Set For A Rally To $0.70? In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward a projection for the Cardano price over the coming days. As highlighted in Martinez’s chart, the ADA token appears to be trading within a descending triangle pattern on the lower timeframes. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Faces Make Or A Point As Analyst Identifies Critical Trading Pattern A descending triangle is a chart pattern that is characterized by a downward upper trendline and a flatter horizontal trendline. The appearance of a descending triangle on a price chart connotes a bearish pattern for any cryptocurrency. However, this downward pattern can help signal a trend shift and potential surge in the value of an asset. Chart showing Cardano price within a descending triangle pattern | Source: Ali_Charts/X In his latest analysis, Martinez posited that this current chart pattern could push the ADA price in one of two ways. Notably, the crypto analyst pointed out that the Cardano price could see a bullish breakout in the near future. In this scenario, Martinez mentioned that a sustained close above $0.638 could set the price of ADA on a bullish path. According to the crypto analyst, the altcoin’s value could jump as high as $0.70, which represents an almost 15% rise from the current price point. However, Ali Martinez warned investors to “keep a close eye” on the horizontal trendline of the triangle chart pattern, which is marked by the $0.613 support. The crypto pundit cautioned that “any weakness at this level could dampen the ADA bullish momentum.” Cardano Price Overview As of this writing, the Cardano price stands at $0.6127, reflecting a 3.9% price decline in the past 24 hours. Although ADA’s bullish momentum seems to be waning, the altcoin has managed to maintain most of its profit in the past few weeks.

Arbitrum Struggles With Network Downtime The status update from Arbitrum acknowledged the problem, stating that the Arbitrum One Sequencer and Feed stalled at 10:29 AM ET amidst a notable surge in network traffic.

Köppelmann remarked that the stress testing of various blockchains using ordinals had led to the disruption, stating, “Ordinals stress testing various blockchains is certainly entertaining to watch. Now they brought the Arbitrum sequencer down.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin 2023 Bull Run Releases New Target In addition to the sequencer and feed issues, Arbitrum also encountered a halt in block production, ceasing to generate new blocks approximately 1.5 hours ago.
