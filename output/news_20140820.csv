42397895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESEw,1408569393,Bitcoin Ban Fear Fades in Thailand With Exchange Launch,"Coins has launched its second bitcoin startup in Southeast Asia with the formal opening of Coins.co.th in Thailand.  The startup has been exchanging baht and bitcoin in Thailand since its soft launch in June, when it received its e-commerce registration from the Huay Khwang District Office.  Jaturong Jantarangs  , the Bank of Thailand's senior director of the payment systems policy department, recently told the Bangkok Post that trading bitcoins for baht does not require approval or a license from the country's central bank.  As such, Coins claims that its new exchange is now ""fully legal"" under Thai law.  The move can be seen as a positive sign for bitcoin's progress in Asia, given that the Bank of Thailand was widely believed to have banned bitcoin in 2013.  The determination also follows statements from the Bank of Thailand issued in March that suggested it did not consider bitcoin a currency.  Regulatory guidance  While it is not being treated as a money services business, Coins.co.th indicated that it does need to follow related laws such as Thailand's Civil and Commercial Code and Consumer Protection Act, as well as its anti­-money laundering (AML) regulations.  Topp Jirayut Srupsrisopa, who will manage Coins.co.th, added that he expects bitcoin's legal situation in Thailand to become clearer over time, as local regulators learn more about the market and its potential.  Bitcoin Co. Ltd, the first Thailand-based digital currency exchange, also told CoinDesk that it continues to operate in Thailand despite the regulatory uncertainty, and that after its issues with the central bank earlier this year, has received e-commerce licenses for both Bitcoin.co.thhttps://bitcoin.co.th/en/ and BX.in.th, its two exchange services.  Still, it reports communication with the central bank has been scarce. As managing director David Barnes, told CoinDesk:  ""We have not had any recent conversations with Bank of Thailand since around the beginning of the year.""  Empowering Thailand's workforce  For now, Coins.co.th will continue to allow users in Thailand to pay for bitcoin using their online accounts, or by paying cash at any major Thai bank.  Hose framed the announcement as one that would help the company bring the benefits of bitcoin to the local Thai e-commerce market, which has struggled to develop sophisticated online payments that could enable growth.  Stressing benefits of bitcoin for local users and the future of his exchange, Hose said:  “Bitcoin can be an easy alternative to bank accounts and credit cards for people who cannot access those tools which fills a huge gap in financial service needs in emerging markets such as Thailand.""  Citing the growth of BX.in.th, Barnes concluded:  ""We are very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin in Thailand.""

42397894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESFv,1408561820,ASIC Maker Seeks to Bring German Efficiency to Bitcoin Mining,"Bitcoin mining startup CoinBau is looking to move aggressively into the hardware market with a new ASIC chip.  CoinBau  ’s chip, dubbed Wolfblood Extreme Efficiency, pulls roughly half the electricity necessary per gigahash – approximately 0.19 joules – compared to most options on the market, which range between 0.35 to 0.45 joules per gigahash.  CoinDesk spoke with CEO Sebastian Krause and CTO Markus Winter, who explained that efficiency is going to be the key factor as the global bitcoin mining industry continues to scale. Data center headquartering is becoming increasingly common among companies in the space, they say, and CoinBau is moving to compete with established crypto hardware firms. Its answer: cheaper mining.  With the chip now developed, the Dresden-based company is seeking between $10m and $15m to begin large-scale production of the chip. Citing strong interest as a result of recent coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Krause said that the company will likely reach its fundraising target.  He explained:  “We are talking every day to investors and a lot of miners. We offer small levels of investment, and we got a lot of responses from miners and people from the community who want to invest. They have a lot of questions, and we are very busy.”  The chip, according to the CoinBau team, was developed over the past year and a half during two phases, with the latter stage beginning in late 2013.  Bringing down the joules  CoinBau plans to make bitcoin mining more efficient through a mix of software and hardware solutions. Winter explained that during the R&D period, the CoinBau team addressed one of the fundamental questions that is shaping the increasingly competitive mining industry – how can more be done with less?  Winter said:  “The key for an economically successful mining chip is power consumption, and there are two important factors to power consumption. One is wattage, and the other one is frequency.”  He added that the development team’s deep history in power development made it possible to explore avenues for reducing the wattage while maintaining top-level performance. This, combined with the efforts of RacyICs GmbH, a Dresden-based chip maker, resulted in the achievement of lower power consumption levels.  Staying ahead of the pack  When asked about the new chip’s effect on the market, the company said that the impact of new chips offering a significant reduction in power consumption is already being felt.  Beyond the chatter among miners and investors, Winter suggested that CoinBau’s competitors in the bitcoin mining space are likely to try and adopt their approach. However, he suggested that they will need to spend significant time and money just to keep up.  Winter said:  “We expect our competitors will have to go the same way, but we do not believe they will be able to do it, at least in the next few months. They will have to invest more money and more time.”  In the immediate future, CoinBau remains focused on fundraising. Beyond building out its operations, the company plans to put its new chips to the test by mining, tweaking and moving to deliver products to the industry.  CoinBau is also in the early stages of building industry partnerships, giving it the ability to put its power consumption solution into the hands of miners. Krause suggested that the bitcoins mined during testing could be used to support other projects, though he said that it’s still too early to confirm any specific projects.  He told CoinDesk:  “We are just in the beginning.”  Images via Shutterstock and CoinBau",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/20/asic-maker-seeks-to-bring-german-efficiency-to-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/197fd56d46441b60d85065cef356ac4a3a9a07cc-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397891,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESBz,1408555805,Why Margin Trading Became the Scapegoat for Bitcoin's Price Decline,"The price of bitcoin has been the focus of increasing debate over the past week, as, in the wake of its roughly $100 fall, the wider digital currency community has sought to find an answer for what could have caused such a sudden and unexpected movement in the market.  Adding to concerns were the two 'flash crashes' that reverberated widely in the mainstream press, one observed on Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and the other more recently on BTC-e – both of which have been widely attributed to the effects of the exchanges' margin trading services on their respective markets.  However, members of bitcoin's margin trading ecosystem allege that, in its search for answer as to what caused the crashes, the community has unfairly labeled them a scapegoat. This segment of the market, including the businesses that offer the service and their consumers, have been blamed unfairly as the impetus for the price decline, they say.  Speaking to CoinDesk, established margin trading service providers such as Bitfinex and OKCoin voiced their concerns about how last week's events have been interpreted.  Offering a contrasting opinion, they argue that a stable bitcoin market requires the development of more advanced trading tools, including those just being introduced to the bitcoin market such as futures, derivatives and margin trading. Furthermore, they say that implications that margin trading has an outsized influence on the price of bitcoin are unfounded, and that they fail to characterize properly how their margin trading offerings impact their exchange services.  'A thousand things'  Bitcoin Solutions  president Adam O’Brien, whose Canada-based, still-in-beta brokerage service offers traders the ability to borrow 8x leverage, was sympathetic to the concerns of the bitcoin community. He questioned, however, that any one factor could be labelled as the driving force behind the price decline, saying:  ""I see where people are coming from with these flash crashes, but there's a thousand things that could cause a flash crash, just like there are a thousand things that could cause the price to increase rapidly.""  Zane Tackett, manager of foreign operations for OKCoin, which offers its international margin traders up to 3x leverage through peer-to-peer borrowing, acknowledged the influence of margin trading on last week's decline. Yet, he cautioned that even without this activity in the market, the price would likely have reacted in a similar manner, telling CoinDesk:  ""Downward pressure is going to bring the market down whether there is margin trading or not. So, margin trading might have made it happen quicker, but even without it I don't doubt that we would be in the same situation as we are in today.""  OKCoin is one of three major bitcoin exchanges that offer margin trading, including BTC-e and Bitfinex. Other notable providers include BTC.sx, CampBX and BitMEX.  Educational offensive  Bitfinex has since become the exchange most commonly associated with margin trading due to the fact that prices in its order books declined precipitously last week, falling from roughly $550 down to $451 on 14th August in the first of the market's two flash crashes.  As evidence of this link, Josh Rossi, vice president of business development at Bitfinex, took to Reddit on 15th August as part of an effort to better explain the volatility observed on the exchange and educate those he acknowledged may feel apprehensive about margin trading.  The 'Ask Me Anything' (AMA) session found Bitfinex seeking to highlight how it ensures a fair market on its exchange, while seeking to quell concerns about margin trading activity, which Rossi described as ""baseless claims"". Rossi went on to explain that Bitfinex does not believe margin calls, stop orders or any type of leverage contributed to the flash crash on its order books, saying:  ""We had approximately 650 BTC sold as the result of margin calls, out of a total amount of sales during this time of around 9,000 BTC. That is roughly 7%. Hardly, the cause of the drop in price.""  Rather, he suggested that a small number of very large orders hit Bitfinex on the morning of the price crash, and that they were flagged as potentially manipulative. As result, the exchange says the actions of the exchange actually prevented a larger crash than the one observed.  Bitfinex told CoinDesk:  ""The drastic and sudden sale of a large number of coins, which would do the same thing to any exchange’s order book, was the main influence on people’s actions.""  The traditionally secretive BTC-e has not issued any statements regarding its own flash crash, and did not respond to requests for comment.  Fire in the movie theater  Bitfinex also provided detail in its AMA regarding how it uses ""speed bumps"" that slow down and flag large orders that could create undue ""slippage"" in the market, whereby the size of the buy or sell order causes the price to move (up or down) as it is being filled.  While not common for small bitcoin orders, slippage has long been a side effect for extremely large orders. As Binary Financial's Harry Yeh explained at the time of the Silk Road auction, the 30,000 BTC sale was attractive to investors because if they had sought to purchase $18m in bitcoin on an exchange, the very act of executing the order would drive the price up roughly $50 per coin as it was being filled.  Raffael Danielli, who has chronicled the recent tribulations in the bitcoin market on his Matlab Trading blog, has been critical of Bitfinex and its use of speed bumps, arguing that it should not be up to the exchange to determine the intentions of traders.  Bitfinex, in turn, said its speed bumps are an attempt to protect users, and it dismisses accusations that it may be trying to manipulate the price of bitcoin through these efforts.  The reason for this safeguard, said the exchange, is that it believes traders who are not seeking to in some way manipulate the market would not desire to execute a large order that creates slippage. Sellers, it maintains, have a vested interest in selling each of their bitcoins for the best price possible.  As such, Bitfinex said that any trader would want to avoid incurring a loss on a large sale, explaining to CoinDesk:  'When a trader is sending an order, and it seems to be against their own interest, or in other words, they are either making a mistake or are not trading with the incentives of an honest participant in the market, the trading engine flags the specific orders that seem to be possibly manipulative in order to result in a better execution for the trader, as well as allowing the market time to catch up and smoothing out the sudden shocks to the system.""  Bitfinex argues that the only reason for a trader to commit such an action would be with the intent of triggering a panic or forcing margin calls, thereby taking advantage of the market's reaction to their activity.  The exchange added: ""This is the equivalent of yelling 'fire' in a movie theater, but worse in that you are selling oxygen masks.""  Competitive interests invoked  While Bitfinex did elaborate on how its internal margin trading systems work generally, it declined to speak further in both its AMA and in its conversation with CoinDesk about how its mechanisms for flagging suspicious orders work, citing competitive interests.  Bitfinex did tell CoinDesk how its system works in a broader sense, though, illustrating how its algorithm for managing the exchange's margin trading risk functions.  To open a margin trade, Bitfinex said, traders must first put up 30% of the value of their trade as collateral, a figure that also represents the total amount that could be lost by the trader should their trade be liquidated. In turn, the individual who provides the remaining collateral gets a guaranteed interest rate for his loan.  Effectively, Rossi explains, it allows two parties to trade exposure to bitcoin's price movements, with the borrower seeking to leverage this risk to to achieve gains, and the lender seeking to eradicate this risk. A time period is then set for the position, which can extend between two and 30 days.  To ensure the lender is reimbursed, the value of the position is closed if it reaches 15%. The exchange also said it has a robust stop-loss program that has been tested in more volatile markets than the one currently holding the community's attention.  ""We have improved them and added any lessons we learned along the way. We were lucky in that we were able to grow organically, and learn over time,"" Rossi told CoinDesk.  Bitfinex offers three types of wallets on its exchange – an 'exchange' wallet for traditional buying and selling, a 'deposit' wallet that can be used to store funds offered to margin traders and a 'trading' wallet where margin trades can be executed.  OKCoin declined to comment on how its systems work to prevent market manipulation, also citing competitive interests, though it said it too has certain mechanisms in place to prevent flash crashes that could affect the wider bitcoin market.  Still, Tackett did suggest it has tools that reduce its exchange's risk for a flash crash. It cited iceberg orders, which only show a portion of the buy and sell traders on its order book.  ""To avoid market manipulation, we choose not to disclose more than 5% of our order book,"" Tackett added.  Stabilizing the bitcoin market  Still, all these aspects of the debate fail to take into account the overall benefits of margin trading, respondents say.  Far from disrupting or manipulating the market, representatives of exchanges that offer margin trading argue that these services will help increase liquidity in the bitcoin market, thereby allowing buyers and sellers to more freely act without considering how this will impact price.  Rossi suggested that many in the bitcoin industry view all margin trades as open credit, neglecting to factor in the collateral that helps protects the margin trading service, adding:  ""There are no 'imaginary' coins being traded, every dollar and every coin is real.""  He went on to describe his service as one that keeps bitcoins from “gathering dust”, instead allowing them to be sold on the market. This in turn increases market participation and liquidity.  To put a face on the service, Rossi sought to illustrate how a variety of members of the bitcoin ecosystem could benefit from the trading options provided by his firm's service:  ""A merchant is more likely to accept bitcoins if he knows that he can exchange them in the future, payment processors need liquid exchanges in order to facilitate merchants sales. Investors need to be able to enter and exit positions rapidly and efficiently, and miners need to be able to forecast whether it is worth using the electricity.""  Bitcoin's market evolves  In talks with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis also struck an optimistic tone that advanced financial services are a sign the bitcoin market is maturing, saying:  ""Margin trading in bitcoin that we're seeing today is a precursor to more sophisticated markets for standardized bitcoin derivatives.""  In the current market, pressure is put on companies like Coinbase and BitPay who must immediately sell the bitcoin they receive to manage their risk. With an active futures market, Matonis said they can sell contracts, thereby agreeing to sell their asset at a certain value at a later date, and allowing them to have more revenue security.  Matonis cited the equities market and the gold and silver mining market as more niche markets that are able to accommodate margin trading and futures. He said, however, that the presence of margin trading and relative absence of futures contracts is a sign of the market's immaturity.  The key difference between the two instruments, Matonis explained, is that with futures contracts, it is not the exchange or the broker who is lending you the money.  He added: ""I think [margin trading] is a stop-gap measure.""  Real risk remains  Matonis noted that exchanges still need to worry about counterparty risk – the chance that one party involved in the margin trade won't live up to its side of the deal – and that this may be the bigger potential downside to margin trading.  ""If you manage your counterparty risk and manage the members of an exchange and do all your due diligence, then in theory there's nothing wrong with margin trading,"" he said. ""It's just that it's very tempting for those operators to be overextended.""  Rossi agreed that this risk exists, calling it a real problem that needs to be addressed.  He sought, however, to stress that Bitfinex, through its risk management procedures, is taking this threat seriously, stating:  ""The key difference is that each user on our platform has already deposited the money that will be traded. In other words, the pool of coins and dollars that is being traded is already present, and there is no counterparty who can fail to deliver. Margin between entities can cause problems, but Bitfinex is a closed loop.""  ""All the funds are present before the trade occurs and we act as arbiters who simply divide the funds up between the users,"" he explained.  Questioning the community's reaction  Even so, there was widespread agreement among margin trading service providers that many community members have a negative impression of the practice, in part due to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. As a result, Matonis said that some members of the bitcoin community unfairly equate any type of margin trading or leverage with a system that is out of control.  For example, one prevailing argument against margin trading is that the bitcoin market is too small, and that integrating such services is perhaps premature. O'Brien disagreed, noting that with the recent increase in the bitcoin network's hashing power, new bitcoins are being introduced to the ecosystem every day.  Still, Rossi attacked the claim more aggressively, suggesting that it was a sign of the lack of overall investment awareness among some bitcoin users.  ""Anytime someone says 'this is different', I tend to view it as an excuse. When people say that bitcoin is too illiquid, and it is 'different' from other assets, I think they don’t have experience in what they are saying.""  Bitfinex and OKCoin also indicated they are doing their part to ensure investors understand the risks of margin trading, though they maintain that traders who use the service must understand the associated risks.  Tackett said:  ""I believe having users sign an agreement that details the risk associated with margin trading before being able to trade is a step in the right direction, which is something OKCoin requires.""  Still, he concluded by suggesting that, at the end of the day, those who engage in margin trading need to be aware of the risk they face, and also the affect their behavior could have on other traders:  ""An exchange can provide as much information as possible, but the responsibility of reading the agreement and being aware of the risks falls on the users.""

42397875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES0B,1408545471,Delaware Legislates on Inheritance of Digital Assets,"The US state of Delaware has enacted a new law that regulates digital legacy issues and allows families to access their loved ones’ digital assets after death or incapacitation.  Notably for the bitcoin community, the legislation should help protect the interests of Delaware residents with cryptocurrency holdings.  Late last week, the Delaware House of Representatives passed House Bill 345, the 'Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets and Digital Accounts Act', which gives heirs and executors the authority to take control of digital accounts and devices, much like physical assets.  The law states:  “A fiduciary with authority over digital assets or digital accounts of an account holder under this chapter shall have the same access as the account holder, and is deemed to (i) have the lawful consent of the account holder and (ii) be an authorized user under all applicable state and federal law and regulations and any end user license agreement.”  HB 345 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA), which was created by non-profit organisation the Uniform Law Commission. Delaware is the first state to pass legislation based on the UFADAA.  Law limited to Delaware residents  Although Delaware is one of the smallest US states, it is home to a number of major companies. Due to its business-friendly policies, the state has managed to attract leading credit card companies, along with tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter.  However, the new law will not apply to companies incorporated in the state. It is intended for Delaware residents rather than companies.  “If a California resident dies and his will is governed by California law, the representative of his estate would not have access to his Twitter account under HB 345,” Kelly Bachman, spokesperson for State Governor Jack Markell told Ars Technica.  Bachman stressed that the law applies only to persons whose will is governed by Delaware law. Whether or not the company holding the digital account is incorporated in Delaware is irrelevant. This has obvious implications for bitcoin users in Delaware and if other US states follow suit and enact similar legislation based on UFADAA, these protections could soon be available to all US residents.  House member Daryl Scott, the lead author of the bill, argues that because legislators had not kept up with advances in technology, the new law will help protect the rights and interests of average residents.  The new law is not without its critics. however. Director of the State Privacy and Security Coalition Jim Halpert warns that the law does not take into account privacy and that it allows executors and heirs to view highly confidential communications between third parties and deceased family members.  Digital wills pose challenges  CoinDesk examined the pitfalls of digital wills and potential challenges faced by heir and executors earlier this year.  The issue of digital asset management in such situations has started to attract attention from legal scholars too. The British Law Society has already urged people to leave clear instructions for their intellectual property and digital media in case of death.  Bitcoin assets pose even more challenges due to their very nature. Trades can be executed globally in seconds, keys can be stored halfway around the globe, while bitcoins can be stored on a wide range of digital media and on physical wallets.  Most jurisdictions simply lack the legal framework for such situations. Therefore the best course of action for the time being is to be prepared for all eventualities. Delaware's legislators are slowly catching up with technology, but the business-friendly state is an exception.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/20/delaware-legislates-on-inheritance-of-digital-assets,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The company, which helps developers build bitcoin apps by providing fast access to the block chain, received the funding from a number of investors including Kevin Ryan, Barry Silbert, Scott Banister, Homebrew, 500 Startups and Pantera Capital.  Silbert, who is the founder of Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, said:  ""Behind the scenes and without a lot of fanfare or public awareness, Chain has built the definitive bitcoin developer platform. I’m thrilled to back the Chain team alongside a fantastic group of investors.""  The round was led by Khosla Ventures, which was started by Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of computer giant Sun Microsystems.  With the announcement, Chain has also gained a new board member, Keith Rabois, who is part of the so-called 'PayPal Mafia’, having formerly been an executive at the company. Rabois is currently a partner at Khosla Ventures and has previously held the positions of COO at Square and vice president of business and corporate development at LinkedIn.  Some of those who contributed to Chain's seed round of $4.2m have returned to top up the latest round, including RRE Ventures, Thrive Capital and SV Angel.  Expansion plans  Adam Ludwin, founder of Chain, revealed the new funding will be used to expand the company's team and build out its product offerings.  ""The company is currently based in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but we're moving everything to San Francisco in September, then we'll be hiring pretty quickly,"" he said.  Ludwin explained that there are currently eight people working at the company, but he envisages the team growing to 15 by the end of the year.  The entrepreneur, who invested in Vine in the early days of the video-sharing service, said he is principally looking to hire data and product engineers. He hopes this will enable Chain to create a ""robust and reliable service"" not just for startups, but enterprises and financial institutions too.  Branching out  Ludwin said the company's longer-term vision is to also cater for non-financial uses of the block chain, such as smart contracts, adding:  ""We're very interested in helping bitcoin itself to evolve and to be leading contributors in helping bitcoin scale and be more robust going forward.""  The company currently has four or five product ideas in development and expects to launch two or three of these by the end of the year.  ""The product that the world sees right now is just the tip of the iceberg – it's really just the foundation that enables what we really want to bring to market,"" Ludwin said.  He mentioned his team is also exploring developments in other digital currencies, specifically mentioning ethereum, ripple and stellar.  ""We are slowly, deliberately, but definitely bringing other currencies to our platform,"" he explained.  Money-making model  Currently, Chain is in beta, offering a free block-chain API to developers. Ludwin said the company will come out of beta ""definitely by the end of the year, but probably sooner"".  However, he stressed:  ""We will always have a very large free tier on the platform and developers who are just starting out on a platform will never be asked to pay.""  When an enterprise or financial institution starts to use Chain's products at scale, a fee structure will be put in place.  The company will also charge for premium features, which are currently in development. These products will sit on top of the API base Chain has built.  ""The base really is a data product, it provides fast and reliable access to the block chain. But there are all these pillars we will be building on top of that and these are the products people will pay for.""  Focus on mobile  Last month, Chain launched an iOS fingerprint API and, according to Ludwin, the response from developers was ""tremendous"":  ""There are a lot of developers who have forked it and are building services. I anticipate that there will be a lot of fingerprint-based bitcoin wallets on iOS in the fall when the new operating system is released.""  Given the positive response received in relation to this project, the company is looking to make mobile development a large part of its operations going forward.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/20/bitcoin-api-developer-chain-raises-95m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17982c7cac38cbbe80e59af3665565df1ecad13c-1260x1040.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The order is sent with a single click and, once processed by the server, will show up in the Open Orders pane. Once executed, the order will show up in the Trade History pane, in real time.  LakeBTC  says the function is easy to use and should appeal to all traders, but especially those that trade more frequently. For those who prefer a more traditional approach, the app has a Manual tab that allows traders to fill in the price and amount for each trade.  Feature-packed charts  Additionally, the exchange claims the many different features packed into LakeTrader make it unique.  “There are loads of features available – BTC/USD and BTC/CNY charts in one, five, 15, 30, 60 minute, one day and one week intervals, with styles in bars, candlesticks, lines, areas, etc. You can also draw trend lines, trend angles, pitchforks, Gann box, Fibonacci retracement, ABCD patterns, Elliott Wave subminuette, and so on,” a LakeBTC representative told CoinDesk.  LakeTrader also integrates CoinDesk BPI data, which can be accessed though the ticker box in the upper left corner by selecting 'CDBPI:USD' in the drop down menu. Users can also compare LakeBTC’s USD chart with the CoinDesk BPI USD chart side by side.  LakeBTC was added to the CoinDesk BPI for USD and CNY prices in June 2014.  Test drive  CoinDesk put LakeTrader through a brief functionality test, placing and executing around a dozen small orders.  The user interface proved user-friendly and intuitive, and all trades were executed as expected. Since it is a cross-platform HTML5 app, the user experience should be identical irrespective of platform or device.  The app’s OneClick functionally can be very useful in certain situations, allowing users to pounce on a good offer in the blink of an eye.  The obvious trade-offs are that users need to keep their eyes constantly peeled and that it is not well-suited for big orders, as offers change in real time and in most cases they involve relatively small amounts of bitcoin.

42397883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES65,1408510227,Australian Bitcoin Industry Reacts to Tax Proposals,"The Australian Tax Office (ATO) today released its long-awaited guidelines on how bitcoin businesses and individual users will be taxed in Australia.  The guidelines are similar in nature to those issued by Singapore in January, which received a mixed response from the bitcoin community.  In summary, bitcoins will not be regarded as 'money', and will be taxed in a similar way to other non-cash or barter transactions. As in Singapore, this raises the specter of double-taxation for some bitcoin transactions.  Likely to be impacted most are businesses who have been transacting in bitcoin and treating it equally to the national currency, the Australian dollar (AUD).  Titled Tax treatment of crypto-currencies in Australia – specifically Bitcoin, the guideline document is a ""general in nature"" draft version only, and not yet legally binding.  The ATO has also not indicated when the rules will begin to apply, or whether (in the case of IRS guidelines in the US) they will be applied retroactively.  Defining terms and setting out rules  ""Transacting with Bitcoin is akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences"", the paper noted.  ""The ATO’s view is that Bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of Bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Bitcoin is however an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.""  Items such as shares, bonds, loans, derivatives and foreign currencies are regarded as 'money' or 'financial supply' under existing regulations, and are not subject to GST (similar to sales tax or VAT in other jurisdictions).  These definitions are bound to cause some controversy. The bitcoin industry had argued that the broad definition of money could also include bitcoin, and asked for it to be defined as such.  Were bitcoin to be defined as 'money', 'foreign currency' or even 'financial supply', exchanging it would not incur GST. This may, however, require legislative change and would likely have wider implications for other forms of non-money units, such as store loyalty points.  Most tax authorities and regulators around the world have so far expressed reluctance to refer to bitcoin as 'money', despite some jurisdictions requiring bitcoin handling companies to apply for 'money services business' licenses.  Personal and business compliance  To comply, Australian tax-domiciled businesses and individuals involved in bitcoin transactions will be required to keep records of: (a) dates of transactions; (b) the value in Australian dollars as listed on a ""reputable online exchange""; (c) the purpose of the transaction; and (d) who the other party is (a bitcoin address will suffice).  Non-business personal transactions using bitcoin would not be subject to income tax or GST. In such transactions, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoins will be disregarded if the value is under AUD$10,000 (USD$9,300).  A business or enterprise receiving bitcoin as payment for goods or services, however, would need to record the dollar value as part of ordinary income (as with any other non-cash payment).  Businesses would also be charged GST on that transaction, though some deductions may be applicable.  Salaries, wages, miners and exchanges  Employees could still elect to have their salaries paid in bitcoins instead of dollars, but their employers would be subject to provisions of the Fringe Benefits Tax (which covers non-salary perks like company cars, frequent flyer points, memberships, etc).  Employers would still be required to deduct 'pay-as-you-go' income tax from bitcoin salaries.  Those in the business of mining bitcoins (not individual miners) would pay income tax on the value of bitcoins transferred to a third party, with losses permitted as a tax deduction. Bitcoins would be regarded as 'trading stock' and their total value would need to be declared at the end of each tax year.  Exchanges and bitcoin ATMs would be taxed depending on whether they were acquiring/supplying bitcoins as part of a regular business transaction, or as an investment. Applying GST (currently 10%) to anything sold by an exchange could see Australians paying more for locally-acquired bitcoins.  Reactions from the Australian bitcoin industry  The Bitcoin Association of Australia (BAA) said it was ""disappointed"" with the guidance and that it ""could be better"", though it appreciated the ATO's level of consultation with experts within the community.  President Jason Williams said in a statement.  ""The BAA believes that as bitcoin is being used as money, it should be taxed as money. Applying double GST to some bitcoin transactions will adversely effect investment in the bitcoin economy and may push bitcoin businesses to relocate to other, more favourable jurisdictions.""  The statement described the ATO's guidelines as an ""onerous administrative burden"" on bitcoin businesses, and would put Australia ""behind the curve"" of a potentially revolutionary technology.  Ashley King, CEO of bitcoin wallet provider CoinJelly, was more optimistic, saying the guidelines might actually help bitcoin participate more in the mainstream economy.  ""The release of the ATO guidelines finally gives the Australian bitcoin community some clarity. We've been expecting this kind of response from them, so we're not surprised. Hopefully this legitimises the community and our fellow bitcoin businesses and makes simple things like getting a bank account easier. We know not everyone will be happy, but now we all know where we stand.""  Jon Garney from ShopJoy said he found the draft disappointing, though not at all surprising.  ""The ATO's policies have always been on the conservative side. Fair enough if they want to close a loophole and make sure that income from Bitcoin is taxed just like any other income. They want everything to be proper, and there's nothing wrong with that.""  He added that he had hoped the ATO would assist Australian startups, who were usually time-poor with limited resources for complicated bookkeeping, as they struggled to get off the ground and compete in a global market.  CoinTree  , a service for buying and selling bitcoin, said it will be business as usual for a majority of its users. CEO Shane Stevenson said the company would implement additional features to assist users in filing tax returns and dealing with GST implications.  Businesses will go offshore, warns commerce association  Ron Tucker  , chairman delegate of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) and CEO of Sydney startup Bit Trade Australia, said the ATO's approach to the impact of GST on bitcoin transactions was ""impractical"" and took a line that had already been rejected by other jurisdictions, such as the UK.  ""The ATO has engaged in the process of consultation but there is no evidence in the ATO’s paper that they have responded to the issues raised by the bitcoin industry and the practical problems pointed out to them. Indeed, the approach of the ATO rejects the international trend.""  Rather than become a regional center for innovation, the new rules would more likely see bitcoin driven underground and startups move offshore. Several proprietors, Tucker continued, had already expressed they would consider relocating.  He added it was now up to the government to respond with legislative change to avoid stifling a budding industry.  ""This is the beginning, rather than the end of discussions on this issue and the ADCCA looks forward to a continuing dialogue with the ATO.""        Consultation a positive sign  Amor Sexton, a leading digital currency-focused lawyer with Adroit Lawyers in Sydney, told CoinDesk the bitcoin industry's reaction would likely be mixed, but was happy with the ATO's level of consultation.  She said:  ""The very fact that the tax office is taking the time to go through the consultation process, and get this far, shows there's some legitimacy to the concept of bitcoin being money.""  Bitcoin adoption rates were still relatively small compared to the rest of the economy, she added.  ""The fact that it's gotten this much attention from the tax office is a really good thing. Even if you don't end up getting the answer you want in the short term, I think it sets the stage for a consultation process that will see change later on.""  Sexton co-wrote a research paper on behalf of the Bitcoin Association of Australia with recommendations on how the ATO should tax bitcoin, which was presented to the agency at the beginning of June. That paper had recommended bitcoin be treated as money to avoid double-taxing through GST.  The ATO announced its intention to issue bitcoin tax rulings in February, initially intending to release detailed guidelines by the end of the 2013-14 financial year on 30th June. Later, however, it decided to delay its announcement in order to provide a ""comprehensive and robust"" ruling and seek additional legal advice on the matter.
