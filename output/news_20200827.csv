42384585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhS6N,1598565942,Whistleblower Kidnapped in Ukraine After Accusing Crypto Firm of Exit Scam,"UPDATE: The kidnapping was staged by Ukrainian law enforcement officials. Read more.      A group of people pushed a man into a gray minivan on a dark street. The man yelled, “Help! Help! No!” and pushed against the van. Passersby shouted, “Let him go!” and tried to stop the van. The man was finally stuffed inside and the van left.      This blurry video, apparently filmed by an unidentified witness Wednesday night in Kyiv, Ukraine, and circulated by local news publications Thursday morning, might mark a new chapter in the story of Bitsonar, a crypto investment firm that raised millions of dollars from investors in the U.S. and Europe, which they are now unable to access.      The Ukrainian media wrote that the man driven away in the minivan was ex-Bitsonar employee Yaroslav Shtadchenko. Shtadchenko’s wife Julia confirmed to CoinDesk her husband appeared in the video and had gone missing last night around 11 p.m. local time as he was coming home from work. She also said she found her husband’s personal belongings on the street after her neighbors told her he was kidnapped.      The harrowing incident highlights the proliferation of risky investment schemes and dubious operators in the crypto industry, but also blockchain technology's potential to help track missing funds.    Complaint to FBI in the works    According to Julia Shtadchenko, before going missing, Yaroslav Shtadchenko called Bistonar’s CEO, Marius Ziubka, and told him he was going to file complaints about Bitsonar to law enforcement in different countries, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the U.S. Then, on Wednesday, the lawyer of Bitsonar’s founder called Shtadchenko and suggested “settling the conflict peacefully,” his wife said.      After that, Yaroslav Shtadchenko was kidnapped on his way home. Julia Shtadchenko said she filed a police report Wednesday night but hadn’t heard any updates on her husband’s whereabouts.      In July, Yaroslav Shtadchenko gave an interview to the Russian crypto news publication Forklog under the pseudonym Jan Novak, saying that Bitsonar was founded by former Ukrainian government clerk Alexander Tovstenko, and Shtadchenko worked for the company as a project manager. Both Forklog and Shtadchenko’s wife confirmed Shtadchenko used that pseudonym.      In the interview, Shtadchenko claimed that Tovstenko stopped withdrawals from the platform in the beginning of 2020 and then got away with the money of investors.      Shtadchenko told CoinDesk in July that Bitsonar received about $2.5 million from investors across the globe. On Aug. 6, the website went down and users lost access to their accounts.      Read more: A Former Beauty Queen Raised $12M to ‘Revolutionize’ Cannabis. The Courts Can’t Find Her      CoinDesk was contacted by 11 people saying they haven't been able to withdraw their money from Bitsonar since February, and one investor who couldn’t get his crypto out since May. According to them, Bitsonar would explain withdrawals were paused because of an audit, but the withdrawals were never resumed. According to the analysis of Bitsonar’s bitcoin wallets by CoinDesk, Bitsonar’s treasury is now empty.      The users who spoke to CoinDesk are from the U.S., Canada, U.K., Denmark, Norway, Netherland, Finland and other countries. Some of them said they would like to pursue legal action but didn’t know where to start. According to Julia Shtadchenko, her husband was ready to file complaints himself, and had the drafts ready. She shared the draft of the complaint to the FBI with CoinDesk.    Legitimate-looking business    Bitsonar looked credible, at least in the beginning. The project advertised itself as a startup that used trading bots to earn high profits on investors’ crypto. Pavel Lerner, a well-known crypto adviser with Ukrainian origins, worked with Bitsonar, which gave the enterprise additional credibility.      Popular YouTube channels dedicated to crypto trading advertised Bitsonar, including MMCrypto, CryptoTV, CryptoJoker, and Ivan On Tech (he later reportedly deleted the videos).      Read more: YouTube’s Whac-a-Mole Approach to Crypto Scam Ads Remains a Problem      Lerner himself told CoinDesk he was introduced to the Bitsonar team by his friends and was hired in May 2019 to set up trading bots. “We launched bots for trading on Huobi and Bitfinex,” he said. Lerner said he was fired from Bitsonar in November.      “I’m not sure what was on their minds and how they raised money. They fired me because they were not satisfied with the bots’ profitability,” Lerner added.      Bitsonar OÜ was registered in Estonia and had obtained a local crypto business license, according to the document published by Forklog. “I trusted Estonia (good startup scene) and licenses too much,” one of Bitsonar’s investors from Finland, who asked not to be named, told CoinDesk.      According to Shtadchenko’s July interview in Forklog, the company had been working normally throughout the summer and fall of 2019. But in December 2019, the team was told by Tovstenko to prevent clients from withdrawing funds by any means, Shtadchenko said.      Then Tovstenko refused to pay annual bonuses to the Bitsonar employees and flew to Dubai to celebrate the New Year, Shtadchenko told Forklog. Later, Tovstenko posted a YouTube video of himself partying, he added.      There was no mention of Tovstenko on the Bitsonar website, but apparently he took an active role in the operations. One of Bitsonar’s investors, Ukrainian entrepreneur Vladimir Chaika, told CoinDesk he personally met Tovstenko and gave him $100,000 in cash in exchange for the paper IOU and a promise of up to 11% monthly profits. He never got his money back, he said. Lerner said he met Tovstenko several times and thought he was either an investor or the founder of Bitsonar.      Yaroslav Shtadchenko said he used his access to Bitsonar’s website to publish information about Tovstenko, who he claimed ran away with the investors’ money. He also published Tovstenko’s contact information, including email address, Telegram handles, Facebook and Instagram profiles, and mobile phones.      CoinDesk tried all of the above but got no response. Two of the Telegram handles listed by Shtadchenko, @alexsky888 and @SkyAlex88, received the message but did not respond. One of the phone numbers belongs to a man who said his family name is not Tovstenko but Kovalenko.    ‘Mom and pop’ investor story    How did investors from across the world get involved with a company set up by an unknown founder in Kyiv? One telling example is Eli Taylor, a 42-years old United Parcel Service (UPS) worker from Portland, Ore., in the Pacific Northwest.      One evening in January, Eli was sitting in his condo watching YouTube videos. He became an avid viewer of videos by crypto influencers talking about making money from bitcoin. They were analyzing charts, talking about price movements, showing how to use different platforms – and, of course, advertising their sponsors. They looked professional and smart, and Eli liked them.      At that time, some of those channels were also promoting Bitsonar. Until the end of January, Bitsonar offered a “Christmas special,” with extra perks for larger investors. Eli decided to give it a try.      “The first thing you learn about crypto is, if it’s not your keys, it’s not your crypto. Never give out your crypto, unless you’re paying for something or you’re trading. And I broke that rule with Bitsonal, but it was because they were so seductive,” Eli told CoinDesk via a WhatsApp call.      He invested 5 BTC and 114 ETH, worth about $100,000 in today’s prices, in Bitsonar, he said, which was most of the crypto he had. Now, that money is probably gone forever.      Eli Taylor is still not out of the woods. Working at UPS allowed him to accrue some savings and make some investments. He started with stocks and invested via an online brokerage, then got into crypto in 2018 via the Robinhood app, which had just added crypto at the time.      He seized the moment to buy bitcoin during the price lows of summer 2018, when one bitcoin cost around $3,000, Eli said, but then sold a lot of it and bought altcoins, which then performed very badly. “If I just would have HODLed I would do well,” he said.      “I was doing pretty well until the end of last year, we were having a little bull market,” Eli said. “But then there was a decline, and I just started just to play around and do my own thing and watch videos.”      He added:    “I was watching a lot of videos on YouTube, and you can learn more on YouTube than anywhere else, if you have your wits about it and you are careful, and you can use other people’s advice to do your own strategy.”    Read also: Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Sues YouTube Over Bitcoin Giveaway Scams      People analyzing price charts looked smart and qualified – and a bunch of them were advertising Bitsonar. Some even showed how they deposited some crypto with Bitsonar. Plus, there was this Christmas special offer. Eli decided to jump in.      At first, it went pretty smoothly, he said. “The customer service was very helpful and proactive, and I was able to even close one of my investments and cash out on my profits. Very professional emails, detailed, they looked very honest. Very detailed, vivid explanation, and it was convincing.”      Withdrawals worked for Eli until late May – unlike most users, who couldn’t take their money out of Bitsonar since February. Eli was able to pull out about $5,000 worth of crypto out of Bitsonar before May, he said. Shtadchenko told CoinDesk that Eli was the largest investor in Bitsonar.    Following the coins    Bitsonar users provided CoinDesk with multiple bitcoin addresses that they used to send bitcoin to Bitsonar, along with the addresses Bitsonar sent funds from when users withdrew. All those addresses are now empty.      According to CoinDesk analysis using Crystal blockchain-sleuthing software, there have been 564 bitcoin addresses associated with Bitsonar. All of them are now empty. The entire cluster of addresses received nearly 115.5 bitcoin, which is more than $1.3 million at the current price.      According to Shtadchenko, Bitsonar accumulated up to $2.5 million in crypto, and more than half of it, up to $1.5 million, came from the retail investors who saw the promotion of Bitsonar by bloggers. About $650,000 came from large investors who handed over physical cash.      Read more: Data Shows Millions Leaving Crypto Wallets Tied to Long-Troubled Exchange      To be sure, blockchain analytics tools like Crystal are never 100% precise and it’s hard to say if Bitsonar actually has anything left in its wallets. It’s also impossible to definitively confirm that all the addresses associated with Bitsonar in Crystal really belonged to Bitsonar, or that it’s a full list.      “Given the pseudo-anonymous essence of most cryptocurrencies, blockchain analytics techniques (especially address clustering algorithms) have been mostly of a heuristic nature, meaning the results are obtained from probabilistic methods,” says Kyrylo Chykhradze of Crystal Blockchain.      Gaining 100% confidence in attributing bitcoin addresses to certain entities can only be done with off-chain insights, which means knowing exactly who is the owner of a particular address in the real world, Chykhradze added.      As of Thursday night, the fate on Bitsonar investors money, as well as Yaroslav Shtadchenko’s whereabouts, remain unknown. CoinDesk will monitor the situation.

42384584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhS2b,1598564459,Wasabi Wallet Is Revamping Its CoinJoin Design to Allow Bitcoin Mixing With Differing Values,"Privacy-focused Bitcoin software wallet Wasabi is getting a major protocol overhaul.      The Wasabi team is working on a new protocol design, dubbed WabiSabi, in a bid to improve the user experience and privacy guarantees of the wallet's CoinJoin transactions. The major design change would allow users to coinjoin with different values than their peers, a first for the privacy-minded technology that could lead to new (and more flexible) use cases. Wasabi has been conceptualizing the design in a research group since the beginning of 2020 and has hired team members to work on the implementation.    Out with the old    Currently, Wasabi’s CoinJoin – a mixing protocol that, when used correctly, can obscure a bitcoin’s transaction history – relies on the ZeroLink protocol and blind signatures for mixing. Under this scheme, users must spend a set minimum amount of bitcoin with other users in a mixing pool for the CoinJoin to work successfully; these like amounts are shuffled together in a pool, after which each user receives the same amount of bitcoin back in a way that doesn’t reveal their original input.      For this to work effectively, each user in a CoinJoin transaction must send a minimum amount of bitcoin to the mixing pool (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, etc) so as to ensure that they receive the same output as other users when the CoinJoin is complete. If recipients don't receive the same amount of Bitcoin at the end of a join as other users in the mix, the transactions could be easily deanonymized by blockchain surveillance.      This current scheme also gives the CoinJoin’s coordinator a spyglass into a user’s information. Wasabi contractor and contributor Max Hillebrand told CoinDesk that a coordinator ""could link the input to the change output, and could link multiple inputs to the same user.”      WabiSabi won’t disintermediate this coordinator role, seeing as it is necessary to make the protocol as frictionless and low-latency as possible. But the new design, according to Wasabi’s team, will keep the coordinator from tracing inputs to ensure “as few privacy leaks as reasonable,” Hillebrand said.    In with the new    The new protocol is a technical casserole that combines Pedersen commitments and keyed-verification anonymous credentials (KVAC), a feature used for group messaging on the encrypted chat app Signal.      If WabiSabi works in practice as it does in theory, then users will be able to spend any amount, irrespective of the value spent by their peers – an improvement over the current design which demands equal value payouts to mixing participants.      Wasabi co-founder and lead researcher Adam Ficsor told CoinDesk this new design could unlock new CoinJoin use cases, like “CoinSwapping with CoinJoins and open[ing] lightning channels with CoinJoins.”      Hillebrand continued to highlight that this implementation will not be limited to self-spends, where users can only send a CoinJoin transaction to themselves, like under the current model. Rather, WabiSabi would allow them to make payments in a CoinJoin transaction to another user as well. This process would operate in the background if it runs the way Wasabi envisions it, opening up the possibility to make “every spend a CoinJoin.”      “The [old] Zero Link CoinJoins are mainly a self-spend, so the same user owns the input and the output. It’s not a payment; it’s like you are shuffling the bitcoin from your left pocket to your right pocket. This increases blockspace usage and thus incurs more expensive mining fees for the sender and verification cost for all Bitcoin full node users.”    'Testing, testing, testing'    Of course, the protocol’s development is still in its early stages, and Wasabi lead developer Lucas Ontivero told CoinDesk the white paper, which was unveiled to the Bitcoin developer mailing list in mid-June, is “still being peer reviewed.”      The challenge now is structuring the actual transaction design, which is a different technical feat from designing the protocol itself. As Hillebrand explained, the WabiSabi protocol design sets the parameters for data transmission between end users and coordinators, while the transaction structure of inputs and outputs is a different problem entirely.      This “transaction structure is not 100% ready,” Wasabi cryptographer István András Seres told CoinDesk over email. He added that “it is a huge design [requirement]” and that the team will want a “proper audit” before feeling comfortable releasing it to the public.      So a working WabiSabi implementation may be some time away, though the next step in development is creating a transaction scheme that retains the privacy promises of the underlying protocol. The team did not make any promises about when the tech could be ready, as “there are many open research questions and unknowns,” Hillebrand said.      As independent Bitcoin privacy researcher Yuval Kogman put it, the next, challenging step is “going from theory to practice” in a way that keeps the protocol as user friendly as possible to maximize its adoption.      “On the cryptography side, the theory is well developed and understood. Anonymous credentials as a concept go a long way back and are fairly straightforward to apply...a big part of the challenge is UI/UX [user interface/user experience], and in order to take full advantage of the credential scheme and the transaction structure, we will have to find some creative solutions,” he said, adding that the team has “already come up with some pretty promising and interesting ideas.”      This article was updated to more accurately describe how Wasabi's current CoinJoin implementation works.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/wasabi-wallet-is-revamping-its-coinjoin-design-to-allow-bitcoin-mixing-with-differing-values,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47a6a78451cb2eb15f2d373b80abeb4989b2d069-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read More: Bitcoin Pops and Drops After Powell Introduces Average Inflation Targeting      Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in an investor note that Thursday’s failed bitcoin rally was a result of the substance, or lack thereof, of Powell’s comments. “Powell's backpedaling and fuzzy inflation framework has disappointed the market that was hoping for a formalization of inflation policy in this speech itself,” the firm wrote.      The Fed inflation framework, which in Powell’s words is “flexible,” is a positive sign, said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills. “Although the market reacted to Powell's comments, I have to believe anyone really thinking hard about it knew this was a likely response by him,” said Van Huis. “One in the digital asset space might be smiling even more now, saying ‘this thing we are building might actually be working,’” he added.      Read More: Commentary: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Details Inflation Target Changes      The bitcoin market may see more exciting action Friday, when over 66,400 BTC in open interest options are set to expire.      William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, expects volatility to rise as a result. “What large open interest means is that there is more money on the line by institutions and retail with strong financial incentives to move prices to or away from certain prices as we move into that expiration,” he explained.      “The two strikes with the greatest open interest are at $11,000 and $12,000,” said Purdy. He thinks spot prices could further gyrate because buyers of options would have gains minimized inside that $11,000-$12,000 range.      Options traders had a small scare when Deribit, the largest bitcoin options exchange, went offline during early European trading hours. At one point, Deribit warned it was possible it wouldn't be back online in time to handle the 2,000 or so bitcoin options that were expiring Thursday. However, the problem was resolved a few hours later.

42384589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhS8t,1598559060,Bakkt Futures Volume Up on Institutional Trading; Its President Slams Offshore Options,"Growing institutional interest is helping to drive a recent spike in volume on Bakkt, according to its president, Adam White. But the U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives exchange is holding out hope its dormant options platform will eventually gain traction.      Trading volumes for physically settled bitcoin futures on Bakkt rose to $134 million on Tuesday from a previous high of $132 million on July 28, according to crypto derivatives data firm Skew. Bakkt went live last September.      “The market recognizes the value that a regulated physically delivered bitcoin future offers for hedging and risk management and speculation,” White told CoinDesk in a phone interview on Aug. 26.      This has been part of the significant growth in bitcoin’s derivative market as a whole, after the cryptocurrency's price went above $11,000.    Getting physical with bitcoin    Despite the recent surge on Bakkt’s bitcoin futures trading volumes, it still lags behind the Chicago-based CME Group, a bigger, U.S.-regulated exchange. Data from Skew shows the aggregated daily volumes of bitcoin futures on Bakkt and the CME were at $279 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, on Monday.      Compared with many offshore, unregulated exchanges that have taken the majority of the bitcoin futures market share, White said Bakkt has the advantage of being based in the U.S. and owned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which also owns the New York Stock Exchange.      ""We are a fully regulated intermediated traditional futures market. Contrast that with the offshore unregulated markets that you see trading on a lot of crypto exchanges,"" he said.      The crypto derivatives provider launched its bitcoin futures contracts in late 2019 with the goal of serving its institutional clients, who range from market makers and proprietary trading firms to family offices and traditional hedge funds, according to White.      At the same time, unlike the CME, Bakkt’s bitcoin futures contracts are mostly settled with physically delivered bitcoin, meaning buyers receive tokens at expiration instead of cash.      Some U.S. institutions are only allowed to trade on regulated exchanges. Thus, if they want to get into crypto, they have two choices: Bakkt or the CME, because exchanges such as Coinbase are licensed but unregulated in the U.S. For those who want to hold their bitcoin in their hands, Bakkt is basically the only game in town.      White said the physical delivery of bitcoin puts Bakkt at advantage because the exchange is seeing more clients interested in receiving crypto assets.      Read more: It's Too Soon to Write Off Bakkt, Wall Street Analyst Tells ICE Investors      “It’s not a bet on the price of bitcoin,” he said. “It doesn’t rely on an index price created from unregulated spot markets that are self-reporting their data.”      In addition, White said that as the market grows, more traditional institutional investors are becoming “comfortable” with holding and trading crypto assets, which is evidenced by Bakkt's increasing market share.      However, other industry experts have said physical delivery of bitcoin could be the one factor that has been hindering Bakkt’s growth in the crypto derivatives market.      According to Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, the number of bitcoin contracts held to expiry on Bakkt dropped sharply in July, to 58 BTC from June’s 221 BTC – the lowest amount held to expiry so far in 2020.      Compared with a cash settlement, physical delivery of bitcoin could impose a tighter margin, Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivative exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk via Telegram.    No options, for now    Despite the success with its bitcoin futures products, Bakkt seems to be still struggling with its options contracts. No volume or open interest have been logged since June 15 in Bakkt’s bitcoin options.      Futures contracts on CME are settled with cash; options contracts settle in futures which in turn get immediately cash settled.      Meanwhile, CME’s bitcoin options contracts contributed about 10% to the total global open interest on Tuesday, second behind Deribit, who accounted for 80% of the market. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts.      White shrugs off concerns about Bakkt’s options products, saying the crypto options market as a whole has a long way to go before it matures.      Read more: Bitcoin Options Open Interest Nears All Time High – But Rise in Puts Could Presage Drop      “When people ask, 'Aren't you worried about your options volumes?' Absolutely not,” White said. “These are the early innings. Most of the options volume is happening offshore, unregulated, not cleared and, frankly, we're not even sure how much of that volume is legitimate.”      White is banking on growing trading volumes and open interest Bakkt’s futures products to eventually draw customers to its options suite, and is therefore not planning on delisting options contracts anytime soon.      “As the institutions move into the futures, their hedging and risk management needs will evolve towards options, and we are going to be there ready to serve them,” White said.

42432577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNozhh,1598558610,Miners' Bitcoin Holdings Reach Two-Year High to Almost 2M,"Bitcoin miners are holding more bitcoins than at any point in the past two years as the cryptocurrency continues to trade above $11,000, signalling increased bullishness about future gains.      According to wallet addresses tracked by Glassnode, miners are holding a total of more than 1.82 million bitcoins, setting a two-year high and continuing a noticeable upward trend that began in September 2019. In just the last year, aggregate holdings by miners have increased by roughly 2%, excluding growth from other bitcoin miners not tracked by Glassnode.      There are three possible causes for the increase in total bitcoins held by miners:      First, potential optimism that bitcoin's recent rally will likely continue.    Miners' holdings data appears to be a bullish signal, according to Thomas Heller, former director at leading mining pool F2Pool, who discussed it with CoinDesk in a private message. Miners seem to feel comfortable holding for a while, he said, possibly in anticipation of a higher price later on.  Miners aren’t the only ones holding more bitcoins, however. The percentage of all bitcoins that have been inactive for at least one year continues to grow after reaching four-year highs in June.    Second, the rotation in hardware as miners order, receive and deploy new machines, according to Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at GRIID, a data center and mining infrastructure company.    This process, which Sudock described as the “hardware cycle,” can take up to six months depending on pricing and order size, he told CoinDesk in a private message. Ultimately, fewer coins need to be sold to cover operational expenses during this retooling period. In addition, with the price of bitcoin so high, relatively few coins need to be sold to pay expenses.  As CoinDesk previously reported, two publicly traded bitcoin companies, Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group, are both in the process of receiving and deploying hundreds of new machines over the next few months as they scale up their mining efforts.  As miners deploy new machines, they also enjoyed a 7% monthly revenue increase in July, according to network data analyzed by CoinDesk, thanks to recent price appreciation and increased transaction fees.    Last, the total number of coins held by miners has increased as new mining pools accumulate uncharacteristically large amounts of bitcoin.    Most notably, a significant percentage of recent overall growth comes from Lubian.com, a little-known mining pool that was largely inactive until March 2020, whose holdings are nearly on par with F2Pool, a mining pool founded in May 2013.  Over the past few months, the pool’s bitcoin holdings have increased to 9,373 BTC as of Thursday, representing an almost equal percentage gain up from 1 BTC in mid March, according to Glassnode.

42432568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNozNh,1598558402,Think Quant Trading Doesn't Work in Crypto? Think Again,"Marc P. Bernegger started his first internet company in 1999 and had two successful exits. He began working with Bitcoin in 2012, is on the board of Crypto Finance Group, Swiss Blockchain Federation and CfC St. Moritz and is a member of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Expert Network for blockchain.      The recent CoinDesk opinion article “10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail” by Jesus Rodriguez makes for a great headline, but it overlooks relevant developments and key data in the sector.      While Rodriguez makes reasonable points about the weakness of quant technology for crypto, a growing number of professional crypto quant fund managers address these through their strategies, demonstrating clear success. Going forward, crypto assets are set to become the perfect asset class for quant strategies.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: The Surprisingly Sunny Outlook for Crypto Hedge Funds      The 2020 PwC–Elwood Crypto Hedge Fund Report says the most common crypto hedge fund strategy (48% of those surveyed) is quantitative (or taking a systematic approach to the market in either a directional or a market neutral manner), followed by discretionary long only (19% of funds; meaning funds that are long only and whose investors have a longer investment horizon), discretionary long/short (17% of funds; meaning funds that cover a broad range of strategies including: long/short, relative value, event driven, technical analysis and some strategies that are crypto specific, such as mining), and multi-strategy (17% of funds; meaning funds adopting a combination of the above strategies).      To understand why almost half of all crypto hedge funds worldwide are focused on quant strategies requires a look at the broader (crypto) hedge fund sector.    Quantitative characteristics    It is important to note that the models used by quantitative funds usually extend beyond digital asset datasets. Many quantitative crypto fund managers come from the traditional finance world, their strategies are defined based on decades of data from traditional asset classes, and these strategies are tested thoroughly before being applied to the crypto market.      Additionally systematic strategies are superior to human decision-making procedures in an environment of irrational and volatile markets, which is definitely the case with most cryptocurrencies.      The crypto market is still dominated by traders making decisions by monitoring the price action on the charts. This increases the strength of trends and favors a quantitative approach based on time series analysis.      Traders can retrieve a vast amount of information by analysing digital asset datasets – particularly when taking on-chain metrics into account (e.g. transaction values, miner fees, etc.). That can be used by quantitative funds to garner some element of predictability instead of relying on technical price data alone.    While Rodriguez makes reasonable points about the weakness of quant technology for crypto, a growing number of professional crypto quant fund managers address these through their strategies.    With outliers, most quantitative strategies can take advantage of the short-term inefficiencies presented by digital assets and actually profit from the outlier events. The key attraction of many quantitative funds is their informational market advantage and the hedging capabilities they offer, particularly during down-markets. As such, outliers may present a challenge, but these periods have been proven quite profitable for some quantitative crypto funds as evidenced by their track records.      Quant funds that generally trade very liquid exchange-listed crypto assets provide better liquidity to investors than a fundamental investor targeting early-stage projects or a multi-strategy, where the fund manager needs to consider the various strategies and instruments in its portfolio.    Relevant results    Most serious and regulated systematic crypto hedge funds are quite transparent with their numbers so investors are able to find actual assets under management or monthly performance figures on platforms like Barclay Hedge or Nilsson Hedge.      Based on available data, systematic crypto funds are outperforming “passive HODLing strategies” (meaning long only), discretionary long/short and multi-strategies significantly and generate sustainable alpha:      In 2019, the average crypto hedge fund performance by strategy was as follows:      Quantitative +58% Discretionary Long/Short +33% Discretionary Long Only +42% Multi-strategy +19%      In 2018, which was a very challenging year for digital assets, quant trading was the only strategy generating positive returns:      Median quant fund +8% Median all funds -46% Median fundamental fund -53% Median discretionary fund -63% Bitcoin -72%      So looking at the performance of crypto hedge funds in 2018 and 2019, it is obvious that crypto quant funds are working.    Growing ecosystem    A growing number of investors, including more and more fund of funds, are investing in systematic crypto hedge funds and crypto quants exclusively, which enables the whole ecosystem to evolve quickly.      With most regulated crypto hedge funds that accept money from external investors being quite transparent about fund performance and assets under management, the growth in investments is becoming apparent. Increases in assets being allocated to crypto hedge funds in the last few months and increasing indications that bitcoin is a digital store of value and a new hedge against inflation, show that the demand from investors is accelerating.      A majority of today’s crypto hedge funds, including crypto quants, were created less than three years ago, illustrating that this industry is still very young.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - 10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail      Assets under management of crypto funds worldwide doubled from 2019 to 2020 (from $1 billion to $2 billion) and there are clear indications that they will roughly triple till the end of this year. A big part of this new money will be allocated to systematic crypto funds.      As CoinDesk’s Noelle Acheson wrote recently, “the outlook for crypto hedge funds is sunny.” Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of direct investment in the market is a more attractive option for many investors: they do not need to worry about custody, best execution, or liquidity crunches. These elements can be especially important for traditional investors, who are not deeply involved in the underlying technology and look at crypto assets primarily as a new alternative asset class to diversify their existing portfolio.      With these arguments, and professional crypto quant fund managers that address known challenges with their strategies to achieve both performance and growth today, the potential for systematic crypto funds to surpass other investment strategies and outperform the market by the end of 2020 looks increasingly probable.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Marc P.

Content is content when it comes to growth    In the early days of YouTube, there was a plethora of pirated content that drove its growth, said Adam Helfgott, CEO of the programmatic advertising firm MadHive.      “This is somewhat analogous to that situation,” said Helfgott in a phone call. “The more you start limiting a platform or content on a platform, when you don't really know if something is good or bad but you have reason to suspect it's one or the other, users will start to rebel and then you won’t have massive growth.”      In July, YouTube moved to dismiss the Ripple lawsuit, relying on Section 230 protections, which protect companies from content liability.      Read also: Ripple Sues YouTube for Allowing ‘Scams’ That Promise Free XRP      “YouTube’s motion to dismiss the allegations boils down to the idea that the video-sharing giant did not willingly or knowingly engage in any of the scams or copyright infringement, and cannot be held liable for any third-party content on its website,” CoinDesk reported at the time. “The firm’s motion also adds that it shut down such scams whenever it was alerted to them.”      The part that’s still an open question is how much money YouTube – and its parent company – makes from scam ads, even on the margins, and the effectiveness of the mechanisms in place for removing them.      “Protecting users from ad scams and fraud is a key priority,” said a Google spokesperson in response to CoinDesk’s query about the YouTube ad. “We have robust policies prohibiting ads that attempt to circumvent our enforcement by disguising the advertiser’s identity and impersonating other brands. In this case, we quickly removed the ad and suspended the advertiser account.”    The ad ecosystem    The ad, which has since been taken down, ran from Aug. 12 to Aug. 17, according to Google.      Google has policies that lay out what kind of ads can run on its platforms, including YouTube. Under these policies, advertisers are not allowed to run ads, content or destinations that attempt to trick or circumvent the ad review processes, according to Google. Due to the complex and evolving nature of cryptocurrencies and their related products and services, Google only allows a limited set of advertisements for regulated exchanges in the United States and Japan.      Yet, the scam ads persist.      See also: YouTube Calls Crypto Purge a Mistake but Many Videos Still Missing      Helfgott said there are challenges when it comes to reviewing ads, given there is so much content out there, and that it would be hard for anyone to manage this volume. In 2019, Google took down approximately 2.7 billion bad ads. That means it removed about 10 million ads per day.      At the same time, he said, companies could be doing a better job. However, companies that rely on advertising on a massive scale, like Youtube and Facebook, aren’t necessarily incentivized to do so.      Helfgott said because of the mass scale of YouTube, there is a large amount of ad inventory on the site and Google may be reluctant to cut that back. For every rule YouTube implements on advertising, the number of ads could drop, and that’s not in Google’s interest as a company relying heavily on ads to make a profit.      These complicated dynamics and incentives may mean scammy cryptocurrency ads are potentially here to stay on YouTube, even if only for a few days. It’s a complicated game of whac-a-mole, with no end in sight despite the pending lawsuits.    Responsibility: YouTube’s or the FTC's?    “Scams and fake giveaways are pretty common over both YouTube and Instagram,” said Data & Society Researcher Robyn Caplan, who focuses on platform governance. “It’s something that falls under the jurisdiction of the FTC [U.S. Federal Trade Commission] – it would be reported to them, a state attorney general or the local consumer protection office.”      See also: Bitcoin in Cuba: A Local YouTube Influencer Explains How It Works      Caplan said YouTube’s Section 230 argument would likely work in its defense because it would be like someone suing the U.S. Postal Service over similar scams and giveaways through the mail.      That doesn’t mean YouTube can ignore these scams, however.      “Platforms should definitely be honoring their terms of service, which means they need to be taking down scams in a timely manner,” said Caplan.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | AIRDROP,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/youtubes-whac-a-mole-approach-to-crypto-scam-ads-remains-a-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a982b909acc9ccf4f5345e7d87023e97c843686d-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dubbed USDC 2.0, USD Coin (USDC) has integrated what are called ""meta transactions"" natively to the dollar stablecoin platform. Now, users do not have to pre-fund their USDC-bearing wallets with ether (ETH) in order to send a transaction.  Meta transactions allow USDC wallets and compatible applications to act as virtual ""gas stations"" by paying the associated mining fee that accompanies every Ethereum blockchain transaction.  ""This [update] enables people to fund their non-custodial wallets with USDC and start using DeFi/dapps without also having to own ETH,"" Coinbase developer Peter Jihoon Kim told CoinDesk.  The update is backwards-compatible, meaning old USDC clients can continue using the network without upgrading.

From Q1 to Q2 in 2020, the total volume of crypto derivatives – the value tied up in bets on future price movements – increased by $60 billion to $2.16 trillion.  Spot volumes decreased by 18% over the same time span, reaching $5.44 trillion.  Because of how widely derivatives products vary among exchanges, BVV predicts there will be several acquisitions in the crypto exchange market in the next few months.

You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Police-resistant To combat extortion and coercive policing in Nigeria, some, like Nigerian programmer Adebiyi David Adedoyin, are turning to bitcoin. Human Rights Watch has documented a trend in the country where police detain citizens, determine their life savings through force entry to their phones and seize it. It almost happened to Adedoyin. “The money they collected to let me go in that case would have been a lot more if I had more money in my account. But I had most of my money in bitcoin,” Adedoyin said. Police are less likely to look for a bitcoin wallet, he said.      Bitcoin fund Fidelity Investments’ chief strategist, Peter Jubber, is launching a new bitcoin index fund. Disclosed in a Wednesday morning filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ""Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund I, LP"" has a $100,000 minimum buy-in and is the latest example of Wall Street veterans warming up to bitcoin. Wise Origin links back to Fidelity Investments via Jubber and Fidelity's brokerage service and distribution subsidiaries, both of which are set to receive sales compensation from the new fund. It also shares a Boston office building with Fidelity, Danny Nelson reports.      Centralized censorship Thailand’s anti-government protests highlight the vulnerabilities of major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama reports. On Wednesday, Thailand’s digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta said authorities will continue an internet crackdown – including Facebook censorship and potential interference on Twitter – in an attempt to limit a groundswell of distributed political action in the country.      Exchange extortion The New Zealand stock exchange has halted trading for the third day in a row as a result of criminal cyberattacks. Targeted disruption from malicious actors have knocked the NZX exchange’s hosting service Spark has knocked it intermittently offline. The criminals, potentially connected to the Amada Collective and Fancy Bear cybergangs, are demanding bitcoin in order to cease the attacks. Over recent weeks, the group has also attempted to extort bitcoin from PayPal, MoneyGram, YesBank India, Braintree and Venmo, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports.      Blockchain on the LINE Messaging giant LINE has launched a wallet for users to manage digital assets and a blockchain platform where developers can issue their own tokens, tokenize digital assets and run decentralized applications (dapps).

The company, whose messaging app boasts 84 million users, aims to leverage its existing network to jumpstart the development of its token economies and accelerate adoptions of many dapps built on its proprietary blockchain platform – setting it apart from other messaging app blockchain experiments.

The Fed has left itself flexibility to change its monetary policy plans in the future, including letting inflation rise above its traditional 2% target. In his speech, Powell didn't rule out any use of its monetary policy tools, such as a broader expansion of its balance sheet to keep markets from tumbling if the economy worsens and bankruptcies increase.      It’s a speech that may have long-term implications on both bitcoin and ether, given the dollar’s relatively precarious position in the global financial system.      The implication for crypto is that the Fed will likely let inflation run hot for a few years, which could theoretically weaken the dollar and boost prices for bitcoin.      Thursday offers a reminder of just how dramatically once-slow-moving monetary forces have accelerated due to the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic. The national debt now stands at $26.5 trillion. Digital currencies are now being studied and pursued by central banks in China, the U.S. and just about everywhere else. Goldman Sachs recently warned the dollar risked losing its dominant reserve status, CoinDesk’s Bradley Keoun reports.    Market intel    Flat options Bitcoin’s options market foresees little price turbulence in the short term, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Bitcoin's implied volatility on one-month options, a gauge of the market's expectations for price movements, fell to the lowest level since July 25. Short-term price expectations have declined sharply from 70% to 52% over the past two weeks. This wait-and-see approach is happening ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address, in which he’s expected to signal tolerance for high inflation – a move that could weaken the U.S. dollar and propel bitcoin higher.

DeFi debate DeFi Pulse, run by the Concourse Open Community, has become the chief source of knowledge in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, pionering a metric called, ""Total Value Locked."" TVL represents the dollar value of all the tokens locked in the smart contract of a given decentralized lending project.

42432563,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNozHh,1598540898,Buggy Code Release Knocks 13% of Ethereum Nodes Offline,"A “critical bug” has left 13% of Ethereum nodes useless, highlighting what is a growing chink in the network’s armor: client centralization.      First hinted at in May and June on GitHub, minority clients Parity-Ethereum and OpenEthereum versions 2.7 and later contain an unknown critical bug that stops nodes from syncing with the network’s latest block.      Such bugs would be a normal issue if it weren’t for the length of time it will take to fix (weeks to months) and additional strain it’ll place on the majority client, Geth.      Clients themselves are different programming language implementations of blockchain software. Running multiple implementations together is considered a way to thwart network attacks by having concurrent yet separate systems running.      It’s proven to be a helpful model historically. For example, the 2016 Shanghai attacks saw Geth momentarily shut down following a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. Parity-Ethereum managed to keep the network afloat single handedly.      The Ethereum Foundation-backed Geth client now supports some 80% of the $43 billion network. This dependency is a recognized attack vector that has forced developers to postpone the July hard fork, Berlin, so minority clients could gain some traction.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns      Yet, eight weeks later Geth’s pie share has only grown larger. And it’s likely to climb as these broken node operators have a decision on their hands: turn off their client, back up to an old client version or swap to another client entirely.      Geth did not return questions for comment by press time.    Hot potato    It was an open secret among Ethereum developers that the Parity-Ethereum client was not up to spec. Indeed, OpenEthereum project manager Marcelo Ruiz de Olano told CoinDesk in a private message that his team found both unresolvable and “very severe issues affecting memory and disk usage.”      Parity Technologies, which originally founded the Parity-Ethereum client, stepped away from maintenance in December 2019, citing costs. The client was then handed off to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of developers funded by ConsenSys spinout Gnosis, called OpenEthereum.      A cursory glance comparing Geth’s and Parity-Ethereum’s codebase commits on GitHub, particularly after the December transition, leads to some more questions about the latter’s codebase integrity, as noted by non-custodial marketplace LocalCryptos in a May tweet.      Read more: OpenEthereum Supported 50% of Ethereum Classic Nodes. Now It’s Leaving the Project      In the meantime, the OpenEthereum team has urged node operators to turn back the clock to 2019’s version 2.5 to bring nodes back online. De Olano said he has four engineers on the project alone and hopes to have a workable client by mid-September. Still, client diversification will remain an issue without additional support, he said.      “Ultimately this is a community project to increase the client diversity in Ethereum and everyone's help is appreciated,” de Olano said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/buggy-code-release-knocks-13-of-ethereum-nodes-offline,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e5bb1ca50a6da54351a7e59053b40156c1a87d3-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Acala, a DeFi startup building on the Polkadot blockchain, has closed a $7 million simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) led by Pantera Capital. Other investors in the funding round include 1confirmation, Arrington XRP Capital, ParaFi Capital, Coinfund, Spartan Capital and others.      Polkadot is a blockchain designed both to easily integrate with other blockchains and to host a number of independent but interconnected chains. Acala functions as what the Polkadot ecosystem calls a parachain, allowing it to define the logic of the Acala ecosystem independent of other parachains.      ""Being able to customize chain logic and optimize for DeFi use cases are key,"" Bette Chen, chief operating officer of Acala, told CoinDesk in an email.      We've also recently seen excitement about DeFi reaching Cosmos; EOS has long had its own version of MakerDAO; and even Tron is chasing the latest buzz (though a massive exit by the tether stablecoin suggests it may not be working).      Read more: Proof-of-Stake Chains Team Up to Prove DeFi Is Bigger Than Ethereum      Acala's lead use case is creating a stablecoin, aUSD, with an eye on a suite of DeFi applications. It's already achieved locking up $52 million in value on its testnet, according to a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance.      ""Polkadot empowers an ecosystem of … domain-specific parachains optimized for their use cases,"" Chen wrote. ""Acala is a parachain optimized for DeFi.""    Need for speed    DeFi has been ruled by Ethereum so far, but it's also become a victim of its own success, with whopping gas fees eating up returns for smaller investors.      ""From a user perspective, they just want quality products on a fast chain and low fees. Ethereum is currently failing at the last two. New chains might be better,"" Arrington XRP Capital founder Michael Arrington told CoinDesk.      That said, it doesn't necessarily have to be that Ethereum loses users to Acala's parachain for this investment to be a success. DeFi is still relatively small. There could be room across multiple blockchains.      ""I don't think DeFi will jump from Ethereum to Polkadot. They are two distinct communities that have users with different preferences,"" Nick Tomaino of 1confirmation, another Acala investor, told CoinDesk in an email. ""DeFi on Ethereum is here to stay and will continue to grow.""      As developers work to establish a bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum, Chen is also mindful of interoperability.      ""We are working with teams building Ethereum bridges to fuel more cross-chain liquidity that'd benefit all DeFi users,"" she wrote.      Read more: Developers Eye Mid-September for Ethereum, Polkadot Bridge Proof-of-Concept      Tomaino pointed in particular to an innovation on Acala, called Liquid DOTs (LDOTS), where users can both stake for staking rewards and also borrow against that stake.      ""Staking is in a way competing with DeFi – users need to make a choice between staking yield and DeFi yield, as once an asset is staked, it cannot be used in other places,"" Chen wrote.    Acala's core function    Acala brings roughly the same mechanic to creating a stablecoin as that made famous by MakerDAO.      A user deposits an asset and borrows a portion of the value of that asset in the form of a newly minted token. On MakerDAO that's DAI and on Acala that's aUSD. This model has also been borrowed recently by Reflexer and Liquity.      Read more: Forthcoming Yield Farming Project Dispenses With Governance      Acala also has a governance token called ACA, that fills much the same role as MakerDAO's MKR.      By adding a decentralized exchange (DEX) to its suite of products, Acala is also able to improve user experience for both loan creation and loan liquidation.      On the front end, the DEX means users can pay transaction fees in whatever coin they need. So, for example, if they were going to lock up renBTC to borrow aUSD, they could also pay for the transaction in a tiny amount of renBTC rather than finding some DOT to cover fees.      And if a liquidation occurs, backstopping it with a DEX should mean the liquidated users get the best price for their collateral, which means they should get the maximum amount returned.      In short, Acala has several moving parts: a staking derivative with LDOT, a DEX and a stablecoin, among other facets.      Said Acala's Chen: ""The rationale behind the product suite we chose to build – we believe they are the minimum set of DeFi primitives we have to build in order to successfully bootstrap Acala and its ecosystem.""      In a press release, Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, wrote:    ""Acala will become the DeFi hub for the entire ecosystem. The company will bring financial stability, liquidity and accessibility, enabling a mainstream audience for financial freedom.""",POSITIVE,DOT | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MKR | SPONSORED,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/polkadot-based-acala-raises-7m-as-defi-grabs-land-on-another-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2de85c7981b12c0e0ff010d3d04409d9f194dbe2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNozJh,1598539193,The Importance of Randomness in the Internet Age,"David Dias is a research engineer at Protocol Labs. He specializes in peer-to-peer networking and distributed systems.      Electricity, water, gas – these are just some of the public utilities we use every day, whether for cooking food in the morning, heating homes throughout the day, or charging computers at night. But what about random numbers? Do we need a public source of randomness just like we need public sources for electricity and water?      You may never have imagined this need, but there is more to randomness than you might think. While random numbers might not sound like a public good, we actually rely on randomness for a host of socially useful things.      Good randomness, defined by having high entropy, is used in the cybersecurity of our smart devices, online gambling and cryptography. It prevents hacks, secures your private keys and is critical to the functioning of the internet. It also has applications in election systems by securing the auditing process.      See also: How a Decentralized Randomness Beacon Could Boost Cryptographic Security      Election integrity depends upon fair, effective and trustworthy auditing, and only randomness has been shown to eliminate bias from this human error-prone process. Using high entropy randomness in selecting ballots and districts to audit ensures that every audit remains both unbiased and unpredictable by attackers or hackers.      If the randomness that auditors use is low entropy or predictable, then election audits will be vulnerable to manipulation and cheating.      The same basic logic applies to all other randomness use cases, such as jury selection and statistical sampling. But just because randomness is necessary to a number of civic and private functions, doesn’t mean it should be provided by centralized actors, like the state.      Right now, true randomness is hard to source and deliver.      In fact, randomness sourced solely from algorithms is, strictly speaking, impossible. That’s because every software algorithm is functionally deterministic, designed to follow the rules of its programming to produce apparently random, but ultimately predictable outputs. As a result, most random number generators rely on seeding input from outside sources of entropy, such as small changes in user mouse movement or keystroke timing.    While random numbers might not sound like a public good, we actually rely on randomness for a host of socially useful things.    While outside sources of entropy do increase the quality of randomness output, they don’t guarantee bias resistance. Even the best random number generators are still vulnerable to manipulation.      In one high-profile case of randomness bias, an IT specialist was able to write malicious code that biased the randomness output of numerous state lottery systems and enabled him to game the lottery in his favor.      When money or crucial cybersecurity is on the line, it’s clearly not enough to just have randomness; the randomness sources have to be secure and bias-resistant. What’s more, for randomness to work as a public utility, we also need its sources to be publicly verifiable so that anyone can check whether the numbers they generate are truly random or not.      For years, computer scientists have proposed different solutions to the problem of how to generate good, bias-resistant and publicly-verifiable randomness at scale. Various projects, such as NIST’s randomness beacon, or the UChile generator are public random beacons backed by unpredictable, high entropy systems, however, these do not deliver a mechanism for publicly-verifiability of the randomness source.      However, none of these projects are decentralized nor provide publicly verifiable randomness, leaving them vulnerable to bias from inside the institutions responsible for generating the randomness they produce. A truly bias-resistant, trustless and decentralized source of good randomness has heretofore remained only possible in our imagination. That is, until now.      See also: Inside the Craze for Filecoin Crypto Mining in China      In July 2020, the League of Entropy, a consortium of diverse organizations from across the world, launched a major upgrade to its distributed randomness beacon, which now serves as a production-level public randomness service. This randomness beacon protocol, named drand, provides a universally accessible source of publicly verifiable, unbiased, and unpredictable randomness.      From a technical standpoint, drand is supported by a distributed network of participants each operating their own drand node. Since the process of generating randomness values is distributed across multiple participants, there is no single point of failure or bias that could corrupt or otherwise compromise drand’s randomness. Additionally, each new randomness value can be verified by a single public key, generated collectively by all partners in the network. Anyone with the public key can both verify that the message is correct and confirm the time it was generated.      On top of that, the League of Entropy itself implements a decentralized governance model and active network monitoring, both of which enhance network robustness and further ensure that no single entity or malicious actor can compromise the network. This bias resistance and security is a game changer for the internet and for every application in need of good randomness. Today, with rapid developments in the Internet of Things and the Blockchain space, there’s greater need for secure randomness than ever before.      That’s because many blockchains and devices on the Internet of Things rely on random values to work properly and securely. Filecoin, for example, uses a random lottery to elect each epoch’s leader and fairly allocate rewards; the project is the first production user of drand. The Internet of Things has a great need for randomness as other computers but, being simple and resource-constrained, are limited in the entropy they can access. A reliable, public source of randomness can help alleviate this shortage.      A true public good serves the world by being open-source, decentralized and fully verifiable. With drand, we can help bring about a fairer, more unbiased, and more secure digital space for the entire world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIL | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Dias,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/the-importance-of-randomness-in-the-internet-age,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db7612460d0f3f59caa94549ae21bb6b19992b06-2560x1702.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That's the main takeaway of a new Latin America report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. On Thursday, the startup revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that Venezuela ranks third in the world for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis metrics, behind Ukraine and Russia.      “The reason why it ranks so highly is the peer-to-peer marketplaces. That's why Venezuela stood out to us,” Chainalysis research lead Kim Grauer said in an interview.      The new data tells of a society so sick of hyperinflation that citizens are willing to turn to bitcoin (BTC) as a haven, Grauer said. They're getting their bitcoin from peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins, centers of Venezuela's burgeoning crypto scene.      Read more: A Rare Glimpse Into How Crypto Is Really Used in Venezuela      Meanwhile, Venezuela's government-approved exchanges are struggling to gain traction.      Criptolago, an exchange owned by the Venezuelan state of Zulia and one of only seven exchanges with government approval, eked out just $380,000 in dollar-adjusted volume over the last year, according to Chainalysis research.      LocalBitcoins reported $242 million in bolivar-to-bitcoin trading volume over the past 365 days, according to data site UsefulTulips. Over the same period, Paxful posted $311,000 in bolivar-to-bitcoin volume. (Paxful suspended payments with the Bank of Venezuela in June, citing U.S. sanctions.)      On-chain data suggests Criptolago is mostly being used by Venezuela's elite, according to Chainalysis. The majority of its bitcoin transactions – 75% are over $1,000 – are simply too large for vast swaths of the cash-poor country to afford.      See also: What Venezuelans Think About Bitcoin and American Media      Experts consulted by Chainalysis speculated that the wealthy are using Criptolago to preserve their riches or even evade sanctions. No matter their reasons, usage is increasing: Criptolago's bitcoin transfer volume in July 2020 was 13 times higher than it was one year ago.      ""From what we can identify, most of the activity on Criptolago is really large,"" Grauer said. ""It's just those transfers that are driving the [exchange's] growth overall.""

This is the third block of the firm by the Russian authorities and comes as the result of a lawsuit brought by Roskomnadzor, according to BestChange's head of public relations, Nikita Zuborev.  BestChange lists the current prices and liquidity supply at the most popular OTC brokers in Russia and its neighboring countries, but isn't involved in trades.  Previous lawsuits were successfully overturned by BestChange in court, Zuborev said.  While a court approved blocking of the websites including BestChange on Jan. 22, the firm was apparently only notified on July 23.  ""We always hear about the lawsuits 'accidentally,' we never get a subpoena [in time] and our lawyers always have to request a time extension to appeal first and then get to the lawsuit itself,"" Zuborev said.  The lawsuit also targeted cryptocurrency news websites and even an online flower shop, all of which, according to Roskomnadzor, were offering bitcoin for sale or goods in exchange for bitcoin.  ""The issuance and usage of bitcoin is decentralized and can't be controlled by the state, which violates Russian laws,"" the court's decision reads.  BestChange said it plans to appeal the ruling and recommended users either employ a proxy to get around the block or go to the ""mirror"" version of the website using its .net domain.  Bitcoin is not illegal in Russia, but it may not be used as a mean of payment, according to a bill recently signed into law by President Vladimir Putin.  As far back as 2015, Russia was trying to limit access to crypto-related websites, blocking even resources like Bitcoin.org.  The country's central bank said it supported such measures in 2017 if platforms were selling cryptocurrency in Russia.  BestChange saw almost 3.3 million views in July, with most traffic coming from Russia, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, according to SimilarWeb.  OTC is the most popular way to buy crypto in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States countries, Zuborev said.

The bridge will roll out in phases and should be production-ready by March 2021.    Phase one of three slated for release mid-September will include “a working demo of two-way transfer of assets [and] state from Ethereum to our testnet chain and in reverse,” Snowfork developer Aidan Musnitzky told CoinDesk in an email.  In a blog shared early with CoinDesk, Snowfork claims its bridge will be able to read Ethereum’s state trustlessly and vice versa. The team has identified two technical solutions to do so.  The project’s announcement follows the deployment of Polkadot’s Rococo parachain testnet on Aug. 6.  Snowfork itself is an “agency” of designers and developers who have previously worked on interoperability projects between Cosmos and Ethereum, the group said.  Polkadot’s native asset, dot, also recently became available for those who participated in the network’s multiple public and private token sales since 2016.

42432560,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNozBh,1598533219,Binance and Oasis Labs Launch Alliance to Combat Crypto Fraud and Hacks,"Leading crypto exchange Binance is launching the CryptoSafe Alliance platform in partnership with Oasis Labs, a data privacy company, to prevent and analyze cryptocurrency fraud.    Calling it the first industry group of its kind, the exchange said the CryptoSafe Alliance will begin by offering post-mortem analyses of any hack or breach of contributing members, allowing members to have a better understanding of how to avoid similar attacks in the future.  The alliance, which will be open to exchanges, blockchain protocols, cybersecurity experts and compliance firms, will maintain a so-called ""blacklist"" of member-submitted digital addresses.  According to a statement announcing the alliance, addresses will be blacklisted when they are found to be complicit in criminal activity such as money laundering, fraud, extortion or theft. Members will then be able to integrate the blacklist into their services to protect their own users.  “The CryptoSafe Platform is essentially a comprehensive database of wallet addresses, endpoint fingerprints and other related information as well as analysis tools and algorithms that support the fight against malicious behaviors including hacks,” the Binance security team said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Eventually, the platform will also provide proactive real-time fraud analysis for alliance members. Doing so will make it easier for members to combat cryptocurrency hacks and thefts and, in doing so, generally improve the standard for the industry, according to the statement.  “By forging closer ties between exchanges, security and compliance firms, and the crypto community, the CryptoSafe Alliance aims to strengthen the industry’s long-term defense against malicious behavior,” said Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.  Oasis Labs’ decentralized, privacy-preserving software will be the primary infrastructure provider.  “By using a combination of privacy-preserving technologies and a decentralized blockchain, the Oasis Network is able to ensure that the CryptoSafe Platform is trustless,” said Vishwanath Raman, Privacy Architect at Oasis Labs. “Each exchange that is part of the alliance can upload threat intelligence without it ever being shared with other partners.”  To do this, all transactions, from uploading data through running queries, are maintained in an immutable append-only ledger with confidentiality so that each member, or their designated auditors, can audit only their transactions, Raman said.  The platform supports the Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRX and EOS blockchains. Additional blockchain protocols and networks will be added later in the year.  Fee structure is decided on a case-by-case basis. Members that meet the alliance requirements of contributing and consuming data will be able to join without any fees. Members that consume data without contributing will be charged, with exact details on fees to be released at a later date.

42384567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcncT,1598532502,Commentary: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Details Inflation Target Changes,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell explains the U.S. central bank's economic approach, including how it will address its previous 2% inflation goal over the next decade.      CoinDesk First Mover Editor Bradley Keoun has already laid out the implications for the crypto space – you can read his article here.      Check this page for updates on commentary and analysis on the day's events. Watch Powell's comments here.      ND (10:00): Powell's done for the day. The symposium will continue through tomorrow, with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey giving a speech Friday morning.      BK (10:00): Based on the muted market reaction after Powell’s comments, nothing he said was very far out of line with expectations – that the Fed is comfortable letting inflation rise above its 2% target over the next few years. But the Fed has left itself flexibility to change its monetary-policy plans in the future. And certainly Powell didn’t rule out any use of its monetary-policy tools, such as a broader expansion of its balance sheet to keep markets from tumbling if the economy worsens and bankruptcies increase. Entirely possible – and within the new framework – that the Fed could come out with more trillion-dollar money infusions the next time markets start to falter/lurch.      BK (9:52): Bitcoin’s price rally post-Powell speech has faded, now down to ~$11,400 from ~$11,600 earlier:      ND (9:49): The banking system was ""well-capitalized and highly liquid,"" Powell says, addressing the pre-COVID-19 economy.      The point of the Fed's efforts across the last six months was not to stimulate the economy but ""provide a little bit of comfort"" to individuals and businesses: ""Our response was actually quite different from what it was in the financial crisis, so we could immediately cut rates to zero, we raised our asset purchases essentially without limit to support market function.""      The economy can recover – if the U.S. can keep the pandemic under control. The hard part is that a lot of communal activities (restaurant, hotel industries) might find it difficult to recover.      ND (9:47): Powell is saying more direct aid would be best but this is ""very hard for us to do""; says he'd look to policy to address this concern.      ND (9:46): Low-wage workers have been disproportionately harmed by the ongoing pandemic, Powell says. He says his institution can support a strong labor market to try and mitigate but this would need to be an ""all-governmental"" effort. [University of Michigan Provost Susan M. ] Collins asks if the Fed can take any additional efforts to support minority-businesses and institutions in particular.      BK (9:46): Powell says “our policies are for the benefit of all Americans” but notes that its tools are “blunt” and the real power on any “distributive” efforts lie with lawmakers.      BK (9:40): The dollar is choppy – hourly chart of euro exchange rate vs. dollar after Powell’s speech comes out:      ND (9:36): Powell says that ""public faith in large institutions around the world is under pressure,"" and he hopes being transparent will help address that. We've definitely seen skepticism in institutions like the Fed in our space. That Powell is acknowledging this doubt is interesting.      He also said he doesn't expect today's move to ""dictate"" particular outcomes, noting this is kind of a subjective effort.      BK (9:32): “People don’t generally think about inflation moving up as a good thing,” Powell says. Sort of the elephant-in-the-room question for most non-economics/finance geeks.      ND (9:29): Powell's prepared remarks have ended, but he's participating in a Q&A with University of Michigan Provost Susan M. Collins.      BK (9:28): Of course, as we’ve seen, the Fed changes its long-run policies pretty much whenever the circumstances require it to do so – with a new rationale for doing so.      And here, too, the central bank is giving itself an out: ""Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.”      BK: (9:26): Bitcoin's price rises 1.8% during Powell's speech.      BK (9:24): Fed will review longer-run goals and policies roughly every five years, according to the statement. Powell says new policy statement was “revised today with unanimous consent” from Fed officials, adds “a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.”      The implication for crypto is that the Fed will likely let inflation run hot for a few years, which could theoretically weaken the dollar and boost prices for bitcoin.      ND (9:21): The Fed just confirmed it's going to look for increasing inflation at times when needed. In an update to its statement of monetary policy strategy, the Fed says that if inflation falls below its 2% target consistently (as it has for most of the last decade), it will target inflation above 2%.    On price stability, the [Federal Open Market Committee] adjusted its strategy for achieving its longer-run inflation goal of 2% by noting that it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time."" To this end, the revised statement states that ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time.""    BK (9:16): Powell notes interest rates are close to the “lower effective bound” i.e. zero “even in good times” – while noting that productivity growth has declined in recent years – the ultimate driver of underlying economic growth.      ND (9:11): Powell is opening his remarks by explaining the history of the Fed's current inflation targets and why the central bank has approached previous targets the way it has.      ""Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency, designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions,"" he said. Bit of tea leaf reading but it sounds like he's expecting a change.      And, of course, monetary policy has evolved, he noted.      BK (9:11): Nothing new from Powell so far. He’s just walking through the recent history of monetary policy.      BK (8:40): The Federal Reserve has pumped about $3 trillion into the financial system this year to help markets recover from the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus. So far, consumer prices have stayed muted, perhaps due to the deflationary impact of slowing demand for goods and services from households and businesses. Powell is expected to discuss whether to explicitly embrace a new policy of allowing inflation to run above the central bank’s 2% annual target. That way, above-target inflation would offset periods of time (such as most of the past decade) where price rises have undershot the target.      Such an explicit commitment would imply to traders that the Fed would stay unusually dovish on inflation for years to come — letting inflation run hot, which likely could push up prices dollar-denominated assets like stocks, gold and bitcoin, since the currency’s purchasing power would be weakening by definition.      Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday the Fed might keep short-term interest rates close to zero for five years or more, under a policy that could be unveiled as soon as next month.      ND (8:40): Thirty minutes before Powell opens at the Jackson Hole Fed symposium, hosted by the Kansas City Fed, and the big question in and out of crypto will remain the economy. While Powell's keynote remarks are likely to draw the most attention, it'll be just as interesting to see what the panelists and guest speakers through the rest of the two-day symposium say.      Last year saw now-former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney discuss the need for a financial system which moves away from the dollar. That's significant in and of itself, but he coupled the suggestion with the idea that a synthetic hegemonic currency, created through a network of central bank digital currencies, could act as the dollar's replacement (among other alternatives).

At at the 2019 Jackson Hole gathering, then-Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned in a speech that the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency contributes to an unsustainable international economic and monetary regime. He argued that world leaders should create a “synthetic hegemonic currency,” potentially provided “through a network of central bank digital currencies.”      Fast forward to now, and the Jackson Hole conference has been forced to go virtual because of the coronavirus. Trump’s economic stewardship, including a U.S. stock market that many investors now say is propped up by the Fed’s $3 trillion of freshly printed money, has become a core issue in the 2020 presidential election. The national debt now stands at $26.5 trillion. Digital currencies are now being studied and pursued by central banks in China, the U.S. and just about everywhere else. Goldman Sachs recently warned the dollar risked losing its dominant reserve status.      “The pandemic has sped up key structural trends and triggered substantial market swings,” strategists for the $7 trillion money manager BlackRock wrote this week. ""The policy revolution was needed to cushion the devastating and deflationary impact of the virus shock. In the medium term, however, the blurring of monetary and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks.”      Many investors are betting on bitcoin as a hedge against the potential debasement of the U.S. dollar, but Fed officials say deflationary forces might be stronger because of an expected drop off in demand from consumers and households.      Crypto traders will focus in the short term on what the Fed’s speech might mean for bitcoin prices, which have surged almost 60% in 2020, far exceeding this year’s 7.7% year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks.      But the Fed’s actions could also have implications for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, where entrepreneurs are developing alternative currencies and semi-autonomous lending and trading networks that might one day replace the current financial system. There’s also a fast-growing business in dollar-linked “stablecoins,” with the amount doubling this year to $13 billion.      “So much has changed,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital. “There is this danger of the U.S. [dollar] in the future no longer being the world’s reserve currency. We are in a much worse position than we were in a year ago.”      Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote this week that Powell’s return to Jackson Hole comes at a time when “people are just starting to ask questions about the intrinsic value of money.”      “U.S. authorities have just taken on an inordinate amount of debt, more than they could possibly ever hope to pay back,” Greenspan wrote. “So the only viable option is to decrease the value of that debt by way of monetary debasement. It’s despicable and dangerous, but the only other option is austerity, which is too unpopular for any public servant to mention at this time.”    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin’s options market is foreseeing little price turbulence in the short-term despite central bank watchers expecting fireworks from the Federal Reserve on Thursday.    Bitcoin's implied volatility on one-month options, which gauges market's expectations for price gyrations over the four week period, fell to 52% early Thursday – the lowest level since July 25, according to data source Skew.  Short-term price expectations have declined sharply from 70% to 52% over the past two weeks.  The three-month gauge has pulled back from 80% to 68% and the six-month has declined from 80% to 72%.  Analysts expect Powell to signal tolerance for high inflation – a move that could weaken the U.S. dollar and propel bitcoin higher.  However, with strong expectations already built in, the scope for disappointment is high. The dollar may surge if Powell’s comments fall short of expectations.

42384568,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnbD,1598529697,Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Falls Sharply Ahead of Jerome Powell Speech,"Bitcoin’s options market foresees little price turbulence in the short-term, even as central bank watchers expect fireworks during a speech by the chairman of the Federal Reserve on Thursday morning.    Bitcoin's implied volatility on one-month options, a gauge of themarket's expectations for price gyrations over the four week period, fell to 52% early Thursday – the lowest level since July 25, according to data source Skew.  Short-term price expectations have declined sharply from 70% to 52% over the past two weeks.  Over three months, the gauge has pulled back from 80% to 68%, while the six-month line has declined from 80% to 72%.  At 9 a.m. Eastern today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce new measures from the central bank at his annual keynote at the Jackson Hole symposium.  Investors usually buy both calls (bullish bets) and puts (bearish bets) ahead of such key events, pushing implied volatility higher.  Analysts expect Powell to signal tolerance for high inflation – a move that could weaken the U.S. dollar and propel bitcoin higher.  However, with strong expectations already built in, the scope for disappointment is high, and the dollar may surge if Powell’s comments fall short of expectations.  The event, therefore, has potential to trigger big moves in either direction.  The lull in expectations for bitcoin price volatility may reflect that traders are playing a wait-and-see game until Powell's planned direction becomes clear.  That said, any potential volatility in the forex markets could feed into cryptocurrencies, as the inverse correlation between bitcoin and U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past few weeks.  The 60-day inverse correlation is now strongest in at least 16 months.  Further, the implied volatility terms structure remains steep, meaning the six-month implied volatility is still hovering above the three-month, which in turn is greater than the one-month metric.  That ""indicates that uncertainty is high,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based institutional brokerage BeQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $11,380, representing a 0.8% decline on the day.

Werner said Bunnel is ""an outstanding lawyer and a great guy.""  Bunnel brings considerable experience to the role having spent time at Homeland Security as general counsel, and before that holding the position of managing partner of the Washington, D.C., office of O’Melveny & Myers LLP, a large international law firm.  Earlier in his career, Bunnel spent several years at the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney's Office, per his LinkedIn profile.  The general counsel role meant Werner would have had to give up his seat on the board of directors at Deutsche Bank Trust Co., a position he told Bloomberg was unwilling to relinquish.

42384553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnKr,1598520630,"NYSE Can Allow Firms to Raise Funding Through Direct Listings, Says SEC","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to allow some companies to raise capital without the expense of an IPO.    In a Wednesday order, the SEC approved the exchange to amend Chapter One of the Listed Company Manual to allow firms to hold direct listings.  The move means companies can now launch a direct listing on the NYSE as an alternate to the initial public offering (IPO), generally preferred by the SEC.  The direct benefit means it would reduce costs associated with soliciting a bank to underwrite the transaction of an IPO.  Previously, companies that have sold common equity securities in a private placement were allowed to list shares on the NYSE ""solely"" to allow shareholders to trade the stock.  The rule change widens the scope to allow companies to list shares ""in addition to, or instead of"" facilitating shareholder sales.  Firms will be allowed the new listing on a case-by-case basis and must meet certain thresholds, including being likely to sell $100 million in shares on the first day of trading on the NYSE.  The so-called Primary Direct Floor Listing will also allow companies to avoid certain restrictions associated with IPOs, namely lockup periods that prevent insider trading.  The American Securities Association (ASA), a brokerage group, said direct listings without protections against insider trading would allow for nefarious actors to cash out at ""inflated valuations.""  That would leave ""Mr and Mrs. 401(k) holding the bag,"" the ASA wrote in a March letter addressed to the SEC as cited in the Wall Street Journal.  However, in the Wednesday order, the SEC said the NYSE's direct listing plans already had sufficient investor protections in place.  The changes come at a time when U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase is said to be preparing to list on the U.S. stock market sometime in early 2021 with preference given to a direct listing.  On Wednesday, the SEC also announced changes to the rules for accredited investors, slightly expanding the pool of Americans who can invest in private securities.

The most popular cryptocurrency options exchange, Deribit, is suffering a severe service outage.    According to company tweets early on Thursday, the trading platform is suffering ""hardware issues"" and a technician has been called to reboot its servers and bring services back to normal functionality.  ""We are not hacked and your funds are safe,"" an initial tweet stated.  Deribit went on to warn that it may not have its systems back online in time for today's daily options expiry.  In that case, the firm will ""manually adjust the options expiry to reflect the actual market at the time of expiry.""  The value used for the adjustment would be drawn from Deribit's index as listed on test.deribit.com.  However, the outage may knock confidence in the exchange with the news that Deribit doesn't seem to have server redundancy to avoid such severe ramifications from technical issues.  Similar issues have affected top U.S. spot exchange Coinbase in the past, leading it to eventually pledge to do more in terms of redundancy provision.  Deribit may, in fact, have been lucky the outage didn't occur Friday, when over $700 million-worth of monthly contracts are set to expire, most of them on Deribit.  Today's daily bitcoin option expiry is worth $22.8 million, alongside $6.5 million in ether options.

42384564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnZx,1598515200,Is This the Blockchain Firm That Will Get Enterprise to Finally Embrace Open Networks?,"Concordium, an ambitious project whose founders have close links to companies including Volvo, IKEA, Saxo Bank and Nasdaq, is looking to shake up the seemingly glacial world of enterprise blockchain.      The most striking thing about Concordium, which launches its third testnet next month, is the way it pushes what was once anathema to big corporates: public and permissionless blockchains.      Businesses, wary of tipping their hands and giving away any competitive advantage, have traditionally preferred the idea of private and permissioned blockchains. But many advocates of blockchain tech believe only open systems hold true transformational promise. The oft-cited analogy centers on the relevance of internet versus intranet.      Read more: ‘Boring Is the New Exciting’: How Baseline Protocol Connected With 600 Corporates      Toeing the line between the privacy requirements of regulated businesses and full-broadcast blockchains like those of Bitcoin and Ethereum has led some very smart people to opt for an attenuated architecture when it comes to distributed ledgers.      However, Concordium is confident it has found a third way, keeping sensitive data private using a clever identity and zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) system, providing firms with a safe, flexible option to deploy open blockchains.      The momentum around projects like Baseline Protocol, which now has some 600 big firms using it, is a solid indicator ZKP tech is ready for prime time.    ‘Something totally new’    According to Concordium CEO Lone Fønss Schrøder, sometimes you need a permission-based ledger; but in order to realize new business models, it has to come in combination with baked-in permissionless possibilities.      “I think that’s really what large corporations are looking for,” said Fønss Schrøder. “If you look at Hyperledger, for example, or R3, I don’t think it is blockchain in the sense of really providing something new. It’s not decentralized. Companies are seeing it as just another way to do their mainframe applications. But when you talk about permissionless blockchain, it’s something totally new.”      Blockchain today simply doesn’t meet the needs of corporations, says Fønss Schrøder, and a lack of permissionless flexibility has led to no uptick in business adoption.      Concordium’s chief marketing manager, Beni Issembert, went further: Businesses underwhelmed by today’s enterprise blockchain offerings are squarely in Concordium sights.      “Businesses that are open-minded feel a lot of frustration and desolation when it comes to using Hyperledger and R3 Corda. And we are talking to those disappointed businesses,” Issembert said.    Big-name partners    It would be easy to write Concordium off as some kind of naive newcomer – both R3 and Hyperledger declined to comment on the Concordium white paper.      But the project, which has its roots in Denmark, features an impressive cast of players from business and academia. On the science side, Concordium’s research center at Denmark’s Aarhus University is run by widely cited cryptographer Ivan Damgard. Last September, Torben Pryds Pedersen, creator of the Pedersen Commitment cryptographic primitive, was appointed as Concordium’s CTO.      Read more: Staying Alive: Why the World of Enterprise Blockchain Has Turned to Collaborations      In terms of corporate clout, Fønss Schrøder is a boardroom director at IKEA, vice chairman of Volvo and spent 22 years at A.P. Moller Maersk. Concordium’s founder, Lars Seier Christensen, founded Saxo Bank in 1992, while the blockchain’s advisers include former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and heavy hitters from Nasdaq, Mastercard and Skype.      It’s one thing to announce a paradigm shift in the way businesses intend to use blockchain technology, but another to show hard evidence of this new permissionless demand.      “We are already in contact with those people [Volvo and IKEA] and looking at ways to fulfill what they would like to do. But we are not only targeting 20 or 40 businesses,” said Issembert. “We are focused on the next generation of commerce, the new unicorns; firms that you don’t have to convince the best approach is an open system.”    Open use cases    It should be pointed out that Volvo has blazed a trail when it comes to tracking the minerals used in electric car batteries with the help of Hyperledger Fabric. IKEA has also done some interesting blockchain experiments with the likes of Tradeshift using the Maker protocol.      Neither Volvo nor IKEA would confirm to CoinDesk whether they were testing Concordium at this time.      Read more: IKEA in ‘World First’ Transaction Using Smart Contracts and Licensed E-Money      If large corporations have been mostly happy with proofs-of-concept using closed enterprise blockchains, what are the new use cases that open systems like Concordium can offer?      Fønss Schrøder said a major opportunity exists in rethinking the way procurement and supply chains work, for example. (In terms of new entrants to the enterprise blockchain space, there have also been some interesting moves from the EOS ecosystem, particularly in Latin America.)      “It could be smart contracts, which actually will function as marketplaces for you and your whole procurement sector,” said Fønss Schrøder. “I think about what Maersk has been doing, but the disadvantage for Maersk is that this should never have been built on a permission-based blockchain; it should have been permissionless. But that’s the kind of logistical use case I’m sure we will be able to support.”      Volvo board member Fønss Schrøder also sees plenty of uses for open blockchains in the car industry, across secondary markets, for instance, and the service agreements that come with that.      “Nearly every car sold by Volvo has some kind of lease arrangement or car-care, and blockchain is well suited to support this on the insurance side and on the service side,” said Fønss Schrøder.    Public, but private    As far as the ZKP secret sauce, Issembert called this the “backbone of the network,” but could not disclose details.      “For the ZKP design approach, we are going to come to the market with our own solution. It’s not something that has been seen yet,” he said.

42384563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnTf,1598488971,LINE Launches Digital Asset Wallet and Blockchain Development Platform,"Messaging giant LINE has launched a wallet for users to manage digital assets and a blockchain platform where developers can issue their own tokens, tokenize digital assets, and run decentralized applications (dapps).    LINE’s development platform aims to allow companies to easily introduce blockchain technology, CoinDesk Japan reported.  LVC Corporation, operator of the company’s crypto and blockchain businesses, and LINE TECH PLUS PTE unveiled the platform, LINE Blockchain Developers and BITMAX Wallet on Wednesday. The wallet services are now only available in Japan, where LINE is particularly well-known.  The company is developing the proprietary LINE Blockchain and issued its own token LINK (LN) for trading against several major crypto assets such as bitcoin and ether in 2018.  LINE also started offering trading services via its crypto exchange Bitbox. It was approved for a crypto business license in September 2019.  The company established the LINE Blockchain Lab in April 2018, which has been tasked to build the LINE Token Economy.  LINE, with more than 84 million users in its messaging app, aims to leverage its existing network to jumpstart the development of its token economies and accelerate adoptions of many dapps built on its proprietary blockchain platform.  The company is one of a handful of messaging apps that have tried to develop blockchain technology and issue their own tokens, but it stands out for the progress it has made.  Canadian messaging company Kik and Russia-originated Telegram have met with lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their controversial fundraising processes called Initial Coin Offering (ICO), while American messaging giant Facebook’s stablecoin project Calibra is stalled and facing major challenges from the U.S legislators and financial authorities.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/27/line-launches-digital-asset-wallet-and-blockchain-development-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b59765b7a4c56a91d1f050b91aa5a5636e799f96-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAcnM7,1598486460,How OSL Became the First Crypto Exchange to Win Over Hong Kong Regulators,"When Hong Kong regulators gave crypto firm OSL a nod of approval last week, it was the icing on the cake for the HKEX-listed digital asset trading platform.      Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) granted BC Group crypto subsidiary OSL an “approval-in-principle” for its license application for Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 7 (automated trading service or ATS), as it pertains to crypto and virtual assets.      The bigger picture is that Asian crypto hubs like Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan have a clearer regulatory stance going forward and are progressing faster than the U.S. and Europe. Perhaps this should be expected, given that Asia remains the global leader in terms of crypto trading volumes.      “I think regulatory progress has been so much more significant than in North America,” OSL CEO Wayne Trench said in an interview. “You’ve got regulators who’ve been front-foot trying to embrace this movement and embrace the technology. The West is perhaps slightly less developed with more obscurity or uncertainty, which just really makes it difficult right for the traditional institutions to engage.”      Read more: Hong Kong Regulator Gives Crypto Exchange OSL Tentative Licensure Approval      This is not to say Hong Kong is delivering light-touch regulation when it comes to virtual assets; quite the opposite, said BC Group CEO Hugh Madden.      “The SFC flies very carefully and is heavily focused on consumer protection,” Madden said. “If you look at the details of the SFC’s licensing framework, it’s quite specific. They prescribed mandatory insurance to protect consumers with specific percentages for hot and cold storage. When you add in the levels of controls, capital and scale of your organization, it’s really quite a tough hurdle.”      The SFC did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      OSL, which states it is the first crypto company to be granted provisional approval by the SFC, has acquired insurance cover for both hot (connected to the internet) and cold (fully offline) storage of digital assets but declined to go into details of the size of cover or markets providing it. OSL is also set apart from other crypto plays in that it’s audited by Big Four accounting firm PwC.      Read more: Crypto.com Lands Record $360M Insurance Cover for Offline Bitcoin Vaults      In terms of timelines, Madden said if all the SFC’s supervisory requirements are met, OSL should have its full license by the end of this year.    Asian autonomy    The SFC announced its regulatory framework for virtual asset trading platforms back in November 2019, emphasizing the regulator would only grant licenses to platform operators meeting standards comparable to licensed securities brokers and automated trading venues.      “With the license in principle given to OSL now, it would appear the SFC is keen to promote the licensing framework that was clarified last November,” said Malcolm Wright of industry group Global Digital Finance.      Read more: PwC Report Shows Major Growth in Crypto M&A in Asia and Europe      Wright, a compliance expert based in Hong Kong, said Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong have a natural advantage in that they are able to develop their frameworks with relative autonomy.      “The U.S. and Europe are more complex environments,” he said via email. “For Europe, first there needs to be European agreement (e.g., 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive) and then each country has to implement it into law – a process that can take several years to complete and can still lead to unevenness in regulatory approach.”    ‘Travel Rule’ landscape    OSL and BC Group have also earned their regulatory chops thanks to their close involvement with the Travel Rule Protocol (TRP), a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “Travel Rule” solution for crypto led by Dutch lender ING and Standard Chartered Bank, and including Fidelity Digital assets and BitGo.      Read more: In Banking First, ING Develops FATF-Friendly Protocol for Tracking Crypto Transfers      Madden pointed out that OSL has license applications underway in both Hong Kong and Singapore. He has personally followed the progress of FATF rules for crypto closely in Asia and internationally, and has had the chance to engage with multiple regulators.      Madden described the Travel Rule solution jurisdictional map as “an interesting landscape,” with virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in the large economies tending to be more domestically focused, while very trade-oriented financial centers are working in a more international fashion.      “Fortunately, we’re all well-known to each other, and all the groups are brilliant at communications in order to try and stay aligned,” Madden said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/27/how-osl-became-the-first-crypto-exchange-to-win-over-hong-kong-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f794646980acf503b426497a406da9f49439788-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
