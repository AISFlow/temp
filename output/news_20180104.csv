42380217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTTT,1515109072,"Dogecoin Market Cap Hits $1 Billion, to Its Creator's Dismay","Dogecoin, the parody coin named for an internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, has broken off the leash.  Nearly forgotten since its heyday in 2014, over the past month the cryptocurrency's price has increased more than 400 percent, setting a new all-time high Thursday above $0.01.  This price surge pushed dogecoin's market capitalization above $1 billion, data from CoinMarketCap shows.  Yet while more than $101 million in trading volume was seen in dogecoin over the past 24 hours, the creator of the project is worried this is a sign of broader market excess.  ""The fact that most conversations happening in the media and between peers focus on the investment potential is worrying, as it draws attention away from the underlying technology and goals this movement was based [on],"" said Jackson Palmer, the founder of the cryptocurrency who left the team in 2015.  He continued:  I have a lot of faith in the Dogecoin Core development team to keep the software stable and secure, but I think it says a lot about the state of the cryptocurrency space in general that a currency with a dog on it which hasn't released a software update in over 2 years has a $1B+ market cap.  But while current dogecoin developers seemed equally surprised by the momentum, they showed more enthusiasm.  ""To me, this proves that we don't need shiny features or a ton of innovation and even with a conservative – and in my own case completely distracted – development team for a boom,"" said developer Patrick Lodder.  Max Keller, another dogecoin developer, echoed that sentiment, saying, ""It's a little scary when you work on software that powers a billion dollar network. This is quite the responsibility. And also one of the main reasons why we are so reluctant to just slap any 'innovative' tech into the reference client. Still, I am proud of what we achieved and thankful to be part of such a great community.""  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of dogecoin started to climb around May 2017 after years of stagnation. Technology development on the tongue-in-cheek token has proceeded in fits and starts, namely because its developers are all volunteers, contributing to it in their spare time.

In a blog post, the company, which currently allows customers to buy, sell, deposit or withdraw bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and most recently, bitcoin cash, said it wanted to explain its process for adding new assets.  The post cited last year’s Digital Asset Framework announcement, where GDAX outlined the criteria it would follow when considering whether to add a new token or coin to its exchange. The company then stated:  “As of the date of this statement, we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.”  The update follows rumors that the exchange would add Ripple’s XRP token, and marks the first statement Coinbase made on the matter.  Over the last few weeks, XRP has been on a run, hitting an all-time high of $3.84 on Thursday, according to data site CoinMarketCap. Just three weeks ago the token was trading for less than a dollar.  XRP fell on Thursday to $3.52 at press time, but maintains its position as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

42380201,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTEN,1515101968,CFTC to Meet On Bitcoin Futures Self-Certification Issue,"Two committees of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission will hold meetings this month on digital currency matters, including the self-certification process used to approve new cryptocurrency derivatives products.  In a statement issued Thursday, CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said the commission's technology advisory committee would discuss how virtual currencies could be used broadly, while the market risk advisory committee would hold a meeting on the self-certification process for new products and rules surrounding the product's markets.  Last month, a few days after futures exchanges CME Group and the Cboe announced they would launch bitcoin futures contracts, the Futures Industry Association (FIA), an organization of U.S. clearinghouses, said its members were worried about having to pay for outstanding contracts caused by bitcoin's price changes. The group's purpose is to act as a safety net for when a company cannot pay out its contracts.  At the time, the FIA said a public discussion should have occurred before allowing either CME Group or the Cboe to complete self-certification procedures due to bitcoin being a non-standard product.  While Giancarlo did not share any expectations from the meetings in terms of new regulatory policy proposals, he did say ""the responsible regulatory response to virtual currencies is consumer education, asserting CFTC authority [and] surveilling trading in derivative and spot markets,"" among other actions.  Giancarlo said the CFTC is ""cognizant"" of the risks related to virtual currencies, specifically referring to bitcoin when saying:  ""In addition to the nascent stage of the technology itself, risks associated with virtual currencies include: operational risks of unregulated and unsupervised trading platforms; cybersecurity risks of hackable trading platforms and virtual currency wallets; speculative risks of extremely volatile price moves; and fraud and manipulation risks through traditional market abuses of pump and dump schemes, insider trading, false disclosure, Ponzi schemes and other forms of investor fraud and market manipulation.""  The CFTC also released an explainer for investors outlining its approach to futures markets based on cryptocurrencies.  'High Risk of Fraud'  Separately from the CFTC announcements, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) released a warning on Thursday to investors interested in token sales, cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency derivatives products, including futures contracts.  According to the warning, a survey found that 94 percent of state and provincial securities regulators think there is a “high risk of fraud” surrounding cryptocurrencies. A full 100% of those surveyed believed that greater investor protections need to be implemented through regulation.  The group specifically cited “initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency-related investment products as emerging investor threats for 2018."" The organization's president, Alabama Securities Commission director Joseph Borg, said ""wild price fluctuations"" can encourage potential investors to place funds into high-risk products they do not necessarily understand.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a statement supporting the NASAA warning, noting that investors are protected by state and federal securities laws that sellers must follow.  However, the SEC statement went on to say “it is clear that many promoters of ICOs and others participating in the cryptocurrency-related investment markets are not following these laws.”  The statement went on to note that while the commission would investigate such violations, it could not guarantee that investors would be able to recover lost or stolen funds. The statement concluded with a recommendation that anyone considering investing in token sales read the NASAA warning.  J.

42380206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTLv,1515098235,$100 Billion Controversy: XRP's Surge Raises Hard Questions for Ripple,"Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is on a bull run.  According to CoinDesk data, the price of XRP is up over 1,000 percent in just the last month alone, eclipsing $3.50 per coin Thursday after spending much of 2017 under $0.30. With a market capitalization above $120 billion, the token has usurped ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin, and social media is rife with speculation about when it might take first place.  But where some might see the kind of meteoric growth that's often associated with a breakout product, industry insiders have been quick to tap the brakes.  Rather than herald the run-up as a success story, some are using the spotlight to revive long-standing controversies that have dogged the Ripple blockchain network, the startup that created it and its fair-weather approach to marketing the cryptocurrency.  Indeed, founded with the mission to bring bitcoin's decentralized, cryptographic architecture to financial services, Ripple has had a complex relationship with XRP – at times touting it as a way for banks to transact seamlessly across borders, while at other points describing it as a benign value-add to enterprise versions of the company's software.  Such hot-and-cold thinking has long been on display in the company's public remarks on the subject.  As far back as 2012, for instance, the founder and former CEO of Ripple, Chris Larsen, spoke of the service as a bitcoin-like payment system. Only a couple years later, Larsen was de-emphasizing XRP's role, telling the Financial Times, ""The world is not going to adopt a new math-based currency.""  Seemingly aligning with a rise in regulatory concerns over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, executives at Ripple even explained to Fortune in 2014 that its cryptocurrency is not meant to be a store of value or a medium of exchange.  And there were times when Ripple leadership hesitated to call XRP a cryptocurrency at all.  Asked directly about its use of terminology in 2016, Larsen pegged the decision to marketing, dismissing the term outright. ""It's not powerful,"" he said then. ""I think sometimes the word 'crypto,' branding-wise, is less institutional than 'digital asset.'""  Yet, as the term ""cryptocurrency"" has come back into fashion over the past year, that narrative has changed.  In contrast to his predecessor, Brad Garlinghouse, who replaced Larsen as CEO when he stepped down at the beginning of 2017, has proclaimed the value of cryptocurrency, specifically XRP.  And in interview with CoinDesk Thursday, Asheesh Birla, who's been the vice president of product at Ripple for five years, said he doesn't remember anyone at the company downplaying the necessity of digital assets. Rather, he said:  ""What we did realize is that there is a pragmatic way of developing use cases that will use digital assets. I think that is a very pragmatic approach of building a payments solution. I think the patience, and the pragmatic nature that we’re working towards is paying off.""  And Birla has a point – three years ago digital assets were thinly traded compared to today, so it was hard to market XRP as a liquidity play.  Yet the company's shift in tone, coupled with the XRP cryptocurrency's recent boom, has brought out a sea of critics who want to take Ripple to task for its seemingly opportunistic stance.  However, they're being met by an equally strong force: a new group of crypto adopters who, all of a sudden, see XRP as an affordable way to get exposure to cryptocurrency and relieve their FOMO.  The XRP faithful  Given the passionate support of its online fanbase, it's perhaps not a surprise that Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has attracted interest, especially as new investors seek to diversify in the cryptocurrency market.  For instance, Ripple evangelist and XRP bull Tiffany Hayden wondered in a tweet whether XRP could jump 740 percent to reach $20 a coin, and while that might seem a stretch, it sounds more plausible when considering that XRP gained 30,000 percent over 2017.  Further, according to a tweet from Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, if XRP's price stayed around where it's at today and bitcoin's stayed around $15,000 a coin, by the time each of those network's cryptocurrency units (100 billion for XRP, 21 million for bitcoin) had been released, the XRP Ledger would have a network value greater than bitcoin's.  Since bitcoin hit $20,000 this past December, a slew of cryptocurrencies have reached new all-time highs, some even outperforming bitcoin by leaps and bounds. But what sets XRP's activity apart may be the sheer volume of crypto enthusiasts who, seemingly, are working under cloudy impressions of the industry.  In speaking with retail buyers, CoinDesk has found that, for some, XRP is their very first foray into cryptocurrency. In one conversation, a source, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that a friend had pushed him to buy XRP.  This investor also cited other reasons for taking the plunge:  ""Surely, because of the advantage of transferring funds very quickly and efficiently anywhere in the world; also its endorsement by [potentially] Amazon and Amex. It didn't hurt that it went from 20 cents to $1 rather quickly.""  It's an interesting answer that sheds light on the state of the crypto industry as it moves into 2018.  Bogged down – at least in the eyes of new investors – by a years-long technical debate, bitcoin seems to have lost its hold on the faster, more efficient payment method use case. In turn, cryptocurrencies that seem more mainstream (such as XRP in its proximity to Ripple) are looking more attractive to rookies.  Yet, the partnerships Ripple has forged recently hide an inconvenient truth – that enterprises using Ripple's services aren't necessarily using XRP.  And as such, XRP investors might not understand they're buying into a cryptocurrency very different from bitcoin and the others that have gained widespread attention over the years.  Without XRP  Case in point: While XRP investors might be charmed by the thought of holding a cryptocurrency that one day a large swath of the banking system may use, the vast majority of Ripple's banking clients are using the company's xCurrent product – a glorified messaging platform.  This product provides banks with real-time, bi-directional messaging with which they can track and manage cross-border payments, and is superior, Ripple executives say, to SWIFT's messaging platform, which only allows for one-way communication.  So for instance, if an account number, name or some other data needed to send a payment gets mistyped when sending a SWIFT message, that message must go through its life cycle before the error can be corrected, with the receiving party sending back an error-and-cancellation message. The sending bank then has to go find where it messed up, and once the errors are corrected, a new transaction must be initiated. (However, SWIFT recently revealed a real-time gross settlement platform and is experimenting with blockchain technology to enhance its processes.)  Ripple's platform, on the other hand, allows senders and receivers to communicate in real time, so simple errors can be fixed quickly, and transactions aren't canceled, but instead merely put on a momentary hold of sorts.  Laid out to CoinDesk during the company's inaugural Swell conference in Toronto in October, Ripple's main product doesn't involve its XRP token at all.  Onstage during the event, a number of banks using xCurrent asserted that they would not be using XRP anytime soon, contrary to what XRP investors might be banking on today.  And xCurrent is the platform American Express is using. In mid-November, Amex announced that it had partnered with Ripple to connect Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the U.K. using British pounds.  During the launch, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, told CoinDesk that Amex and Santander were connected directly with no need for an intermediary cryptocurrency.  Yet, the price of XRP rallied on that news, hitting a high, for the time, around $0.30 per coin.  And now, with the price of XRP continuing its upward momentum, there seems to be another pump based on misperceptions about the Amex relationship and speculation that Amazon will accept XRP sometime this year – both were mentioned by the anonymous neophyte as reasons he's investing in XRP.  Secondly, many investors new to the cryptocurrency space might not be aware of where all the XRP actually exist. Unlike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, XRP isn't created on a particular timeline through mining – or the act of securing decentralized networks.  Instead, the 100 billion XRPs (the cryptocurrency's coded limit) are already available, with most under the control of Ripple itself. Ripple currently controls about 61 billion XRP, although in May (where the price ranged from 5 cents to 41 cents) the company announced it would move to lock up 55 billion XRP is escrow, to be released at a rate of 1 billion a month for at least four and a half years.  According to Birla, that lock-up started in December, and any XRP not used during the month is put back into the escrow accounts.  In May, Garlinghouse told CoinDesk funds were being spent at a rate of 300 million per month, but Birla declined to disclose any updates to that number.  Yet, Birla did say, with the price increase, the company would be re-evaluating what it needs.  What's wrong?  First and foremost, XRP's rise on old news and unconfirmed speculation displays one of the challenges within the crypto market – that there's no foolproof way to value cryptocurrencies.  And not only that, but the definition of cryptocurrency is a bit murky as well. Because XRP's use is fixed to the Ripple Network, its protocol doesn't involve any mining and Ripple itself controls the majority of tokens, many long-time crypto enthusiasts would put XRP in a separate (albeit in some ways similar) bucket from bitcoin and other, more decentralized cryptocurrency projects.  ""XRP will go down as the Icarus of cryptocurrency,"" tweeted Preston Byrne, an outspoken blockchain pundit, referencing a Greek mythological tale about hubris.  In an interview, Byrne said he finds extremely troubling the trend of private companies issuing their own monies, retaining some for employee compensation and working capital, listing them on exchanges for speculation and then selling their monies on those exchanges to fund operations.  Byrne, the founder of Tomram Consultancy and former general counsel of blockchain startup Monax, told CoinDesk:  ""The scale of this activity has become distinctly market-distorting. My greatest fear is that these schemes could, if left unchecked, lead to a systemic crisis.""  And chief among the criticisms leveled at Ripple is that the project is not truly decentralized, and so is little more than blockchain hype on a traditional system.  The bitcoin developer and perennial blockchain skeptic Peter Todd has recently taken to tweeting a number of his concerns, and while they're all focused around the question of decentralization, his real uneasiness with Ripple revolves around the company's opaqueness.  Ripple relies on a Unique Node List (UNL) – currently encompassing five core validators all run by Ripple – when matters of consensus need to be determined. According to Ripple, it cannot recommend any new validators to this list. In Todd's interpretation, Ripple has been slow to add new nodes to the UNL primarily because these validators must be trusted entities that stay in consensus with Ripple itself.  And while a number of people and organizations run nodes on the Ripple network, according to Todd, choosing to route transactions through a node that's not a part of the UNL means that if your node comes to a different determination about the state of consensus than those nodes run by Ripple, it could split you off onto a separate ""Ripple"" chain.  While Birla seemed to acknowledge the issue in conversation, he also said XRP Ledger (which was rebranded from Ripple Ledger last year) was decentralized in that it is open for anyone to use or build on top of.  ""Anyone can download the XRP ledger package and become a validator and start broadcasting immediately, but getting everyone else to listen to you is a second point,"" Birla said.  To address the paltry number of trusted nodes on the UNL (in comparison, bitcoin has about 10,000 validating nodes and ethereum has about 30,000), Ripple released a scaling roadmap which stated it intends to increase the number of trusted nodes on the UNL to 16 over the next 18 months.  But according to Todd:  ""The really dangerous thing here is Ripple's technical documentation doesn't make any of these risks clear – nowhere do they describe in detail how nodes can fall out of consensus with one another if their UNLs don't match.""  First step  Todd continued, saying that for Ripple's bank clients, being transparent about it's model as a centralized system that users can fully validate shouldn't be much of a problem..  ""For some customers that may even be seen as an advantage,"" Todd told CoinDesk.  Yet, he alleges that Ripple muddies the waters because ""they don't want the market to lose confidence in XRP.""  This much is clear: right now the market has a lot of confidence in it.  Yet, while it seems people are rushing into XRP ahead of any real use of the cryptocurrency, Birla said that more companies will be announcing their use of XRP in the first quarter of 2018.  Birla said he expects a ""full list"" of XRP users this year, telling CoinDesk about the xRapid product, which is basically xCurrent with XRP on top:  ""There is a whole pipeline of folks now integrating into that product. We'll release names early this year.""  He continued, saying the success of getting banks to use Ripple's non-cryptocurrency-related products is positioned as the first step of a bigger plan to move banks to XRP.  And Ripple has had success in getting financial institutions to see the value in its xCurrent product. In total, since it started its ""war"" on SWIFT and the legacy financial system, more than 100 companies have joined its network.  As far as XRP itself is concerned, though, only one company has publicly revealed its use of the cryptocurrency. In October, Mexican financial services firm Cuallix partnered with Ripple to convert cross-border fund transfers into XRP for easy delivery between currencies.  When asked whether new XRP investors understand the relationships between Ripple, its clients and XRP, Birla said, ""Big names like Amex and smaller names, like other companies were signing, are all helping build out the network. We're adding on the liquidity [part] after that"" – that is, the xRapid product that uses XRP.  He continued, ""We've been really clear. The way that we looked at solving problems was a very methodical approach, a pragmatic approach.""  According to him, XRP's use case couldn't be realized until Ripple had built out the network.  ""We've identified a use case, we've identified a pain point, we have real customers using our product,"" Birla said, concluding:  ""We have continued to get market traction.

TimefireVR Inc, an Arizona-based company that was founded in 2014 to develop a virtual reality application platform, announced Thursday in a release that the company has sold its virtual reality assets as part of its strategy shift to investing in cryptocurrencies and the potential acquisition of blockchain technologies.  The firm, publicly listed on OTCQB, an over-the-counter exchange platform operated by the OTC Marketplace Group, has since seen a 200 percent price surge, according to data from Yahoo Finance.  After closing at $0.03 on Jan. 3, the penny stock saw a high open at $0.1 today, and dropped slightly to $0.0938 as of press time. Other public stocks have seen a similar trend. In recent months, the biotech company BiOptix and beverage firm Long Island Iced Tea both recorded major price jumps after rebranding to Riot Blockchain and Long Blockchain, respectively, a new focus that was reportedly related to the blockchain technology.  Also notably following such market movements, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization (SRO) in the U.S., issued a warning to investors, urging them to be cautious about stocks that tout involvement in blockchain or cryptocurrencies and subsequently see a stock price increase.  In addition, the firm said in the release that it has hired Jonathan Read as its CEO. Read, who has been a director of the TimefireVR since August 2017, served as a board director of BTCS, a publicly traded bitcoin startup since July last year.  While indicating the new strategy will focus on ethereum, the firm has yet to respond to an inquiry asking for clarification whether such investment refers to owning the ethereum tokens or developing smart contract applications on top of the ethereum blockchain.

42380213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTUj,1515090352,Ripple Fever? Other Crypto Assets Are Outpacing Its 2018 Gains,"So-called alternative cryptocurrencies are making their presence felt in the first week of 2018, recording impressive gains that are drawing investors to options once considered risky.  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied 1,900 percent last year. But, as prices neared the $20,000 mark in December, the relatively cheap ""small cap"" coins began to rise. With gains due, in part at least, to the rotation of money out of an overbought bitcoin, the broader cryptocurrency rally seems to have gathered pace in 2018.  With 66 percent appreciation so far in 2018, Ripple's XRP token is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That's impressive, yet XRP still ranks sixth on the list of top gainers so far this year, among those ranked in the top 25 by total value, as of 18:00 UTC.  So which ""large-cap"" cryptocurrencies are leading the pack?  Top 10 cryptocurrencies of 2018 by percentage gained  Overall, the TRON token tops the table with 270 percent gains since Jan. 1. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 100 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and its market cap has tripled this week to $10 billion.  In second place is the status network token (SNT) – an ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has gained more than 160 percent in value this year and is up 700 percent month-on-month. Stellar, which topped the list two days ago, has slipped to number three. It is now the seventh largest currency with a market cap of $9.97 billion.  And although at a record high of over $1,000 today, ethereum's native token ether (up 28 percent this year) sits at the bottom of the table in 10th place.  Interestingly, bitcoin ranks as low as 18 (up 2 percent this year), as prices have traded roughly sideways since the fall from its December all-time high.

42380202,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTGt,1515085231,Report: PBoC Quashes Bitcoin Mining Ban Rumor in China,"The People's Bank of China has put to rest a rumor that it would order a domestic shutdown of bitcoin mining activities, according to a local media outlet.  The report, published on Jan. 4 by the Chinese business publication Caixin, said that China's central bank did not host any meetings to discuss a policy requiring the closure of bitcoin mining operations in the country by a certain deadline. The meeting had supposedly taken place on Jan. 3.  However, Caixin's report, which did not identify its sources, indicates that top regulators in China are planning to withdraw preferential benefits such as tax deductions and cheap electricity supplies available to bitcoin mining companies.  This means the government's current stance on bitcoin mining is to neither encourage nor hamper such activities. This change is the latest move from Chinese regulators in the cryptocurrency industry after previously issuing a ban on initial coin offering and tightening restrictions on crypto exchanges.  According to the report, the rumor first emerged through a photo on the WeChat messaging platform that purportedly showed Guo Hongcai, a notable and active investor in the bitcoin industry in China, claiming there would be a ban. Guo later said that this image was fake through his WeChat account.  Despite his disavowal, a Chinese bitcoin blog, 45-block, published a report that the PBoC was discussing a ban on bitcoin mining. The same report also said the central bank would soon require government bodies at different levels to survey and report on the number and locations of bitcoin mining facilities within their territories in an effort to shut down such activities.  The claim was significant given that China currently accounts for nearly 70 percent of the global hash power in bitcoin, a computing capacity that is crucial to solve the mathematical function to mine the cryptocurrency.  However, upon inquiries, Bixin and ViaBTC, two cryptocurrency mining pools based in China, told CoinDesk over WeChat messages that they had received no information regarding the issue from regulators.

With the U.S. tax year having ended on Dec. 31, the company's users are now faced with a banner placed at the top of their dashboard, stating ""Please remember to pay your taxes,"" and linking to the website's newly updated tax FAQ page.  The FAQ points out that Coinbase ""cannot provide legal or tax advice,"" but links to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines on how to report and pay taxes relating to crypto trading. A similar banner is also now visible for users in the EU as well.  It also adds that users can refer to their account transaction histories in order to calculate their gains and losses. Coinbase further offers a Cost Basis for Taxes report (currently in beta) to assist with the process, the FAQ states.  Notably, the move to raise awareness of users' tax liabilities comes soon after Coinbase concluded a lengthy court battle with the IRS over the tax agency's request that the firm hand over records on thousands of customers.  The San-Francisco district court ruled in late November that Coinbase must hand over user accounts at the exchange that bought, sold, sent or received sums of $20,000 and higher between 2013 and 2015.  The dispute over user records had been ongoing since November 2016, when the IRS had originally requested 480,000 customer accounts – a number that was slashed to over 14,000 in the final ruling, prompting Coinbase to claim the case a ""partial victory.""

42400820,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1pe,1515074449,Bank Blockchain Integration: A Challenge Overcome,"John Whelan is blockchain lab director at Banco Santander, where he specializes in the application of blockchains, distributed ledgers and smart contracts within the financial industry.      The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      For the past couple of years, there has been an extraordinary amount of hype around the potential of blockchain (or more correctly distributed ledger technology) to transform the banking industry.  The reason for this hype is quite profound: DLT has given us the opportunity to rearchitect the financial industry.  In the years ahead, we will move from a system of many banks with many ledgers (with all the associated reconciliation, central clearing parties, auditing, etc) to a simpler system of many banks but fewer ledgers where reconciliation is automatic. Central clearing parties may no longer be necessary and regulators will have a real-time view of the positions and risks across the industry.  But this transition, if it finally happens, is going to take a long time, and the chief reason is simple: legacy bank infrastructure and the tens of billions of dollars that have already been spent on building that infrastructure.  The core bank systems of today, designed with security in mind, are extremely robust and secure. But as a result, they sacrifice flexibility and aren't exactly friendly in how they communicate with other technologies.  Luckily though, over the past several years, the APIs of core bank systems have been upgraded to be REST-compliant and some even support events and web sockets.  So, integrating a DLT platform with a core bank system can be relatively straightforward even though the underlying DLT network topology, architecture and security considerations may still be a work in progress.  Keeping it simple  The key to any successful integration is to minimize complexity.  Certain use cases and transaction processes (e.g. cross-currency swaps) are complex and touch upward of 20 computer systems. And although very promising for the application of DLT, they may not be the obvious place to start as we move forward with the first real-money pilots.  Other transaction processes like cross-border payments are simpler, and it is these kinds of applications that are probably the closest to production.  So, how do integrations work in practice? At Banco Santander, our Blockchain Lab starts by building a prototype to tackle a specific business problem on a particular DLT platform (ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, R3's Corda).  In order to make the prototype as close as possible to the real thing, first we will build a limited core bank simulator that emulates the core bank systems for that particular application.  Next, we will map out the process flow for the use case that we are building and then spend the next two to three months in a series of sprints that result in an application that is robust enough to demonstrate to the business.  If the business leaders like what they see, they may support taking the application to the next phase: pilot.  At Santander when we say ""pilot,"" we mean running the application on real money systems, though at limited scale. (The pilot phase is when the bank's IT teams – corporate IT and ops, security, infrastructure – get involved.)  Together, we will do an architecture and security review of the prototype application and figure out all the necessary modifications that will need to be made to plug it into the bank’s pre-production environment.  But because we have already been building on core bank simulators, connecting to the real core bank systems becomes significantly easier. These pilot integrations have been taking us four to 12 weeks, depending on the amount of work involved.  Once the pilot integrations have been done, performing a robust series of tests on a defined schedule is the next step. It is during these tests that bugs are identified and squashed.  The chief concern here is maintaining atomicity between the core bank system and the blockchain. In other words, it is imperative that the numbers that are reflected in the core bank are exactly the same as the numbers that are present in the blockchain.  In practice, though, this is not too difficult to achieve and the two systems play quite nicely with each other. Very nicely, in fact.  A sample use case  A good example of a hypothetical integration process might be the development of a killer app like digital cash (aka a ""fiat-backed stablecoin"" in industry parlance) that will support micropayments, pay-per-download of digital content and the natural extension of Internet of Things, the machine-to-machine economy.  Digital cash as a concept is not new and has been tried before, starting with the original Ripple gateways in 2013 and followed by later attempts like BitAssets that involved backing the stablecoin with a non-fiat asset.  More recent efforts like basecoin are at the white paper stage, with theoretical approaches to creating an algorithmically backed stablecoin. And, while we are waiting for central banks to issue digital versions of their own currencies (very possible, but unlikely to happen for quite some time) existing commercial banks could get the ball rolling.  So, what integrations would be needed to deploy a fiat-backed stablecoin?  First, we would have to identify the components and integration points needed for a simple tokenized digital cash system as follows:  User wallet: The user registers his or her blockchain wallet with the digital cash platform. Know your customer(KYC) checks would be performed at this time. An integration with a KYC system is required.  Escrow account: The account at the bank where the funds from all the different users are pooled. Segregation of those funds happens on the distributed ledger.  Tokenizer: The interface between the core bank system and the blockchain. This application detects incoming transfers to the escrow account and creates the matching amount of digital tokens in the user’s wallet. It also handles redemptions of tokens and triggers their destruction and the corresponding transfer of real funds from the escrow account back to the user’s bank account.  Transactions: These occur directly between user wallets on the blockchain. No integration as such is needed, although regulations may require that both wallets conduct KYC in advance and anti-money-laundering (AML) screening might be required for transactions above a certain size  From a technical point of view, building a digital cash application is quite straightforward.  Very few integrations with core bank systems are required. The ""tokenizer"" does most of the work, with KYC and AML being done off-chain if needed.  Of course, there are many legal and regulatory challenges that will need to be overcome before bank-backed digital cash becomes a reality on public blockchains.  But for blockchains, particularly smart contract platforms, to reach their true potential and become an integral part of the lives of the Earth's 7 billion people, enabling tokenized versions of real money is an essential step.  Admittedly some of the technology is not quite ready to support digital cash at scale. But the good news is that from an integration point of view at least, creating a fiat-backed stablecoin might not be too difficult.  In fact, it might be the easiest integration of all.

42400829,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1xW,1515063910,Down But Not Out: Bitcoin Holds Onto Bullish Territory,"Bitcoin has come under pressure today amid sharp gains in alternative currencies, but the charts are showing no signs of panic.  Having clocked a high of $15,394.99 at 02:14 UTC today, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index fell to an intraday low of $14,225.17 at 09:14 UTC. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $14,500 levels. Quite clearly, the 2 percent depreciation in the value shown by data source CoinMarketCap is largely due to the decline seen between 02:14 UTC and 09:14 UTC.  Meanwhile, cheaper alternative currencies are strongly bid. For instance, Ripple's XRP token has set a new all-time high of $3, having appreciated by a hefty 31.63 percent in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, prices of cardano (ADA) and stellar have jumped at least 20 percent each, while NEM (XEM) has appreciated by 46 percent.  An argument could be put forward that investors are using the BTC to accumulate alternative currencies, given the sharp gains in the XRP/BTChttps://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XRP_BTC, ADA/BTChttps://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ADA_BTC and XEM/BTC pairs.  Amid what some are calling an ""altcoin bubble,"" it remains to be seen whether money will pour back into BTC once the valuations of the alternative currencies start to look overstretched.  Currently, the charts suggest BTC is down but not out and is holding onto bullish territory.  Bitcoin chart (prices as per Coinbase)  As discussed yesterday, the outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above $12,701.55 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement).  Also, the drop from the intraday high of $15,400 seems to have come to a halt around the upward sloping 5-day moving average at $14,352. Further, the 50-day MA is sloping upwards in favor of the bulls. The chart also shows upside (bullish) break of the falling wedge.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC has breached the falling trend line and has established higher lows, indicating scope for an upside move.  An inverse head and shoulders pattern with neckline hurdle at $15,500.  View  The short-term outlook remains bullish. A break above $15,500 (neckline resistance) would open doors for a return to $18,500 (inverse head and shoulders breakout target as per the measured height method).  On the downside, support is seen at $13,500 and $12,701.55. Only a close (as per UTC) below $12,701.55 would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

42400818,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1sb,1515056448,Japan: The New Heart of Bitcoin,"Yuzo Kano is the CEO for BitFlyer, one of Japan's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He previously worked at Goldman Sachs developing settlement systems, and later on equities derivatives and convertible bonds.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      No matter what negative news rocked the community, what hard fork happened or what skeptics stated, bitcoin held strong in 2017.  This is due in no small part to Japan. While the wider community is what breathes life into any coin, Japan is now bitcoin's heart; the country that is at the center of its support. There used to be a concern about the longevity of bitcoin, the safety of using such a novel new invention.  2017 is the year that fear died – and Japan is a big part of that reason.  Where other countries have had knee-jerk responses to bitcoin and blockchain technology, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) expertly analyzed the technology and developed clear and fair laws to regulate virtual currency exchanges. This is no small matter – bitcoin exchanges are the onboard ramp to both bitcoin adoption as well as the future of virtual currencies.  Coming home  With all the positive news this year from Japan, it's only appropriate to acknowledge the country's deep history with cryptocurrency. While we may never know for sure if he (or she) is (or was) Japanese, Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese name. Japan is bitcoin's home.  But though bitcoin has always had strong roots in Japan, it was also the center of its biggest controversy.  Some say that Mt. Gox's implosion, now nearly four years removed, was the worst event to ever happen to bitcoin. The numbers were staggering. 650,000 bitcoins, worth around $437 million at the time, were lost when the exchange abruptly closed. The company filed for bankruptcy. This affected over 127,000 customers around the world. Today, those lost bitcoins are worth nearly $9 billion.  Still, this event, while terrible, forced the Japanese regulators to step in and protect consumers.  That disruption, that explosion, is why Japan has become the most forward thinking jurisdiction for bitcoin and virtual currencies. The FSA's understanding of the technology, regardless of the bad or inexperienced actors early in the space, helped lay the foundation on which the rest of the world can begin to understand and fully accept bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  Starting on April 1 of this year, the Japanese government enacted an amendment to the Payment Services Act. These amendments, which BitFlyer helped establish, have been referred to as the Virtual Currency Act and alongside additional tax reform have provided three main pieces of regulation in 2017:  1: Legal clarification of bitcoin  The Virtual Currency Act described and identified what a virtual currency is, clarified that bitcoin is considered an asset and that bitcoin can be considered a payment method.  That act, however, did not declare bitcoin as a legal currency, as some have mistakenly professed.  2: Virtual currency exchange regulation  The Japan Financial Services Authority was granted the ability to both regulate, as well as issue licenses, to virtual currency exchanges in Japan. This cemented bitcoin as an established market in Japan, where the rules are clear and consumers can be protected.  BitFlyer was proud to be granted one of the first licenses of this sort earlier this year in September.  3: One additional piece of regulation from a different act  Lastly, while not part of the Virtual Currency Act, tax reform was pushed forward on July 1, which removed a consumption tax that dissuaded foreign investors from purchasing bitcoins on Japan's market. This opened up Japan’s markets to international investors.  Expanding bitcoin and blockchain usage  But while Japan has led the way, the rest of the world should learn from the regulations and research that has resulted.  Here, BitFlyer has been able to work closely with government organizations to provide research and information about the usability of bitcoin and blockchain technology. The research, just like bitcoin, is borderless and publicly available. BitFlyer has also been hard at work researching and developing a world-class enterprise blockchain called ""miyabi."" With a top speed of over 4,000 transactions per second, miyabi guarantees immutability, finality, Byzantine fault tolerance, low latency and has no single point of failure.  This work has not gone unnoticed.  The largest interbank clearing network in Japan has selected bitFlyer to demonstrate a proof of concept, utilizing miyabi to show how blockchain can be used to revolutionize the banking industry and create a much faster settlement platform. If adopted, the largest banks in Japan will be connected through blockchain and demonstrate to the world that enterprise blockchain can be implemented securely, creating a better and more united financial world.  These developments are why we believe 2018 will be another spectacular year for bitcoin.  Volume has been growing steadily through 2017, the price has been skyrocketing throughout the year, but most importantly, the last pieces for institutional investors to get involved with bitcoin are close at hand.  Even if a bitcoin ETF doesn't gain approval in 2018, the creation of futures products for bitcoin will allow for much more liquidity to enter the markets. Past just conventional derivatives, dozens of trading firms have sprung up over the last year to allow for boutique hedge funds, family offices, or even large-sized individual traders to access the virtual currency markets.  With all of these developments, bitFlyer has realized an incredible opportunity to harness all the liquidity in Japan to fuel these new marketplaces and service new traders. BitFlyer's bitcoin trade volume (including leveraged trading) is the largest in the world. Regardless of the massive inflow of volume institutional firms can bring through derivatives, trading firms will need to trade actual bitcoin for delivery.  BitFlyer's global expansion (such as the recently launched bitFlyer US exchange) seeks to service these markets directly, by providing institutions and individuals everywhere with the ability to participate with the largest source of bitcoin liquidity in the world: Japan.

The company, which operates an AI-powered advertising platform for purchasing media space, recently discovered cryptocurrency mining activity on its network, a development the company claims is becoming part of wider trend.  Spotad’s AI system, named ""Sarah,"" recently identified anomalies in the code of seemingly legitimate ads for both desktop and mobile that turned out to be a miner for the cryptocurrency monero. The JavaScript-enabled ad was designed to dupe users into clicking on a pop-up that would initiate the mining process.  According to co-founder Yoav Oz, the agency responsible for the ad was unaware of the code that was embedded inside. The name of the agency or the subject of the ad has not been disclosed.  ""Look at what's happening today around this entire cryptocurrency world, you see how much money is involved, you see the volume picking up week by week,"" added Tomer Horev, chief strategy officer, who led the team that discovered the code.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think people identify that as the next gold rush and they will try to do everything that they can in order to produce this kind of money.""  Oz and Horev explained that Spotad's AI system regularly monitors for irregularities in ads and is now being trained at spotting cryptocurrency mining scripts.  Some of the key signals include a lack of click or behavior patterns typically seen in legitimate ads. ""It was showing a different kind of behavior where users were not clicking much, there was no engagement on the ad. That’s where we got the signals out of our system,"" said Horev.  Monero mining  Why monero though? The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around the $440 mark while bitcoin is having its bumper year, topping $18,000. According to Oz and Horev, it’s simply easier to mine surreptitiously.  Horev explained:  ""The mining protocol for the big [cryptocurrencies], like bitcoin and bitcoin cash… to mine that kind of crypto requires high end servers and even GPU-based processing. Monero has script that can perform well on CPUs that actually reside in any desktop, laptop, and mobile device.""  ""This type of cryptocurrency has value harvesting through low end devices,"" he continued.  This week Russian cybersecurity firm publicized a piece of Android malware called Loapi that is spread through ad campaigns and app stores, which can mine for monero even with low-powered processors.  Cryptocurrency miners have become a controversial topic after torrent site The Pirate Bay tested out a monero mining code that it claimed it was testing as an alternative to advertising. Even sites from TV network Showtime and MMA organization UFC had run code from CoinHive, which makes this type of script for mining monero. In these cases, users were not immediately aware that their CPUs were being put to work mining for cryptocurrency.  Symantec published a report this week that stated there is now a cryptocurrency miner “arms race” under way as more cybercriminals seek ways to cash in on the cryptocurrency buzz, whether it’s monero or other coins like zcash or ether.  Time to act  Per the Symantec report, publishers and website owners need to be vigilant with the integrity of their websites’ source and be wary of any injections that may be miner scripts. Online publications typically use tools to detect fraudulent activity or inappropriate traffic on their sites.  These tools will need to evolve to consider miners, added Horev.  ""I think here requires a different type of fraud detection that when something happens on the device itself and not on the publisher website. I’m not sure that this type of technology is yet to be introduced in fraud detection tools but I believe it’s just a matter of time,"" he said.  For regular users, the tell-tale signs are a little easier to spot as the CPU will run at 100% and the responsiveness of the site in question, and even the entire device, will slow down. Some antivirus and security software vendors have moved to block scripts suspected of being miners.  ""The motivation is out there [to mine],"" said Horev. ""It’s time for more action to be taken and fraud and detection tools to get into the game.""

42400813,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1of,1515042068,Volatility: A Necessary Ingredient for Monetary and Social Transition,"Farzam Ehsani (@farzamehsani) is the blockchain lead at RMB and the Chairperson of the South African Financial Blockchain Consortium (SAFBC).  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Nothing lasts forever – we live in a world that is subject to the immutable law of change.  However, it's also true that human minds have a preference for the current state of affairs (status quo bias) and have difficulty conceptualizing dramatic changes from what they know and are familiar with.  Money is a case in point. The form, nature and name of money have changed over time. We have used cows, animal hides, beads, shells, salt, gold, paper and more as our stores of value, means of exchange and units of account. Much has been written about the key characteristics of money (divisibility, durability, fungibility, portability and scarcity) that determine its acceptability in society and how, over time, communities adopt the most frictionless forms of money that best embody these attributes.  Yet, despite this rich monetary history, we have a tendency to believe that our current form of money, fiat currency, is somehow immortal, even though it has only existed in its current state (unbacked by gold) for just over 46 years – half a human lifetime.  This past year, despite the promise that cryptocurrency will become the most technologically advanced form of money humanity has ever known, many have criticized the volatility of cryptocurrencies as a sign of their demise. The truth is that this asset class wouldn't be what it claims to be without this volatility.  It is a necessary ingredient for monetary transition.  Defending the new  Money is most volatile at two stages of its lifecycle: its birth and its death.  We are well familiar with the volatility that takes place at the death of a particular type of money. The Venezuelan bolivar and the Zimbabwean dollar are two of the most recent examples.  The birth of a completely independent type of money is just as turbulent. Our traditional valuation methodologies of discounted cash flows, comparable analysis or precedent transactions fail us as cryptocurrencies have no cash flows to discount, no comparable ratios to multiply and no precedents in history.  We're left with the brute forces of market dynamics to discover the relative value that humans place on this new asset: people express the value they place on cryptocurrencies by the amount of another asset (e.g., U.S. dollars) they're willing to sacrifice. But opinions on cryptocurrencies vary drastically and these divergences lead to expressions of sacrifice that are just as divergent, leading to tremendous volatility.  Money always needs to prove itself as a store of value before it becomes a medium of exchange, let alone a unit of account (why would someone ever accept money in exchange for energy-consuming goods and services if the money didn’t possess and hold value?). Volatility is an inescapable path toward this proof of a new form of money.  Toward unification  But while the future remains unknown, the path towards acceptance and adoption of a new form of money won’t be simple.  The plethora of cryptocurrencies in existence today may only be a stepping stone to a universally accepted form of money. Yet, the volatility inherent in establishing a new international currency heralds the volatility that society will need to undergo in order to establish a new global system that better serves the needs of humanity.  The unity of the family, tribe, city-state and nation have been attempted and established. World unity is the next goal towards which a harassed humanity is striving. True monetary union cannot be accomplished without political and fiscal union.  The following words from ""Who’s Writing the Future?,"" written by the Baha’i International Community in 1999, well before the advent of cryptocurrencies, resonate as I ponder our future:  ""It would be difficult to exaggerate the psychological and social impact of the anticipated replacement of the jumble of existing monetary systems – for many, the ultimate fortress of nationalist pride – by a single world currency operating largely through electronic impulses.""

42400827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1ta,1515025827,2017's Crypto (R)evolution Was Just the Beginning,"Bobby Cho is head of global trading at Cumberland, where he oversees one of the largest cryptocurrency and digital asset trading operations.    The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      When we kicked off this year, bitcoin had just topped $1,000 for the first time in three years.  It was a signal to the market, but cryptocurrency still lacked serious interest from mainstream banks and institutional investors. Today, we’re looking at a very different market and, as one of the largest liquidity providers in the space, Cumberland has had a front row seat to the evolution — or revolution, depending on your perspective.  Over the last several years, anyone who was following cryptocurrency or involved at all in the markets alluded that ""Wall Street"" was coming. This was the year we actually saw this start to happen, driven by the new ventures, burgeoning demand and market maturation that generally accompany a rapid run up in price.  Real dollars are put to work  2017 was an inflection point.  We saw a shift from getting familiar with cryptocurrencies to putting real dollars to work — a shift from education to action that was evident throughout the activity we saw in the crypto markets. Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies saw their valuations grew consistently over the first half of the year and, as we entered the back half of the year, prices reached all-time highs over and over again, with year-over-year market cap figures growing over 4,000%.  The end-of-the-year headlines are telling the story of volatility (those of us who have been in these markets for some time know that volatility defines them — and, indeed, all nascent markets), but the fact remains we've seen prices up 1500% this year. And demand to invest real, new money has followed.  Realizing that bitcoin is here to stay, CME, CBOE and Nasdaq all announced plans to list bitcoin futures contracts, with a race to get the first product listed. CME and CBOE have already launched and have active market participants.  Historically, adding derivatives to a spot market has been an indication of maturity, and we see these contracts as a natural progression in the expansion of bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) as an asset class.  These developments also signal that action will only continue, as futures have been a known precursor to an ETF — and NYSE and CBOE have both announced plans to list. Futures and ETFs are familiar to institutional money, and many investors who have been on the sidelines are using these products to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.  Market players change face  Bitcoin has always had a diverse group of followers, historically made up of early adopters, crypto-centric companies, individual traders, high net-worth individuals and a small group of institutional traders like Cumberland.  But it's the birth of the crypto-specific hedge fund that has really signaled a trend from education to action among institutional capital. At Cumberland, we saw these funds emerge this year in truly meaningful numbers, from a handful in 2016 to around 70 in the middle part of this year to now more than 120 and growing, a figure which represents approximately 1 percent of all hedge funds globally.  We’re seeing everything from early crypto-enthusiasts who did well for themselves now running funds to the more established funds turning their full-time focus on cryptocurrencies.  From our perspective, it’s a trend that shows no signs of slowing down in 2018.  We're also seeing the changing face of the cryptocurrency investor reflected in the shifting landscape between early crypto movers — let’s call them bitcoin 1.0 — and newer users or bitcoin 2.0.  Both groups are ultimately trying to achieve the same goal – making bitcoin scalable, secure and usable, and making it the largest decentralized network for the movement of value. We have seen some significant developments over the last year which brought about different solutions, with one ultimately creating bitcoin cash. It remains to be seen which philosophy will come out on top and what that means for the continued mainstreaming of the asset.  Ecosystem builds on bitcoin  We also saw a shift this year as the interest in bitcoin gave rise to interest in other cryptocurrencies, with a cottage industry of new products and services emerging around them.  As people embraced bitcoin and ether, other cryptocurrencies began to attract investors, which eventually led capital into different and diverse projects. If you didn’t like certain attributes of bitcoin for whatever reason, other tokens and protocols were more readily available in 2017 than ever before, and this demand came sooner than was really expected.  There are thousands of cryptocurrencies that exist today for a wide array of utilities and use cases, and over the last year, we have seen an increase in demand for these cryptocurrencies. We believe that an overall interest in decentralized technologies, community investment and collaboration, and the dramatic increase in the market capitalization of the crypto ecosystem have all fueled this acceleration.  This year's action also gave rise to ICOs, an entirely new layer to the ecosystem. We've seen the number of ICO white papers increase dramatically over the last year as entrepreneurs look to fund a dizzying array of projects.  According to Icodata.io, the number of funds raised increase by over 6,000% and the number of deals issued increase by over 2,500% year-over-year.  Action to adoption  If 2017 was about education turning to action, 2018 is about action turning to adoption. 2018 could set the stage for white papers converting into production-grade products.  Right now, investors are still exploring what their strategy will ultimately be — despite the giant increase in demand this year, a lot of it was more dipping a toe in than making a big splash. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to see the institutional capital magnified, with cryptocurrencies more fully established as an asset class.  More crypto-funds popping up, more institutions making crypto a key part of their strategy, more jurisdictions providing regulatory clarity. And to be clear, many of the ideas and projects in the marketplace will fail, but may give rise to better developed ideas and projects down the line.  While it's still early days and no one knows with certainty how this will all play it, I expect it will be fascinating ride — and Cumberland is looking forward to being here at every step.
