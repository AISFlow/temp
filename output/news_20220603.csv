42421557,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXochR,1654297467,How Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Is a Litmus Test for Cryptocurrency Exchanges,"Many companies have withdrawn from Russia to protest Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. So far, major cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. have resisted, saying they won’t do it unilaterally.  This is a principled stand, and it is consistent with the guiding ethos of the cryptocurrency community. After all, these markets serve as an alternative to those dominated by governmental policy interference. And in Russia, as in Venezuela and in other zones of economic chaos, cryptocurrency is an important tool for ordinary citizens to resist financial totalitarianism.  Max Galka is the founder and CEO of Elementus, a New York-based blockchain and crypto analytics firm.  So long as the U.S. Treasury Department and other financial regulators do not force the crypto markets to pull out of Russia, this principled stand is also defensible. Of course, if a federal ban on Russian access to U.S. financial markets is put into place, there isn’t flexibility or tolerance for inaction. All U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges will have to comply. And ignorance would not be a defense.  A third path  There is yet a third path that cryptocurrency markets should consider between these two positions – one that would preserve their core ethos while addressing one of the most central threats to the crypto markets, writ large.  It is worth the extra effort for the crypto community to explore such options in this case. Russia, after all, is not just another nation with crypto users. By one estimate, roughly 17 million Russians – about 12% of the country – own crypto (that’s about 50% higher than the ownership rate among Americans). Those figures may understate crypto’s usage in Russia amid a collapse in the value of the Russian ruble. Blanketing such a market with sanctions would punish everyone in a large economy, by any measure.  But Russia is also the source of more than half of questionable and illegal crypto and blockchain transactions, by our own estimates. An Elementus report published last month found that five of the eight most lethal ransomware groups operate from Russia and that the other three may also have ties to the country.  Ransomware and other criminal activities that emanate from Russia depend on this access to crypto markets.  For years, crypto exchanges steered clear of blocking bad actors because of the strong libertarian mindset that bitcoin should be fungible and that blockchains should be open, decentralized and free from governmental interference.  More critically, many exchanges argued, and rightly so, that until now, they haven’t had the means to systematically differentiate between good and bad actors and identify the sources of illicit activity.  That is no longer true. Technology now exists to allow financial institutions to review the blockchain of any given cryptocurrency and discover who owned what and when – and do it relatively quickly and efficiently. In a shock to criminals who thought they could hide their money by transferring ill-gotten gains into cryptocurrencies, many of these dollars have already been identified and recovered.  Read More: Trustless Evidence: Web 3 Is Helping Document War Crimes in Ukraine  Of course, no technology is perfect, and criminals are always adept at staying one step ahead of the law. In this case, if they’re using mixers, tumblers and coinjoins as “crypto laundromats’’ to obfuscate their trails, there are limits to what the current technology can do to follow the digital breadcrumbs. Human judgment also plays a role in that the nature of the technology sometimes makes it hard to make a definitive judgment on the entities behind these crimes.  So cryptocurrency exchanges have the option to maintain the principled stand that they will not unilaterally cut off Russian customers, while also reducing access to criminal elements – and, if necessary, those responsible for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. And they can do both without violating their libertarian ethos.  A first step for exchanges  The first step in the right direction is for exchanges to determine their unwitting exposure to various potentially suspect entities. If sanctions require exchanges to cut off Russian government officials – or major supporters – these markets must know whom to target. Many Russian customers are not government officials or supporters of the war and should be spared the impact of such sanctions.  Existing technology allows major exchanges to quickly identify how many bitcoin transactions came from Russia. If such crypto activity is illegal and tied to ransomware and darknet markets or other illegal activity, wouldn’t exchanges be operating in their own best interest – regardless of sanctions – to block it?  Those who are shaping the cryptocurrency markets – many of which are publicly traded and are, therefore, regulated companies – have an opportunity to move ahead of compliance-driven action and preemptively block illegal activity coming out of Russia.  The exchanges can then maintain a principle that is worth defending.  Crypto is a storehouse of value independent of government fiat and policy intrusion. But it is not – nor can we let it be – a place for criminals to store their ill-gotten gains.

This move had garnered a lot of interest from investors in the space who have been looking forward to taking advantage of this unique opportunity. However, the launch of the bitcoin bond has now been postponed for a second time. El Salvador&apos;s finance miner, Alejandro Zelaya, gives the reason for the multiple delays. Not A Good Time The finance minister had put forward that it was not a good time for the launch of the El Salvador Bitcoin Bonds.

42415416,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVgyb,1654292784,Environmentalists Target Greenidge as They Turn Up Pressure on NY Governor to Sign Mining Moratorium Bill,"NEW YORK — Emotions are running high after the New York state Senate passed a bill that disallows fossil fuel power plants from setting up new projects to provide energy to proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mines for two years.  Environmentalists and state Assemblywoman Anna Kelles – who sponsored the Assembly version of the bill – called on New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to not only sign the bill into law, but to also deny air permits for bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation at a press conference on Friday.  The environmental groups congratulated each other in a gleeful online press conference and thanked the elected officials who passed the bill through the state’s two houses.  At 5:00 a.m. ET this morning, Greenidge Generation rushed to declare that the bill does not apply to its operations, even quoting Kelles herself from an April Wall Street Journal story.  The bill effectively bars the creation of new bitcoin mines that use behind-the-meter fossil fuel power by denying the air permits to the power plants that supply them with electricity. Mining at home, using renewable energy or using fossil fuels through the grid are all allowed under the bill.  “In essence this is a power plant bill. This bill says that we will not for the next two years allow cryptocurrency mining companies to purchase power plants that use fossil fuels … and use them for cryptocurrency mining. ... That is the crux of this bill,” Kelles, the lead sponsor of the bill in the state’s lower house, said at the press conference.  Greenidge Generation is one of two bitcoin miners that use this model in the state, and its air permit is currently under review by the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The department pushed the deadline for making a decision to June 30, just two days after the state is set to elect a new governor.  The power plant in Dresden in upstate New York has been the eye of the storm in the state’s struggle over bitcoin mining. Located next to Seneca Lake, a tourist destination known for its vineyards, the power plant has been using lake water to cool its operation, which some residents of the picturesque locale say is causing algae blooms and jeopardizing the lake’s fauna.  Environmental advocates also called for the denial of air permits to Digihost, a crypto miner that is working to convert another fossil fuel power plant in New York state about 120 miles northwest of the Greenidge Generation site.  Digihost declined to comment for this report, as well as Coinmint, whose bitcoin mines in Plattsburgh and Massena, New York, have also run into controversy. A spokesperson for Greenidge Generation contacted after the press conference said the company doesn’t have any further comment.  The bill’s opposition  Bitcoiners decried the measure. Some called it an unjustified restriction to economic freedom – several of them inaccurately labeling it as a full-on ban on bitcoin mining in the state.  Others took a more moderate stance, expressing concern about the future of the industry in the state.  “Although the bill is quite limited in its scope, it will project an image of New York being ‘anti-bitcoin’ so it will likely limit any expansion of crypto mining in the state and accelerate even more the move to other jurisdictions, like Texas or Oklahoma, where there is strong political support for miners,” said Alex Martini, CEO of Blockfusion, which operates a mining operation in Niagara Falls.  “Even if the governor ends up vetoing this, I would imagine people are going to be very hesitant to set up more bitcoin mines in New York,” said Joe Burnett, a mining analyst at Blockware Solutions.  Read more: NY Bitcoin Miners Start to Give Up on State Amid Regulatory Uncertainty  Kelles claimed that conservative economic freedom groups fought the bill. Her colleagues are getting 700 emails every single day that appear to be templates, not from New York residents, she said. The assemblywoman believes they are funded by two conservative organizations, Club for Growth and Freedom Works. CoinDesk could not reach either organization for comment at the time of publication.  The environmental groups claimed that they were met with vehement opposition in the form of lobbying efforts.  “We took on a very powerful industry with vast financial resources at its disposal,” said Eric Weltman, an organizer with Food & Water Watch, at the press conference.  The governor’s dilemma  The bill is now before Gov. Hochul, for her signature or veto. Kelles said Hochul’s environmental staff “very much recognize the concerns about the environmental impact.” Now that the bill has passed both houses, it is clear that this is the will of the people of New York, Kelles said.  The bitcoin mining industry plans to continue its lobbying efforts.  “We’re trying to determine when the governor will request the bill [to sign it into law]. It’s really a question of whether she [Hochul] wants to have this hanging out there for a while or not. So, we just continue to watch and see when it gets delivered, and we’ll be engaging with her office immediately to explain the problem with the bill and the potential impact,” said John Olsen, head of New York policy at lobbying group Blockchain Association.  Gov. Hochul has received a $40,000 donation from Ashton Soniat, the chairman and CEO of Coinmint, as well as $78,000 from Albany lobbying firm Ostroff Associates, which includes Blockfusion in its list of clients, The New York Times reported.

42415427,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhQU,1654289026,Market Wrap: Altcoins Underperform as Bearish Sentiment Rises,"Bitcoin (BTC) declined from a high of $30,658 during the New York trading day as buyers remained on the sidelines. The cryptocurrency is up by 3% over the past week, but has struggled to outperform a majority of alternative cryptos (altcoins).  Internet Computer's ICP token pared Thursday's gains and declined by 10% over the past 24 hours, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. Avalanche's AVAX token and Solana's SOL token were down by 4% on Friday, while Polkadot's DOT token rose by 4%.  Sentiment among crypto traders remains bearish, evidenced by a downtick in the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index over the past few days. The index moved deeper into ""extreme fear"" territory, similar to what occurred in January of this year, which preceded an upswing in BTC's price.  Still, technical indicators suggest limited upside for bitcoin, particularly at its 50-day moving average, currently at $34,177.  In traditional markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined on Friday as the 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher. Gold was also lower on Friday, and is down by 5% over the past three months, compared with a 25% loss in BTC and a 4% dip in the S&P 500 over the same period.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $29,548, −2.35%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,749, −3.87%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,108, −1.64%    ●Gold: $1,854 per troy ounce, −0.69%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.96%     Short-term upswing?  Some analysts expect crypto prices to stabilize over the short term, which typically occurs after periods of significant price declines.  ""For BTC and ETH, the current drawdown is now identical to the 2020 [COVID-19] drawdown. It is possible that we see a short-term bounce from these oversold levels,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm wrote in a Friday report. A similar peak-to-trough decline occurred in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which could point to a short-term relief bounce in speculative assets.  Still, in 2017, it took roughly one year for BTC and ETH to reach a trough, which means upside could be limited until an absolute bottom in price occurs, according to QCP.  Bitcoin dominance intact  So far, some crypto traders have been reducing their exposure to risk. Typically, during down markets altcoins decline by more than bitcoin because of their greater risk profile. As a result, bitcoin's market cap rises relative to the total crypto market cap (dominance ratio) during bear markets.  The chart below shows a recent breakout in the BTC dominance ratio, similar to what occurred in 2018. That means a reversal of the risk-on environment over the past two years is underway. An increase in the dominance ratio toward 50% could offer some relief for altcoins relative to BTC, albeit within the context of a confirmed bearish cycle for cryptocurrencies.  For now, upside price moves are confined to short-term trading ranges.  Altcoin roundup  Chainlink expands to Solana: The blockchain oracle network said Friday that developers who build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Solana mainnet can now incorporate seven of Chainlink’s price feeds into their products. Popular decentralized finance (DeFi) projects including Aave, Compound and dYdX already use Chainlink’s data services.  WAVES's wild ride: WAVES, a token based on the Waves public blockchain that enables users to access Web 3 apps, experienced a two-fold increase over the past week. “We have to work on the algorithm” after several depeggings from the dollar, founder Sasha Ivanov said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program earlier this week. WAVES is still down by 84% from its all-time high in March.  Volume stabilizes: ""We have seen more balanced flows although it seems both buyers and sellers have been reluctant to get too aggressive, in our view. BTC and ETH continue to dominate trading volumes. Cardano's ADA saw larger volumes as its token climbed as much as 36% in the days leading up to month end,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in an email.

Bitcoin Net Unrealized Loss Surges Up, But Still Remains Below 0.5 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the cryptocurrency&apos;s price may still be nowhere near a bottom. The relevant indicator here is the &apos;net unrealized loss&apos; (or NUL in brief), which tells us about the total number of coins that are currently holding an unrealized loss. The metric works by comparing the last selling price of each coin on the chain to the current value of Bitcoin. If the previous previous of any coin was more than the current one, then that coin is holding a loss right now. On the other hand, the current price being more than the last selling value would imply that the coin is in profit at the moment.

42394050,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjuF,1654280007,Will Crypto Markets Be Regulated Like Traditional Markets? One NFT Lawyer Weighs In,"The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) first crypto-related insider trading case raises the question of whether the crypto markets will be policed the same way as traditional markets and what constitutes a security, according to one attorney specializing in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web 3.  The DOJ lawsuit, which alleges that Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at online NFT marketplace OpenSea, engaged in NFT insider trading for his own benefit, could be the U.S. government’s first attempt at figuring out its role as a regulator, said Moish Peltz, an New York-based NFT lawyer and partner at law firm Falcon Rappaport & Berkman PLLC.  Read more: US Charges Ex-OpenSea Exec With NFT Insider Trading  Chastain faces one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 40 years in prison for allegedly front-running $60,000 in NFTs.  “The government here is coming in taking the position that these are big marketplaces. There's a lot of money at stake now,” said Peltz during CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. “There's a lot of consumers that are coming in, whether for collecting or looking to make money or for some other reason, and they should have confidence that the marketplace works, and it's not stacked against them.”  Chastain, who was once the public face of OpenSea, the largest online marketplace to buy and sell NFTs, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday. The Justice Department alleges he breached an employment agreement in which he used confidential business information to purchase NFTs in advance of them being featured on the marketplace’s homepage. The indictment adds that as part of Chastain’s employment he was responsible for selecting the homepage’s NFTs.  Read more: OpenSea Exec Accused of Insider Trading Resigns  According to Peltz, the DOJ could be trying to make an example out of Chastain. “If you were to use insider information for your benefit, that could be a criminal violation,” he said.  Consumers may have been the ultimate victim rather than OpenSea if these charges are true, according to Peltz.  “It's one thing to know that these [NFTs] are highly volatile and speculative and you can lose all your money. It's another thing to have insider information and use that to exploit purchasers in that marketplace,” Peltz said. “Then there may also be a governmental role in that marketplace.”  Peltz added that a possible governmental role raises questions for companies operating in the space that have employees who have access to confidential information that could move the crypto markets.  “Whether in marijuana assets or altcoins or NFTs,” he said, “you should be thinking, ‘What’s going on here? Do we have an obligation as a company to have policies and procedures in place to speak to our employees, to educate [and] to make sure they know what the ground rules are?’”",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/03/will-crypto-markets-be-regulated-like-traditional-markets-one-nft-lawyer-weighs-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61ef902f6049e33653f159047fb0bced39a03513-1900x1044.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, BTC&apos;s price trades at $29,500 with a 2% loss in the last 24-hours. According to a pseudonym trader, Bitcoin could be ready to re-test the lows at $29,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. The trader expects BTC&apos;s price to potentially dip below this level and then bounce back to $35,000. This would put Bitcoin close to the bottom of its current range. Therefore, a move to the upside and some relief seems logical, if BTC is to continue to trend rangebound. In that sense, the pseudonym trader recommended to &apos;play the trend&apos; and re-examining if BTC breaks above those levels. The trader said via Twitter: Before you get discouraged about trading just remember this tiny little range of chop is what&apos;s been so difficult for everyone to figure out.

The cryptocurrency has been anchored to the $30,000 price level over the past two weeks, where a majority of the trading volume occurred. That could point to volatile price moves later this month.  On the daily chart, bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is stuck below the 50 neutral mark, which indicates slowing momentum behind the recent upswing in price. The persistent decline in momentum means BTC's six-month downtrend remains intact.  The weekly RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded an uptrend in price. This time, however, upside appears to be limited because of negative long-term momentum signals.  Still, over the short term, BTC could stabilize above the $20,000-$25,000 support zone. The 200-week moving average, currently at $22,179, is another gauge of long-term trend support.  BTC is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal, per the DeMark indicators, which could appear over the next two weeks. That could pave the way for a short-term price bounce, which would delay additional breakdowns on the chart.

42415428,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhOL,1654278603,Middle East Oil Producers Move Into Bitcoin Mining With Crusoe Energy Stakes,"Crusoe Energy, the privately held U.S. company that pioneered bitcoin (BTC) mining by using wasted natural gas as a power source, is expanding in the Middle Eastern region with investments from Mubadala – the sovereign wealth fund (SWF) of Abu Dhabi – and the Oman Investment Authority (OIA).  Crusoe this week announced the OIA and Mubadala were each part of a $350 million funding round that closed in April. “This investment will power Crusoe’s efforts to expand internationally as it works to align the future of computing with the future of the climate,” according to a statement sent to CoinDesk by the company.  As part of the expansion, the Denver-based miner will initially open an office in Oman’s capital city of Muscat and in Abu Dhabi shortly thereafter. Crusoe will start with hiring two or three people for the offices and about eight field personnel, CEO and co-founder Chase Lochmiller told CoinDesk. Lochmiller expects to have pilot-level technologies deployed at one site in each country in the first quarter of 2023.  While not commenting on the size of the investments by the two nations, Lochmiller did allow that the stakes were “meaningful.” The expansion of Crusoe’s patented digital flare mitigation systems establishes the company as the first flare gas bitcoin miner in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, he added.  Crusoe currently has several mobile sites across the U.S., and a customer roster that includes energy producers Devon Energy (DVN), Kraken Oil & Gas, Canada’s Enerplus (ERF) and maybe Exxon (XOM), where Crusoe is reportedly working on a pilot project to use flared gas to power bitcoin mining operations at the energy giant’s North Dakota oil wells.  'A global problem'  In the flaring process, excess natural gas is burned off into the atmosphere as part of oil drilling operations. It has become standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny, however, with the U.S. President Joe Biden pledging to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations.  It is not just an issue in the U.S. but “a global problem with a global impact,” said Lochmiller, who said the MENA region is responsible for over 38% of the global flaring in 2020. Oman accounted for about 1.8% or 2,517 million cubic meters of that emission, while the United Arab Emirates accounted for approximately 0.7% or 955 million cubic meters.  Using this otherwise wasted flared gas to mine digital assets has emerged as a popular trend among both the crypto and energy industries. Those involved point out the win/win of reducing emissions while powering mining rigs.  “We’re excited to expand our Digital Flare Mitigation technology to the Middle East to help solve the region’s long-standing flaring challenges, while also empowering a new generation of digital technology in the region,” Lochmiller said. “Both OIA and Mubadala saw the value in Crusoe’s digital flare mitigation technology and how it can actually bring a flexible mechanism to both reduce emissions and bring new technologically enabled industries to the country,” he added.  “Our hope is that these two locations can be a launching point for continued expansion into other nations in the region, '' Lochmiller continued, noting Oman’s and Abu Dhabi’s MENA neighbors – Saudi Arabia among them – face similar challenges.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/03/middle-east-oil-producers-move-into-bitcoin-mining-with-crusoe-energy-stakes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e93de707c7bce3faf3b3d0a3762db8303a222c9-8060x5373.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421547,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocaD,1654278188,"Are Exchange Layoffs the First Sign of Crypto Winter, or Is It Already Over?","On Thursday, June 2, came a truly shocking announcement from Coinbase (COIN). Not only would the publicly traded crypto exchange extend a hiring freeze first implemented two weeks ago, it will also rescind existing offers to new hires, according to a statement.  This is perhaps the most dramatic in a series of layoff decisions by crypto exchanges, which come as both equity and token markets continue to deflate amid the U.S. Federal Reserve’s attempts to fight inflation by hiking interest rates.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But are these cuts just part of a broader cyclical downturn that’s also hitting other speculative “growth” companies, like Tesla (TSLA)? Or is it something narrower and crypto specific?  In short, are these layoffs just the start of something much more dire? Are we on the brink of another crypto winter?  Welcome aboard! Oh, wait, nevermind  Coinbase’s decision to pull existing job offers is straightforwardly heinous. Imagine Coinbase offered you a job a week ago. You immediately put in your two weeks’ notice at the box factory where you’ve been grinding to feed your family while spending nights and weekends immersed in crypto. On Thursday you woke up excited to start a new gig in the exciting world of digital assets.  Then you got a god-damned form email titled “Update to your Coinbase offer” and the update was “whoops, nevermind.” Seriously, Coinbase, get your act together. This is shameful behavior.  Public reaction has been predictable scorn. Above all, this is yet another index of Coinbase’s general incompetence when it comes to handling its employees. This is the same company, remember, that accidentally acqui-hired a bunch of murderous fascist spies and triggered a wave of resignations by issuing a hamfisted workplace gag order (the exchange did offer separation packages to employees who left).  See also: Lex Sokolin: How Coinbase Is Worth $100B | Opinion  But these latest un-hirings (?) don’t just affirm what seems to be Coinbase’s longstanding disregard for its workers. They reveal a dramatic tactical fumble: Throwing the emergency brake on spending this hard suggests nobody at Coinbase saw problems on the horizon even as the crypto market steadily cooled for more than six months. Did nobody grasp the significance of the Fed rate-hike cycle? Rescinding job offers is a flop-sweat panic move born of a failure to plan for clear changes in market conditions. The Fed literally announces forward guidance ahead of time!  Blood in the snow  Yet, while Coinbase once again manages to excel in its public bumbling, it is not alone in facing headwinds. As the crypto economy slows, exchanges have been among the first to reveal cutbacks, in part because more of them are public or regulated firms. Robinhood (HOOD), which offers equity and crypto trading and saw hypergrowth during the coronavirus pandemic, has reversed course to cut 9% of staff. Mexican exchange Bitso and Middle Eastern exchange Rain Financial have also made cuts.  The layoff announcement from the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange may be the most provocatively framed. In announcing it is cutting 10% of staff, Gemini predicted the entire industry was “entering a period of stasis,” and explicitly warned of a coming “crypto winter.”  But if crypto winter is coming, we haven’t seen it yet. These exchange layoffs are kid’s stuff – rookie numbers. The term “crypto winter” was popularized during the 2019 market collapse and industry retraction, when total crypto market cap collapsed to $100 billion in December 2018 from nearly $830 billion at the start of the year. The resulting layoffs were many times worse in percentage terms than the current round, so far. And I know firsthand, because I lost my crypto job then along with darn near everyone else.  We’re dealing with anecdotal numbers, but the differences are striking. In 2019, the token swap service ShapeShift laid off 30% of its workers in one swoop. Also in early 2019, many crypto over the counter (OTC) desks – which are less exposed to market swings than retail-focused exchanges – shed staff or shut down. Ethereum incubator Consensys’s downsizing was particularly emblematic: It cut 13% of staff in December 2018, then spun out several incubated “spokes” in what amounted to even broader cuts. It fired another 14% of its remaining employees in February of 2020.  Note the timeline here: These layoffs across the industry largely came a full year after token markets started slumping. It’s been about eight months since bitcoin (BTC) hit its all-time high in November 2021 and the start of the current market retrace. Certainly we haven’t entered a crypto winter in earnest. It may still be waiting in the wings.  Winter's coming?  So if it can get that much worse, will it?  First, to briefly describe what triggers a “crypto winter”: the combined decline of new customer revenue from outside the industry, the decline of venture capital (VC) investments and the decline of retail speculation.  As in previous cycles, the “retail speculation” part of the equation was the first to go, in no small part thanks to the catastrophic unwinding of the Terra network. (It should be noted that Coinbase Ventures helped back Terraform Labs, so to a measurable extent Coinbase’s current panicky firings are fallout from its own decision to shephard obvious bad actors into the industry.)  The macroeconomic environment is also obviously key to retail behavior. There is definite good news here, with new jobs data showing unemployment in the U.S., the most important retail crypto market, remains at a very low (though nominal) 3.6%.  A bigger headwind is interest rates, which will draw money away from speculative investments as they rise, which the Fed has said will continue. But in a must-read post published June 1, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes made a compelling argument that the Fed could halt its rate-hike campaign early if pain in asset markets gets too great. That’s quite bad as macro policy, of course, but it’s the reality we live in.  Hayes also argued, based on historical trends, that bitcoin dropping briefly below $26,000 may have been the market bottom. That optimistic take on price levels is by no means the consensus, though, and depends on the Fed changing course on interest rates.  Other analysts point to different areas of bitcoin’s price cycle for their predictions. If the previous BTC top is a bottom for the next cycle, then BTC would bottom out at about $20,000, or another 30% drawdown from current levels. More pessimistically, markets could follow 2018’s 85% drawdown from highs, which would leave BTC below $12,000 per token.  See also: Bitcoin Is Down, but You Don't Have to Be | Opinion  On the other hand, there are factors in play that weren’t in 2018. Most importantly, there is a lot of venture capital money ready to support viable ideas. Andreessen Horowitz’s new $4.5 billion venture fund alone is going to keep a lot of devs employed. There are also now large segments of the crypto economy that generate real revenue from outside the industry, from mass-market NFT (non-fungible token) brands like NBA Top Shot to the law-enforcement analytics provided by firms like Chainalysis.  Though painful for some, crypto winters are often necessary and ultimately good. A tougher environment leads to more scrutiny by regulators and industry participants alike and, I hope, helps concentrate capital in more immediately viable and revenue-generating projects. This also leads to major reshuffling of talent from less-viable to more-viable projects. For instance, we’re seeing developers formerly working on Terra being courted by other projects, which amounts to a transfer of labor value from a worse-than-useless dead end to things that might not be. This dynamic also encompasses exchanges like Coinbase, which critics claim lacks a long-term viable business model given its over-reliance on inflated fees.  See also: How Crypto Payments Shift Revenue to Creators, Not Platforms | Opinion  Nobody has a crystal ball. But taken as a whole the situation looks bad but not bleak, and nothing like a 2018 repeat. Crypto isn’t disappearing or “over,” and a little brushfire to clear out dimwits and operators like Do Kwon is a net positive. Most likely, crypto is going to track the broader economy, with a quiet year or two followed by a resumption of growth and adoption.  That said, it’s a good time to be extremely cautious.

42421555,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocgP,1654271857,Tackling the Quantum Threat to Bitcoin,"One of my favorite descriptions of Bitcoin comes from that great oracle of this space, Andreas Antonopoulos. He called it a “sewer rat.”  Antonopoulos’s unflattering comparison is actually an expression of respect. He means Bitcoin is a survivor; its exposure to threats has allowed it to develop strong resistance to them, akin to how exposure to germs helps people develop immune systems. It has faced multiple crises – from Mt. Gox to China’s mining ban – and after each has emerged stronger, with an expanded hashrate, enhanced economic security, growing user numbers, falling transaction costs and more efficient processing.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In many ways, the leaderless, amorphous ecosystem that drives Bitcoin forward embodies Nassim Taleb’s idea of an “anti-fragile” system (although Taleb recently became quite a prominent Bitcoin critic). It offers a good reason to believe Bitcoin will again bounce back stronger from the recent setbacks in cryptocurrency markets.  As many die-hard believers will tell you, Bitcoin’s durability is in large part a function of how hard it is to alter its protocol. As we learned from the block size wars, when a lobbying campaign by powerful interests failed to find support to increase Bitcoin’s data capacity, it takes an overwhelming consensus among both users and miners for significant code alterations to be adopted. That gives the system certainty and breeds faith in the provable scarcity it promises.  Still, it would be naive to think Bitcoin is entirely invulnerable to outside threats. In fact, one in particular that gets too little attention now looms larger than ever: quantum technologies. And in this case, Bitcoin’s “hard to change” characteristic could prove to be a bug, not a feature.  A long time coming  Quantum computing has been coming for four decades, delayed because of the highly complicated engineering challenge that sits before it can achieve, at scale, the kind of supercomputing powers it promises. That slow process is why some people, including many in the cryptocurrency industry, believe it will never come.  But recently, computer scientists have discovered uses for the field’s calculation techniques in conjunction with graphic processing units (GPU). They foresee powerful uses without having to wait for the development of an all-out quantum computer.  That has raised excitement around the possibilities posed by rapid processing of massive datasets to accelerate research into areas such as battery technology. It has also fueled concern the encryption systems upon which our digital economy depends are at risk of being broken by attackers wielding quantum tools.  So scientists are collectively working on the release of a set of open “post-quantum cryptography” standards to “quantum-proof” our computer systems. A recent article in Nature by a group of these scientists laid out a transition strategy backed by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and its foreign counterparts.  A Biden administration memo last month outlined “key steps needed to maintain the nation’s competitive advantage in quantum information science (QIS), while mitigating the risks of quantum computers to the nation’s cyber, economic and national security.” It directed “specific actions for agencies to take as the United States begins the multi-year process of migrating vulnerable computer systems to quantum-resistant cryptography.”  One of the scientists behind this drive, Jack Hidary, the CEO of Sandbox AQ, is now on a mission to convince crypto developer communities to start the likely long process of transitioning to post-quantum standards before their blockchain protocols are rendered useless.  “This process of changing all the blockchains could take four or five years, and that’s part of the understanding of why we have to start this process now,” he said during an interview that ran in last week’s special World Economic Forum edition of the “Money Reimagined” podcast.  Bitcoin’s sewer rat resilience will not protect it here. Although its key pair system is built on Elliptic Curve cryptography (ECC), an advance beyond the ubiquitous RSA system of public key cryptography used in most encryption systems, research has shown that EEC will be unable to withstand quantum processing, Hidary says.  That means a third party could use a super-fast “brute force” quantum calculation to quickly uncover the private key you secretly guard to unlock and transact with bitcoins referenced on the public blockchain.  Act now, later or never?  Will blockchain developers buy in?  To upgrade the code in a company-owned website, all that’s needed is for the CEO or chief technology to order their staff to do so. But you can’t meaningfully change a widely distributed, decentralized, open-source protocol whose value depends on a network of users unless a sufficiently large majority of participants adopts the code change.  We know, not only from the block size wars but also from how long it has taken for less-contentious upgrades such as Taproot to be adopted, that finding consensus in Bitcoin can be especially difficult and time-consuming – partly because there’s so much money at stake.  One would think that if these computing advances pose this kind of existential threat, change would happen rapidly. People will preserve something they are invested in, one would think.  But such an upgrade entails much more than just a few lines of code. It means overhauling the entire cryptographic foundation and requires the engagement of all players in the Bitcoin economy. It will take a lot of meetings, and a great deal of argument over Twitter and IRC to get everyone on board. Bitcoin’s resistance to change could prove a barrier.  Inevitably, some will mistrust these scientists making threats and promises. Companies like Hidary’s are offering services to solve these problems for blockchain developers. Is this fix as urgent as he claims? My head hurts thinking of the fights, the accusations, the conspiracy theories.  The truth is no one knows how long it will take for quantum to become advanced and accessible enough to pose a threat to blockchains.

42415429,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhSd,1654270198,Market Rout Prompts Analyst to Slash Bitcoin Miners’ Price Targets by Average of 65%,"Wall Street investment bank BTIG lowered its average 12-month price targets for bitcoin (BTC) miners by 65%, citing the decline in bitcoin prices as well as concerns about funding.  “While we expect BTC mining stocks to trade with the BTC price (just like most commodity stocks with the commodity), we believe the other driver of the miner's underperformance to BTC are concerns around funding growth (think a lower BTC price means less capital for growth),” BTIG analyst Greg Lewis wrote in a research report on Friday.  Bitcoin miners have gotten battered this year, their stocks declining by more than 50% on average as the price of bitcoin slumped following last year’s bull run. The pain has been amplified for the miners as the Bitcoin network hashrate, along with mining difficulty, has risen near all-time highs this year, squeezing miner margins.  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  Such market conditions have led to investor concerns that miners won’t be able to raise the funds they need for growth because building a large-scale mining operation is very capital intensive. However, BTIG’s Lewis sees larger miners faring better at raising funds even in a bear market.  “In a flattish BTC price market, the ability to access capital has become that much more important (think financing for rigs, infrastructure, and BTC) and we expect large established miners to continue to have access to capital at the expense of smaller newer miners,” he wrote.  Lewis kept his buy rating on all four mining stocks he covers – Riot Blockchain (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA) – and remains optimistic about the longer-term outlook for the industry. “Not surprisingly, our BTC mining price targets are highly sensitive to our BTC price estimate; hence a near-term BTC price of ~$40K points to 30%-40% upside to our price targets, while a BTC price of $50K points to 90%-100% upside to our price targets,” he wrote.

42411778,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfz7D,1654270024,What Is Optimism?,"Ethereum (ETH), the largest smart-contracts blockchain, has a scalability problem. As more and more users join Ethereum, the network becomes more expensive and slower to use.  In response to Ethereum’s scalability problem, a bunch of Ethereum alternatives – popularly known as ""Ethereum killers"" – have emerged. So-called Ethereum killers, such as Avalanche or Fantom, are separate blockchains, or layer 1s like Ethereum. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ecosystem has come up with a scaling solution: layer 2s, chains that work on top of Ethereum mainnet.  Read More: What Is Avalanche? A Look at the Popular ‘Ethereum-Killer’ Blockchain  Optimism is one of the layer 2 scaling solutions. It’s powered by a technology called Optimistic rollups, which bundle large amounts of transaction data into digestible batches. Optimism is much cheaper to use than Ethereum, and it’s increasingly becoming popular along with other layer 2s, such as Arbitrum.  Optimism is governed by its eponymous token, or OP for short. A portion of the OP supply was airdropped to early Optimism users in late May 2022 in a turbulent launch. Developers behind Optimism said it would continue to airdrop more tokens.  What is Optimism?  Optimism is a layer 2 chain, meaning it functions on top of Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). Transactions take place on Optimism, but the data about transactions get posted to mainnet where they are validated. It’s like driving in a less crowded side street while benefiting from the security of a highway.  Optimism is the second-largest Ethereum layer 2 with a total of $313 million locked into its smart contracts, as of this writing, according to Defi Llama. Arbitrum comes first with $1.32 billion.  Synthetix, a derivatives liquidity protocol, is the largest protocol on Optimism, with a total value locked (TVL) of $125 million. Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), is the second most popular protocol on the chain. As of this writing, there are 35 protocols on Optimism with at least $1,000 locked into their smart contracts.  Read More: What Is Uniswap? A Complete Beginners Guide  How does Optimism work?  Optimism uses a technology called rollups, specifically Optimistic rollups.  They’re called rollups because they roll up (or bundle) the data about hundreds of transactions – non-fungible token (NFT) mints, token swaps … any transaction! – into a single transaction on Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). When so many transactions are rolled up into a single transaction, the blockchain transaction, or ""gas,"" fee required to pay comes down to only one transaction, conveniently distributed across everyone involved.  And they’re called Optimistic rollups because transactions are assumed to be valid until they are proven false, or in other words, innocent until proven guilty. There’s a time window during which potentially invalid transactions can be challenged by submitting a “fraud proof” and running the transactions’ computations with reference to available state data. Optimism reimburses the gas needed to run the computation of the fraud proof. (Here’s a more technically detailed explanation of the process.)  How do you use Optimism?  For users, Optimism feels pretty much the same as Ethereum mainnet. Your Optimism address is the same as your Ethereum mainnet address, which begins with 0x. Optimism’s blockchain explorer is identical to Etherscan, Ethereum mainnet’s blockchain explorer.  Optimism supports a bunch of decentralized finance (DeFi) wallets, including MetaMask, the most popular choice.  Read More: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet  Although you can manually configure your wallet for Optimism, there’s a much easier way: Just go to a DeFi app like SushiSwap (SUSHI) and indicate Optimism as your network (top-right corner in the case of Sushi). Your website selection will force your MetaMask to add the network and switch to it. Welcome to Optimism!  But, of course, just like Ethereum mainnet, Optimism requires ether (ETH) to cover gas fees. So to begin using Optimism, you’ll need to send ETH to your MetaMask from another chain, such as Ethereum mainnet or other layer 2s like Avalanche. To send funds from another chain, you can use any of the bridges that support Optimism.  You can also use a centralized cryptocurrency exchange to fund your Optimism address with ETH. But before attempting to send funds to a layer 2 from your centralized exchange, always make sure that it can support withdrawal to that chain. If you send funds to an address that your exchange doesn’t support, your funds may be irrecoverably lost. As of this writing, Binance, Bybit and Huobi allow withdrawals to Optimism.  What is OP, Optimism’s token?  Optimism launched its OP token on May 31. A total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens for free (known as an “airdrop”). That accounts for 5% of the total 4.29 billion supply, meaning 95% of the supply has yet to hit the market. You can track how many users claimed the first airdrop on this Dune Analytics dashboard.  The initial airdrop was met with “widespread frustration from the Optimism community” after some users claimed tokens early and then dumped those tokens. Optimism admitted there were mistakes and promised a retrospective in a series of tweets:  The OP token gives holders participation rights in The Optimism Collective, a two-tier governance system composed of Token House and Citizens’ House. Citizens’ House will come live later in 2022. Token House, which is already active, governs technical decisions related to Optimism, such as software upgrades. The Citizens’ House governs public-goods funding decisions. In its early days, Optimism itself raised funds on Gitcoin, a major public-goods funding platform.  How do you qualify for an OP airdrop?  In its first airdrop, Optimism used the following criteria to award users with tokens:  Optimism user: use of an OP bridge before June 23, 2021, or use of Optimism projects more than once between June 23, 2021, and March 25, 2022.  Repeat Optimism user: repeat use apps on Optimism in four different weeks between June 23, 2021, and March 25, 2022.  Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voter: active participation in decentralized governance.  Multisignature signers: control over large pools of capital and key protocol functions on Optimism.  Donated to Gitcoin Grants on layer 1: donation to Optimism on the public goods platform.  Priced out of Ethereum: use of bridges while being a regularly active user on layer 1.  The next airdrop may include some, none or all of these criteria. The exact criteria aren’t announced in advance to avoid gaming the system.  When is the next OP airdrop?  In a blog post in April 2022, Optimism said there would be “an entire season of airdrops.” The Optimism team did not disclose the dates of the airdrops, and airdrops are generally announced at short notice.  Before the airdrop takes place, Optimism is likely to announce who’s eligible and how much OP they’re due to receive. This will be based on a snapshot: a record of the state of Optimism chain on a particular block height. Snapshot dates aren’t announced in advance. So if you want to receive OP tokens, get on the network and start playing with the apps. Remember, however, your capital is at risk.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | OP | AIRDROP,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9ceb611dc9ebd039d5d3a78c2d241433e283ac9-1279x959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The blockchain oracle network said Friday that developers who build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Solana mainnet can now incorporate seven of Chainlink’s price feeds into their products.  Popular DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound and dYdX already use Chainlink’s data services. Chainlink’s launch on Solana, however, makes it the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain supported by the network.  Chirag Dhull, head of product marketing at Chainlink Labs, told CoinDesk the “high throughput architecture” of Solana will help the price feeds obtain data at “high speeds and low costs.”  Chainlink’s services have brought 2.6 billion data points to blockchain applications, Dhull said. In February, Bank of America (BAC) attributed the growth of DeFi’s total value locked to Chainlink’s services accelerating mass adoption.  Solana-native projects such as Francium, Tulip and Apricot Finance have committed to integrate Chainlink’s price feeds.

42415424,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhFl,1654266334,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Slips as Report Shows Faster-Than-Expected US Jobs Growth,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin was fluctuating at around $29,700 after a report showing U.S. jobs growth slowed in May.  Market Moves: Crypto winter might really have actually, genuinely, truly now arrived.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was struggling to find direction Friday after a U.S. government report showed that the pace of jobs growth slowed in May – potentially a sign that the Federal Reserve's recent moves to cool the economy might be starting to have an impact.  As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands at around $29,500, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours.  Crypto traders and analysts have been monitoring the Fed's actions because many see the U.S. central bank's $4 trillion-plus of money-printing over the past couple years as having stimulated prices for risky assets. Now that the Fed and President Joe Biden are pledging to tamp down inflation that has been at its fastest in four decades, prices for bitcoin and stocks have come under severe downward pressure.  In traditional markets, European indexes were mixed, and U.S. stock futures were lower on Friday. Gold was down 0.5% to $1,860 an ounce.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 390,000 jobs in May – a modest slowdown from April's 436,000 gain, but above economists' expectations of 325,000.  According to MarketWatch, gold prices were lower after the report that job growth was faster than expected. Analysts say gold will struggle as long as the U.S. dollar is strong in foreign-exchange markets, which is theoretically the case when the Fed is raising interest rates.  Market moves  Crypto winter might have arrived  As bitcoin's price has steadily ticked down – the largest cryptocurrency just completed a record nine-week losing streak – analysts in digital-asset markets have wondered whether a ""crypto winter"" has arrived.  The term harkens back to the 2018 cold spell when bitcoin's price fell 73% that year alone, accompanied by a crash in prices for tokens recently minted at the top of the market through ""initial coin offerings"" or ICOs. Cryptocurrency companies slashed jobs, bitcoin miners mothballed new projects, and breathless headlines vanished from the mainstream press.  After this year's 35% price plunge (so far), signs are now emerging that it might again be time to hunker down.  Recent cost-cutting measures by the Coinbase and Gemini exchanges show how seriously industry heavyweights are taking this pullback.  Riot Blockchain, one of the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, unloaded more than half the bitcoin it mined in May, CoinDesk's Aoyon Ashraf reported Thursday. As the price of bitcoin falls, more miners are powering off or selling their holdings to fund operating budgets; high energy prices are squeezing profits from the cost side.  ""The impact has been felt across the space. Nothing has been spared from this drawdown,"" trading firm QCP Capital wrote Friday in a note to subscribers on Telegram.  QCP ran the math on some of the key comparisons between the current market and 2018. Below are some of the key highlights. Brace yourself.  ""For BTC and ETH, if we match the 2017 drawdowns of 85% and 95% respectively, we will be looking at levels of $10,000 for BTC and $250 for ETH.""  ""While we think this is unlikely, the deep negative skew in the vol markets is reflecting some fear of this happening.""  ""In 2017, it took roughly 1 year to find the bottom for BTC and ETH. We are potentially still some time away from the absolute bottom.""  According to QCP, a big driver of the pullback has been the withdrawal of stimulus liquidity from the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Some of the riskiest tokens might have been the biggest beneficiaries of the money printing-fueled central bank balance sheet expansions.  ""DeFi (decentralized finance) and meme coins have had the largest drawdowns,"" QCP wrote. ""When the easy money dries up, coins with poorest utility and highest multiples suffer the most.""  When does the cycle turn? In the topsy-turvy logic of financial markets, where the Federal Reserve serves as both a countervailing economic force and the 800-pound gorilla, that might happen when the data starts to look really ugly.  ""We are now therefore entering into a 'bad news is good news' phase with regard to growth and employment data,"" QCP wrote. ""The market would trade positive on negative news as that would reduce Fed hawkishness.""

The unemployment rate remained at 3.6% for the third consecutive month, a tick higher than expectations for a decline to 3.5%. The pandemic high in April 2020 was 14.8%.  May's job gain suggests there's been no cooling in the labor market – though it did break a streak of 11 consecutive months of more than 400,000. Checking wages, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in May, flat from April, and up 5.2% year over year.  Another recent report by the Labor Department showed that employers had 11.4 million vacancies in April, which means that there are nearly two jobs available for every person looking for a job.

42415415,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVh0k,1654257600,"Crypto Firms, Especially Exchanges, Slash Jobs as Market Rout Continues","The prolonged downturn in cryptocurrency prices, along with broader tech sector woes, has led to a growing number of layoffs at crypto firms as participants brace for a bumpier ride ahead.  On Thursday, the Winklevoss-led crypto exchange and custodian Gemini was one of the latest to announce job cuts of about 10% of its workforce, with the firm citing “turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time.” Soon after, Middle Eastern crypto exchange Rain Financial said it was cutting dozens of jobs due to the difficult market.  On top of those pieces of news, the largest publicly traded U.S crypto exchange, Coinbase Global (COIN), reiterated on Thursday that it would be extending its previously announced hiring pause and even rescinding accepted job offers as part of cost-cutting maneuvers amid tough market conditions.  ""The recent market volatility and subsequent layoffs will likely continue into this summer,” predicted Masha Boone, vice president of people at non-fungible token (NFT) exchange Rarible. “However, it is important to recognize this as an opportunity to reflect on what is needed in the crypto space and reconsider where the industry is headed from here.”  For her part, Boone told CoinDesk that Rarible was using the turmoil as an opportunity to strengthen its internal development and product teams.  Exchanges hit particularly hard  Cryptocurrency’s downturn has coincided with a rout in public stock markets, with interest rate hikes designed to tamp down inflation spooking investors in many high-flying technology and growth equities. Crypto exchanges that may have relied on retail traders during a time of excess liquidity in the system have seen significant slowdowns in trading.  As a result, crypto exchanges have been among the quickest to cut jobs in the current environment. In addition to the moves by Gemini and Coinbase, Argentina-based crypto exchange Buenbit recently laid off 45% of its staff, top Latin American crypto exchange Bitso cut 80 employees out of its workforce of 700+ workers and the holding company for leading Brazilian exchange Mercado Bitcoin laid off over 80 employees.  “It is natural that the exchanges, which are currently seeing lower volumes, are cutting back,” said George Sutton, an equity analyst with research firm Craig Hallum. “The beauty of this industry is there are a plethora of disruptive models in the digital currency and blockchain space to gladly hire any available talent. We view the volume declines as temporary,” Sutton told CoinDesk via email.  Going forward, crypto companies with valid use cases and utility are the ones that will best survive, according to Nicholas Strange, founder of Seattle-based hiring firm Crypto Talent. Many crypto firms have been through downturns before and have become better at managing their treasuries, Strange told CoinDesk. Additionally, quarter-over-quarter venture capital funding remains at all-time highs, and certain VC firms may use this downturn to continue funding promising crypto-related projects, Strange said.

Lawsuit Concerning Bitcoin Futures Contract From 2017 According to an official press release from the CFTC, in 2017, Gemini&apos;s founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made false or misleading statements to the watchdog during the exchange&apos;s application for bitcoin futures contracts. In other words, the CFTC claims that Gemini lied or omitted facts about how easily the Bitcoin futures contract could fall prey to price manipulation. &apos;Making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in connection with a futures product certification undermines the CFTC&apos;s work to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to the CEA, protect market participants, deter and prevent price manipulation, and promote responsible innovation and fair competition,&apos; said Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe. The CFTC said it would seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, monetary penalties, and injunctions relating to registration and trading and against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The BNB price cannot break and fix above the $335 mark. At the same time, the trading volumes on the market is virtually unchanged from July 2021. In fact, the BNB price came in an extremely wide liquidity zone, ranging from $213 to $294. It is unclear exactly where the new growth wave may begin. However, we have identified two important liquidity levels - $264 and $213. It is during the test of these marks that you can risk buying BNB with the first target of $377. The strength of the $264 mark is noticeable in the weekly timeframe both when the coin price rises and when it falls. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/soKWbRLj/ Note that in March 2021, buyers on increased volumes could not control the $264 range for the first time. In May 2021, fixing the price above $264 allowed buyers to start a new growth wave with the final target of $669. If you consider the mark of $213 to buy BNB - this is an extremely strong level, where the price is not so common. This liquidity zone reflected all the most powerful fall waves and formed false breakdowns. The $213 mark is the critical point of the BNB growth trend. It will be dangerous to invest in the BNB below.

Related Reading | Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest That Investors Are Starting To Accumulate With all the chaos, it&apos;s no surprise that the co-founder of BitMex predicts both Bitcoin and Ethereum bottom levels. According to Hayes, Bitcoin will relax at $25,000-$27000, while Ethereum will remain at $1700-$1800. This is a far cry from what both cryptos were trading some months back. On his reasons for making the predictions, Hayes pointed out that the sale of 80,000 BTC done recently by Terra has reduced the frenzy to sell Bitcoin. Another reason for this set bottom is that BTC is lagging while stocks recover. Last week, while Wall Street saw some positives, Bitcoin went lower instead to $29,000+ from May 29 to May 30.

However, the country has made positive moves to legalize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Minister of Industry and Trade in Russia Denis Manturov recently announced that cryptocurrencies would be legalized as a form of payment in Russia in the future. This indicates that the government and central bank may be approaching a resolution of their differences. Just before Russia deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24, the finance ministry introduced legislation that contradicted the central bank&apos;s desire for a blanket ban. Someone asked Manturov in a forum if he believed that cryptocurrencies would become legal as a form of payment. Of course, now that the government and the central bank are actively working on it, the question is how it will be regulated once it occurs.

The Metaverse trend shows no signs of slowing down as Companies such as Facebook create their own, and billions of dollars are invested into the industry. So, why are people interested in it? The Metaverse employs what is known as play-to-earn, where users can accumulate wealth or assets for completing tasks within a Metaverse. This varies with projects as some create a social hub where other more advanced Metaverse environments offer lucrative P2E incentives. In addition, people spend between four and five hours a day with leisure time - why not have this leisure time earn you money? Someone may spend four hours a day playing the popular Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5) title by Rockstar Games. In this game, the player completes a mission with friends and acquires guns, cars, and houses. In addition, the player may spend real money buying fake currency and purchasing more vehicles. Alternatively, the Metaverse allows this while making actual money. This is because the tokens the users earn are tradable to anyone around the globe, from NFTs to fungible tokens like the MTVT token within Metaverser. Metaverser is a P2E project that aims to provide a world of opportunity, fun, and profit-making.

Originally perceived solely as entertainment, today gaming has transformed into a means of making a substantial profit. It&apos;s now evident that the NFT rental systems will become one of the core instruments of the GameFi and DeFi industry. Yet, the nascent industry still lacks an aggregator that would connect members of the GameFi ecosystem, give brands a better idea of consumers&apos; intent, lower entry barriers, and create more trust in the space, nor tools that would allow monetizing NFTs to make a profit. UNITBOX DAO is the first custody-free NFT renting and leasing protocol, as well as the first use case of the wrapped NFT (wNFT) technology. It leverages DeFi mechanics to aggregate millions of crypto investors, renters (guilds, scholars), and players to provide them with access to its one-of-a-kind Rent-to-Earn model.

And now, it&apos;s making its way into one of the most important parts of everyday life - communication. But what makes blockchain so powerful, and what exactly does it have to do with the way in which we talk to others? What Makes Blockchain Powerful Cryptocurrency networks decide on the true state of their blockchains using consensus mechanisms, processes that verify the legitimacy of data stored within blocks and decide where along a particular blockchain those blocks belong. If nodes within a cryptocurrency network disagree on a blockchain&apos;s true state, then protocols specific to each network automatically settle the dispute and determine the correct blockchain. Because this is done automatically, it is very difficult for an attacker to commit fraudulent transactions. Consensus mechanisms contribute to another attractive feature of blockchains, that being their immutability. Data stored within blockchains cannot be retroactively changed or reversed without majority consensus. 51% or more of all nodes within a cryptocurrency network must agree to change the state of a blockchain. As a cryptocurrency grows, it becomes harder and harder for a single entity to control 51% of the network.

Japan is one of the first major economies to pass a law specific to stablecoins even if the legislation comes into effect in a year, the report added.  The bill provides clarity around the definition of stablecoins, which will now be considered as digital money and must be linked to the yen or another legal tender, guaranteeing holders the right to redeem them at face value.  Stablecoins can now only be issued by licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies. The bill does not address existing asset-backed or algorithmic stablecoins. However, exchanges in Japan do not list stablecoins.  Prepared by Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), the bill was planned in late 2021, accepted by the House in mid-March this year and has now been passed by a majority in the House of Councilors plenary session.  In the wake of the terraUSD (UST) collapse, this swift action by Japan could help restore confidence in crypto.

42415422,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhDc,1654234343,New York State Senate Passes Bitcoin Mining Moratorium,"The New York State Senate passed a bill targeting proof-of-work (PoW) mining early Friday morning in an effort to address some of the environmental concerns about cryptocurrencies.  The bill, which was passed by the state Assembly last month, would impose a two-year moratorium on new PoW mining projects powered by carbon-based fuel in the Empire State, though existing mining firms or ones currently undergoing the permit renewal process would be allowed to continue operations. The Senate voted 36-27 in favor of the bill.  According to the bill's Democratic sponsor, state Sen. Kevin Parker of Brooklyn, there is only one such plant in current operation that wouldn't be affected by the bill. He added that there is one pending application that may be put on hold until the study has concluded.  During the moratorium, the state will conduct a study on the potential environmental impact of proof-of-work mining.  Many had expected the bill to die in committee – the fate met by last year’s version of the bill – after the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee declined to consider the bill during its last meeting of the session. The committee’s chairman, state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, told CoinDesk in May that he was worried the bill could lead to “deleterious economic consequences for New York if people perceive it as being hostile to crypto.”  However, an eleventh-hour referral of the bill from the Environmental Conservation Committee to the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, where Parker is the chairman, on Thursday evening meant that the bill was able to reach the full Senate floor for a vote mere hours before the close of the legislative session at midnight.  Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul still needs to sign the bill before it can become law.  Read more: What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry  New York has long been seen as a place for crypto mining firms to set up because of the state's cheap hydroelectric energy sources. In more recent years, mining firms have also repurposed defunct coal power generation facilities. Greenidge Generation, for example, refurbished one such facility to operate using natural gas.  The crypto industry rallied against the bill after its Assembly counterpart was introduced last May, with many industry advocates calling the proposal a “ban” on mining outright.  John Olsen, a lobbyist with the Bitcoin Association, told CoinDesk last month that he feared the moratorium could be extended or turned into a ban over the course of the next two years, which could drive away companies seeking to set up shop near New York’s cheap energy sources.  Mining companies based in New York have threatened to leave the state if the moratorium is passed, pointing to the comparative ease of doing business in more mining-friendly states like Texas.  Clark Vaccaro, the acting president and chief strategy officer at industry trade organization BaSIC, told CoinDesk the passage of the bill ""is a grim day for blockchain technology, effectively shutting the door on a nascent industry.""

In 2021, rug pulls consisted of 37% of cryptocurrency scam revenue, compared to a negligible 1% in 2020. The term was coined after the expression &apos;pulling the rug out from under&apos;, which means to abruptly withdraw support. What is Rug Pulls? The term is often thrown over the internet by exasperated investors who have lost their money. But what are rug pulls? Rug pulls are essentially projects where developers siphon large amounts of money from investors, and then withdraw everything from the liquidity pool, causing the value of the cryptocurrency created for the &apos;project&apos; to drop drastically. They are intricate and manipulative scams that usually occur on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). How long does rug pull last? While rug pulls do not have a general time frame to classify them, any crypto coin suspiciously skyrocketing in price is relatively more likely to be a scam. Here are some examples of the most notorious rug pull scams to take place in recent times: Thodex Thodex is a Turkish centralized exchange platform that obstructed its user&apos;s ability to withdraw any and all funds.

As a result, the Ethereum blockchain would go on to birth a revolution of decentralized innovation in the financial world. The decentralized finance world is becoming hypercompetitive; with the growth of various projects garnering widespread attention. Meanwhile, note that the total locked value in the DeFi sector has grown by 60% - 73% between 2021 and 2022. Despite this growth, the sector still faces challenges ranging from hacks and security loopholes. In this post, we discuss some of the top DeFi platforms by TVL in 2022: 1. Compound The compound is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance market that bridges the gap between lenders, borrowers and a pool of assets. Also remember, that the platform aims to eliminate a centralized authority. The liquidity pool on Compound Protocol pools funds from lenders who already have their funds deposited on the cTokens exchange. When the pooled funds accrue interest, lenders can then redeem them later on for collateral and reap more profits. 2. MarkerDAO MarkerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that runs on the Ethereum Network. The platform has two digital coins; MKR and an algorithmic stablecoin.

Firstly, it allows NFT creators to mint (also known as creating/adding NFTs to the blockchain) NFTs and list them for sale. Secondly, it gives collectors a platform to browse and buy original NFTs. There are over 3,000 NFTs on the site, with a wide range of categories for collectors to choose from. Since its launch in July, the TRX token has risen steadily with a trading volume of around $1.3 billion and a market capitalization of over $2 billion. The NFT Foundation has more than 177,000 NFTs, with a royalty rate for creators that is limited to 10% compared to Mintable&apos;s unlimited.
