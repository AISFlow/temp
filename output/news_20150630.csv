42378208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MyBB,1435690889,Payments Firm Backs 'Crazy' Offline Bitcoin Transactions Experiment,"As an Internet-based payment system, most bitcoin transactions today necessitate that users are online or otherwise can print and exchange private keys.  However, Romanian mobile payments provider Netopia mobilPay is now backing a proposal that strives for a middle path. Called OffCoin, the proposal is for a system that allows microSD cards in mobile phones to generate, store, transmit and delete bitcoin private keys.  In effect, OffCoin would be capable of moving digital currency between mobile phones without requiring users to be connected to the Internet or needing to pay the cost of using the bitcoin blockchain. By transacting with NFC, Bluetooth, QR codes or a combination of these technologies, Netopia suggests it can allow users to send and receive bitcoin without paying fees for sending funds over the bitcoin blockchain.  CEO Antonio Eram called the project one of the company's recent ""experiments"" with bitcoin, which also include the new exchange product, BTKO.in it debuted at a recent Silicon Valley event. An established mobile payments company, Netopia boasts an estimated 24 million customers and relationships with telecommunications giants T-Mobile and Vodafone.  Explaining his firm's interest in the OffCoin project, Eram told CoinDesk:  ""Decentralised bitcoin for offline usage is a reality with our solution. As I have presented, there is only positive impact on the public ledger. We've just created a trusted offline, off-blockchain infrastructure.""  Project developers argue that the system is decentralized, since there's no central entity that guarantees the funds. Further, parts of the transaction process are segregated, as the bitcoin wallet would only have part of the private key, to be completed by the microSD cards.  Netopia indicates that OffCoin now works with most Android phones version 4.1 or higher that accepts microSD cards, though the company is seeking to expand its capabilities.  ""We have an USB version available for testing and soon one that is compatible with iPhone. This was designed to be universally acceptable and not a solution for high end phones,"" said Eram. ""Our vision is to enable offline bitcoin transactions anywhere in the world. Including the areas where phones are not exactly high end.""  Project origins  OffCoin as a concept and project dates back to late 2013, as it is a rebranding and furthering of development of the Othercoin project started by Romanian developer Razvan Dragomirescu.  Under its former name, OffCoin attracted the attention of notable bitcoin developers such as Gregory Maxwell, Adam Back, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, who offered early and varying opinions on the concept. Maxwell, now a CTO at Blockstream, called the proposal a ""fantastic idea"", but suggested issues could arise should the issuers of the microSD cards compromise the system. Similarly, Hearn expressed his optimism that advancements with smartphones and Internet connectivity would negate the need for such solutions.  Dragomirescu ultimately developed the project alone, but he attracted the attention of Netopia, which began negotiations to invest and promote the project this year.  ""This solution is revolutionary in terms of enabling bitcoin payments and transfers for offline usage,"" Eram said of the move. ""We may be in avant-garde, however, we know the applicability can be expanded exponentially.""  Because OffCoin maintains security while keeping transactions private, Eram went so far as to say it could be a potent development tool as the network seeks to increase its transaction processing capabilities.  For example, the recent debate over bitcoin's standard block size rests on the number of transactions able to be transmitted over the network each second. By conducting transactions off-chain more widely, the number of transactions broadcast on the network could theoretically be reduced.  Solution viability  Given the offline nature of transactions, Eram framed the project as one that could have relevance in context of proposals such as the Lightning network that are seeking to reduce the number of transactions that need to be entered directly on the blockchain.  ""Offcoin is about real privacy. Achieved offline without any changes in the blockchain, as in forks, or expensive hardware. This is an elegant solution that accomplishes a lot,"" he said. ""Releasing pressure from the blockchain is in line with the discussion of changing the block size for allowing more transactions. With OffChain, we can do this and use the blockchain as a settlement layer.""  Still, some observers caution against the widespread use of the tech, with developer Justus Ranvier suggesting a more thorough analysis of the cost of extracting private keys through illicit means would be needed.  Other factors could also limit the usefulness of the system, however, such as the decline in the use of microSD cards in mobile devices, a trend attributable to the cost phone manufacturers can charge for more data space.  Eram, though, believes developments such as Google's Project Vault, which seeks to build a secure computer on a microSD-sized device, demonstrate a continued interest in the technology.  Question of scale  One of the most frequent criticisms levied against the project, while interesting to developers, has been the difficulties in achieving scale, which is where Netopia believes it can help take the project forward.  As a mobile payments specialist, Eram said, the company already has a network of consumers, merchants and telecommunications providers it could leverage to promote solutions like OffCoin as well as bitcoin more broadly.  ""Since we are big enough, we can push bitcoin to various markets. We're pretty confident that our investment in the ecosystem will pay off in some time,"" he added.  Eram said that interest in bitcoin is growing among members of these industries due to the use of bitcoin amongst Romania's freelancers.  ""They want to be paid in bitcoins now. That's an income that is in bitcoins, and they have to be used, and so what we have done in the last six to seven months is that we enable a lot of merchants to accept bitcoins,"" Eram said.  He estimated BTKO.in is now doing roughly 5 BTC in daily volume, but that the service has yet to open to the general public.  No launch schedule  As for when the project may be more widely announced, Eram indicated Netopia is currently looking for the ""best opportunity"". He suggested this could coincide with the launch of BTKO.in.  Eram noted that Netopia will likely use its standard strategy in promoting the technology, placing an early bet that may be advantageous later.  ""We are in a very good position to start a bitcoin business in that region, also we are very well known for innovation, even if we do like crazy experiments,"" Eram continued.  In particular, Eram said that Netopia is currently investigating how it can enter the European, Latin American and Middle Eastern markets later this year, concluding:  ""With OffCoin we think is the same. Huge potential. Maybe not the right time, considering the acceptance of bitcoin, but we are confident that we can make a difference.""

42378195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Mxw5,1435678542,"Tibdit Raises £122,000 for Bitcoin Tipping Platform","Bitcoin micropayments startup Tibdit has raised £122,080 in seed capital through a crowdfunding campaign.  Founded in September 2013, the London firm lets users send bitcoin tips or 'tibs' between 3p–75p to content producers.  As a result of the raise, which took place on equity crowdfunding platform Seedrs, 161 investors will receive 15.03% equity in the firm.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Tibdit co-founder Justin Maxwell said the company's decision to use Seedrs reflected the ""democratic"" ethos of its business.  ""Micropayments made via Tibdit are inherently very 'democratic', providing an opportunity for everyone whether they are the online equivalent of buskers [or] mainstream content providers.""  Roughly half of its money will go towards additional features, while a third will be used to expand the handful of sites that currently support Tibdit. The remainder will cover operational expenses.  ""We have identified a number of sectors where tibbing can be of real value and has a really good fit, and are prioritising these now,"" Maxwell said.  Access payments  Bitcoin micropayments have been largely popularised by tipping platform ChangeTip, which markets itself as a 'love button' for social media platforms including Twitter, Reddit and SoundCloud. Back in December, the firm raised $3.5m seed funding from investors including Pantera Capital and 500 Startups.  Unlike its competitor, WordPress plugin Tibdit facilitates both tips and 'access payments', where users can pay to view content beyond a publisher's paywall.  As the publisher, or 'tibbee', cannot see the value of each transaction, Maxwell said they are ""forced to treat ever tibber equally"".  While ad-hoc tipping models like Changetip have had some success with bitcoin, he added, there is still work to be done to rethink micropayments:  ""Advertising-swamp, click-bait, and subscription-paywall-popups are encroaching further and further into our online experiences. The need for a viable alternative that really works for both commercial and non-commercial sites has never been greater than it is now.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated users could send tips of between £3 and £70.

42378204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7My8f,1435669286,BitGo Launches New Financial Transparency Service,"BitGo has announced a new service that leverages the security firm's status as a consigner on its multisig accounts to allow customers the means to provide greater financial transparency.  As part of the announcement, bitcoin firm ChangeTip will use the new Verified by BitGo service to demonstrate its account holdings. The tipping platform will display its bitcoin solvency on its website, listing assets and liabilities in real-time along with information specific to individual users.  Links to the Verified by BitGo page will also be displayed within each user's ChangeTip account page and on the website's home page when users aren't logged in to the service.  According to the company, Verified by BitGo is seeking to become a foundational security feature for companies operating on the blockchain in the same way that VeriSign's offerings helped expand consumer trust in e-commerce.  As explained by BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, Verified by BitGo aims to mainstream the complex proof of reserves processes long used by prominent companies in the industry as a way to build consumer trust.  Davenport told CoinDesk:  ""You've seen this a number of ways done over time. You've seen it very ad-hoc, where an exchange would make a very large transfer to prove that they had control of the funds. That's very risky, and fraught with operational risk.""  The service also intends to showcase the ability of BitGo's technology in tracking more conventional assets, as the service will be able to provide proof of fiat currency reserves for companies that keep consumer balances in such holdings.  As such, Davenport sees bitcoin exchanges as one of the sectors best capable of driving adoption of its new tool, though such discussions, he said, are still in the early stages.  ""We're having conversations with exchanges. I don't think we have specific names but we hope to launch with some additional customers,"" he said.
