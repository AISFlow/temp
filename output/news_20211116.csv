13222058,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=476543,1637107195,"Paypal Loses AMC Theaters Throne, Bitpay Will Support Shiba Inu Payments","AMC Theather, the largest movie theater company in the world, announced that they will be accepting Shiba Inu (SHIB) as a payment method through Bitpay, becoming their first client to do so. The company has been working on accepting diverse cryptocurrencies as payment methods for a while and now offers to do so through PayPal, which allows payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Lietcoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). However, AMC is also interested in accepting the meme cryptocurrencies Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) because of the remarkable popularity both showed on Twitter during polls made by the theater chain CEO Adam Aron. When CEO Adam Aron conducted the last Twitter poll, Shiba Inu got 124,623 votes in favor, which takes us to this new announcement in which Shiba Inu shares its spotlight with Bitpay. In about 3 months PayPal will cease to be the only payment method that supports cryptocurrencies on the AMC website. Related Reading | AMC Theaters Considers Accepting Shiba Inu As Payment Amid Growing Interest Bitpay, as a payment method for the theater chain, does not only allow more cryptos as options -a great marketing strategy for AMC-, but it also emphasizes Paypal limitations with only four crypto coins and services that lack many great features offered by actual crypto wallets.

42375847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBpvv,1637106550,Director Quentin Tarantino Sued by Miramax Over ‘Pulp Fiction’ NFTs,"Famed director Quentin Tarantino is being sued by Miramax for copyright infringement after Tarantino announced he would be auctioning off a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) from his celebrated movie “Pulp Fiction” at the recent NFT NYC conference.  The seven NFTs being sold are from different scenes that were cut from the final film, for which Miramax currently owns the rights.  While Tarantino owns the rights to publish the film’s screenplay, Miramax, the powerhouse entertainment company that produced and distributed the 1994 film, says the one-time NFT sale falls outside that categorization.  The company sent a cease-and-desist letter to Tarantino to stop the sale, but the director has continued to push forward with his plans.  Miramax attorney Bart Williams said in a statement that the studio has plans to “maximize” the film’s NFT rights “through a strategic, comprehensive approach.”  The lawsuit is complicated by the fact the NFTs are “secret,” meaning the tokens are programmed so that only their owners can view the deleted scenes. The studio is suing the director over content that it hasn’t seen.

42396506,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT40yw,1637105400,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Plummets, Dashing Hopes of a Quick Return to Its Record High","Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Crypto traders were licking their wounds – and looking for explanations – after bitcoin’s biggest single-day price decline in almost four weeks.  Technician’s Take: Short-term indicators suggest limited downside into Asian trading hours.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $60,643 -5.16%  Ether (ETH): $4,264 -6.77%  Market moves  Bitcoin on Tuesday suffered its worst daily loss in almost four weeks, all but upending any near-term hopes of a return to last week’s all-time high near $69,000. The bitcoin price was down more than 5% over the past 24 hours.  “Overall, we’ve turned quite neutral after this awaited leverage washout,” the cryptocurrency trading firm QCP Capital wrote Tuesday in a market update on its Telegram channel. “We expect some gravity around this [$]60,000 level.”  In trying to explain the latest sell-off, traders cited U.S. President Joe Biden’s signing this week of an infrastructure bill containing a controversial cryptocurrency tax-reporting requirement, as well as a drop-off in enthusiasm after last weekend’s Taproot upgrade on the Bitcoin blockchain, the network’s first major enhancement in four years.  “There was some expectation that this would be a catalyst for a leg higher in price,” QCP Capital wrote. “The lack of reaction caused a ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ effect.”  The debut Tuesday of a new bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund – the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, stock ticker XBTF – did little to generate much enthusiasm.  In traditional markets, stocks rose after a report of higher-than-expected U.S. retail sales in October, seen as an indicator that consumers remain ebullient despite the fastest inflation rate in three decades.  But there’s some speculation that higher inflation might prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to accelerate tightening its monetary policy. Such a move could put downward pressure on investment assets considered risky, such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  “Bitcoin may continue to attract inflation hedges, but if pricing pressures trigger rapid rate-hiking action from the Fed, that could trigger a massive wave of risk aversion that would penalize cryptos,” wrote Edward Moya, senior markets analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Stabilizes Near $60K Support; Faces Resistance at $63K-65K  Bitcoin (BTC) is down about 5% over the past 24 hours after sellers became more active than buyers around the $65,000 resistance level.  The cryptocurrency was stabilizing around $60,000 support and appeared to be oversold on intraday charts.  For now, short-term indicators suggest limited downside into Asian trading hours. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is the most oversold since Oct. 27, which preceded a near 10% price bounce.  Still, the RSI on the daily chart was neutral as upside momentum continues to wane. This suggested intraday buyers will be quick to take profits around the $63,000-$65,000 resistance zone.  A period of consolidation could persist over the next few days before BTC establishes a stronger footing around the $60,000 support zone.

Bitcoin’s price slid about 5% over the past 24 hours, although the price later stabilized around the $60,000 support level. Technical indicators suggest BTC is oversold, which could support a brief price bounce during Asian trading hours.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): 60,128.20, -5.96%  Ether (ETH): 4,234.64, -7.55%  S&P 500: 4,700.90, +0.39%  Gold: 1,850.62, -0.62%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1,637%  “Bitcoin’s sell-off has taken it back to levels last seen 10 days ago; hardly a plunge, more a correction of the multi-month rally,” Nicholas Cawley, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  If current support levels hold, Cawley expects BTC to eventually reach a new all-time high over the coming weeks.  ‘Extreme greed’ tapers off  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is starting to fall from the highest level since September, suggesting that extreme optimism among market participants is starting to fade.  “After bitcoin’s crash today, the index will likely see a substantial fall, but this is common in bull markets and doesn’t necessarily imply that the show is over for now,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin’s pullback also triggered higher intraday volatility, which could mean buyers and sellers are uncertain about future price direction. BTC has traded in a range between $57,000 and $69,000 over the past week.  Crypto mildly overbought  “The crypto space has now become mildly overbought,” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, an investment research firm, said during an interview with CoinDesk. The chart below shows MRB’s cyclical momentum indicator, which has risen from oversold levels over the past month.  Espinosa said that risk-taking in cryptocurrencies has been heavily incentivized by extreme monetary and fiscal stimulus. This could mean cryptocurrencies have further room to rise and eventually reach extreme overbought levels.  For now, “I believe that until real interest rates become restrictive, the recent rally in this speculative space has legs,” Espinosa said.

It will also include no annual fees and lockup of assets to earn rewards and users can access their assets via ATMs.  Supply chain meets NFTs: MultiChain, one of the first blockchain platforms to explore ways enterprises could benefit from crypto tech, is adapting non-fungible tokens (NFT) to the needs of buttoned-up businesses, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported.

Brave browser launches built-in crypto wallets: Brave’s browser has a built-in crypto wallet thanks to an update on Tuesday, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. Adding a native wallet is an obvious play for crypto-conscious Brave Software, Inc., which says it has 42 million monthly active users. Brave Wallet, which is self-custodied – meaning wallet users hold their private keys – allows for token purchases through Wyre, tracks portfolio performance, swaps a wide range of tokens and stores non-fungible tokens.

42396504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT40xx,1637092524,Israel’s New AML Rules May Help Banks Onboard Crypto Clients,"Israel’s new anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing rules for crypto asset service providers take effect this week, clearing the way for local banks to more easily accept clients from the crypto sector.  Local banks have so far taken an ad hoc approach to accepting deposits tied to crypto investments. Crypto advocates in Israel see the new AML regulations, which came into effect on Sunday, as a first step in setting up comprehensive guidelines at the national level for banks.  “We hope that this order will significantly reduce transfer blocks and the denial of banking services experienced by crypto users and investors, and create a better atmosphere for investors, users and companies in the field,” said Youval Rouach, CEO of Israeli crypto exchange Bits of Gold, in a written statement.  Israel has been making a number of policy moves to rein in the local crypto market this year, from proposing strict reporting requirements on crypto transactions for tax purposes to ordering insurance and investment houses in the country to justify any investments linked to bitcoin.  The much-awaited AML regulations were a joint effort by the country’s Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Authority and the Ministry of Justice, and follow guidelines set for crypto assets by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  “It is a milestone in transforming crypto into a solid-steel financial tool that can be used by citizens and businesses of all types. Once digital currencies become regulated, the opportunities will be endless,” said Eli Bejerano, CEO and cofounder of Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bit2C, referring to the AML enforcement order.  The new AML rules cover identification and verification of crypto recipients, reporting requirements for crypto firms, and lay out a risk-based approach to dealing with money laundering. Earlier this month, Israel’s Capital Market Authority published a draft circular about how all financial service providers including banks should go about enforcing the AML rules.  “This provision, which complements the provisions of the [AML order], is intended to guide the supervised bodies in the implementation of a risk-based approach to dealing with money laundering risks and terrorist financing,” according to Sunday’s statement by Israel’s Ministry of Justice.  How Israeli banks deal with crypto  On Sunday, one local media outlet reported that the new AML rules will allow Israeli banks to accept deposits or profits from crypto trading without “falling [afoul] of anti-money laundering legislation.”  But according to Ilan Sterk, chief executive officer of Altshuler Shaham Horizon, the digital asset arm of one of Israel’s largest investment houses, the new AML regulations that came into effect on Nov. 14 only apply to crypto service providers.  “On the other hand, the banks are subject to supervision by the bank overseer in the Bank of Israel and so the new regulations do not automatically apply to them,” Sterk said in a written statement.  Rouach clarified that crypto holders are already able to deposit money originating from digital currency transactions in Israeli banks.  “The problem was that different users were blocked due to arbitrary reasons, whether it was a specific branch, or a particular banking group,” Rouach said.  Bejerano confirmed this, saying Israeli banks enforce their own policies, which may “differ from branch to branch or from client to client.”  Sterk added that currently many investors can’t even buy cryptocurrencies because some banks block bank transfers to digital asset service providers.  Ben Samocha, founder of Israeli crypto media platform CryptoJungle, went so far as to say that the local banking system has become an “enormous liability” for the growing Israeli crypto market.  “The banks’ policies have essentially made every crypto holder a suspect of wrongdoing, despite almost all of them being honest taxpayers with clean records,” Samocha said.  Samocha, who also manages CryptoTalks, an Israeli crypto Facebook group that amassed nearly 30,000 followers in the last year, said he knows of situations in which people chose not to buy cryptocurrencies solely because they didn’t want trouble with the banks.  “That is no less than outrageous in my view,” Samocha said. “I personally know honest people who cannot sell cryptocurrencies back to Israeli shekels because the banks wouldn’t accept it – even if it’s to pay taxes.”  But Samocha, Bejerano, Sterk and Rouach all confirmed that the Bank of Israel has said by the end of the year it will be publishing guidelines for banks on how they should deal with cryptocurrencies.  “As such, crypto players will need to wait a little longer in order to understand how they can deposit profits from their investments in local Israeli banks,” Sterk said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/16/israels-new-aml-rules-may-help-banks-onboard-crypto-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4dc867186a685ecf7a6f6996ff3f58075dd77bc-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Funding Rates Briefly Fell Below Zero Yesterday As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the funding rates have plummeted following a spike around when BTC made a new ATH. Yesterday, they briefly went below zero. The &apos;funding rate&apos; is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us about the current periodic payments that futures contract traders are making between each other. When the metric has positive values, it means long traders are paying short traders to keep their positions. Such a situation suggests that the market sentiment is currently bullish. On the other hand, negative values of the indicator imply short traders are paying a premium to hold their positions. This trend may mean that the market sentiment is bearish at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of the Bitcoin funding rate has changed in the past couple of months: Looks like the funding rates have plummeted recently | Source: The Arcane Research Weekly Update - Week 45 As the above graph shows, when Bitcoin made a new ATH around $69k earlier in the month, the indicator also showed a big positive spike.

The DOJ said in an announcement Tuesday that the liquidation was the most sizable recovery of assets tied to a crypto fraud by the U.S. to date.  The agency said it would “begin the process” of selling the seized cryptocurrency and would hold the proceeds in U.S. dollars with the intent of providing restitution to the victims of the scheme.

42411622,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPL84,1637084212,Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?,"On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal ran a tantalizing headline: “Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Could Be Unmasked at Florida Trial.” Nakamoto, of course, is a pseudonym used by the person or people who laid out the basic principles of Bitcoin, helped develop it between roughly 2008 and 2011, then disappeared with secret identity intact. You would think the Journal’s report on possible new information about Satoshi’s real identity would be welcomed by the cryptocurrency world.  You would be mistaken. The headline was greeted with reactions ranging from confusion to withering scorn from major crypto figures including Matthew Graham of Sino Global Capital, Bitcoin educator Matt Odell and author Vijay Boyapati.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Two Sides? Maybe Not.  The crux of the backlash was at least twofold.  First, the headline and much of the story are at best misleading on purely factual grounds. The ongoing civil trial between computer scientist Craig Wright and the estate of former collaborator David Kleiman does not actively consider the question of whether Wright is, as he has claimed for years, Satoshi. The Kleiman estate largely accepts Wright’s claim as part of its standing for the lawsuit, and a verdict either way would not, in itself, amount to a judgment on whether Wright is Satoshi.  But more substantively, fury over the Journal story manifests a bone-deep exhaustion among Wright skeptics at having, yet again, to deal with all this. Wright has been making claims to be Satoshi for more than half a decade at this point, but the bitcoin and broader crypto communities have found his evidence consistently unconvincing. Defenses of Wright these days come overwhelmingly from his own affiliates, particularly CoinGeek, the news operation owned by Calvin Ayre, an online-gambling entrepreneur who has faced legal trouble in North America. Ayre is also an investor in nChain, where Wright is chief scientist.  nChain develops commercial blockchain services on Bitcoin SV, which forked from Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as part of the long fallout of the so-called “block-size war.” The campaign to prove that Wright is Satoshi is inextricable from nChain and Ayre’s financial stake in BSV, which stands for “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision” and purports to represent Satoshi’s true design intentions. If the BSV price is an index of the industry’s acceptance of that claim, it has not been very convincing: BSV has lost roughly 94% of its value relative to BTC since January 2020.  The continued serious treatment of Wright’s claim to be Satoshi, by no less an institution than the Wall Street Journal and despite the apparently widespread disbelief of Wright’s peers, exemplifies much broader challenges of the digitized information age. Just as cyberlibertarians like John Perry Barlow predicted in the early 1990s, the internet has provided a powerful platform for voices that break from the consensus. CoinGeek and Ayre have stuck by Wright despite nearly universal condemnation and mockery, and have managed to attract enough true believers to keep their version of the story, at the very least, on the menu.  Of course, the Wright story may also be an example of the costs that come with this diversity of voices. Wright-as-Satoshi is just one in a long list of issues that can be plausibly characterized as “unresolved” because of the persistence of a vocal or well-funded minority against an overwhelming expert consensus. For those who remain skeptical of Wright, that leaves the barn door open for an endless debate that is, at best, a wearying distraction from more substantive and constructive issues.  Other similarly contested claims have had devastating real-world consequences and torn open large social rifts. The nonsensical “Q” movement colonized the brains of tens of thousands of Americans, distracting would-be child saviors from actual pedophile rings, only to fizzle out in deadly embarrassment. A single since-retracted study has become the foundation for a terrifying backlash against the scientific triumph of vaccination.  See also: Square-Led COPA Sues Craig Wright Over Bitcoin White Paper Copyright Claims  These examples of social media meltdown, though, may make it too easy to forget the advantages of leaving space for heterodoxy: Sometimes, after all, the contrarians are right. Ideas that were long considered crank “conspiracy theories,” such as the CIA’s LSD-based mind control experiments and role in the global drug trade, have been bolstered or outright confirmed, thanks largely to new digital communication, collaboration and research tools.  And a unified and unchallenged mainstream media can be a threat in itself – remember that the New York Times rubber-stamped the march towards the disastrous second Iraq war. A recent congressional hearing focused on the decades-long disinformation campaign funded by the fossil fuel industry that stymied U.S. consensus on climate change – not through social media manipulation, but through credulous network news broadcasts and corrupt academic journals. With the same methods, one offhand contrarian letter to a medical journal in 1980 was transmuted by the Sackler family into an immense legalized drug racket that the media didn’t unravel until opioids had killed half a million Americans.  The new fragmented information landscape is particularly challenging for journalists because they are trained to be, above all, impartial. It is almost as paramount a value in journalism as the doctor’s pledge to “first, do no harm.” But in a world where ink is free, competing or contradictory claims on any given topic can proliferate endlessly. A simple claim that one thing is true and another is not can almost always be spun as a betrayal of neutrality by those living in the world of alternative facts.  For some journalists, the solution is to simply lay out two competing claims without litigating who’s right and who’s wrong. This is more or less the approach taken by the Journal’s piece on the Kleiman-Wright trial – and the visceral reaction highlights just how inadequate the approach can be. Critics argue that framing issues like climate change or vaccination as ongoing debates is already a kind of victory for disinformation merchants, because their often relatively miniscule and marginal constituencies are suddenly given equal weight with the much larger consensus arrayed against them. Critics have diagnosed this failure of contemporary journalism as “both-sides-ism.”  Consensus Rules  The Journal’s coverage, in addition to mischaracterizing the dispute at the heart of the Kleiman-Wright trial, commits some serious both-sides-ism with its framing of Satoshi’s identity, and Wright’s claims, as a “mystery.” Though it rightly describes “withering criticism” directed at Wright’s claims, the piece does not make clear to its non-expert audience just how universal and vociferous cryptocurrency experts and leaders have been in their dismissals.  One of the more comprehensive rebuttals is this lengthy 2019 piece by former Casa executive and privacy champion Jameson Lopp, detailing all of the ways Wright has failed to back up his claim to be Satoshi. More has emerged since then, including strong evidence that Wright does not control at least 145 of the Bitcoin addresses he claims in the Kleiman suit. Those addresses’ private keys were used in May 2020 to sign an anonymous message describing Wright as “a liar and a fraud.”  Perhaps most indicative of the attitude of the crypto community is the repeated mockery of Wright by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, one of the most magnanimous and non-confrontational people in crypto, called Wright a “fraud” to his face at a 2018 conference. Wright filed a libel lawsuit against Buterin in the U.K., in parallel with suits against podcaster Peter McCormack, “Hodlonaut,” Roger Ver and Blockstream’s Adam Back, who had all similarly dismissed Wright’s claims. Most of those suits were subsequently abandoned or dismissed, itself fairly typical of Wright’s regular use of the legal system to intimidate critics.  Resistance to Wright’s narrative ranges far and wide. Cardano founder and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson wrote in 2019 that he doesn’t believe Wright is Satoshi because he “lacks foundational knowledge, character, has a totally different communication style and Satoshi wasn’t down with the patents.” Tether has provided financial support for Peter McCormack’s defense against Wright.  Skepticism of Craig Wright, in other words, is a precious point of agreement between people who, in many cases, would quite gladly gouge each other’s eyes out given half a chance. In fact, short of the core values of transparency, privacy and censorship resistance that define blockchain technology itself, disbelieving Craig Wright may be the single largest point of agreement in the entire cryptocurrency industry.  But we in the media continue giving his claims air. Why?  Not least because it’s engaging, even deeply fascinating stuff. Even when presented responsibly as the oddity the consensus takes him for, Wright is an enthralling figure, his motives and mindset a tantalizing glimpse of the strangest depths of human nature. The problems come when we treat him as not just interesting but important, depicting his moves as part of a larger “mystery” or “controversy.” The allure can sometimes be too much, even for us here at CoinDesk: We’ve recently had to modify a few headlines and social media posts that skirted a bit too close to the Journal’s thirsty both-sides-ism.  See also: Decentralization’s Challenge to Policymakers Is Coming | Preston Byrne  Overwhelming sentiment against Wright doesn’t necessarily mean the consensus is correct, of course. It’s perfectly possible that Wright will sooner or later provide the long-delayed proof that he’s truly Satoshi. If and when that happened, there would be quite a reckoning – not least because it would likely involve Wright taking control of nearly $65 billion worth of bitcoin, a trove that he claims to own but has, for whatever reason, not so far leveraged in his fight against skeptics.  This, like many future unknowns, is perfectly possible. But should responsible journalists entertain the merely possible as a viable alternative to the truly plausible, the likely – the version of reality shared by those who have looked at it most closely? Would it be responsible for a reporter to write the sentence “it is possible that drinking gasoline cures COVID-19″ if he or she cited a gasoline-refinery blog making that claim?  There are few easy answers for those tasked with taking such self-interested claims, checking them against storms of contrary debate and turning them into a shared reality. But here’s one that shouldn’t be too hard: When one perspective is shared by the vast majority of the acknowledged authorities in a little-understood field and the other is largely supported by a single investor, they don’t need to be treated as two equal “sides” by one of the most important information sources on Earth.",NEGATIVE,BCH | BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | BSV,David Z.

42411639,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLsM,1637083800,The SEC Still Doesn’t Like Spot Bitcoin ETFs,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) put the kibosh on VanEck’s latest attempt to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  When (spot) ETF?  The narrative  Staffers at the SEC shanked yet another spot bitcoin ETF application last Friday, ending VanEck’s hopes to one-up those shiny new futures ETFs with a physically backed product.  Why it matters  Investors have long seen a spot bitcoin ETF as a milestone in crypto’s breakthrough to mainstream investing. October’s rack of futures-linked ETF launches may have already captured headline pizazz (and billions of dollars to boot) but that ultimate goal, and its promise of more efficient returns, remains elusive. The reason? SEC staffers are just as skeptical of market manipulation on spot bitcoin as ever.  Breaking it down  Was anyone surprised that the SEC denied another bitcoin ETF application?  I certainly wasn’t. When the the SEC rejected VanEck’s application last Friday, it followed a longstanding tradition of stonewalling any and every physically backed crypto ETF product. That history began in summer 2018 with the Winklevoss twins falling flat. Three plus years later and the song remains the same.  Has it, though? Not quite. For starters, other countries like Brazil have jumped ahead of the U.S. by green-lighting their own bitcoin ETFs; Canada even has an ether product. And there are any number of crypto exchange-traded products in Europe.  U.S. investors haven’t been left entirely in the dark. Last month’s bitcoin futures ETF launches capped a multi-year battle to bring bitcoin exposure to the investing masses. All it took was a crypto-savvy SEC chair spelling out exactly what kind of product could hope to make it through.  But the war is far from won. Critics of the bitcoin-linked ProShares and Valkyrie funds – by happenstance VanEck launches its own today, too – will argue the products are inefficient and expensive mechanisms through which investors gain bitcoin price exposure. Quirks of the futures market and regulatory concerns hamstring their usefulness. In short, they’ve got nothing on the real thing.  Something is better than nothing, though. Getting even an inefficient and pricey bitcoin vehicle through the SEC’s gates is a watershed for crypto. It shows the regulator slowly warming to the reality that people want bitcoin exposure. It shows a regulator accepting that it can make that reality happen and still exercise super-tight control.  Last week’s rejection shows a true blue bitcoin ETF is far, far from approval for all the same reasons – It represents a lack of control. The SEC spelled it out in the VanEck denial letter: Bitcoin markets are too prone to market manipulation to let an ETF tracking spot prices go live.  They’ve said it all before; their arguments have not changed. Like a vindictive professor flunking a student, the SEC gave VanEck’s latest spot application – which the regulator at times called repetitive, illogical and poorly sourced – a resounding F.  It’s doubtful that another hopeful issuer could soon succeed where VanEck floundered. The SEC is simply too suspicious of the bitcoin markets and their potential for manipulation to let it slide. Anyone arguing that bitcoin’s decentralization makes the token uniquely resistant to funny business (proving this quality is one way around the blockade) takes on a Sisyphusian task. Avenue 2 – establishing a “surveillance sharing agreement” – seems equally unlikely to win any time soon.  For a bitcoin ETF to win the day its issuer must establish what the SEC calls a “surveillance sharing agreement” with another major, compliance-minded market upon which the asset trades. It’s a simple argument, really. Any would-be manipulator would need to influence one market to reap gains on the other. If both those markets share data, then better the chances to catch the crook.  CME’s bitcoin futures market would seemingly fit this model. Trading over one billion dollars in bitcoin futures contracts daily, it’s a major, heavily regulated outpost for the crypto markets. But it’s a drop in the bucket of bitcoin’s global footprint. According to the SEC, it’s far too small to matter; it doesn’t lead the market. Spot ETF application DENIED.  And yet here we are mid-November 2021 with a rather odd assortment of facts. CME futures contracts are good enough to be an ETF benchmark, but not good enough for a separate product’s behind-the-scenes role.  It all makes you think: How much longer will the largely pliant crypto industry play nice?  “I wonder how long before one of the spot bitcoin ETF sponsors gets sick of arguing with a brick wall & decides to sue the SEC for an APA violation,” tweeted Jake Chervinsky, a crypto law veteran who is now head of policy for industry lobbyist The Blockchain Association.  “I get why nobody did this before, but the case is stronger now with futures ETFs live, & the incentive to play nice is much weaker.”  Biden’s Rule  It’s been a quiet week in Bidenland with no confirmation movement of note.

The miner announced on June 3 that it would go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed data management company Sphere 3D (ANY). The deal was initially slated to close in the third quarter of this year but that was pushed to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to a complicated regulatory approval process.  However, the company said in a filing on Nov. 15 that the merger is now expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.  “The exciting changes that we have undergone have pushed our timelines out to seek the regulatory and shareholder approvals required to close. However, we are actively working towards completion of the merger, and plan to provide further updates as we move towards closing the transaction,” the company said in a separate statement.  On Oct. 28, Canadian investment bank PI Financial’s analyst Kris Thompson said that he wouldn’t be surprised if the merger takes place in the first quarter of 2022 due to its complicated nature.  Under terms of the deal, Sphere said it will issue 111 million shares to Gryphon shareholders. Sphere 3D shareholders are expected to own approximately 62% of the company and Gryphon shareholders will own the remaining 38%. Gryphon CEO Rob Chang, who previously served as CFO of bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain, will be CEO of the combined company, which will take the Gryphon name.

Included in a Tuesday update, the native wallet deepens Brave’s foray into crypto self-custody after years of relegating that to third-party wallet extensions like MetaMask. CoinDesk tested a beta version of the wallet on Sunday night.  Brave Wallet allows for token purchases through Wyre, tracks portfolio performance, swaps a wide range of tokens and stores non-fungible tokens (NFT). It is self-custody, meaning wallet users hold their private keys. It supports all Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible tokens, Brave said.  Adding a native wallet is an obvious play for crypto-conscious Brave Software, Inc., which says it has 42 million monthly active users. The browser markets itself to crypto users and companies – the homepage links to four exchanges – and its signature BAT token rewards program splits a fraction of digital advertising revenue with users.

The crypto industry was concerned about a tax reporting requirement within the bill that sought to expand the definition of a broker for Internal Revenue Service purposes. The bill would require all brokers to report transactions under the current tax code.  Industry proponents worried the definition would be too broad, capturing entities such as miners and other parties that don’t actually facilitate transactions.  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and others are attempting to narrow the scope of the law’s crypto broker clause with a separate bill introduced Monday.  Another provision opposed by the crypto industry essentially requires recipients of transactions over $10,000 to verify the sender’s personal information and record his or her Social Security number, the nature of the transaction and other information, and report the transaction to the government within 15 days.

On Monday, Marathon disclosed in its 10-Q filing that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to produce documents and communications concerning its Hardin, Montana, data center facility.  The firm also said the SEC is investigating whether the company has been in violation of federal securities law.  In addition, the company said it is raising $500 million in convertible senior notes to buy bitcoin and bitcoin miners, a raise that was later upsized to $650 million.

The latest funding comes just seven months after StarkWare closed a $75 million Series B funding round led by Paradigm.  The funding will be used to support the deployment of the StarkNet platform, which allows anyone to build blockchain apps. StarkWare’s technology has until now been available only to clients through its scaling engine StarkEx.  StarkWare’s method for blockchain-based computation is used by leading platforms and applications, such as dYdX, Sorare and Immutable X, which in turn deliver its technology to firms including TikTok.  “This valuation makes us more confident than ever in our vision,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and president at StarkWare, in a statement. “By empowering blockchains to scale globally, people of any economic status will gradually be able to stop entrusting data into the hands of big companies, and control it themselves instead.”  Sequoia partner Mike Vernal added that “StarkWare is attacking one of the most important problems in crypto – the computational scalability of the blockchain.”  Read more: Sequoia Jumps Into Token Plays With Investment in DeFi Project Parallel",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/16/blockchain-firm-starkware-raises-50m-series-c-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The first crypto by market cap trades at $60,800, as of press time, with a 5% loss in the daily chart. Although it has seemed some recovery, Bitcoin registers a correction of around 12% from its all-time high as an increase in selling pressure caused the entire crypto market to take a dive. Related Reading | Bitcoin Bears Are Back, Why BTC Could Even Dive Below $60K The general sentiment in the market has flipped from extreme greed to normal greed levels, according to data from Arcane Research. Despite the correction, traders and operators remain optimistic about potential new highs. This metric could continue to fall as Bitcoin moves at the low of a range between $58,000 to around $70,000 and the market reset. The derivatives sector is likely to be the most affected. As NewsBTC reported, Bitcoin futures contracts across the board got overheated as BTC&apos;s price pushed into uncharted territory. This created a lot of liquidity at the lows and a rise in funding rates. In other words, a lot of traders took over-leveraged long positions expecting more upside, but large investors drove the price below $59,000 to take advantage of the liquidity and fill their orders.

The VanEck ETF (stock ticker XBTF), which is designed to roughly track the price of bitcoin, attracted a fraction of the trading volume witnessed when the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF went live on Oct. 19. The VanEck ETF’s shares ended the day around $59.73, with a trading volume of 44,698 shares, or about $4.8 million in dollar terms. By comparison, the ProShares ETF, with the stock ticker BITO, hit a trading volume of about $1 billion by the end of its first day.  The VanEck vehicle “did not really move the needle in attracting new investors,” Edward Moya, senior markets analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Tuesday in an email.  The new ETF is managed by VanEck’s head of active trading, Greg Krenzer, and the launch comes several weeks after the application won approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in late October.  Notably, the VanEck ETF advertises a net expense ratio of 0.65%, lower than the 0.95% charged by the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF.  The “low fee will help but not in near term,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. “I do see it being successful, but it will take some time.”  The increase in ETFs listed in the U.S. indicates a growing degree of market maturity and acceptance from regulators, even though some analysts have warned that the new vehicles might not track bitcoin’s price as well as a direct investment in the cryptocurrency.  “All this is doing is compressing downwards the bitcoin ETF in the U.S. at a much faster rate than in Europe,” said crypto ETF expert Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital.  He added that XBTF is an actively managed ETF and many investors won’t know how and when the futures contracts are purchased or sold. There’s also the risk that returns might be eroded by the need to constantly “roll” futures positions into new contracts at the monthly expiration.  “There are decent rolling cost (soon to expire) contracts to futures months which are passed on to the product and hence the investor,” Kssis said.  The VanEck fund is the third bitcoin futures ETF to start trading in the U.S., so it’s possible the frenzy for such investment vehicles may have subsided since last month’s much-hyped launches.  In October, the SEC greenlit the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (stock ticker BITO), which subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The fund quickly gathered more than $1 billion in investor assets, the fastest an ETF has ever hit that milestone.  Following ProShares’ much anticipated ETF launch, Valkyrie Investments’ bitcoin futures ETF started trading on the Nasdaq a couple weeks ago.

The bitcoin miner’s third quarter revenue was $64.8 million, compared to the consensus analyst estimate of $67.1 million. Earnings per share were a net loss of $0.16, while analysts expected a profit of $0.35.  The net loss in the quarter was “significantly impacted” by a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $36 million and a non-cash unrealized loss of $11.2 million on marketable equity securities, the company said in a statement.  Riot’s mining revenue margin, or mining revenues net of the cost of those revenues, was 76% in the third quarter versus 47% in the same period last year.  The miner said it increased bitcoin production by 482% to a record 1,292 bitcoin during the quarter, compared to 222 bitcoin during the same quarter a year ago.

42396501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT40v0,1637071237,Supply Chain Meets NFTs in New Offering From Enterprise OG MultiChain,"MultiChain, one of the first blockchain platforms to explore ways enterprises could benefit from crypto tech, is adapting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the needs of buttoned-up businesses.  London-headquartered Coin Sciences has integrated support for NFTs with the release of MultiChain 2.2, announced Tuesday, in response to customers looking to apply non-fungible properties in certain permissioned settings.  A few years have passed since the great hype around enterprise blockchain. While the application of blockchains behind company firewalls is not going to transform all IT systems worldwide, strong use cases have emerged where multiple firms want to safely share a database without putting someone in charge.  Meanwhile, NFTs, with their digital watermarking capabilities are now established, particularly within creative industries like art, design, photography and music. From a business perspective, NFTs can be used to make all kinds of assets non-fungible, so that each of their units is separately named and tracked, for example.  “Since the whole NFT thing happened, quite a few of our customers and users have said, ‘We want to do that. But we don’t want to do it in a public blockchain,’” said Coin Sciences CEO Gideon Greenspan in an interview. “So instead of tracking aggregates of items – 50,000 units of this and 10,000 units of that – you’re actually tracking individual items where there’s a large number of such items going across the supply chain, which becomes practical to do.”  Read more: The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  Coin Sciences is not the only enterprise blockchain platform to have noticed the practicalities of using NFTs. IBM and the Linux-affiliated Hyperledger blockchain Fabric have also been working on enterprise NFTs.  The MultiChain version of NFTs is not based on Ethereum standards like ERC-721 and involves no smart contract coding, Greenspan explained.  “The approach we take at MultiChain is that in order to use a blockchain, you shouldn’t have to program your blockchain,” he said. “So the functionality that we provide for assets, data storage and distribution, and now for NFTs, it’s all based on out-of-the-box functionality. You can just use these building blocks that MultiChain provides.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/16/supply-chain-meets-nfts-in-new-offering-from-enterprise-og-multichain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16360cc5259435b27bd3f1e85f71e68f3228d230-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other investors in the round included Coinbase Ventures, Tendermint Ventures, Kraken Ventures, Alameda Research, Sino Global Capital, Spartan Group and a number of angel investors.  PStake plans to use the money for talent acquisition and to carry out security audits.  Persistence is based on Cosmos, the so-called “internet of blockchains.” It offers a proof-of-stake (PoS) tech stack that works to expand decentralized finance (DeFi) markets while also attracting institutional investors to the space. Existing Persistence products include decentralized commodities exchange Comdex and staking-as-a-service solution Audit.One. PStake is Persistence’s first in-house application.  “Persistence is decently capitalized already. This was purely a strategic fundraise, which is why we tried to bring on the crème da la crème,” Persistence founder and CEO Tushar Aggarwal told CoinDesk during an interview. He noted that Three Arrows and Defiance Capital are among the largest liquidity providers to protocols, while Sequoia Capital offers the “traditional VC brand name” and bolsters its hiring efforts.  “Tushar and the team behind pStake are dedicated builders in Web 3 that are growing the utility of the Cosmos ecosystem. The Sequoia India team is excited to support them as they build out a roadmap that will bring new utility and further composability to staked assets,” said Sequoia India Managing Director Shailesh Lakhani in the press release.  How it works  Staking in this context refers to using cryptocurrency coins to take part in the consensus of a PoS chain, which provides yield but locks up those coins. PStake gives users a token to represent their staked funds, unlocking the ability to use the tokens for loan collateral or earning interest in DeFi protocols.  PStake wraps a customer’s native tokens into pTOKENS to allow PoS assets into Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) ecosystem. The pTOKENS are pegged to ERC-20, the token that’s considered the technical standard for token implementation on the Ethereum blockchain. Other ERC-20 pegged currencies include Maker and Augur.  Customers can claim staking rewards at any point in the form of pTOKENS, which can be staked again to compound the rewards, or cashed out in the equivalent amount of the native PoS tokens.  What’s next  The PStake application went live in July. Last month, Persistence partnered with BridgeTower Capital to enable institutional players to integrate PStake into their staking operations. The near-term roadmap remains ambitious.  “Asset expansion, DeFi integrations and then asset issuance on the native Cosmos chain for the Tendermint [protocol]-based assets. Those are the three work streams that we’re working on actively right now over the next three to six months,” Aggarwal told CoinDesk.

The company said the increase in revenue was mainly due to a rise in cryptocurrency prices, the increased production of bitcoin as a result of Hive’s purchase of Quebec and Atlantic facilities and the acquisition of miners for those facilities.  The gross mining margin was 86% in the fiscal second quarter, compared to 71% in the same period last year.  Second-quarter earnings per share rose 433%, to 16 cents (U.S.) versus 3 cents last year, mainly due to the improvement in gross mining margin, higher cryptocurrency prices, gains on the sale of digital currencies, and foreign exchange.  The miner said that at quarter end it held 1,116 bitcoin, worth US$48.4 million and 25,154 ether, worth $74.7 million.  Hive said it is nearing completion of its two data centers in New Brunswick, Canada.  The shares of the miner were down 4.7% in early U.S. trading as prices for bitcoin and ether tumbled more than 5% on Tuesday.  Hive is hosting a conference call at 9:30 a.m. ET.

42411631,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLVD,1637069191,A Few Unorthodox Thoughts on DeFi Regulation,"In recent months, the fast-growing pace of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market has captured the attention of regulators looking to fit this new area of crypto into existing regulatory frameworks. Attractive yields and very unique financial instruments are regularly pushing the market to new highs, making the regulatory conversation increasingly relevant.  What makes the topic of DeFi regulation so complex is the very unique nature of DeFi protocols. For decades, financial regulations have evolved around the concept of establishing trusted intermediaries to enable the key building blocks of the financial systems. DeFi challenges that core foundation by replacing those key financial primitives with programmable, autonomous smart contracts. A potential approach to tackle this challenge could be leveraging existing regulatory models while also exploring new frameworks that at least consider the uniqueness of the DeFi space.  Jesus Rodriguez is CEO of IntoTheBlock.  First principles  Without pretending to have an exhaustive list about those first principles, here are a few that are worth discussing:  Applying existing regularly models to DeFi: There is an obvious path to apply existing regulatory frameworks to DeFi protocols. Although possible, this approach might be incredibly over simplistic and harm the growth and existing innovation of the DeFi space.  Creating DeFi-first regulatory frameworks: Native DeFi regulatory models might alleviate the path to regulation without constraining technological innovation.  Quantifying value trade-offs: Imposing regulatory mechanisms in DeFi protocols can certainly hurt the space in the short term but it’s not crazy to think that it will create additional value in the long term.  Traditional approach  The vast majority of the regulated DeFi debate centers around applying frameworks such as know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) to DeFi protocols. In that setting, users interacting with lending protocols such as Compound or automated market maker (AMM) protocols like Uniswap would have to pass KYC and AML processes before they are able to trade. This seems reasonable enough but comes with obvious challenges. For starters, KYC-AML restrictions can severely harm the growth and activity in DeFi protocols, at least in the short term. Additionally, a significant percentage of the activity in DeFi protocols is done via smart contracts that adds multiple layers of indirection to any KYC-AML model.  Read more: US Floats Long-Dreaded Plan to Make Crypto Exchanges Identify Personal Wallets  Getting unorthodox  Approaching the DeFi regulation problem by imposing KYC-AML requirements on DeFi protocols is definitely viable but also quite constraining and potentially harmful to the DeFi space. The decentralized, transparent and programmable nature of DeFi provides a foundation for new types of regulatory frameworks. As a general principle, DeFi introduces groundbreaking innovations in the structure of financial primitives, so why shouldn’t we think about regulatory models that leverage those native innovations? Even though some of these ideas might result insufficient from a regulatory coverage standpoint, their underlying principles might help to provide a better bridge between DeFi and current regulatory frameworks.  A DeFi regulatory score  The activity in DeFi protocols is completely transparent at the blockchain level, so why not to use that information to assess the regulatory compliance of a specific DeFi protocol or artifact. Let’s take the example of a lending protocol like Compound. Imagine if for every Compound market we could develop a regulatory score that quantifies every wallet based on criteria such as the number and frequency of liquidations, the wallets it interacts with, the size of loans and other indicators specific to the Compound protocol. A wallet that interacts with suspicious addresses will score lower than wallets that interact with addresses with a high regulatory score.  Aggregating the scores for the individual wallets should give regulators a statistically significant understanding of the compliance viability of each Compound market. You can extrapolate this concept to other DeFi primitives such as AMMs, decentralized exchanges (DEX) and many others.  The idea of leveraging on-chain data to quantify the regulatory compliance of DeFi protocols is not only viable today but could also be a more effective and certainly a complementary mechanism than traditional KYC-AML frameworks. KYC-AML validations are a validation of past compliance, but it’s hard to refresh regularly.  For instance, suppose a given DeFi protocol imposes KYC-AML requirements. If a bad actor is able to circumvent the validation using fake information, then the actor will be able to act with certain impunity. On the other hand, systematically computing on-chain metrics relative to the bad actor wallet can eventually result in a lower regulatory score.  Continuous incentivized KYC  DeFi protocols regularly rely on incentives and governance votes to adjust the behavior of the protocol. For instance, protocols like Curve regularly assign incentives to different pools to attract liquidity. A similar concept could be applied to regulatory mechanisms like KYC-AML. Imagine that Curve or Aave decides to regularly incentivize pools or markets with a large percentage of identified wallets. It is conceivable that such a mechanism will attract more liquidity into those Curve pools while also incentivizing users to complete KYC-AML processes. Instead of enforcing the KYC-AML requirements, a regulatory framework could use native DeFi incentives to organically increase the compliance of DeFi protocols.  Read more: For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID  Trading value today for value tomorrow  There are plenty of challenges about establishing a regulatory framework for DeFi protocols but there are also some interesting opportunities. The most obvious one is the potential of enabling DeFi rails for a new set of regulated asset classes that are not active participants in the ecosystem. Stocks, commodities, bonds and real estate are some of the asset classes that could be traded in DeFi protocols with the right regulatory infrastructure. DeFi today is mostly based on crypto-to-crypto instruments but thoughtful regulation could drastically increase the value locked in DeFi protocols. In a very ambitious world, DeFi doesn’t have to be an alternative financial system but it can replace archaic financial instruments in capital markets.  Overregulating DeFi in a brute-force approach can certainly harm the level of innovation and growth in the sector. However, a thoughtful approach to regulation can unlock the potential of DeFi to all areas of the financial ecosystem. The trade-off is not trivial, but the only way to minimize the potential damage is to have thoughtful dialogs with regulatory bodies and open the door to experimentations. DeFi is novel and different and can open the door to more efficient and innovative forms of regulation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/16/a-few-unorthodox-thoughts-on-defi-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/407b50cf198a5d9897a67492cad35b977191c020-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts said a pullback was expected and has normalized the elevated funding rates or costs associated with holding long positions in the perpetual futures market.  The cryptocurrency printed lows under $59,000, bringing the 50-day moving average (MA) into play for the first time since Oct. 1.  The sell-off began in Asia following the Twitter CFO’s comments that buying crypto “wouldn’t make sense” for the company. There was continued strength in the dollar index, seemingly due to forced unwinding of long positions by exchanges.  “We have seen substantial long positions (worth $335 million) on crypto exchanges Binance and FTX,” Laurent Kssis, crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, a crypto trading advisory firm, said in a Telegram chat.  “It’s a combination of long liquidations and market makers getting rid of their risky (bullish) exposure,” Kssis added. “Leverage and delta hedging becomes more expensive as more orders flood the market.”  The average funding rate across major exchanges hovered around 0.05% last week, having hit a six-month high of 0.0589% earlier this month, according to the data source bybt.  Funding rates are calculated and collected by exchanges every eight hours. Costs associated with leverage typically become a burden when the momentum stalls, forcing traders to liquidate.  Bitcoin’s move to record highs near $69,000 last Wednesday was quickly undone with a pullback to $63,000 on Friday. The cryptocurrency saw a meager bounce over the weekend before turning lower on Monday.  “The market was quite complacent and probably overleveraged, as evidenced from last week’s high funding rates,” Amber Funds said.

42396502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT40wy,1637049033,"Bitcoin, Ether Lose Ground as Twitter CFO Rules Out Crypto Investment, Dollar Index Hits 16-Month High","Bitcoin, ether and other major coins face selling pressure as anti-crypto comments from Twitter’s chief financial officer soured the market mood. The continued strength in the dollar index likely added to bearish forces.  Bitcoin was trading 4.3% lower on the day near $60,800, while ether was nursing a 5.3% loss at $4,320 at press time, according to CoinDesk data. Litecoin, Binance coin, Polkadot’s DOT token and prominent decentralized finance coins flashed bigger losses.  The selling began during early Asia hours after Wall Street Journal quoted social media giant Twitter’s CFO Ned Segal saying that investing cash holdings into crypto assets like bitcoin “doesn’t make sense” right now.  Segal cited price volatility and the lack of accounting rules for these assets as critical factors stopping the company from diversifying into cryptocurrencies.  While there was never any expectation of Twitter announcing crypto investments, Segal’s comments likely provided a reason for traders to take some risk off the table in the wake of the rising dollar and controversial crypto tax reporting requirement introduced by the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by the U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday.  The infrastructure bill requires brokers to provide the Internal Revenue Service with information about traders transacting an amount of over $10,000. The crypto industry is worried that the definition of the word “broker” may be open-ended, bringing miners and node operators under the tax hammer and create tax reporting challenges for investors.  Few companies including Square, Tesla and MicroStrategy have acquired bitcoin as a reserve asset, and widespread corporate adoption remains elusive to date. On Monday, analysts told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s relatively high price volatility is delaying its transition to haven asset from a risk-on or speculative investment.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, reached a fresh 16-month high of 95.50 early today on lingering fears that Federal Reserve may resort to early interest rate hikes to contain inflation. Interest rate hikes are generally bullish for domestic currencies and weigh over perceived inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold. Like gold, bitcoin is also priced in U.S. dollars. So a rising dollar is considered bearish for the cryptocurrency.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission said on Tuesday that it would consider “punitive electricity prices” for some crypto mines in the next stage of its crypto mining crackdown. China stepped up its crackdown on mining in May and declared bitcoin, ether and tether as illegal in the third quarter.  Analysts said bitcoin could suffer a deeper drawdown in the short term.  “We have noticed some larger sales occur on [cryptocurrency exchange] Bitfinex as well as openings of new short positions,” said Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds. While liquidations [forced closure of long positions] so far are quite low by historical standard and funding rates are approaching flat, we could see a further cool-off in BTC for the short term as momentum is beginning to stall.”  Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar Trading Capital, said the downward move represents a healthy correction and could extended further to $60,000 or possibly to $55,000.  “We have been seeing bearish flows in the options market from late last week,” Cheung told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “Put-call skews have flipped bearish.”  Put-call skews measure the cost of put options or bearish bets relative to calls or bullish bets. Positive values indicate increased demand for puts or downside protection.  The one-month put-call skew has risen to a four-week high of 5% from -2% on Monday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The one-week gauge has increased from 1% to 6%.  A deeper drawdown may be seen later on Tuesday if the U.S. retail sales number beats estimates and Federal Reserve officials start to sound the alarm over inflation, bolstering rate hike fears and adding to the dollar’s strength.  According to FXStreet, retail sales data, scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET), are likely to show consumer spending in the world’s largest economy rose 0.7% month-on-month in October.  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, and San Francisco President Mary Daly are scheduled to speak during U.S. hours.  China’s President Xi and U.S. President Biden met on Monday evening at a virtual summit. As markets still await readouts from the meeting, the initial reports appear to be positive.  Also on Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia’s Governor Philip Lowe reiterated that the latest data and forecasts do not warrant an increase in the interest rate in 2022.

NFTs are now seen as a building block of the emerging Metaverse, but, behind the NFTs boom, and the media hype around it, there is still a big challenge that needs to be addressed for NFTs to become the driving factor of Web 3.0. The challenge is the fact that, unlike in the early days, when there was only one big platform (Openseas), today the NFT ecosystem is very fragmented with a constant proliferation of new platforms. To add complexity to the equation, NFTs have gone from just being on the Ethereum platform, to encompass Solana, Tezos, and a dozen more cryptocurrencies. This creates massive confusion and problems because, for the average fan and collector, the options can be mind-boggling. Further complicating the situation for collectors and fans alike, every day there is a large number of drops or NFT releases, and numbers are growing. In early 2021, it could be one or two a day. Today it can be 50 or more daily, spread across multiple cryptocurrency platforms. Each drop has a different minting process and can be tied to a different exchange.

With assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum hitting new all-time highs, and other cryptos following in their wake, it seems like a matter of time before mass adoption is imminent. However, the industry needs some technological improvements before it can be broadly accepted by the rest of the world. Namely, it needs cross-chain capabilities. The Cross-Chain Problem With so many crypto projects launching on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, and other decentralized networks, users will want to experiment and interact across the different chains. However, cross-chain activity in the current industry is quite cumbersome, expensive, and technologically challenging. As of now, swapping an asset from one chain to another is costly, time-consuming, and a bit of an overwhelming process for those new to crypto. If the crypto industry plans to support the mass adoption it so very much needs, it must solve interoperability.
