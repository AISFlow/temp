42427002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyafh,1471710693,On Tokens and Crowdsales: How Startups Are Using Blockchain to Raise Capital,"Companies we've never heard of are launching IPOs before our very eyes.  But instead of ringing the IPO bell after years of operations, they are going public on day one, and instead of raising money by selling their company stock, they are building distributed networks and selling their own tokens.  This new way of building companies is what Fred Ehrsam , founder of Coinbase , described as the ""decentralized business model"".  Yet, many of the established rules about building and investing in businesses don't apply to this new model. What can we learn from the companies going down this road?  Tokens  The mechanics of a token crowdsale are directly related to the kind of token issued.  We identified three types of tokens:  Debt Tokens  Equity Tokens  User Tokens.  User tokens  User tokens , or 'appcoins' as Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan have called them, are a form of digital currency needed to access the service provided by the distributed network.  As Union Square Venture managing partner Albert Wenger explains, you can think of these as tokens you buy at a fair to get on a ride.  In ethereum, for example, you need ether to build distributed apps on the platform. In the case of Sia, a distributed storage system, you need to own Siacoins to store files in the network.  User tokens are earned by providing value to these networks.  Contributions can take the form of mining, as in bitcoin, ethereum and Sia, or publishing stories, as in Steemit. Since user tokens are on a blockchain, they can be easily redeemed for any local or cryptocurrency.  Equity tokens  Equity tokens are used to finance the development of the network, but are not needed to access the services provided by the underlying protocol. As its name suggests, we can see 'equity tokens' as cryptographic shares of a network.  In exchange for investment, equity token holders are entitled to ""dividends"" in the form of revenue sharing or transaction fees in the network. For example, in the case of Sia, 3.9% of all successful storage payouts go to the holders of Siafunds, their equity token.  In many cases, these equity tokens represent shares of a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO's code is responsible for issuing the tokens, holding the money collected from the token sale, and contracting a company to develop the network.  Besides receiving a pro-rated reward, equity token holders in the form of DAO shares are usually entitled to pledge on proposals for how the investment money will be used.  That's the case of Digix, an asset-tokenisation platform built on ethereum. DGD token holders:  Receive a reward on the transaction fees of the Digix Gold Network  Are able to submit and vote proposals on the DigixDAO.  Debt Tokens  A third type of token is the 'debt token'.  We can see these as a 'short term loan' to the network, in exchange for an interest rate on the amount lent. Steemit is one of the few networks with debt tokens, issued in the form of Steem Dollars.  Steem, the cryptocurrency mined by the network, can be used to buy Steem Power or Steem Dollars. Holders of Steem Dollars receive a ~10% interest rate, paid in Steem Dollars.  Steem Dollars are unique to the economics of the Steemit protocol.  Through buying Steem Dollars, people can invest in the network with sufficient liquidity, without committing to the two-year vesting period to which Steem Power holders are subjected.  We see networks with multiple combinations.  These include networks with:  Both user and equity tokens (Sia, Digix)  Only user tokens (bitcoin, ethereum)  Only equity tokens (Golem, SingularDTV)  User, equity and debt tokens (Steemit).  The combination depends on the unique dynamics and economics of the network.  Crowdsales  The type of token typically dictates the mechanics of its crowdsale.  Pre-sale of User Tokens    To sell user tokens, companies tend to:  Publish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development.  Publicly announce the token and release the source code prior to creating the first token.  Deploy the network and secure user tokens via mining. Alternatively, allocate a portion of the pre-sale tokens to the founding team as a reward for ideating and developing the network.  Advertise the network and sell user tokens to anyone, anywhere.  Work to grow the number of people using, building apps on top and maintaining the network.  As the network grows, demand for the token increases, leading to a rise in the user token price. This is what we call the 'Nakamoto business model'. Satoshi got its reward not by pre-mining bitcoins, but by being the first believer and supporter of the network.  Steemit followed the Nakamoto business model as well. The company wrote the code to power the Steemit distributed network, announced it to the public and secured ~80% of the initial STEEM via mining. The project plans to keep 20%, sell 20% to raise money and give away 40% to attract users/referrers.  Ethereum’s case is a bit different. Its pre-sale consisted of distributing private keys to buyers as a software access token to use the future network. Ethereum raised over $18m worth of bitcoin in the form of 60m ETH tokens created, where 12m ETH (20%) were retained by the development team.  When ethereum launched, buyers received their ether as the first blocks were mined.  Crowdsale of equity tokens  For equity tokens, companies tend to:  Publish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development.  Write a smart contract for a DAO, with a pre-defined number of equity tokens allocated to the company founders.  Make the company the provider of the DAO, in charge of developing the network in exchange for a payment.  Advertise the DAO crowdsale and sell equity tokens to anyone, anywhere. Use that money to pay the company for their development work.  Work to make the network grow to increase the value of the equity token, and collect rewards based on the increased network usage.  Digix reached its $5.5m total within 12 hours by following these steps.  Since DigixGlobal is the company that ideated the network, published the white paper, wrote the DAO smart contract in ethereum and holds a substantial amount of equity tokens, they became the default service provider of the DigixDAO.  Regulation on token crowdsales  The laws that govern the issuance and sale of cryptographic tokens depend on the jurisdiction in which these events take place.  There are countries like Singapore and Switzerland where virtual currencies are not considered securities nor legal tender.  In the US, the Howey test is used to evaluate the sale of securities.  Under the Howey test, an instrument is a security if it A) involves an investment of money or other tangible or definable consideration used in B) a common enterprise with C) a reasonable expectation of profits to be D) derived primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  The public sale of securities to US citizens is overseen by the SEC, rendering it illegal to perform such an act without its permission.  Industry thought leaders, like non-profit advocacy group Coin Center and Harvard Berkman's Primavera de Filippi, suggest the issuance of user and equity tokens may constitute the sale of securities under the Howey test. But in reality, the power of these tokens goes beyond our understanding of traditional securities.  We also know the SEC is working on ways to rule blockchains as transfer agents. The actual impact of this regulation on the issuance of tokens is still unknown.  Connecting tokens to the legacy world  We see four different approaches used to carry out a legal and compliant token crowdsale.  The Swiss-based GmbH and Foundation    The ether pre-sale was conducted by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, whose sole purpose is managing the funds raised from the ether sale in order to best serve the ethereum ecosystem.  To enable US citizens to purchase Ether without being ruled by the SEC, they framed the pre-sale of user tokens as the sale of cryptographic fuel – ether (""ETH"") – required to run distributed applications on the Ethereum open source platform.  The initial development of the software was carried out by Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, a Swiss-based LLC.  The Singapore company and DAO    In the case of Digix, the smart contract for the DigixDAO was written by DigixGlobal, a Singapore-based company. This company is then hired by the DigixDAO and gets paid for developing the Digix network. Equity tokens sold represent shares of the DigixDAO.  While the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not consider tokens as securities, the legal sale to US citizens depends on the SEC's interpretation of the tokens under the Howey test.  The 'CODE'    A third experimental approach used by Singular-DTV – a blockchain entertainment studio – is the ""centrally organized distributed entity"".  The ‘CODE’ is a combination of a centrally organized (CO) governance component in the form of a Swiss GmbH – LLC – and a decentralized entity (DE) component in the form of a tokenized ecosystem built on ethereum.  In this case, the GmbH is responsible for spending the ether collected in the Decentralized Entity token sale to build media projects and collect the revenue generated. The ‘CODE’ is supposed to be regulatory and tax compliant, protecting the token holders from potential liability.  The independent company  The last approach is to keep the network and issuance of tokens independent from its creator.  Tokens are allocated via a computer algorithm that does not specify any specific public keys to receive funds. Following the Nakamoto business model, the network creator secures its share of tokens by being the first miner in the public network. Steemit did this as a Delaware C Corp.  The formation of these entities are some of the first approaches tried to legally connect the new model for building companies to the legacy world.  As more companies, lawyers and regulators enter the space, we’ll see how they develop.  Overall, we see 40-plus companies applying the token-based model to finance protocol development. We believe it could be extended to other types of companies as well.

42427016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyb1h,1471700203,Why Big Bank Blockchain Leads Are Leaving for Startups,"Recent months have seen blockchain innovation professionals departing legacy financial institutions for smaller startups, but the motivations driving this shift in the industry are less than clear.  To date, it’s been one of the less-discussed trends of 2016, given the lack of public dialogue from the major firms affected and the relative quiet of the new startup founders, many of whom are seeking to do business with their former employers.  So far in 2016, BNP Paribas, Deloitte, JPMorgan and State Street have all seen members of their blockchain teams depart. This has given rise to a new wave of lesser-known startups including firms like DPactum, Kadena and Nuco. Still others, like the founder and head of Philips Blockchain Lab, have left without specifying why.  In interviews, representatives of these startups say the departures are more about bringing their enterprise blockchain insights to a wider group of industries. Rather than the result of any cutbacks in spending at major backs, this new generation of founders believes it will be easier to raise more capital, more quickly, outside the firm.  For Stuart Popejoy, who left JPMorgan’s blockchain project in July to found financial services-focused private blockchain startup Kadena, it’s about opportunity and demand.  Popejoy told CoinDesk:  ""Our work at JPMorgan established that a scalable blockchain was possible, but somebody still had to push it out to the industry. After all, blockchains are inherently inter-organizational, whereas JPMorgan’s priorities will be to solve problems in the bank.""  But, Popejoy didn’t go alone, as his fellow JPMorgan colleague, developer Will Martino, also made the move to Kadena. The two ex-bank execs want to bring the technology to the broader market, and in their eyes, it’s still early enough to make headway.  Even the high-profile enterprise blockchain groups are having trouble answering basic technical questions – scalability, transaction privacy and the safety of smart contracts – about how blockchain can be implemented, he said.  “When we were at the bank, we simply couldn't find a vendor solution that could provide the necessary performance our use cases demanded without sacrificing the robustness and simplicity of a true blockchain, which is why we ‘rolled our own',” Popejoy said.  Natural progression  Other former finance executives are departing for existing startups.  Jeremy Drane, for example, was previously head of blockchain at ‘Big Four’ accounting firm PwC before joining blockchain startup Libra as its CCO. Drane said he sees the recent run of departures as the natural progression of tech moving from experimentation to pilot phase.  “What you’re seeing is the first round of projects moving ... off the innovation budgets into enterprise evaluation cycles where the processes are more rigid,” Drane said. “There’s a totally different set of rules around how those projects are managed and what flexibility you have.”  This maturation is another possible reason that members of blockchain teams at legacy institutions are moving on, but industry analysts also spoke to its “sex appeal”.  For professionals that are geared towards innovation, moving into production is less appealing. Instead, they’ll take what they learned and build startups that bring the tech to more industries.  “There are probably push-and-pull factors for joining startups. The potential upside is larger in the entrepreneurial space than in managing a team in a large organization,” said Antony Lewis, an independent blockchain consultant.  While there seems to be enough blockchain startups to go around, most of these companies operate in the financial services space. Legacy companies in other industries will need help adopting the technology for their business models. Consumer product companies, entertainment and media businesses, as well as humanitarian and international aid projects, are a few of the industries currently showing interest in blockchain.  Chris Larsen, founder and CEO of Ripple, said this movement signals that blockchain optimism is still on the rise for both banks and startups.  “If anything, I’d say it’s an indication that thing are getting stronger and that [the professionals] see things booming and want to put themselves where the action is,” Larsen said.  Uncertainty Remains  Others have demonstrated more skepticism.  Gideon Greenspan, founder and CEO of blockchain tech specialist Coin Sciences, sees the market for private blockchain solutions contracting. For example, he said that concerns about confidentiality have shaken the faith in use cases such as clearing and settlement that had previously been earmarked for R&D budgets.  “Much of banks' early investments in blockchains were based on this expected use case, rather than more general ideas of shared data storage (for which blockchains are well suited). In that case it would make sense for them cut back on spending in the area,” he said.  However, Greenspan indicated that he hasn’t seen a slowdown in the use of Coin Science’s Multichain platform for big bank pilot programs. So far, he said, Multichain has been used to create a crowdfunding platform, a regulator overview and a shared documentation notarization service.  One reason banks may be pulling back on external equity investment and partnerships with startups could be the overabundance of blockchain startups in the market.  “Banks could be waiting to see which platforms become dominant before developing a project on any particular platform,” Greenspan said.  Many banks, analysts said, simply don’t have the manpower to filter through and vet all these various startups.  For now, it seems the industry will remain stuck in the awkward positioning of its hype cycle. While many are heralding 2017 as the “Year of the Blockchain”, it’s likely that this claim will be valid for years to come.  Libra’s Drane concluded:  “I can understand the skepticism, but these systems take a long time to build.”  Evolution image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Bailey Reutzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/08/20/why-big-bank-blockchain-leads-are-leaving-for-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60b5d565ed147ea13a750194b36563fe4b53965f-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
