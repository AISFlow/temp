I believe that that isn't the only thing - since Bitcoin isn't backed by anything tangible, the likelihood is that there isn't really a bottom. With a lot of people placing a disproportionately large portion of their holdings in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies - this can turn ugly real fast. That's why I'm selling the rest of my Bitcoin and have turned very bearish on the market and 'alternative currency system'. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, as well as cryptocurrencies in general, have seen negative news coverage at an increasing rate over the past couple of months. The cryptocurrency market made people millions and billions in value after it rose from a near penny-stock level to over $50,000 per Bitcoin at its peak a few quarters back. Since then, although some tout it as a more secured way of financial transacting, an increasing number of hacks and fraud allegations have been taking place and shining bright in the news all around the world. The problem with this, I believe, is twofold: The first is that while those who use Bitcoin, estimated at around 106 million people , mostly ( 60% ) trust the system, they only represent less than 2% of the global population. Only 17% of Bitcoin users trust the world governments, showing that although it may be touted by some as a good alternate to global currencies and that more and more businesses are allowing you to use Bitcoin and pay in real time, it's still not being adapted by a significant population. Active Bitcoin Accounts (Chainalysis) This means that there still is an issue with the hypothetical way forward for Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general, which is wide scale adaptability and usage, which may be the only way to make it stable enough to be considered anything near a usable long term global currency. This means, I believe, that we're going to continue to see volatility in the cryptocurrency system for years to come, which will further deter new participants in the system. The second is that, on top of not having a growing user base, even current users don't wholeheartedly support the system of alternative currency, leading it to become more of a commodity without any backing in peoples' portfolios. This means that, I believe, it will be one of the first things to be sold if and when we head into any form of a recession, which I believe we will do soon. With the mass (relative) layoffs in the technology sectors, which are where a sizable portion of the Bitcoin holders are from, people who have invested and potentially made a good bit of money are going to think about and eventually sell portions of these investments to fund their lives while they job search. These two factors mean that, I believe, there isn't as much of bottom to the cryptocurrency market where people will be buying, and that there is a ceiling in a years long span where we would expect a recession or slowdown. But that's not all. The Other Short-Term Problem There's also a third group of Bitcoin (and other NFT-style unit) holders - young people. This phenomenon has certainly paid off big time for some, but for the most part it hasn't resulted in any significant change to these peoples' lives. But due to the fact that a good portion of these young folks who put whatever money they have into these cryptocurrencies and NFTs because of influencers peddling these various ""investments"" - they don't necessarily have an alternative to these if they need money. Cryptocurrency Trading (Pew Research Center) For those who have some cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in their portfolio, which can constitute from 1% to 50% of their holdings, they usually have steady job and other savings and cash flow to mitigate any serious inflows. But if Bitcoin and various non fungible tokens crater more than they already have - they're likely to sell in a panic due to their downside tolerance being much lower. What A Crash May Mean If, as I believe, Bitcoin and most cryptocurrency markets have a ceiling and that the sell-off we've seen over the past few months will spook a lot of retail investors who have large amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - we're likely only at the beginning of this downturn. The issue here is, given that the system of Bitcoin isn't backed by anything but faith of one person buying from the other - the bottom here is most likely a lot lower than if we enter a bear market in the 'regular' stock market. There are going to be holdouts in the cryptocurrency system, especially those who have Bitcoin as only a small part of their overall financial holdings, which may mean that it'll take more time for them to hear about the news as it gets worse before they sell. This means that not only do I believe we are in for a shock to the system soon but also that the risk here is much greater than the 'regular' stock market given that, in theory, there is no bottom compared to a company like, say, Apple ( AAPL ), which still will take in a certain amount of revenues and make a certain amount of cash and have real value on the books, even in a deep recession. So Now What? While shorting something like Bitcoin is absolutely insane, even if there was an easy way of doing that, the price, as it has done before, can spike by hundreds of percentage points in a matter of a few days or over a weekend, leaving any short position deep, deep in the red. But as someone who has had Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a tiny part of their overall portfolio: I think it's time to take it down even further and avoid it for now. That's because it can become a slippery slope / snowball. What I mean by that is that there are several million people out there with a significant portion of their money in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and other NFT-style things, which if the price of those assets eventually goes down by 50% to 90% will see their net worth of the value of their holdings fall. This can, I believe, cause an actual spending crunch if the value of said portfolios fall. So this can become a snowball effect where people sell some of their Bitcoin after losing 50%, which causes the price to fall further, which then prompts them to sell the rest, or all, at a loss which will then cause them financial hardship and their spending will go down. Which will then hurt the economy and cause even more people to look at selling their non tangible assets etc. Given these factors, I have turned very bearish on Bitcoin and the prospect of cryptocurrencies and NFTs in general and will be avoiding Bitcoin for a while.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560266-bitcoin-panic-may-just-be-getting-started?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4700878.jpeg

So far we have seen the price of Bitcoin dropping into the low $15K region. In this article we will examine why these price regions have technical importance and if the $10K target is reached, will that be a bottom. What if I was to tell you an unregulated industry was met with a high volume of inexperienced ""investors""? Doesn't sound like the dream matchup does it? I documented stories in previous articles a number of months ago about meeting people from all walks of life who had mentioned they had got into crypto but in reality, I have no facts of how things ended for them so I can only hope well, but generally, in these situations, history has told us that is not the case. On the other hand, when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was circling around the $17-$23K region for a long period of time, I did say it was going lower. This also may not have been the case as I do not own a crystal ball but I do know my technicals. And the region it had potentially bottomed off technically didn't add up. In bearish cases, it can be slightly more complex to exactly decipher the outcome of a wave pattern as they can at times, work differently to bullish wave patterns. Buy low sell high comes to mind and therein lies one reason, a financial product can be bought up at any stage if the buyer with enough buying power and insight or courage can essentially turn a market around where others follow. Bullish waves have generally been bought low and without coining a phrase like ""Let the winners run"", there is some truth to the aforementioned cheesy line. As prices are going up investors want to stay for the long term and traders may see no need to sell in a calm market so bullish waves have generally more of a chance of completing than their bearish counterparts. In Bitcoin's case, I was technically forced to make a call as where it had appeared to be ""bottoming"" just didn't make technical sense. A bearish wave will normally at least see the Fibonacci 161 after breaking through support and in Bitcoin's case that level is 10k. Bit firstly, let's look at the current monthly chart. My previous Bitcoin article was published at circa the price region $19K. So large was the bearish wave one that if wave three completes a numerical copy of it, Bitcoin will end up at zero. The first level we can see is the Fibonacci 150 at $14.9K which isn't a popular Fibonacci level, given the scale of the wave one, the 150 level came within heightened probability of being hit before the 161 level at $10K. So far Bitcoin has come near and dropped into the low $15K region. Bitcoin Monthly (C Trader ) We can see the wave one $69K - $32K with the wave two topping out near the $50K region before breaking support at $32K. So what's next and is the just the start of a steep demise for this digital currency? Possibly is the answer. In the chart below we can see that if Bitcoin does numerically replicate its wave one it will drop to zero. Bitcoin Monthly (C Trader ) To summarize, I would expect Bitcoin to drop to the $10K region within the next 30-120 days. If there are signs of a macro turnaround by way of a three wave bullish pattern on the monthly chart that develops it may signal a bottoming. Without that three wave pattern being formed the probability that the wave may look to complete by heading to zero will be heightened. About the Three Wave Theory The three wave theory was designed to be able to identify exact probable price action of a financial instrument. A financial market cannot navigate its way significantly higher or lower without making waves. Waves are essentially a mismatch between buyers and sellers and print a picture of a probable direction and target for a financial instrument. When waves one and two have been formed, it is the point of higher high/lower low that gives the technical indication of the future direction. A wave one will continue from a low to a high point before it finds significant enough rejection to then form the wave two. When a third wave breaks into a higher high/lower low the only probable numerical target bearing available on a financial chart is the equivalent of the wave one low to high point. It is highly probable that the wave three will look to numerically replicate wave one before it makes its future directional decision. It may continue past its third wave target but it is only the wave one evidence that a price was able to continue before rejection that is available to look to as a probable target for a third wave.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560257-this-just-start-for-bitcoin-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4699142.jpeg

Gox hack burst into life Wednesday with its largest transaction since August 2017, sending a total of 10,000 bitcoin, worth around $165 million, to two unidentified recipients, according to CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  As part of the transaction, which occurred around 08:38 UTC, a wallet that received 3,500 bitcoin forwarded 300 BTC to another destination. That was split further and landed in several wallets not attributed to any known custodial service.  The distribution pattern is open to interpretation: It's possible the wallet owner simply sent the money to other wallets of their own, sent it to other people or cashed out through an unofficial over-the-counter broker. The remaining 6,500 stayed put.  Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, was robbed of 744,408 BTC and shut permanently in 2014. Alexander Vinnik, alleged to be the operator of BTC-e – which he denies – was arrested in 2017 at a resort near Thessaloniki, Greece, at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice on money laundering and other allegations.  The wallet involved in Wednesday's transaction was attributed to BTC-e by blockchain analytics system Crystal Blockchain. The transfer was noticed by Russian crypto entrepreneur Sergey Mendeleev, who published the observation in his Telegram channel.  The discovery comes as the crypto industry suffers through its latest debacle, the collapse of FTX and fallout that has affected multiple companies touching the crypto exchange and its affiliated companies.  Other News  Bitcoin (BTC) jumped about 2% after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed that the majority of central bankers prefer a slower pace of rate hikes going forward. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading as high as $16,671 but had settled back to $16,400 as of press time.  “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated. “The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.”  Some altcoins notched similar gains: Ether (ETH) followed BTC, and was up roughly 3.9% to $1,170.Solana’s SOL token jumped 20%, while Binance's in-house BNB token was up 12%.  Equity markets turned green ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday: U.S. stocks edged up following the Fed minutes release, with the Standard and Poor's 500 Index up 0.5% at closing.

LTC's bullish turn comes eight months ahead of Litecoin's third mining reward halving, which will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%.  Anxious Ethereum stakers are now questioning when they will be able to access the funds. Ethereum core developers generally agree that the aim was always for staked ether (ETH) withdrawals to be opened up as part of “Shanghai,” the next upgrade on its development road map.

SEC: Lawyer Explains Why Nov 30 Is Crucial And Why A Settlement Is Possible Cosmos (ATOM) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart Most crypto traders and investors have had a rough few days, with many concerned about where the market is headed after so much turbulence in the crypto space. Many altcoins have struggled to show strength, losing key support in a bid to survive. The current market uncertainty has caused traders and investors to be hesitant to purchase altcoins, as there is no guarantee that they will rise in value any time soon. The price of ATOM on the weekly chart has struggled despite the market uncertainty that has affected major crypto projects that have continued to build in this bear market, and more FUD (fear of uncertainty and doubt) persists. ATOM saw its price traded in a region of $17 on the weekly chart, but the price was rejected as ATOM’s price declined to a region of $8.5, bouncing off this region to trade at $9.5 with a small relief from the market. Weekly resistance for the price of ATOM – $10. Weekly support for the price of ATOM – $8.5. Price Analysis Of ATOM On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ATOM remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $8.5 support after the price was rejected from a high of $17. ATOM’s price trades at $9.8 below its 50 and 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of ATOM. The price of $11.5 and $13.8 corresponds to the prices at these levels, acting as resistance. If the price of ATOM breaks and holds above $11.5, we could see more rallies for the ATOM price to a region of $13; a break below a region of $8.5 would send the price back to a region of $5. Daily resistance for the ATOM price – $11.5. Daily support for the ATOM price – $8.5-$6.

42394098,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWjr,1669238299,Mansplaining Your Way Through the Crypto Crash at Thanksgiving,"Crypto investors are set to eat a lot of humble pie at this year’s Thanksgiving table. This time last year, as bitcoin and ether were setting new all-time highs, you probably looked like a genius for being able to explain what a “decentralized autonomous organization” or non-fungible token is. Well, times have changed.  The crypto economy has collapsed but you could still come out looking smart this holiday. And what better way to ease tense conversations than by explaining your way through them. This is CoinDesk’s definitive guide to explaining what broke in crypto this year and why it was in no way your fault. No way, no how!  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, the economic context! Crypto is a risk asset that benefited greatly after governments turned on the money spigots to keep their economies floating amid the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. This was after about a decade of “cheap money,” where the U.S. Federal Reserve deliberately kept interest rates low to encourage people to spend and invest rather than save.  Investors – from thrill-seeking venture capitalists to pension funds – were indirectly encouraged to seek out ever-riskier bets. And there sat crypto, looking pretty on the far end of the risk curve, ready to soak up excess liquidity. Well, once inflation started to rear its ugly head, and Jerome Powell decided to cool a “temporarily” hot economy, of course crypto would take a hit.  Who could’ve predicted that? Certainly not anyone who thought a 20% savings rate on Terra's Anchor protocol looked SAFU.  Celebrities and FOMO  OK, so maybe you did say last year that the upcoming Ethereum Merge would be a great buying opportunity. But are you any more responsible for getting your family and friends to invest than someone like Tom Brady? This fella, an American Treasure, staked his entire reputation on FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange.  Crypto hype cycles tend to be self-reinforcing – as soon as the number goes up, there’s a natural tendency for it to keep going as more and more people remember that they opened a Coinbase account in 2017. (This is Bitcoin’s patented “number go up” technology, which works until it doesn’t.)  See also: NFL Legend Tom Brady Caught in FTX Fallout  Many people, however, won’t be convinced to buy crypto by rising prices alone. Instead, they need a little encouragement. Enter the “celebrity influencer.” Crypto didn’t invent the idea of selling products to fans, or the odd psychological trait where people form parasocial relationships and begin trusting people they don’t even know. But it is a natural fit.  Kim Kardashian boosted “ethereumMax.” Larry David made FTX seem lovable even to curmudgeons. Matt Damon told us investing in crypto was an act of courage. Should anyone have taken investment advice from these people? Well, they had to get rich and/or beautiful (maybe not Larry) somehow …  Real crypto has never been tried  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and the hedge fund Alameda Research, built a celebrity reputation of his own. The supposedly ethical billionaire, who donated to and founded nonprofits and ate vegan, spent as much money on charity as on advertisements. Just as people trust people like Tom Brady, we learned to believe in Sam.  But even if the vision Bankman-Fried was selling wasn’t a scam, it still wasn’t “crypto,” you could say. As many have pointed out since the collapse of the once $32 billion dollar crypto exchange, the type of mismanagement of customer funds that happened at FTX could have only happened on a custodial platform.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  DeFi, or decentralized finance, never takes ownership of users’ funds, and so cannot abuse them. Further, throughout the bear market, many DeFi platforms have functioned exactly as they should have by following prewritten rules set in code – liquidating anyone that should have been liquidated.

ApeCoin, the Ethereum-based governance and utility token used within the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)-linked APE ecosystem, launched in March.  Built by non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructure company Snag Solutions, the new community marketplace lists for-sale NFTs from Yuga Labs-owned NFT collections like BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) and Otherdeed for Otherside.  Zach Heerwagen, CEO of Snag Solutions, said the platform offers “unique features built specifically for the BAYC and Otherside communities, including ApeCoin staking and NFT metadata integrations.”  The platform also offers a reduced-fee structure for sellers – .5% fees on ETH transactions and .25% fees on ApeCoin transactions – and holds .25% of each sale in a multi-signature wallet to fund future decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) initiatives, creating a benefit loop for ApeCoin holders.  “Snag exists to support creators by unbundling marketplaces, and we're excited to partner with the ApeCoin community to replace the status quo with a product that respects royalties while heavily reducing fees,” Heerwagen tweeted.  Its unique fee structure comes at a time when NFT marketplaces such as Magic Eden and LooksRare have dropped mandatory creator royalties, which put pressure on competitors like OpenSea and X2Y2.  Yuga Labs declined to comment. The ApeCoin marketplace is not directly affiliated with Yuga Labs, according to The Block, though Heerwagen told the outlet that “lines of communication were open with Yuga.”  Snag Solutions, which launched in July, previously created a white-label NFT marketplace for Goblintown creator Truth Labs.

42420866,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVt7,1669236388,Crypto Market Analysis:  Commitment of Traders Report Shows Asset Managers Trimming Long Positions,"The Commitment of Traders report shows asset managers reduced their open long positions by 559 contracts last week. This marks the second consecutive week of declines, as long positions decreased by 132 in the prior report.  Asset managers now account for 31% of open long positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), down from 43.4% a week prior. The reduction simply means that asset managers now account for a smaller percentage of bullish investors on the CME for the moment. The Commitment of Traders report is a weekly snapshot of open positions on the CME.  Leveraged funds, by contrast, increased their long positions by 1,367 contracts following a previous 1,694 contract increase. Leveraged funds now account for 30% of the open interest for long positions on the CME, and 51% of the open interest in short positions.  Fewer open long positions by asset managers generally means reduced exposure to BTC prices. Amid the recent downturn, bitcoin's price is down 20% for November, and appear to be building a base of resistance around $16,500.  For leveraged funds, increased long positions could be a byproduct of funds buying futures contracts which currently trade at a discount to spot prices. This condition, referred to as backwardation is generally a bearish sign for markets.  Current bearishness will continue to pressure BTC markets in what has been a prolonged crypto winter. At current prices, just 45% of BTC supply is in profit, down from 70% in the beginning of 2022.  Bitcoin's percent supply in profit has been lower in the past however, falling to 43% in March 2020, and as low as 39% in 2015. Historically, declines in percent supply in profit have marked short-term price bottoms for bitcoin.  Another note of concern is the reduction in net positions for miners, which coincides with an increased hashrate and an uptick in BTC being sent to exchanges.  As hashrate increases, the prospects for miners to generate a profit become more challenging. As that occurs, they often must sell their BTC holdings. Accelerated selling is likely to pressure bitcoin prices downward.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/23/crypto-market-analysis-commitment-of-traders-report-shows-asset-managers-trimming-long-positions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f638ccd8496bc332856d1d2910b827075e063c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The controversial individual was behind a sophisticated run against Mango Markets. The run has been called an attack by some and a clever strategy by others. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Sees Over 7% Gains Amidst Crypto Market Recovery Aave (AAVE) trades at $57 with a 7% and 36% loss in the last 24 hours and the previous week, respectively. Curve Finance’s native token CRV was also part of the attack. This token has seen significant selling pressure in the short term but has been trending to the upside over today’s trading session. Orchestrating An Attack On Aave, First Attempt? Rudy Kadoch, founder of the portfolio management project Nested, summarized yesterday’s event and the “Bad Debt” attack on Aave. According to this report, Eisenberg borrowed $83 million of CRV and used $50 million of stablecoin USDC as collateral on the decentralized finance platform. Eisenberg published the thesis that supported this strategy in October 2022 via his Twitter account. It was public, and his objectives were perfectly outlined: to leverage his initial capital to influence the price of an illiquid token, such as CRV or Ravencoin (RVN), in hopes of creating “bad debt,” an excess liability assumed by the protocol. Check out recent activity in the @CurveFinance $CRV pools on @AaveAave V2! Over the past couple of days, the $CRV pools on Aave have seen a significant increase in both borrow rate and volume, likely to go short on $CRV. 👇 pic.twitter.com/Hx5Bt42Ks6 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) November 22, 2022 To pay off this debt, Aave would trigger an auction mechanism that involves selling AAVE on the spot market. By taking a short position on this token, Eisenberg would benefit. I’ve been advised aave is perfectly safe so here’s the potential trading strategy. Not financial or legal advice, but if you do make 9 figures on this feel free to send a tip Note that starting with more initial capital increases success odds and profit percentage pic.twitter.com/HKAF7Y5ogM — Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) October 19, 2022 By prompting the price of the underlying collateral, the Aave borrower can double or increase its price by five-fold “at least.” This attack was unsuccessful, as Kadoch noted, due to a lack of capital. The actor was trying to liquidate a CRV whale to create a bad debt. However, as the attack was being carried out, the team behind Curve Finance released the whitepaper for a stablecoin, crvUSD. This announcement supported the price of the token and shifted the trend. Kadoch noted: – $sdCRV, $cvxCRV, $yCRV depegged a lot with more than a 10% discount to get back $CRV. – People are paying more than 200% to borrow $CRV. – People telling Aave is not secure while the system was ready for such an event. The Future Of Aave In Jeopardy? On the other hand, the protocol operated as intended without centralized intervention. The team behind Aave claims that they will talk with the community and the DAO about the recent incident. In that sense, the protocol might introduce changes in the coming days to mitigate “long tail asset risk.” Many believe Eisenberg will resume its attack on the protocol once he can pool together more capital. You can call it attack on AAVE, but I actually think they made a mistake by not implementing a hard cap on how much CRV/other illiquid coins can you use as a collateral on AAVE. Otherwise you get a similar problem as with FTT. — DeFiac (@TheDEFIac) November 23, 2022 The “Bad Debt” attack on Aave was like the situation that led to the FTX’s collapse. The failed company issued held massive amounts of FTT, its native token. When the price of the asset crashed, Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire followed.

Solana (SOL) was one of the most affected by this movement, deviating from its all-time high of $260.06 to currently trading at $13.75. The total circulating supply of SOL stands at $362,782,994. Also, the 24-hour low is $11.l7, while the high is $13.78. The current price reflects an increase in Solana’s price, currently ranked at number 14 on CoinMarketCap with a trading volume of $739,091,583, which is a 38.59% gain in 24 hours. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharks Push Price Over $75, LTC Likely to Keep On Rising Although Solana is currently down on rankings, it is still recording massive trading gains. What Is Giving Solana Price Support Despite The Current Trend? Solana’s current price trend and increase in volume are supported by trader activity in the market. Despite recording a massive slump in the crypto winter, the project still enjoys massive adoption from investors. Its fast transaction execution time has made it widely adopted by institutions and individuals alike. Experts predict that the price of Solana might rise in the coming months. Also, the adoption of SOL for gaming and NFT makes it the ideal futuristic project for investors. SOL price is however not immune to the crypto winter currently taking place. Solana has recently enjoyed strong adoption for NFT projects, with many notable gaming giants relying on the asset for their in-game purchases. Solana is currently generating investors’ interest as investors look to consolidate on older and trusted tokens. With the collapse of FTX and its native token, FTT, Solana presents a viable investment option for users. SOL Predicted To Go Bearish In Short-term Source: Trading View With a bearish breakout observed in the sideways channel, around the $30-$45 level, the price of SOL crashed below the critical support zone of $25-$30, reaching the $12.50 support level. The price bounced off this support level and seems to have begun a rally, currently trading at $13.75. The MacD is below the signal line, and it implies the possibility of a bullish run. The support zone of $12 is still valid, while the resistance zone stands between the $25-30 level. The stochastic Oscillator shows Solana in the oversold region. However, the line is attempting to re-enter the channel. Solana’s bearish sentiment was strengthened by the demise of its strongest support platform, FTX. Despite its brief 24-hour rally, SOL will likely continue on the bearish movement for the short term. Related Reading: Ripple Vs.

Dave Ripley, currently the crypto exchange’s COO and named to replace CEO Jesse Powell when he steps down, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that Kraken is a supporter of self-custody.  Asked how his centralized exchange (CEX) could be trusted after the implosion of rival exchange FTX, he responded:  “One of the things that is really critical to this system is that it is the only place in the world where you can actually take control [and] own ownership of your own assets in a digital format.”  Read more: What Is a CEX? Centralized Exchanges Explained  Still, “it is not easy” to maintain client trust despite the exchange’s guardrails, according to Ripley. He said FTX’s misuse of customer funds will only put more emphasis on the need for proof of reserves.  “Individuals are going to ask for proof as opposed to just blind trust in centralized third parties,” Ripley said.  Proof of reserves is an auditing technique to confirm whether assets are, in fact, available. Ripley said Kraken has undergone two proof of reserves this year, with another planned for the start of the new year.

Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Breaks Above $75 As Price Eyes $90; Here Are Levels To Watch The crypto market, in general, has been on a downward trend. This week has been more positive, with some tokens rallying positively. Traders are still uncertain about the actual direction of the market and if support levels will finally outperform resistance. Institutional traders are increasing their crypto holdings with the long term in view. Currently, trust in cryptocurrencies hit an all-time low with the unraveling of FTX. However, some traders are consolidating positions and buying the dip. What Is Boosting The Price Of Ethereum Classic Amid A Possible Market Rally? Macroeconomic factors are mostly responsible for the price movement noted in cryptocurrencies. Ethereum Classic is rising due to traders’ optimism about the token’s value. Built from an Ethereum hard fork, the wide adoption of the parent blockchain has also helped the project. However, Ethereum itself is currently undergoing a bearish phase. The proof of stake migration has not significantly impacted the price of ETH, since it has continued to dip. Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, has no plans to switch to proof of stake and is still being mined. The motivation of profit by miners has helped its cause even in the prolonged bear market of 2022. The announcement by the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, to purchase 1BTC a day also helped the market to rally. ETC Is Tentatively Bullish Ethereum classic, despite its rally, will encounter resistance at the $21.7 and $26.5 levels if it goes on a bullish run. The support levels of the crypto asset stand at $15.9; if it breaches it, the coin will plummet further to the $13.2 level. The macD shows signs of tentative price movement; this means the positive momentum noted in the asset; might not be sustained. The formation of a golden cross is present on this chart, with the 50-day MA crossing the 100-day MA. This implies that a bullish run is to be expected in the short term for the Ethereum classic. Market forces and investor sentiments will also play a major role in the short-term price movement. Individuals are adjusting their investment portfolios, with fear and panic commonplace in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Closing In On This Bullish Crossover, Relief Finally Ahead?

42388590,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRIwTp,1669231435,FTX Contagion Revives Dreaded 2022 Crypto Knell – the ‘Withdrawal Halt’,"In the crypto industry in 2022, the phrase ""halting withdrawals"" is like black smoke billowing out of a building. Damage is certain.  Technically it means that a crypto exchange or lender has gated customers from being able to get their money or digital tokens back – typically because there’s just not enough assets on hand to meet redemption requests. The likely upshot, though, is that the business is unlikely to recover easily from the destruction. In many cases, a bankruptcy filing is the next step.  Now, the rapid unraveling of once-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including the FTX exchange and the crypto trading firm Alameda Research, has unleashed a fresh wave of crypto exchanges and lenders halting customers’ withdrawals over the past few weeks.  The collateral damage lengthens a list of casualties from the dramatic collapse of the Terra blockchain earlier this year, which accelerated or led directly to the failures of crypto firms including Celsius Network, Babel Finance, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.  The contagion can spread swiftly. When one company suddenly refuses redemption requests, another company suddenly faces a liquidity crisis. Market jitters unnerve investors, leading to further withdrawal requests, exacerbating the panic. Such is the pattern in digital-asset markets where there is no Federal Reserve or other central bank backstopping it all – as there is in the traditional financial system.  (CoinDesk counts 16 distinct withdrawal-halt announcements this year; the list is below.)  “For each player, you're going to be in this situation where all of a sudden you have to manage how much information you want to reveal,” said Benoit Bosc, global head of product at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR. “It might be more information than you actually want to reveal then.”  BlockFi, Genesis  BlockFi, a crypto lender, paused client withdrawals from its platform on Nov. 10, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation; it was two days after the FTX exchange fully halted customer withdrawals on Nov. 8. BlockFi later acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.  Last week, Genesis, a big crypto financial firm, announced its lending unit had suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.” Earlier in the year, the business suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses after Three Arrows Capital’s failure. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Bosc cited Warren Buffett’s oft-repeated quote: “‘When the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked.’”  Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis firm DataTrek Research, wrote in a note that the current crisis will take time to be resolved, and “until then this space will likely see more selling pressure.”  The following is a timeline of crypto firms’ withdrawal suspensions in the past few weeks:  Nov. 8: The FTX exchange halted customer withdrawals, an FTX support employee said in the company's official Telegram group.  Nov. 10: Crypto lender BlockFi halted withdrawals from its platform, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation at that time. (In a Nov. 14 update, the lender acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.)  Nov. 11: FTX US ceased processing crypto withdrawals. The same day, FTX Group companies – including FTX Trading and FTX US – filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  Nov. 13: The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange AAX said it had suspended withdrawal for as long as 10 days due to ​​the failure of an unidentified third party. The company said it had no financial exposure to FTX or its affiliates. On Nov. 23, AAX announced to close out derivatives positions.  Nov. 15: The Japanese crypto exchange Liquid, owned by FTX, suspended both fiat and crypto withdrawals on its Liquid Global platform “in compliance with the requirements of voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States.” The exchange announced on Nov. 20 that it had paused all forms of trading on its platform.  Nov. 15: Crypto lending platform SALT said it had halted all deposits and withdrawals on its platform due to FTX exposure.  Nov. 16: Crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading’s lending unit temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.”  Nov. 16: The Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini exchange said it was pausing withdrawals on its yield-earning Earn program as the exchange suffered a $485 million rush of outflows following Genesis' announcement earlier in the day. Genesis Global Trading powered the Earn program for Gemini.  And here is a timeline of withdrawal suspensions from earlier this year:  June 12: Celsius Network says that it is “pausing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts.” (Celsius filed for bankruptcy on July 13.)  June 17: Babel says “redemptions and withdrawals from Babel Finance products will be temporarily suspended.”  June 23: CoinFLEX announces it is “pausing all withdrawals.”  July 1: Voyager Digital says it is “temporarily suspending trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards.” (Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection on July 5.)  July 4: Vauld says that it “made the difficult decision to suspend all withdrawals, trading and deposits.”  July 20: Zipmex says that it is “pausing withdrawals until further notice.”  August 2: ZB.com announces that ""deposit and withdrawal services are now suspended"" after losing nearly five million in a suspected hack.  August 8: Hodlnaut says it ""will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/23/ftx-contagion-revives-dreaded-2022-crypto-knell-the-withdrawal-halt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fed2ab76d69c343a96860ccad725ac7a9c01adf7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Flashbots, Suave, a so-called sequencing chain, will be geared towards completely decentralizing the block-building process. By the firm’s description, it would be a “plug-and-play” solution that “unbundles the mempool and block-builder role” from existing blockchains.  In addition to maximizing the revenue that validators earn for operating blockchains, Flashbots hopes Suave can ameliorate rising concerns around transaction censorship, exploitative MEV practices and slow transaction execution.  Flashbots co-founder Philip Daian announced Suave earlier last month in Bogota, Colombia, at Devcon, the biggest Ethereum conference of the year.  As part of today’s update, Flashbots announced its first planned milestone will be to share a prototype for its “Execution Market,” where users can submit their transactions, and Suave will run simulations to return as much MEV as possible to validators. Flashbots also plans to release a Suave testnet chain to begin testing its new features.  The Flashbots research and development team has been working on ways to curb the potential harms of Maximal Extraction Value (MEV) within the Ethereum ecosystem. MEV refers to the additional income that block builders and validators receive as a result of including or reordering transactions within a block. One of the tools that validators can use to circumvent malicious MEV practice is by using MEV-Boost, a middleware component that Flashbots built, which allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders.  Right now, the way to earn MEV, mainly through MEV-Boost, has a centralizing effect. Validators connect to MEV-Boost through relayers, like the one that Flashbots runs, to earn MEV. About 91% of blocks relayed have used MEV-Boost; of those, 78% have used the Flashbots relayer. In August, Flashbots’ relayer started censoring Tornado Cash transactions to comply with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, but decided to make open source its MEV-Boost relayer code so that others could develop their own non-censoring relayer options.  With Suave, Flashbots hopes to improve the block-building process and further decentralize MEV, allowing validators, users, and third-party “executors” to maximize their revenue, while also maintaining a fair ecosystem.

In today’s blogpost, Flashbots said Suave’s architecture would be set up in three parts.  The first part, the “Preference Environment,” will collect “preferences” from users – messages which “express a particular goal or unlock a payment if the user’s conditions have been met.”  The second part, the “Execution Market,” will allow third-party “executors” to earn MEV by competing with one another “for the right to turn a preference into a transaction (or bundle) and fulfill the users’ preference at the best price possible.”  The final part, the “decentralized block building network,” will turn these transactions into blocks that can be added to a blockchain while maximizing MEV for builders and validators.  These three components make up what will be called the Suave Chain. The chain will be EVM-compatible, meaning it will work with blockchains built using Ethereum’s core technology stack.

All Market Cap Weighted Crypto Indexes Have Been Moving Together Recently According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the 30-day ETH-BTC correlation now has a value of 0.95. To assess the performance of the different portions of the market as a whole, the coins are divided into the “crypto indexes.” The criteria for putting any asset into an index is using its market cap. The “market cap” here simply refers to a measure of the total worth of a cryptocurrency’s entire circulating supply. There are three main categories of indexes: the “large caps,” the “mid caps,” and the “small caps.” As their names already imply, these indexes give a look at how the different sized coins are doing right now.

Both Bitcoin and the mid caps currently stand at exactly 18% in the red during the period of the last thirty days, while the large caps have also only minimally performed worse as the index’s returns are at 19% currently. The small caps have taken a noticeably higher hit than the rest of the pack, as this index is 23% underwater in this timespan.

According to the filings, Blumer bought 2,934,537 shares of the crypto bank on Nov. 16 while Block.One bought 2,363,186 shares.  The purchase makes Blumer the largest shareholder of Silvergate, according to the latest statistics from FactSet.  Block.one is a private blockchain company founded by Brenden Blumer and Dan Larimer in 2017. It is best known for developing the EOS.IO protocol, which the company announced in 2017 and subsequently released as open-source software in 2018.  In a press release, Block.one said it believed Silvergate was a consistent innovator whose share price was undervalued.  ""We believe Silvergate’s current equity prices do not accurately reflect their strong balance sheet, their strategic positioning, or their market-defiant growth trajectory, and therefore offers a unique investment opportunity. We are excited to be a new passive shareholder,"" the company wrote.  Shares of Silvergate were rising about 5% on Wednesday afternoon. They are down sharply since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX on concerns that Silvergate’s exposure to FTX would weigh heavily on it as well. FTX does have at least $1 billion in deposits with Silvergate, but the bank says that represents less than 10% of its total deposits from all digital asset customers.  Its CEO has also sought to reassure investors that market volatility created by FTX’s collapse would not affect the crypto banker’s business.  “Suffice it to say, whether deposits are up or down, we have the liquidity and the capital ratios to support the volatility,” said Alan Lane at the Oppenheimer Blockchain & Digital Assets Summit last Thursday.

This has come as the student loan repayment moratorium is reinstated on the back of a successful legal challenge against the debt relief plan. The near-term outlook for SoFi's common shares is mixed with heightened volatility likely as the crypto's implosion plays out. Crypto is imploding and SoFi ( SOFI ) has now found itself under the crosshairs as four U.S. senators recently wrote a letter to the Fed, FDIC, and OCC, to review the company's crypto listings. The situation is serious as the blame game for the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD), the world's third-largest crypto exchange by volume plays out. For those not tuned into the cryptosphere, FTX was a $32 billion behemoth whose founder CEO expropriated consumer assets. In stark contrast to the unfettered euphoria from last year, 2022 has seen the failure of numerous crypto firms from Voyager (VYGVQ) to BlockFi. 2022 really has come to be one of the worst years for cryptos and SoFi might soon find its crypto trading business on the list of casualties. The four U.S. lawmakers are clearly looking to assess and mitigate the systematic risk posed by crypto's implosion to the broader financial system. Indeed, another letter was addressed directly to SoFi asking the company to explain how its status as a Bank Holding Company can be prudently aligned with its facilitation of what fundamentally remain unregulated securities. Crypto is still a wild west but SoFi was allowed to continue offering crypto trading for at least two years from its bank charter approval earlier this year in January. This also came with the possibility of 3 one-year extensions with the condition that it did not expand crypto trading activities. The key takeaway from SoFi's investors is that crypto trading, a largely immaterial part of the company's flywheel, was always going to come to an end. The risk is whether this happens ahead of a planned 2027 phase-down. To be clear here, crypto is immaterial to SoFi's long-term bull case. The value of their members' digital assets at $132 million as of the end of its last reported quarter. It forms a small component of what was $3.85 million in brokerage fees generated during their fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings. The other takeaways for SoFi investors will coalesce around two points. Firstly, the very public letter could fix future common share price movement of the fintech to what is fast becoming an intense implosion of the more than decade-long crypto ecosystem. Genesis , described as the Goldman Sachs (GS) for crypto, and Core Scientific ( CORZ ), the largest Bitcoin miner in North America are both teetering on the brink of chapter 11 as the contagion from the FTX collapse ripples across an industry without a lender of last resort. Further, if SoFi is moved to end crypto trading early, its platform could become less attractive to prospective new members. This would likely only be a small number of individuals but would be a further dampener on revenue growth when aggregated with the student loan pause and the fraught macroeconomic context. An Old Enemy Resurfaces The White House has extended the payment pause on student loans following a federal appeals court ruling that imposed a nationwide block on the debt relief plan. It rightfully would not have made sense to ask debtors to start paying interest on tranches of debt that would otherwise have been forgiven. This would be the eighth pause of a policy that was brought in during the early weeks of the pandemic and one that has materially shrunk what was previously one of SoFi's largest businesses. The new pause is set to expire 60 days after the legal case is settled by the Supreme Court. However, if the Supreme Court appeal fails, then repayment will restart 60 days after June 30, 2023. This sets the context for what could be the majority of next year being written off for SoFi's student loan refinancing. Student loans becoming political football has placed SoFi in a difficult position. The company will almost certainly have to revise down its revenue guidance for its full fiscal 2024 as this part of its business further strays away from being considered a legitimate contributor to the long-term bull thesis. For SoFi, When It Rains It Pours SoFi will have to work harder on growing the other parts of its flywheel with crypto likely to be out of action and with the student loan pause back on the map. There is a silver lining though, the ongoing implosion will indeed be felt by centralized exchanges and institutional participation in the space. This will filter through to less retail demand for buying and selling crypto on platforms like SoFi. Critically, it would make a future SoFi decision to end its crypto trading early less disruptive to its business as the legacy of the FTX collapse is a push for crypto self-storage and decentralized exchanges. However, whilst the end of crypto trading will be a rounding error, the student loan pause will have an intense negative financial impact on the company's roadmap for growth and will discombobulate the overall momentum of its flywheel. Hundreds of thousands of new members from early next year are now out of the question. SoFi is also unlikely to regain a high valuation with one of its core business functions being restricted. Against this, I continue to be long with the expectation that the first half of 2023 is unlikely to bring any respite for my position. Longer-term this will form a significant opportunity to buy more shares.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560188-sofi-student-loan-pause-as-crypto-implodes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4691510.jpeg

The minutes might hold clues on the pace of future interest rates, a key factor in prices for risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading as high as $16,634 early Wednesday but had settled back to $16,300 as of press time, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recovered somewhat since hitting a two-year low of $15,480 on Monday amid jitters over the future of the crypto financial firm Genesis.  “The situation with Genesis itself is likely to have been priced in already,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital. “However, we will want to see if other names come to the fore as well.” (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Ether (ETH) followed a similar trend, up 2.5% to $1,160. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was up 1.4%. Some altcoins notched double-digit gains: Solana’s SOL token jumped 11%, while Binance's in-house BNB token was also up 11%. Zcash’s ZEC token was up 10%.  Equities also edged up ahead of the Fed’s minutes, with the Standard and Poor's 500 index up 0.4%. U.S. weekly jobless claims reached a three-month high, which is reflected in the recent layoff wave in the tech sector. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) showed weakness, sliding 0.7%.  There has been a debate in both traditional and digital-asset markets over how much the Fed will raise interest rates at its December meeting to curb hot inflation. The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see roughly a 71% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by just 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) in December – slowing from the 75 basis-point hikes at recent meetings.  Any dovish signs from the Fed minutes may “help markets maintain these levels at the very least,” DiPasquale told CoinDesk.  Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note that bitcoin’s next area of resistance falls around $17,500, though it could be “very difficult to overcome.”  “There's arguably a greater case for the price to fall to $10,000 at the moment than rising to $20,000,” Erlam wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/23/bitcoin-clings-to-16k-ahead-of-fed-minutes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b9364bd7db975d516c83a72d7fc51b54df58d1a-1250x624.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394097,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWej,1669227396,Ethereum Needs Competition,"Hear me out.  As I never tire of pointing out in meetings, there’s nothing you can do with a blockchain that you can’t also do faster and cheaper with a traditional centralized computing infrastructure. While blockchains have generated some very cool new approaches to products and services, including tokenization and smart contracts, they can all be replicated in a centralized system. The essential, irreducible value proposition of a blockchain is true decentralization. Everything else is optional.  For enterprise users, I believe that value proposition is tied to a well-founded fear of the power of centralized market operators and the path they generally take from useful utility to predatory monopolist. This is why private blockchains remain such a silly idea. Decentralization theater doesn’t change the fact that the system operator is just a potential future predatory monopolist.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  From ride-sharing to consumer products, the story of the digital economy in the last decade has been the rise of these so-called nearly unshakeable digital monopolists. Along the way, some of these firms may have been raising the share they take of the transactions that are executed on their networks. This generally happens when the value proposition of a marketplace shifts from “it’s a better system” to “it’s just a bigger system” and eventually to “it’s the only system with efficient scale to reach your customers or suppliers.”  Though the world of Web2 is still (historically speaking) new, this isn’t a new problem and we’ve solved it before, not with decentralization but with regulation. In 1895, there were an estimated 6,000 local phone companies in the United States. Each company could set its own rates and had to reach agreements with each other for interconnection. Just like today’s so-called digital monopolies, the big got bigger. Eventually, there was just one dominant player left, AT&T, the eventual successor to the American Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell and his father-in-law in 1885.  To “regulate” AT&T and create a level playing field for smaller, competitive companies in the telecom space, the Communications Act of 1934 decreed that telephone service was a public service and participants in the business were common carriers. To be designated a common carrier meant that a company must offer its products and services to all members of the public on equal terms, including interconnection. In that world, the carrier with the biggest network could not shut out smaller players or charge them steep fees to connect calls from one network to another.  See also: The Ethereum Killers Are All Zombies Now | Opinion  Imagine if common carrier rules were applied to private blockchains, complete with mandated interconnection rules and fees. In this world, any user of any private blockchain could interconnect and transact with any other user or any other private blockchain. No matter how big or small the chain, the biggest operators would not be able to attract market share simply by being bigger. They’d have to be better. Perhaps that means faster, more secure, or more reliable.  There are some big attractions for this kind of approach. The most important is that, in many ways, it can produce a much more competitive and dynamic marketplace. Centralized private blockchain operators would compete with each other to be the best. The downside is that the nature of that competition is limited. For a token or smart contract to be interconnected from one private chain to another, they have to be fundamentally the same or so similar as to be indistinguishable for most purposes. Just as ISPs are largely reduced to competing on speed and price, the nature of common carrier competition tends to be quite limited.  In 1984, the Bell system was broken up into a series of regulated regional operators, which were separated from the long-distance phone call business. Subscribers paid monthly fees for access and local calls, and long-distance calls were charged per minute. Consumers and businesses could choose any long-distance provider they wanted, all of which had equal access to the local phone network thanks to common carrier rules. The result was a competitive transformation which drove down the cost of long-distance calls by 40% over a decade. Eventually, the plunging cost of networking and computing drove those fees down to near zero, where they have remained ever since.  Read more: Reversibility on Ethereum: The Benefits and Pitfalls | Opinion  Why does any of this matter? Because warm, friendly, community-centric Ethereum may not be far from becoming a global digital commerce monopolist. Ethereum is already much more valuable than any other blockchain ecosystem and has the most developers and users. That makes it harder and harder for viable competitors to emerge, no matter how good they might be. Over time, the power of that network is likely to only grow stronger.  Ethereum is unlikely to become a predatory monopolist, jacking up fees and squeezing users. Nor do I foresee the Ethereum Foundation commissioning a grand headquarters tower in New York City any time soon. However, no matter how good the intentions, no matter how democratic the governance, a lack of competition could shape culture and behavior. Complacency and self-satisfaction could eventually be just as damaging to the pace of innovation.  Having competition breathing down your neck is good for all organizations, even nonprofits. Common carrier regulations could transform the world of private blockchains from irrelevant to competitive overnight.

For instance, 55% of BTC addresses were out-of-the-money in January 2019, when bitcoin bottomed out at around $3.2K and then climbed to more than $5K three months later. The historical data implies that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could be near its bottom ahead of the next bull cycle, though it's important to bear in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Seeking Alpha contributor Daniel Jones, meanwhile, warned that a full on bitcoin collapse is likely about to happen. The implosion of crypto exchange FTX, followed by a series of fallouts from other high-profile crypto-related firms, dented bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) price significantly (from last year's all-time highs) in a relatively short period of time. The token changed hands at $16.39K at 1:15 p.m. ET, down 14.6% M/M, -65% YTD and -71.5% Y/Y.

LTC’s price continues to look strong as bearish sentiment for the market lingers, with things looking uncertain for most traders and investors. LTC’s price rallies high on the daily timeframe as the price moves towards $90 above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) Litecoin (LTC) price has held strong above $60, showing good bullish signs of rallying to a high of $90-$100 if the market conditions remain favorable for prices. With many looking for a major dump in Bitcoin (BTC) price, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) bounced from $15,500 as price rallied to a high of $16,500, leaving bears on the sidelines as the price of Litecoin (LTC) gains more momentum to rally. The price action displayed by Litecoin (LTC) in recent times has been encouraging compared to many altcoins battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors involved has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move after previous weeks.

The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The price of LTC has been a standout performer of the market as prices continue to show immersed strength holding up well above $60 despite the persistent FUD (fear of uncertainty and doubt). LTC saw its price traded in a region of $60 on the weekly chart, but the price bounced from this region to a rally high of $80, showing some great strength. The price of LTC faced resistance to trade higher to a region of $90-$100. LTC price needs to break above $80 for more signs of a rally. Weekly resistance for the price of LTC – $80. Weekly support for the price of LTC – $60. Price Analysis Of LTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of LTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $70 support after breaking up nicely from its daily range movement showing some great price action to trend higher to a region of $80. If the price of LTC breaks and holds above $80, we could see more rallies for the LTC price to a region of $90-$100; a break below a region of $70 would send the price back to a region of $60. Daily resistance for the LTC price – $80. Daily support for the LTC price – $75-$70.

42420788,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH0f,1669227113,3 Things We Learned at Tornado Cash Dev Alexey Pertsev's Trial,"The long-awaited trial of Alexey Pertsev, held Tuesday in the Netherlands, offered a few clues to how prosecutors will take their case against the Tornado Cash developer forward – including detailing what he is being charged with doing.  Pertsev, who contributed code to the crypto anonymizer, has been in jail since August, days after the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the decentralized protocol, which it said had been used to process dirty money by North Korean hackers.  Tuesday’s pro forma hearing decided that Pertsev must remain detained until at least February – and also offered, for the first time, a clear statement of charges against the developer.  But it also gave a hint about what the case will and won’t do. In the U.S., the Tornado Cash issue is often talked about in terms of the Constitution – which the U.S. Supreme Court has said includes the right to publish computer code.  In Europe, there’s no equivalent legal doctrine. Lawyers in the case don’t seem to be making any appeal to the free speech provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, and it looks more like the trial will instead get deep into the mechanics of how decentralized finance (DeFi) works in practice.  If so, the proceedings may do little to resolve more general questions – such as the fear many developers have that they could now be held responsible for the open-source software they develop.  Here are some of the things we learned, beyond the initial headlines.  There are other suspects  Prosecutor Martine Boerlage mentioned Pertsev’s name frequently with co-developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm as she attempted to paint a picture of a service that was under their joint control.  “The defendant sits along with Semenov and Storm in the driver’s seat and determines what does or does not happen within Tornado Cash,” Boerlage said, citing evidence taken from group chats on Pertsev’s phone. (A written version of Boerlage’s speaking note seen by CoinDesk refers to the two as “S. and S.”)  Separately, the prosecutor said that other suspects are also being investigated alongside Pertsev, but on a different track, given the complexity of pursuing those not on Dutch territory. Contacted by CoinDesk, the public prosecutor’s office declined to confirm whether Semenov and Storm are among those under investigation.  When previously contacted by CoinDesk several weeks ago, Semenov told CoinDesk he was not ready to give public statements on the case, and did not immediately respond to a further request for information made after the trial. Storm invited CoinDesk to contact his lawyers, but did not say who they are.  The case will get into the guts of DeFi  Dutch law makes it illegal to conceal or disguise the origin and movement of funds, and prosecutors said Tornado was used to place almost 75% of all crime-related crypto on the Ethereum blockchain.  To prove that Pertsev is somehow responsible for this activity, prosecutors will have to refute the conventional wisdom that Tornado Cash runs autonomously, meaning it is not under anyone’s control.  Boerlage said records of internal conversations show Pertsev, Semenov and Storm ran Tornado like a business, discussing management and operational decisions, and that they could, in practice, outvote other holders of the protocol’s TORN tokens. In particular, she said, they could have chosen to impose better laundering checks but doing so would have driven away too many clients.  She said she’s still working to decipher exactly how Tornado’s governance works, and to prove that Pertsev profited from funds that passed through the protocol.  “We have found large sums of money and cryptos in the name of the suspect in various places around the world,” Boerlage said. She added Pertsev “couldn’t have afforded his rented house and expensive Porsche” with wages from his job at cybersecurity company PepperSec alone.  Pertsev’s lawyers deny the charges, which they say are vague and don’t specify when, why or how the supposed money laundering happened. They also said the prosecutor is confused about how decentralized finance works.  Pertsev’s team will be seeking to show this case is different from existing case law on bitcoin mixers, the lawyers said. That will require a deep dive into how projects like Tornado Cash are governed, such as – for example – that the protocol can be used with multiple user interfaces, not just those supplied by Pertsev.  “It's clear to us that these judges are not as familiar with the subject matter [of how crypto works] as they should be,” Pertsev’s lawyer Keith Cheng told CoinDesk outside the courtroom.  Human cost  Ultimately, the hearing was not substantive but procedural to decide whether Pertsev should remain in custody pending a full trial. As Cheng put it, the hearing is about “deprivation of pretty much the greatest asset we know in our society, which is our personal freedom.”  Pertsev has been in jail since August without fully knowing the charges against him. His counsel alleges details and documents have been withheld.  The hearing was a reminder of the great personal cost of being held, uncharged, in jail. Pertsev and his wife Xenia Malik have previously told CoinDesk they are permitted just a single, supervised, one-hour meeting per week. He was planning a trip to Disneyland with his kid sister when he was arrested, the court was told.  In the courtroom, Malik wept as she observed the case being made against her husband. With judges deeming he could try to flee the country or hide evidence if freed, the couple now face a Christmas apart.

Despite a growing Cosmos ecosystem, ATOM and the Hub lack value capturing. The Cosmos Hub 2.0 provides four revenue sources for the Hub and value accrual for ATOM. However, the proposal was rejected by governance. The Hub 2.0 proposal will be split into several parts to be submitted for governance approval again. If successful, it will be an important catalyst for ATOM. Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Edward Wu as a new contributor.

Click here to find out more » Cosmos Ecosystem And Cosmos Hub Cosmos (ATOM-USD) is best known as an interoperability solution for connecting multiple layer 1 blockchains. It is not a single blockchain, but rather a web of application-specific blockchains (called appchains) connected by IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol). Cosmos Hub is an appchain with its native token Cosmos used for transaction fees and staking, as well as a voting mechanism in governance. This is the first and also the largest appchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. Despite its size and its potentially important role, Cosmos Hub has historically not benefited from the growing ecosystem. The ATOM token lacks a value-accruing mechanism, and given that, taken together with its current inflationary nature, the token price performance has been lackluster. Cosmos Hub 2.0 Proposal In late September, a new white paper for Cosmos Hub 2.0 was released with four initiatives to empower the Hub and ATOM token. Those were Interchain Security, Liquid Staking, Interchain Scheduler, and Interchain Allocator. Among these, Interchain Security and Interchain Scheduler provide two new sources of reward for ATOM holders. Liquid Staking and Interchain Allocator provide additional services for the ecosystem. Cosmos Hub 2.0 White paper Interchain Security Appchains in the Cosmos ecosystem are independent PoS blockchains secured by validators who stake respective native tokens to validate transactions and produce new blocks. However, bootstrapping new validator sets is a challenging task. Interchain Security allows appchains to rent security from the Cosmos Hub, thus lowering the entry barrier for a new appchain. Appchains rent Cosmos Hub's verifiers for greater security by paying their native tokens as the service fee. ATOM holders who stake their tokens will receive appchain's native tokens as part of staking rewards in addition to the ATOM issuance reward. Rewards from staking ATOM in the future will include four elements: ATOM new issuance (i.e., inflation) Transaction fees - this part of the reward is minimal; total transaction fees paid by Cosmos Hub users are only $1 million per year Other App chains' native tokens by providing interchain security service Revenue from Interchain Scheduler Interchain Scheduler Interchain Scheduler is a solution for cross-chain maximal extractable value (MEV) by building a MEV market for the Cosmos ecosystem: MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by censoring and/or changing the order of transactions in a block. When someone sends a transaction in the blockchain, there is a delay between the time when the transaction is broadcast to the network and when it is recorded into a block. During this period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool called the mempool where contents are visible to everyone. Arbitrageurs can monitor the mempool and find opportunities to maximize their profits - e.g., by front-running transactions. MEV creates a bad user experience and leads to worse execution prices as a result of arbitrage activities. One popular way to solve this is to create an open market for MEV opportunities. Validators auction off the right to front-run users, selling block space to an open market of arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs need to pay a fee to block producers to ensure their transactions get preferential treatment. The Interchain Scheduler is an interchain market that let arbitrageurs bid on block space across chains connected to the Cosmos Hub. By bidding block space on different chains, arbitrageurs can lock in profit with strong execution guarantees. Interchain Scheduler will then redirect fees generated from the cross-chain MEV marketplace to the Cosmos Hub treasury. Here's an overview of Cosmos Hub 2.0's revenue streams: Cosmos Hub 2.0 White Paper On the left-hand side in the above diagram, Interchain Security, transaction fees, new token issuance, and Interchain Scheduler are the four sources of revenue for the Cosmos Hub. Interchain Allocator is similar to a venture capital fund that deploys generated capital to bootstrap Cosmos DApps and other initiatives. Revenues will be either distributed to validators/delegators and the community pool, or to Cosmos Hub Treasury to fund public goods and future growth. Tokenomics ATOM is the native asset of Cosmos Hub. As with other proof-of-stake blockchains, validators stake ATOM to participate in the network consensus mechanism, validating transactions and proposing new blocks. Validators receive block rewards that currently include new ATOM issuance and transaction fees. In the future, block rewards will also include other appchains' native tokens from Interchain Security and revenue from Interchain Scheduler, as discussed above. Cosmos Hub targets a staking ratio of two-thirds of the total token supply for maintaining sufficient blockchain security. The annual ATOM issuance rate adjusts based on the staking ratio. If less than two-thirds of ATOM are staked, the issuance rate will gradually rise to 20% until reaching the targeting staking ratio. If the staking ratio is over two-thirds, the issuance rate will slowly adjust back to 7%. Cosmos Hub 2.0 seeks to change the ATOM issuance schedule in an attempt to capitalize the Cosmos Hub treasury up front and reduce the issuance rate in the long term. It proposes an initial one-time issuance of 4M ATON token to the treasury and another 10 equal tranches of 4M ATOM to occur annually, subject to separate governance votes. The long-term issuance rate is expected to decline to below 1% when new revenue sources generate enough traction. Why Was Cosmos Hub 2.0 Rejected By Governance? Cosmos Hub uses on-chain voting by ATOM token for any change in the blockchain. A quorum requires 40% of the total staked ATOM token to participate in a vote, and 50% of the token that participated in the vote needs to vote in favor of the proposal. There is also a ""no with veto"" option where if more than 33.4% of the vote goes to veto, the proposal is rejected even if there are enough votes for ""yes."" Cosmos Hub 2.0 got an unusually high turnout of more than 73% ATOM token participation in voting. The results were 47% pledged in favor, 37% voted no with veto, 13% abstained, and 1.8% voted no. The high voting participation highlights the importance of this proposal, and almost half of the token holders supported the proposal. In essence, most members who vote no with veto agree with most of the parts of the proposal. However, given the broad nature of the new Cosmos Hub 2.0 proposal, it's logical that even if one point in the proposal raises concerns, it will be hard to vote yes. Several important contributors to the Cosmos Hub suggested splitting the proposal into separate actionable proposals for the Cosmos Hub 2.0 vision to move forward. Risks The contagion effect could occur as the FTX (FTT-USD) collapse is in play, and the market is experiencing another round of deleveraging. Nonetheless, ATOM is still above the June low and has outperformed both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). The reason could be that ATOM is less used in DeFi as a collateral asset and avoids the selling pressure due to liquidation. Cosmos Hub has a unique proposition in the layer 1 blockchain landscape. It is not trying to compete directly with Ethereum. Instead, it's trying to build an ecosystem of appchains. In the long term, success will depend on Cosmos's ability to execute its roadmap. Unlike Ethereum, which is coordinated by the Ethereum Foundation and has Vitalik Buterin leading the development direction, Cosmos has widely dispersed groups of contributors, which means that sometimes it's difficult to achieve consensus in the Cosmos community. Takeaway Cosmos is one of the best blockchain projects in the industry, and plenty of analysis claims it could be the only real competitor to Ethereum. Cosmos Hub 2.0 offers a clear repositioning of the chain and provides solutions to the long-criticized problem of value capture. Although the proposal has been rejected, token holders generally support most of the content in the proposal. We will soon see a split version of separate proposals to be submitted for approval again. The approval of these proposals will be the most significant catalyst for ATOM.",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560174-important-new-catalyst-for-atom?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4689853.jpeg

42394085,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXVfB,1669222479,What Is a Crypto Exchange Token and How Did It Help Blow up FTX?,"The FTT exchange token played a key role in the downfall of the crypto exchange FTX and affiliated trading firm Alameda Research. It was the use of FTT to inflate both entities’ balance sheets, reported by CoinDesk’s Ian Allison on Nov. 2, that raised the first doubts that sparked the collapse.  FTT may have been core to another aspect of the FTX fraud, serving as notional (but actually worthless) “collateral” for loans of customer funds made by FTX to bail out Alameda.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But what are exchange tokens? What role do they serve for the exchanges that issue them? How should they be treated under modern accounting standards? And how do they advance the crypto industry’s agenda of decentralization?  To answer the last question first: Exchange tokens are by and large not decentralized, and, if anything, their goal is the opposite of decentralization. They are, at bottom, an incentive to keep using the same centralized exchange. Holders can use them to get discounts on trading fees, rewards and early access to offerings. Despite chatter on Twitter, the FTT token did not distribute a share of FTX platform revenue or give holders any governance rights, and neither do most exchange tokens.  Technically, exchange tokens are nothing special. FTT was tracked as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, a kind of token that pretty much anyone can create with limited technical skill. BNB, Binance’s exchange token, is tracked on its branded BNB Chain, a blockchain that began life as an Ethereum fork but has merged with a separate permissioned blockchain.  See also: Binance Seeks to Rev Up Its BNB Blockchain  That’s in contrast to one of the concepts that may have inspired the creation of exchange tokens. Starting roughly in 2016-2017, there was a lot of discussion in crypto of “utility tokens” that would be used to incentivize and pay nodes for decentralized computing services. Though the term seems to have faded, current examples include the decentralized storage network Storj; the BitTorrent token now managed by Tron; and even Helium, the troubled Wi-Fi node project.  The appeal of utility tokens is you don’t need any legal regime to enforce property rights or claim a place in the “capital stack” – that is, the ordered list of obligations from an organization to counterparties including debtors and investors. That’s partly because there is no capital stack, but also because the value derives procedurally from demand for services that are, in effect, directly connected to the blockchain.  The value of exchange tokens, by contrast, is implied to rest on a regulatory or legal regime that in many cases doesn’t actually exist. Most if not all exchange tokens are issued by so-called “offshore” exchanges, like FTX and Binance, that are registered in light-touch regulatory havens such as, in FTX’s case, the Bahamas. U.S.-registered exchanges Kraken and Coinbase, by contrast, do not have their own tokens because they have access to standard equity markets (and the associated regulatory restraints). Exchange tokens represent a way for offshore exchanges to raise money without that access.  “Binance was the first to launch, and it was really successful. And when you’re successful, you get copycats,” Katie Talati, co-founder and director of research at the crypto asset manager Arca, said. “Huobi, OKX, they all launched their own token and, going forward, it has been standard. FTX didn’t launch until the second half of 2019, and at the same time they launched their token.”  But just because exchange tokens can raise money like equity doesn’t mean that’s what they are. “Currently, these aren’t part of the capital stack and you can’t claim anything in a bankruptcy, for instance,” Talati said. “There’s no governance, you can’t say you want the exchange to do X,Y and Z.”  But in a strange sort of ontological mystery that is fairly common in crypto, these tokens, issued by entities without strong regulators or even necessarily well-enforced property rights, trade a lot like equity. Talati said that a discounted cash flow model is one useful way to think about their value, “but there are a lot of inputs that we can’t model.”  This semi-fungibility with an equity model may have eased the way to Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent finances. One element of the grift was that FTT was what’s known as a “low-flow, high-fully diluted value” token. Only a very small portion traded publicly, but the public price for that fraction was assumed to apply to hundreds of millions of dollars of the token owned by FTX itself. This makes a rough sort of sense if you think in terms of the “equity value” that a startup founder, for instance, hangs on to after venture capital investors get their slice.  But the handling of the FTT tokens on FTX and Alameda’s balance sheets didn’t track either to standard equity accounting practices or, more importantly, to reality. When accounting for its own equity, or handling stock it has bought back from public markets, companies do not add them to their valuation estimate or liquid assets, instead usually tallying them separately as “treasury stock.”  That’s because a company’s equity isn’t part of its total value, it is a reflection of that value. Adding your own stock to your bottom line would be a bit like a snake eating its own tail.  This basic accounting deception became a time bomb when Bankman-Fried seemingly began using FTT as collateral for loans between FTX and Alameda, as well as other related entities. As I wrote last week, these shenanigans resemble nothing so much as Enron’s use of related entities and paper shuffling to hide debt and pump its own valuation.  The centrality of FTT to the worst crypto blowup of all time has pushed crypto leaders to clarify their stance on accounting for exchange tokens and similar in-house assets. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, took pains last week to clarify that Binance has “never used BNB as collateral.” In a Twitter Space last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse similarly clarified that his company does not count its vast trove of XRP on its balance sheet.  See also: Binance Launches Native Oracle Network, Starting With BNB  This relatively unspoken norm helps explain why CoinDesk’s reporting about flows of FTT was so explosive. It’s not the sort of asset that should be used in the way it seemingly was, and no truly independent entity would have accepted it as loan collateral, or even considered it an “asset.”  Experienced crypto investors are in a position to be the bulwark enforcing that norm – and to lose their shirts when they don’t. Talati is unambiguous on Arca’s stance.  “When we look at [projects], a lot of them will have their own token on their balance sheet,” she said. “And we just cross that out.”",NEGATIVE,BNB | FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | FTT,David Z.

42388591,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRIwYV,1669222148,Bitcoin Wallet of the Failed BTC-e Exchange Wakes Up,"A crypto wallet attributed to the BTC-e exchange that's been linked to the 2014 Mt. Gox hack burst into life Wednesday with its largest transaction since August 2017, sending a total of 10,000 bitcoin ($165 million) to two unidentified recipients.  As part of the transaction, which took place around 08:38 UTC, a wallet that received 3,500 bitcoin forwarded 300 BTC to another destination. That was split further and landed in several wallets not attributed to any known custodial service. The distribution pattern is open to interpretation: It's possible the wallet owner simply sent the money to other wallets of their own, sent it to other people or cashed out through an unofficial over-the-counter broker. The remaining 6,500 stayed put.  Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, was robbed of 744,408 BTC and shut permanently in 2014. Alexander Vinnik, alleged to be the operator of BTC-e – which he denies – was arrested in 2017 at a resort near Thessaloniki, Greece, at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice on money laundering and other allegations.  The wallet involved in Wednesday's transaction was attributed to BTC-e by blockchain analytics system Crystal Blockchain. The transfer was noticed by Russian crypto entrepreneur Sergey Mendeleev, who published the observation in his Telegram channel. Blockchain data provides a limited amount of information, which is open to interpretation.  Vinnik, a Russian national, faced competing extradition claims from Russia, France and the U.S. He was extradited to France from Greece in 2020 and sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering. In August of that year he was extradited to the U.S. to face allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings,” according to a 2020 indictment by the California court. He is now at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California, according to the court case docket.  Russian Link  Soon after BTC-e closed and its servers seized by the FBI in 2017, a clone started under the name WEX. After a year of operation, WEX froze all withdrawals and shut down. CEO Dmitri Vasilev said he sold the exchange to Dmitri Khavchenko.  Before and after shutting down, WEX wallets were drained of millions of dollars worth of crypto, CoinDesk reported at the time. Users filed police reports and several investigations were reportedly launched in Russia and Kazakhstan. Over the years, Vasilev has been arrested in Italy, Poland and Croatia at the request of the Russian police, but every time released soon after.  The most recent picture in Vasilev's Instagram profile was posted on May 3, geotagged as taken in Amsterdam. On the photo, Vasilev is standing in front of a store named Scamm.  In his public talks, as well as in group chats with WEX users, Vasilev said control of users' crypto had always been with the anonymous WEX admin. In 2019, another Russian national, Alexei Bilyuchenko, confessed to being the admin. He said he was forced to transfer all the money to two unidentified officers of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), according to the criminal case materials obtained by BBC.  According to a group of WEX users, Bilyuchenko is currently in a Russian prison called Matrosskaya Tishina in Moscow, because a letter sent to him through the official prison mail system was reported as received.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/23/bitcoin-wallet-of-the-failed-btc-e-exchange-wakes-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a54a494bc04db7fba7ca31b2d61db402cad1c41e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) reminded Attorney General Merrick Garland and Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the DOJ’s recently renewed commitment to prosecuting white-collar criminals. The senators want them to honor that commitment when investigating the behavior of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives “with the utmost scrutiny.”  Warren, a long-time critic of the crypto industry, has closely monitored the collapse of the Bahamas-based FTX, as well as the ripple effects that collapse has had across the wider industry.  On Tuesday, Warren, Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) sent a letter to Fidelity, asking the financial services firm to reconsider allowing retail clients to include bitcoin in their retirement plans. Last week, Warren and Durbin wrote to Bankman-Fried and FTX’s current CEO, John Jay Ray III, asking for information about what precipitated the exchange’s collapse.  In addition to the knock-on effect across the wider crypto industry, Warren and Whitehouse’s letter expresses concerns about the impact of FTX’s implosion on retail investors, who they say were given a “false sense of safety and legitimacy” by FTX’s “high-dollar advertisement placements and celebrity endorsements.”  Though the letter urges the DOJ to investigate and prosecute all FTX executives potentially embroiled in the alleged fraud, Bankman-Fried bears the brunt of Warren and Whitehouse’s ire.  “The fall of FTX was not simply a result of sloppy business and management practices, but rather appears to have been caused by intentional and fraudulent tactics employed by Mr. Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives to enrich themselves,” the senators wrote. “In fact, Mr. Bankman-Fried had already revealed his true interests of self-enrichment last year when he siphoned $300 million to his own wallet.”  Read more: The FTX Downfall: Full Coverage",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/23/senator-warren-demands-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-execs-be-held-accountable-to-fullest-extent-of-the-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f966742faffea1b658f5a1a9b7160e0e828cf4bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Short-Term And Long-Term UTXO Age Bands Approach Crossover As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC has usually observed a significant rise following the formation of such a crossover. The relevant indicator here is the “UTXO Age Bands,” which tells us the percentage of the Bitcoin supply that each group is holding right now. The different Age Bands denote the time period between which each UTXO (or simply, each coin) falling into said band was last moved. For example, the 6m-12m UTXO Age Band includes the part of the BTC supply that hasn’t been transferred since six to twelve months ago. In the context of the current topic, the Age Bands of interest are the 1m-3m and the 2y-3y groups. The first of these represents the short-term UTXOs (as they haven’t aged much yet), while the latter denotes the long-term UTXOs. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Add $1B More To Their Holdings Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both these Bitcoin UTXO Age Bands in the last several years: Looks like the two metrics have been approaching each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the 1m-3m Bitcoin UTXO Age Band has been declining recently, while the 2y-3y group has been observing a rise. If both the indicators continue going in the current trajectory, then they will soon meet and go through a crossover, where the long-term Age Band will overtake the short-term one. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Diamond Hands” Have Dumped 84.5k BTC Since FTX Collapse The quant has also highlighted the trends that followed in the price of BTC when such a pattern previously formed during the past few years. It seems like whenever this kind of crossover has taken place for the crypto, the price has gone onto see a significant rise in the long term. The significance of this cross is that it represents a shift in supply from short-term buyers (who are often weak hands) to the long-term holders (strong hands). It now remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin UTXO Age Bands will go on and complete the cross, and if the same trend as in history will follow now as well. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.5k, down 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 13% in value. The price of the coin seems to have recovered back above $16.5k during the last 24 hours | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-closing-in-on-bullish-crossover-relief-ahead/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/4686985.jpeg

The cryptocurrency is moving higher than more significant assets in the space, and it’s making its way to the top 10 by market capitalization. Related Reading: SUSHI Latest Feats Are Quite Impressive, But Crypto Must Overcome Rough Terrain The current market landscape and on-chain activity support a bullish thesis. As of this writing, Litecoin already overtook Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this ranking. LTC’s price is trading at $78 with 15% and 35% profits in the last 24 hours and the previous week, respectively. Litecoin On Track For Further Gains? Data from research firm Santiment indicates that prominent players have accumulated Litecoin over the previous two weeks. These players anticipated the current bullish momentum. The firm noted that addresses holding from 1,000 to 100,000 Litecoin accumulated over $40 million in the cryptocurrency over this period. Santiment pointed out the following while sharing the chart below: Litecoin’s price surge may have shocked some of you, but the large address accumulation has been the key to watch. In the past 2 weeks, addresses holding 1k to 100k $LTC accumulated $43.4M in coins en route to the first price jump above $80 since May. As the chart shows, the Litecoin accumulation trend has lost strength. Large LTC holders might take some profits at current levels before resuming their accumulation pattern. Additional data from Material Indicators point to substantial support for LTC’s price at $55 to $60. These areas should operate as critical support in case of a retrace. As seen in the chart below, Material Indicators and Santiment coincide with the buying pressure triggered by investors with bid orders of above $10,000. Retail investors have also been supporting the LTC price rally. Why Is Litecoin Likely To Trend Higher Several factors point towards further appreciation for Litecoin. First, the macroeconomic landscape is becoming more favorable for risk-on assets. Inflation in the U.S. dollar is declining, with economic growth following. This change might give the U.S. Federal Reserve room to pivot its monetary policy, allowing Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the crypto market to record more profits. The possibility of a Fed pivot is still far, but the market conditions are shifting after a long capitulation period for the nascent sector.

""A lot of Tesla's valuation is based on hype, it's based on sort of promise and potential, but it's based on this belief that Elon Musk can't fail,"" the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures told CNBC. ""All of a sudden, if he does fail, if he can't rescue Twitter, and it seems like he's having a pretty hard time doing so, what you have to worry about is if investors say, 'you know what, is Tesla a little bit of a house of cards?'"" Tusk added. TSLA edged higher on Tuesday and showed gains in Wednesday's premarket action, bouncing back from a string of declines that took the stock to a recent 52-week low. Early this week, shares of Musk's EV maker touched a 52-week low of $166.19. The stock, which set a 52-week high of $402.67 late last year, has fallen nearly 58% in 2022. The firm's market cap, which once topped $1T, is now sitting at around $530B. Looking at another of the major headlines that have dominated the conversation on Wall Street in recent weeks, Tusk also commented on the recent FTX ( FTT-USD ) situation. Tusk argued that the meltdown at Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange will cause many venture capitalists to step up their due diligence in the future. He specifically pointed to Sequoia Capital, which was closely tied to FTX and has apologized to investors for its involvement with the now-bankrupt company. ""Sequoia has significant egg on their face ... I suspect that on the next deal like this, they are going to do more diligence and be a little more careful about it,"" he said.

SEC: Lawyer Explains Why Nov 30 Is Crucial And Why A Settlement Is Possible,"While the crypto community has been eagerly focused on the developments surrounding Genesis Trading and Digital Currenc Group (DCG) over the past few days, Ripple Labs continues to battle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). And the next important deadlines are already looming. By November 30, both Ripple and the SEC have to file their summary judgment briefs, which will remain under seal for the time being. On December 02, the two parties will meet to jointly discuss the redactions for the court filings. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies 15%, Why Ripple Could Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum A few days later, on December 05, Ripple’s and the SEC’s briefs will be made public. Finally, on December 22, the omnibus motions to seal all documents related to the summary judgment motions will be filed. Lawyer Believes A Ripple / SEC Settlement Is Possible According to renowned Australian lawyer and crypto enthusiast Bill Morgan, November 30 could be an important date that sets the course for the outcome of the lawsuit. According to Morgan, the documents that will be made public on December 05 could be one of the most revealing documents of the trial. The Ripple reply may be one of the most telling documents filed in the case to date and certainly one of the top few I have eagerly awaited. Morgan believes, based on his experience as a mediator, that a settlement agreement between the SEC and Ripple is a real possibility. Further, he noted that a settlement agreement could be reached at any time, without the public’s knowledge. “[N]obody outside the parties will know until the parties say it has settled.” Related Reading: Genesis / DCG: All Cool Again? Bitcoin Investors Should Be Cautions According to the attorney, Ripple’s possession of records of Hinman’s speech provides it with strong leverage. In order to keep these documents secret and prevent a broader impact on overall crypto market regulation, the SEC may be forced to settle. When asked if the SEC might eventually be forced to make the Hinman documents public, Morgan said: Not necessarily if keeping the Hinman documents confidential is a term of settlement. That is why having them gives Ripple real leverage in settlement negotiations. We don’t know on what basis Ripple received them that does not allow them to be publicly revealed. Under the local rules under which I practise in Australia there is an implied undertaking not to publicly reveal documents disclosed by another party until put into evidence. Is Hinman The Stumbling Block For The SEC? Therefore, in Ripple’s brief, all eyes will be on whether or not the fintech company cites the Hinman documents as evidence. To the extent Ripple waives it, it could be a tell-tale sign of a settlement agreement. Already in mid-September, XRP community lawyer John Deaton had expressed a similar view. According to him, the Hinman documents are of key importance to Ripple. Deaton said then that if judge Torres rules that the documents must be released, the SEC’s delay tactics could run out of time by the end of the year, forcing a settlement.

The legislation makes New York the first state to partially ban PoW mining, a process that allows crypto miners to earn digital rewards by solving complex mathematical equations to authenticate transactions while using a hefty amount of computing power. The New York State Senate passed a PoW-targeted bill in June in an effort to address concerns about the high energy usage in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and thus its negative environmental impacts. Sustainable crypto miners (think of those that use Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms) likely cheered the eco-friendly legislation since more market share could open up for them. On the other hand, PoW miners have lobbied fiercely against the bill since it was passed by the State Assembly in May. “I will ensure that New York continues to be the center of financial innovation, while also taking important steps to prioritize the protection of our environment,” Hochul said , as quoted by The Wall Street Journal . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners, especially Core Scientific ( NASDAQ: CORZ ), Argo Blockchain ( NASDAQ: ARBK ) ( OTCQX:ARBKF ) and Iris Energy ( NASDAQ: IREN ), have been dealing with a tough mining environment as depressed BTC prices hurt revenue and a rise in energy prices increase costs, thus squeezing profitability. Miners: Riot Blockchain ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), Marathon Digital ( NASDAQ: MARA ), HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( NASDAQ: HIVE ), BIT Mining ( NYSE: BTCM ), Hut 8 Mining ( NASDAQ: HUT ), Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ), Bit Digital ( NASDAQ: BTBT ), CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ), Greenidge Generation ( NASDAQ: GREE ) and Soluna Holdings ( NASDAQ: SLNH ).

At this time of writing, CoinGecko is estimating a 24% increase in value, which is a 10% increase from where it was.

All in all, investors and traders have a lot to be optimistic about here. But the technicals of the coin suggest that the bullishness is fleeting, as it is being carried around by the present bear market. SUSHI Remains Stale Since its crash in May 2022, SUSHI’s price has barely moved. Also, the token has been trading between $2.083 and $0.861 for some time now. This coin, however, has been making higher highs and lower lows despite the bear market since the latter half of Q2 this year. The present price surge, however, is not only due to its recent successes, but also to the active development that Santiment has seen. Image: TradingView Recently, the team issued an update on its focused liquidity pool, which they claim would increase capital utilization efficiency. Related Reading: Polygon Poised For A Major Advance Next Year If MATIC Stays On This Course At present, the token’s long-term price action is a spreading triangle. This indicates an increase in volatility and a possible price reversal. This coincides with the expansion of the Bollinger band at the current market price. On shorter timelines, the present price has already made it past the middle band, but on a daily scale, the price is still below the middle band. While the regression channel partially confirms a possible reversal, below-neutral RSI readings impede this possibility. Chaikin’s money flow index, which currently stands at -0.12, likewise favors the bears. Caution Advised For Traders If the price continues to struggle and closes the day with a red candle, SUSHI may fall to $1.083 in value. If the bulls are unable to defend this price level, a further decline to $1.012 is possible. Sushi would likely be an excellent investment if market conditions were less unfriendly. With the EMA ribbon indicating that a short position is significantly more plausible, resistance at $1.375 will be greater despite SUSHI’s favorable circumstances. As the situation steadily improves, SUSHI appears to be an appealing investment for portfolio diversification.

4682698,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509842,1669210482,Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $1 Billion Worth Of Ethereum Amid High Sell-off,"The crypto market often runs on a cycle of highs and lows. Conscious investors leverage the lows to enrich their wallets with assets awaiting the bull run. This quarter’s bearish trend is no exception. The past few weeks in the crypto market have been filled with massive losses following the FTX collapse. The extreme macroeconomic conditions following the Fed’s interest rate hike are not helping matters. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $16,500 But Not In Safe Zone; Here Is Why Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, suffered multiple setbacks in the last weeks following the market decline. Ethereum slumped below $1,600 to $1,081, losing nearly 24% over the weekend. Ether whales took note of the bearish trend and accumulated over $1 billion worth of ETH while the price went below the support level. Whales Buy A Major Amount Of Ethereum According to Santiment, Ethereum whales accumulated nearly 947,940 ETH worth over $1 billion in the current market price. The “Percentage of Supply Held” data for Ethereum indicates the move as the most significant single-day whale accumulation in the last year. In previous accumulations, Ethereum’s price rose by an average of 3.2% against BTC. Bitcoin whale accumulations at support levels often trigger a bullish price reversal, but the opposite happened this time. This is because Ethereum still suffers the effect of the FTX contagion. The FTX collapse hit the cryptocurrency as the crypto exchange suffered ETH shortages, leading to insolvency. Former CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research transferred a large amount of ETH to the exchange to save the situation. However, the attempts failed as both firms filed for bankruptcy a few days later. The FTX hacker didn’t help, as he attacked the exchange’s accounts and carted away many assets. The account drainer later converted all the assets to Ethereum, raising speculations that the hacker’s wallet address belonged to an insider. However, days later, the hacker dumped all the stolen ETH for Bitcoin, causing further sell pressure on Ethereum. Two Largest Cryptocurrencies Fall To New Lows Given the unfortunate events, Ethereum price continued tanking amid the crisis down to the support levels before the whale accumulation. Ethereum now trades at $1,165 with gains. However, despite the massive loss, Ethereum has shown signs of recovery as its price added 2% in the last few hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself is not doing so well. Last Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency hit its four-month low at $17,656 after plunging 10%.

42413597,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA2xi,1669209300,Alameda-Backed Crypto Trading Firm 3Commas Says It’s Pretty Sure It Wasn’t Breached,"Over a dozen users of the crypto trading service 3Commas, which was backed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, say the platform leaked their credentials and enabled attackers to run away with over $6 million in user funds.  The platform’s CEO has called these allegations “false rumors,” stating that those who lost their funds have been phished – meaning they accidentally shared their credentials with an exploiter.  But in an interview with CoinDesk on Monday, 3Commas Deputy Chief Technology Officer Artem Koltsov walked back the company’s unequivocal claim that every user who lost money was the victim of phishing or input-stealing.  “The very disappointing thing here is that nothing can be told for sure,” said Koltsov. “We know that there is phishing out there. We know that anything could happen with those API keys. We're not happy about it.""  Neither side is able to prove its argument definitively: Just as 3Commas can’t state for certain that it was never the victim of a hack, its users can’t prove that they never accidentally shared their API keys.  But amid all the confusion, conflicting statements from 3Commas have invited more questions than answers.  What happened  3Commas, which is based in Estonia and calls itself the “largest automatic crypto trading platform,” claims in its Twitter bio that it processes $23 billion in monthly volume.  CoinDesk reported in September that it raised $37 million in Series B funding from Target Global, Jump Crypto and Alameda Research – the SBF-linked trading firm that imploded earlier this month along with Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  The bread and butter of 3Commas is its trading bots – programs that automatically execute trades for users on exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase and FTX.  In order for a 3Commas bot to execute trades on a platform like Coinbase, the user must give 3Commas an API key – secret credentials generated by the exchange which grant third-party platforms, like 3Commas, permission to trade on a user’s behalf.  Starting in October, several 3Commas users noticed that their accounts on Binance, Coinbase, FTX and OKX had been ransacked.  “I had an email from Coinbase saying, ‘Your account has been locked because of a security issue,’” recalled one 3Commas user, a U.K.-based entrepreneur, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I managed to go through their self-recovery process, which took about six hours. I got into the account and I could see that it’d been compromised.”  “There were dozens and dozens and dozens of trades,” the user said. “Basically, they used my API details to sell all of my assets into a low-cap, low-liquidity coin.” Altogether, this user says, he lost $200,000 to the exploit.  Over a dozen users claimed to have been the victims of similar attacks, which happened in waves throughout October and November.  In communications reviewed by CoinDesk, Help Desk agents at Binance and Coinbase confirmed to several users that their accounts had been drained by hackers via their 3Commas API keys.  After the first wave of attacks in mid-October, 3Commas published a blog post confirming that some of its users’ API keys had been stolen. According to the firm, the API keys had been used to steal over $6 million – a number that would have increased with subsequent attacks in November.  3Commas said that an internal investigation found no evidence, however, that its platform had been breached. Instead, the firm concluded that users must have inadvertently shared their API credentials with phishing websites.  “The most typical phishing scam, which was the case with the one under discussion today, involves impersonating a legitimate company via email or other means and getting the user to click on a cloned website that closely resembles the interface the user is familiar with but with a slightly different URL,” wrote 3Commas CEO Yuri Sorokin. “The user enters their log-in details, and then significant stress and pain are experienced by that user and the legitimate service they’re trying to interact with.”  Rumors of a 3Commas leak  Not everyone bought 3Commas' explanation for what happened, and rumors started to circulate online that 3Commas was using the story of a “phishing scam” to cover up an exploit.  Speculation of something more sordid grew louder on Nov. 14, when Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, referenced 3Commas in a tweet: “We [sic] seen at least 3 cases of users who shared their API key with 3rd party platforms (Skyrex and 3commas), and seen unexpected trading on their accounts. If you used such a platform before, I highly recommend you to delete your API keys just to be safe.”  Sorokin addressed the leak rumors in a Nov. 15 blog post titled, “RE: False Rumors of API Leaks or Exposure of our Database.” At the top of the post, he reiterated that “3Commas traders are safe.”  As for the rumor that the platform had been breached, Sorokin called it “a completely baseless accusation being floated by individuals on social media who don’t understand how API key encryption actually works.”  This particular statement rubbed several 3Commas users who’d lost funds the wrong way. Users who believe their credentials had been leaked by the firm organized themselves into a Telegram group. Many in the 18-person group claimed to be seasoned crypto users, and at least two identified as software engineers.  All of those with whom CoinDesk spoke insisted they found no 3Commas phishing sites in their browser histories.  Group members with whom CoinDesk spoke say they also took added precautions – like bookmarking the official 3Commas site and configuring two-factor authentication to secure their accounts.  Phishing scams typically work by tricking users into copying and pasting sensitive credentials onto a spoof site.  One Turkish engineer who lost $300,000 to the 3Commas API incident said that he connected his Binance exchange account to 3Commas using a “Fast API” service. According to Binance, the Fast API service removes the copy-paste step entirely – it would have connected 3Commas to Binance without requiring the user to manually input his API code.  If this user never manually pasted API credentials anywhere, as he claims in the Telegram group, it is less clear how he could have been phished.  “[3Commas has] known about this for up to a month and they could have taken more decisive action,” the U.K. entrepreneur told CoinDesk. “They have put out blog posts without any direct warnings, and all of the warnings are the party line that customers have been phished for their API details. But their claim just doesn't stand up.”  Members of the “3Commas Leak Issue” group have begun to flood the company’s Discord server, Twitter page, and Telegram groups with questions, requests for more transparency, and allegations that the platform has acted dishonestly.  3Commas, for its part, banned some disgruntled users from its Discord and has started closing down Telegram chats circulating rumors that the platform was breached. “We are now obliged to close Telegram group chats as we can see that some members proving [sic] the misleading and false information, which is a criminal offence,” Sorokin tweeted.  Setting the record straight  As users continue to hound 3Commas with questions, the firm appears to be backing off its assertion that phishing was the only explanation for how users lost their funds.  In a Nov. 18 tweet, 3Commas’ first stance was unequivocal: “Over the past month, there have been multiple incidents of unauthorized trades on partner exchanges. We’ve identified that these users’ API keys were accessed through a variety of phishing and input-stealing methods.”  To back up its claim that the attack was the result of phishing rather than a leak, 3Commas posted screenshots to its blog showing that dozens of spoofed versions of its site had proliferated in recent weeks. Several of these phishing sites were apparently promoted to the top of Google above the real 3Commas site – a disappointingly common tactic in the world of crypto-phishing scams.  But in his interview with CoinDesk later this week, Kortsov was more circumspect about what actually happened. “We cannot be 100% sure. We definitely know that there are phishing sites out there. But also, whenever you ask the user, most of them will say … ‘I have never dropped my keys anywhere’” As for the denials from users, “there’s no way to check it at all,” said Kortsov.  The 3Commas API saga is ongoing.

In the meantime, they said, “Only a miniscule fraction of users reported abnormal activity to 3Commas. 99.9% of the API keys stored in 3Commas database have not been impacted by the attacks.”  But the legal team, like Koltsov, stopped short of making blanket claims that users were phished.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said Block Earner offered a range of fixed-yield earning products based on crypto assets, according to a statement from the commission Wednesday. The products should have been licensed because they are a managed investment scheme, leaving ""consumers without important protections,"" it said.  “Although we understand the backdrop, this is a disappointing outcome,"" said Block Earner co-founder and CEO Charlie Karaboga in a statement to Business News Australia. Karaboga said since inception, customers' funds have been protected against events like the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX and that a lack of regulatory clarity ""creates friction between regulators and innovators."" The company, which has backing from crypto exchange Coinbase, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  The case isn't the first time ASIC has targeted the crypto industry. Last month, it sued BPS Financial, the company behind the qoin digital token, for running misleading ads.  ""Simply because a product hinges on a crypto asset, does not mean it falls outside financial services law,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said in the statement. The regulator is seeking declarations, injunctions and pecuniary penalties. A hearing has not yet been scheduled.  Michael Bacina, a partner at law firm Piper Alderman, said the alarm around such financial products had already been sounded in the past few months. “Crypto products offering a percentage return are on a high risk of being seen to be a financial investment or managed investment scheme, even if they are structured as a loan arrangement,” he said.

42420790,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH4n,1669206600,Anxious Ethereum Stakers Question When They’ll Be Able to Access Funds,"Rumors emerged on Twitter last week claiming that the Ethereum Foundation is pushing back its timeline for staked ether (ETH) to be withdrawn from the Beacon Chain. In these volatile times for the crypto industry, when many services including FTX, BlockFi, and Genesis have halted crypto withdrawals and appear to be collapsing, it’s understandable that stakers would be suspicious of any perceived delays in accessing their funds.  So what is going on?  Ethereum core developers generally agree that the aim was always for staked ETH withdrawals to be opened up as part of “Shanghai,” the next upgrade on its development road map.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  But a definitive date for withdrawals? That hasn’t been set yet. Ethereum core developers have always been hesitant to ink in a date for the upgrade. After all, implementing any hard fork upgrade is not a simple task. Before the code gets shipped, it will have to run through tests, and developers will have to debug any problems in the implementation.  Anyone who has been following Ethereum at any point in its seven-year history knows the protocol is notorious for being perpetually behind schedule and for pushing deadlines farther and farther into the future.  Read more: Why Ethereum’s ‘Difficulty Bomb’ Has Been Delayed Again  Ethereum retired its old model, proof-of-work, which used miners to add new blocks of transactions to the ledger. Since the Merge on Sept. 15, the blockchain has adopted a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which uses validators to approve those blocks instead.  Validators began staking 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain prior to the Merge in order to participate in the block validation process: Part of the deal was that all that staked ether and any accrued rewards would remain locked up in the Beacon Chain smart contract until the next upgrade, which would happen at some point after the Merge.  That upgrade, Shanghai, is expected to include the mechanism by which those rewards will be released. There was a projected implementation for six to 12 months after the Merge, according to the Ethereum Foundation website. But last week followers noticed the language had changed: The Foundation website no longer had a proposed timeframe.  Tim Beiko, lead protocol support at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), told CoinDesk the original projection of “six to 12 months is the ‘historical average’ time between upgrades on Ethereum. I don’t see why this upgrade would take longer, but we’re not far enough in the process to talk about main net deployment dates.”  This change in language, even if it is innocuous, isn’t sitting well with ETH stakers right now. They want to know exactly when they will be able to access their funds, and the lack of specifics seems to be making them nervous.  ""I don’t track daily changes to Ethereum.org (which has contributions by hundreds of people, not just the EF), but there hasn’t been any change to Withdrawals’ status: They are included in the next network upgrade, as can be seen in the specs for both the execution and consensus layer,” said Beiko.  Ethereum developers say they are committed to making withdrawals a priority for Shanghai. “There’s always discussions about timelines and moving things around, but I don't think there’s ever been more consensus among core devs to move withdrawals back. It has and will always be included in the next fork,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk. “I don’t see a scenario in which withdrawals don't get shipped in the next fork.”  More to Shanghai than staking?  The Shanghai upgrade is the next in a long series of hard forks that are shaping the Ethereum ecosystem. And it is not necessarily a single-issue upgrade.  While staked ETH withdrawals seem to be universally agreed upon to be included in Shanghai, there are other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) that are under consideration for inclusion. For example, EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, could be a first step toward making the network more scalable through sharding, a method that splits up the network into other databases, or “shards,” as a way to increase its capacity and bring down gas fees.  But developers are still unsure whether proto-danksharding will be included in Shanghai or in a subsequent upgrade. They are collecting data now to see how difficult it is to implement EIP-4844.  “I think if EIP-4844 seems too difficult to achieve, we'll split it into a simple withdrawals fork + a bigger 4844 fork later in the year. Currently, our aim is to try and ship both together, pending data collection,” Jayanthi said.  At this week’s upcoming All Core Developers call, Ethereum developers are likely to decide which EIPs, including EIP-4844, make it into Shanghai. Then, once that decision is made, all the Shanghai EIPs will go through a rigorous testing process to make sure that the upgrade is ready for mainnet.  Progress on that front is already underway. In October, Shanghai’s testnet, Shandong, went live. There, developers will have opportunities to ensure that the new code is secure and working properly.

Bitcoin Investors Should Be Cautious,"The Bitcoin price plunged to a new bear market low at $15,487 on Monday after rumors intensified that Genesis Trading and Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns Grayscale with its 635,000 BTC strong GBTC, would go bankrupt. Since then, the Bitcoin price is recording a relief rally. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $16.598 and faced the crucial resistance zone at $16,000. If this resistance is overcome, a quick candle towards $17,500 to $18,000 could be on the table. DCG/Genesis Safe? Bitcoin investors, however, might be asking themselves what has changed in the whole misery surrounding Genesis / DCG and Grayscale? DCG CEO Barry Silbert released a putative letter to investors yesterday. In it, the CEO explained that while DCG owes $575 million to its own trading arm, Genesis Trading, it is not due until May 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $16,500 But Not In Safe Zone; Here Is Why Silbert also emphasized that DCG will have revenues of $800 million in 2022. While this represents a decline of about 20% from the previous year, Silbert said that revenues should still be sufficient to pay Genesis. Further, the DCG CEO also confirmed the the company owes Genesis $1.1 billion on a promissory note that matures in June 2032 and is related to the Three Arrows Capital default. “Genesis leadership and their board decided to hire financial and legal advisors, and the firm is exploring all possible options amidst the fallout from the implosion of FTX,” Silbert affirmed in his letter, adding that “we will let you know if we decide to do a financing round.” Related Reading: Bitcoin At $1M By 2030: Why Cathie Wood Remains Confident In Bold Bet The letter seems to have calmed the market. However, Crypto-Twitter is still puzzling over possible scenarios around how DCG can overcome its precarious financial situation.

VC/Attorney that has seen @DCGco data room per cap raise: “Current valuations are way off, liabilities dwarf assets… nearly impossible to not see a DCG bankruptcy shortly after Genesis.” — Andrew (@AP_ArchPublic) November 22, 2022 Parish accuses DCG of bluffing and claims that Silbert’s note was not sent to investors. He claims to have heard from several investors and creditors of DCG and Genesis: This wasn’t sent to us first, we didn’t see it until it was posted online/twitter. It’s all optics to soften a Genesis bankruptcy for DCG… and lawsuits that will follow. An All-Good Solution? Parish also dismissed Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis’ supposed “solution”. Selkis suggested that some of the Genesis creditors could convert their claims into DCG preferred or debt and warrants (“the Buffett-Goldman deal”), “potentially led by a reputable debt or growth fund”. There’s a lot of things that led to this mess, but the current situation seems salvageable. I have no stake in this directly, just want to see a good resolution, and there’s not much time. Parish countered that DCG and Genesis “have yet to have any meaningful dialogue with Genesis creditors,” as he was told by supposedly major investors. So what’s the deal?

This can be summed up in a response to a commenter on the announcement’s Twitter post: How is this different from luna’s UST — Moche (@mocheswap) November 21, 2022 This is reflected in the price fluctuations of ADA. The regressive tendency indicates that holders will endure additional suffering. At the present price of $0.3160, a decline to $0.2985 is possible. However, the Money flow index appears to contradict a value of 60, indicating a possible reversal. Correlation also contradicts the regression pattern, since ADA’s significant correlation (0.94) with a rising BTC will undoubtedly be beneficial. Unquestionably Still Bearish However, RSI values remain neutral. With the price action establishing a double bottom, however, a decline below $0.2985 remains probable. An coming Bollinger band crunch zone will also threaten an additional bullish recovery. The announcement is welcomed with enthusiasm and anticipation by the community. However, the cryptospace’s past experiences and the current bear market provide a formidable obstacle for investors and traders. With bearishness evident on the daily and shorter timelines, this price increase could be a precursor to more declines.

In September, the Ethereum network switched its algorithm from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), doing away with the need for computation-heavy mining in favor of a process called validating.  Ethereum miners have since had to find new ways to make money using their graphics processing units (GPU). Tokens such as ethereum classic (ETC), ravencoin and beam (BEAM) have seen a big influx of former Ethereum miners looking for a new use for their GPUs. Computing power on the Ravencoin network has grown about fivefold since before Ethereum's switch to PoS, data from Coinwarz shows.  However, as miners flock to a token, a mechanism known as mining difficulty kicks in, which makes it less likely they will win rewards. Thus, the ones with less efficient machines or high costs are eventually crowded out.  Binance Pool will be charging 1% fees for its RVN pool.  In October, Binance Pool launched a $500 million fund to lend to distressed miners amid a market downturn that has seen many of them struggle to pay off their debts.

BTC’s price continues to look strong as bearish sentiment for the market lingers, with things looking uncertain for most traders and investors. BTC’s price bounces from a low of $15,500 on the daily timeframe as the price moves in a range below the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) With many looking for a major dump in Bitcoin (BTC) price, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) bounced from $15,500 as price rallied to a high of $16,500, leaving bears on the sidelines. The price action displayed by Bitcoin (BTC) in recent times has yet to be encouraging after its erratic price movement, leading to the price of many altcoins, including Bitcoin (BTC), battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors involved has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well, rallying from a low of $19,200 to a high of $21,600 (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Remains Capped, Why 100 SMA Is The Key Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days haven’t been the best of times for most crypto traders and investors, with many becoming worried as to where the market could be headed after so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength, losing their key support in a bid to survive. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The price of BTC saw its price traded in a region of $15,500 on the weekly chart, but the price bounced from this region to a rally high of $16,500, showing some great strength. The price of BTC needs to break above $18,500 for more signs of relief. If BTC prices fail, this could be a bear trap and lead to more downward price movement. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $18,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,500. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $16,500 support after bouncing off from the region of $15,500, leading to the price forming a bullish divergence for price. If the price of BTC breaks above $18,500, we could see more rallies for BTC price to a region of $19,500-$20,000; a break below a region of $15,500 would be a bear trap as the price could go lower. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $18,500. Daily support for the BTC price – $16,500-$15,500.

The Onyx Digital Assets network uses tokens for short-term trading in fixed income markets, enabling investors to lend assets for a period of hours without them leaving their balance sheets.  Trades on the repurchase – also known as ""repo"" – market are for the most part backed by government bonds, making it a vital source of source of collateral for banks to fund their balance sheets.  The aim of the Onyx network is to allow banks to settle such transactions in a matter of hours, as opposed to the one or two working day-period it has taken historically.  Over $300 billion of intraday repo deals have been carried out on Onyx since JPMorgan launched it in 2020.

Here we’ll share our insights on the growth, key developments and outlook in this space, as well as how we arrived at our base case. Blockchain bridges allow the exchange of assets, messages, data, and, most importantly, users. In our base case, we value the bridging sector to be worth $174B by 2030. The blockchain bridge space is the final frontier in applied blockchain technology. Bridges are gateways that allow the exchange of assets, messages, data and, most importantly, users . While they are the source of tremendous controversy amid billions in hacks , bridges have also been used to great strategic effect. Chains like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) have employed bridges to jumpstart their blockchains by onboarding hundreds of thousands new users and billions of dollars in assets in the span of just a few weeks . Based on our discounted cash flow analysis, our base case is that the blockchain bridging sector will be worth $174.1B by 2030. Here we’ll share our insights on the growth, key developments and outlook in this space, as well as how we arrived at our base case. Blockchain Bridging Goals Bridges may present tremendous perils but also high potential rewards to users, investors, applications and entire ecosystems. Because bridges collect tolls on the information shared between blockchains, they stand to benefit enormously in an environment where economic activity is fragmented across many ecosystems. With $54.2B in assets spread across more than a dozen major smart contract platforms, we live in a multi-chain world. Blockchains are closed loop systems of value, which means assets are mostly restricted to their native blockchains. The result is that asset prices and asset liquidity vary across ecosystems. Even interest rates for the same asset, within the same application, differ depending upon where they reside. A successful set of blockchain bridges could immediately create higher capital efficiency in DeFi by harmonizing rates according to a more transparent set of variables. Borrowing Rates on Aave ( AAVE-USD ) USDC Rates USDT Rates DAI Rates Protocol Borrow Lend Borrow Lend Borrow Lend Arbitrum 1.45% 0.45% 3.22% 2.24% 1.76% 0.57% Avalanche 2.26% 1.01% N/A 2.76% 2.48% 1.09% Optimism 2.93% 1.70% N/A 2.20% 3.28% 1.89% Polygon 2.46% 1.22% 2.57% 1.72% 2.54% 1.19% (Source: Aave, as of 11/01/2022) One major goal of bridging infrastructure is to unify the various blockchain asset markets, much in the same way stock exchanges are connected through electronic trading, to make capital truly interchangeable and transferable. To achieve this goal, bridges (or centralized exchanges, or stablecoin issuers) must implement safe blockchain-to-blockchain asset transfer methods, while reducing the complexity and time spent utilizing bridging applications. The end state should offer a user experience defined by a few clicks, whose safety matches the level of the bridged blockchains. Ultimately, a user should not even have to understand the route that the assets take to perform a desired function nor even which blockchains are being used. If bridges are able to surmount their considerable safety issues and their technology is aptly applied, bridges may render blockspace a commodity. Blockchain Bridge Security Key to Growth Despite the massive market opportunity, bridges struggle with serious safety issues that have prevented them for reaching their full potential. Due to hacks, more than $2B in funds have been lost in the last year alone. Thus, notable figures such as Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin continue to raise concerns about bridge safety. Because bridge designs and implementations are cutting-edge and because bridges hold large amount of funds, they are prime targets for hacking attacks. However, the potential value of a successful bridge, combined with the greenfield design space, has spawned over a hundred bridge projects. The bridge space today resembles that of the early-era crypto exchanges, where many competitors battled for early market share amid uncertainty over safety, practicality and functionality. As a result, the bridging space is one of the most highly fragmented components of the blockchain infrastructure layer. The presence of so many bridges is simply a transitionary period, in our view. If and when safer, more versatile bridges prove themselves, we believe economic activity is likely to consolidate around a few winners. One of the chief reasons is that each bridge creates its own synthetic assets similar to Liquid Staking synthetic assets. Synthetic asset integration in DeFi drives network effect feedback loops that favor one version of a synthetic asset over others. This is similar to traditional finance, where U.S. Treasury Futures are created by many venues, but the vast majority of usage revolves around CME derivatives. As a result, the top bridge projects will build competitive moats through superior safety, simple user experience, deep application integration and the wide proliferation of their synthetic assets. Improving Blockchain Bridge Implementation and Design Due to the infancy of bridge construction and their enormous complexity, bridge security is difficult to assess by even the most seasoned smart contract developers. Bridges must mathematically prove the recent transaction history of different blockchains, translate that proof data for each blockchain to understand, lock assets, and then safely route and communicate verification of the whole process between blockchains. Each of those steps introduces a new component to the tech stack - often a brand-new design - that represents a potential point of bridge failure or hacker attack. In the highly adversarial nature of blockchain, this is akin to airlines flying passengers on never-before-tested airframes using brand new engine types. Generalized Bridging Framework (VanEck Research, as of 10/30/2022) Bridge implementation will improve as lessons are applied, and bridge development will likely mirror the security improvements seen in DeFi smart contracts. Over time, the best bridge designs will progressively decentralize while also reducing trust assumptions. At the moment, most bridges employ third-party computer node networks to verify bridged blockchains, authenticate transactions and safeguard locked value. While some of these networks approach the level of sophistication of a layer-1 blockchain, nearly all suffer from trust design flaws that rely upon the integrity of these third-party networks. For many bridges, an attack where a simple majority of a bridge’s nodes are compromised means that the attacker can seize all bridge funds or even mint fraudulent assets. In the bridging space, the securest designs mitigate this hazard by relying only upon the trust assumptions of the blockchains being bridged - the security of the two connecting blockchains rather than a third-party network. The closest to a “trustless” roll-up bridge, such as the bridge between a Layer-2 on Ethereum and Ethereum, is Cosmos’ ( ATOM-USD ) IBC , which currently only serves to connect Cosmos blockchains. Though several projects claim to employ IBC technology, the only one that approximates the security of IBC is Composable Finance (PICA), which we discuss in further detail below. Level of Trust Assumption (VanEck Research, as of 10/30/2022) How We Arrived at Our Bridging Base Case In our base case, we value the bridging sector to be worth $174.1B by 2030, based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. Discounting that back to today’s dollars at 27%, we arrive at a valuation of $25.7B. This represents approximately 8.75% of our estimate of smart contract layer blockchains at $2T. Our estimate is based upon a discounted cash flow valuation with a 30.8x exit multiple, a terminal annual cash flow of $5.66B and a terminal growth rate of GDP+20%. Bridge revenue is composed of two major components: toll fees and maximal extractable value (MEV). We derive these components by estimating their share of projected blockchain revenue and total value locked (TVL). However, as the space matures, there may be dramatic evolution in how fees are assessed and which party pays those fees as the bridges’ customer focus evolves from the consumer to the blockchains and application (from B2C to B2B). Controversially, we believe bridges will play a roll in MEV because they route assets and messages across chains to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Bridges may even integrate directly into the MEV technical stack to bid on blockspace.

In general, we find that the bridging space is currently unfavorable to token investment compared with layer 1 smart contact protocols and other more proven decentralized applications. Simply put, there is still too much competition and uncertainty over safety and tokenomics. While bridges have sought many avenues of differentiation, the top-tier projects currently distinguish themselves by capability, TVL, safety record and fee structure. On those features, no project has achieved a strong moat. Since the design space is immature and no bridge has achieved great user traction nor application integration, we expect numerous projects to deploy over the next year. Blockchain Bridge Projects to Watch Comparing some of the available options, Multichain (MULTI) and Synapse (SYN) are consistently generating fees through high usage, but poor token distribution, weak token value accrual and lack of transparency make their projects difficult to value. LayerZero’s Stargate Finance ((STG)) token offers clear value accrual and favorable tokeconomics, but its value is tied to the Stargate Finance application utilizing the bridge, rather than the bridge itself. Wormhole has strong user metrics and a stellar team, but it already suffered a major disastrous hack and currently does not have a token. Axelar ((AXL)), while boasting a token that will attract demand and offering exceptional tooling for developers, also retains an initial unfavorable token distribution and substantial near-term token supply unlocks. Though Composable Finance offers favorable tokeconomics through a community-focused distribution and a token value accrual mechanism that mirrors Polkadot ( DOT-USD ), the project has been delayed to expand its vision and has yet to launch. Despite to our concerns, we see potential opportunities in Axelar and Composable Finance , with the latter being particularly interesting, if it can deliver on even part of its stated goals. Axelar looks strong over the medium term, once token unlocks occur, because its bridge is well-positioned in the Cosmos ecosystem with numerous asset integrations in the most important Cosmos DEXes and its strong partnerships with projects like USDC ( USDC-USD ) and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ). On the other hand, Composable Finance has tremendous potential due to a top-notch team that accomplishes impressive technical feats , utilizes the most trustless bridge design, and boasts high-utility, integrated applications. For those who wish to “bridge” into the realm of the “well-informed digital asset investor,” the bridging space demands their attention. While rife with security issues, bridges represent a developing and essential part of the blockchain technical stack that could be the source of enormous value. It will also be important for the knowledgeable investor to apply their findings in bridging to the broader debate of centralized versus decentralized custodianship, the future of user interaction with blockchains and “ownership” of the user. While users can move assets between blockchains using self-custody wallets and permissionless protocols, they can also simply employ a centralized entity like Coinbase ( COIN ) to exchange and hold assets. In fact, the Coinbase application already uses a frontend that connects to backend bridges to transfer assets to different blockchains. In the future, Coinbase may simply employ its own centralized database and deep pool of liquidity to provide users the ability to swap assets across chains. Coinbase could even influence users to employ the Coinbase application to interact with blockchains through a “walled garden” approach utilizing a semi-self-custody wallet and white-listed (Coinbase Ventures-backed) dApps. This paradigm would clearly threaten not only bridges but other applications as well, as Coinbase dominates the entire user journey from fiat on-ramp to custody to protocol usage. It is also worth considering that Circle (USDC creator) has recently unveiled its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol , which would utilize the technology of a group of vetted bridging projects for cross-chain USDC usage. This new program allows complete USDC interchangeability across different blockchains using approved bridges. In this dynamic, bridges that meet a certain safety threshold would be approved to transfer USDC. The safety of the bridged USDC tokens would then be reinforced by Circle’s centralized USDC database that tracks movement across blockchains as USDC is “burned” on one chain to be “minted” on another. The consequence of this decision means that bridge assets, at least USDC, can no longer be the source of bridge differentiation but also provides guaranteed traffic for bridges from arbitrageurs. At the same time, this would allow users to quickly and safely bring value to connected blockchains to quickly resolve asset price and interest rate differentials, contributing to a unified blockchain financial system. Paradoxically, bridge projects like Synapse are deploying true multi-chain assets, called xAssets , to enable canonical tokens of multi-chain applications, like Sushi ( SUSHI-USD ), to be seamlessly deployed across multiple chains. The concept of xAssets would provide applications the ability to tap into users of other blockchains more easily, while also providing bridges with a point of differentiation and guaranteed usage. If successful, concepts like xAssets could enable applications to offload assets, execution and settlement to any blockchain of their choosing, if blockspace becomes too expensive on one blockchain.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of cryptocurrencies.

42413610,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA374,1669191991,Ethereum Name Service Selects Karpatkey DAO to Manage Its Endowment Fund,"The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has chosen a new fund manager to take charge in managing its treasury in the wake of crypto winter.  In a vote that opened last Wednesday, Nov. 17, and closed on Tuesday evening, Nov. 22, community members selected Karpatkey DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) fund management organization originally incubated through Gnosis DAO.  Karpatkey received 1.76 million votes. Notable addresses that picked Karpatkey include ENS co-founder Alex Van de Sande (avsa.eth), founder of Rotkiapp Lefteris Karapetsas (lefteris.eth) and ENS steward Griff Green (griff.eth), who altogether had a voting power of 468K ENS.  “None of the above” came in second place with 1.3 million votes.  Now that the community has chosen Karpatkey, the treasury management firm in collaboration with Steakhouse Financial, going forward, will manage the bulk of ENS’s treasury composed of mostly USDC and ETH. With more than two years of experience, Karpatkey currently boasts over $397 million of non-custodial assets under management, excluding ENS.  The goal of the endowment fund, called ENS Endaoment, is to create a sustainable fund that can fuel continuous development regardless of macroeconomics conditions that may adversely affect revenue stemming from ENS registrations and renewals. Talks of the ENS Endaoment were happening as early as March before the crises related to Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, according to Nicholas Johnson, one of three directors for the ENS Foundation, and Mona El Isa, CEO and founder of Avantgarde, one of the potential fund managers up for consideration.  Karpatkey said in its proposal, “The funds would be managed transparently and completely on-chain through a non-custodial solution … The core of Karpatkey’s non-custodial solution relies on the most battle-tested tooling to manage DAO treasuries: a proxy Management Safe and the Zodiac Roles Modifier.”  Zodiac, developed by Gnosis Guild, is “a collection of tools built according to an open standard” as said on its Github page, while Safe, securing close to $40 billion in all its Ethereum contracts, is one of the most popular ways to custody digital assets in a decentralized manner.  $52 million is the initial size of Karpatkey’s proposal for the ENS Endaoment and $69 million with a projected return of 5.83% is the final stage of Karpatkey’s proposal. “The strategy would use low-risk, medium complexity DeFi strategies such as providing liquidity to automated market makers.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Karpatkey’s business development manager who goes by ""DeFi Foodie"" on Twitter, said, “It’s been a great exchange that has been in the forum, on the diversity of voices, how everybody could just give their opinion openly. And that’s been really healthy for ENS DAO because people can just speak their minds and have civil exchanges. When the forum asks questions [and] challenge[s] points, I think that’s something that is rich for the community and favorable.”  El Isa told CoinDesk that if a fund manager endorses a non-custodial, completely transparent solution, such as Enzyme, Avantgarde's proposal choice for a decentralized asset & treasury management protocol, for the ENS Endaoment, it “would be the first example of something being run completely on-chain”, where a FTX or Bernie Madoff situation “wouldn’t be possible.""

The cryptocurrency's outperformance perhaps stems from an impending positive change in its supply dynamics.  CoinDesk data shows LTC has rallied over 43% from $55 to $79 this month, with prices rising 28% in the past 24 hours alone. Market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have dropped 19% and 26% this month.  LTC's bullish turn comes eight months ahead of Litecoin's third mining reward halving – a programmed code that will reduce rewards or LTC paid to miners for recording transactions on Litecoin's blockchain from 12.5 LTC per block to 6.25 LTC per block.  To crypto natives, LTC's latest rally may be reminiscent of the bearish-to-bullish trend change seen in the months leading up to the previous halvings, dated Aug. 26, 2015, and Aug. 5, 2019.  LTC bottomed out, broke out of prolonged downtrends and led bitcoin higher in the run-up to the 2015 and 2019 halvings. Traders in crypto and traditional markets typically tend to be forward-looking and price in bullish/bearish events in advance.  And they might be at it again.

ETH could rise further, but upsides might face hurdles near $1,200 and $1,230. Ethereum started an upside correction from the $1,070 and $1,080 support levels. The price is now trading above $1,120 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,140 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could rise further towards $1,200 or even $1,230 in the near term. Ethereum Price Recovers Ethereum price remained well bid near the last swing low at $1,070, similar to bitcoin. ETH formed a base above the $1,070 and $1,080 levels before it started an upside correction. There was a decent recovery wave above the $1,120 and $1,140 resistance levels. Ether price jumped above the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $1,232 swing high to $1,073 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,140 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price is now trading above $1,120 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,170 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $1,232 swing high to $1,073 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,200 level. A clear break above the $1,200 resistance could send the price towards the $1,230 resistance zone. Any more gains might open the doors for a test of the $1,300 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,200 resistance, it could start another decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,150 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $1,120 level, below which ether price may perhaps decline further. In the stated scenario, the price could decline towards the $1,070 support zone in the near term. Any more losses might call for a move towards the main $1,000 support in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin regained its grip over $16K after dipping to a two-year low earlier in the week.  Insights: Changpeng Zhao and Elon Musk have been pointed in recent comments about FTX and the rapidly growing fallout. Did they go too far?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 814.88 +15.8 ▲ 2.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,187 +399.0 ▲ 2.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,129 +28.9 ▲ 2.6% S&P 500 daily close  4,003.58 +53.6 ▲ 1.4% Gold  $1,741 +3.2 ▲ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.76% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Recovered From Its Monday Slumber  By James Rubin  Bitcoin awakened from an early-week slumber to rest snugly above its previous $16,000 support.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading about $16,200, up 2.5% as crypto markets returned to tracking stocks, which rose on renewed hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy was taming inflation and that it would soon be able to retrench from its recent diet of 75 basis point interest rate hikes.  ""Wall Street is mostly green today and that has provided a little boost for cryptos,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.  BTC sunk to a two-year low on Monday amid fears over the fate of Genesis Global, a once-mighty crypto trading and lending firm, that is reportedly in talks to raise fresh capital after it halted customer withdrawals last week. Genesis is the latest victim of the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, and despite Tuesday's bitcoin recovery, investors remained jittery. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  ""Bitcoin is back above the $16,000 level but still remains in the danger zone as everyone waits for the next crypto domino to fall,"" Moya wrote. ""It seems crypto traders are already pricing in a bankruptcy for crypto lender Genesis. Contagion for FTX will impact many but it seems a fresh catalyst is needed for sellers to take control.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,120, up more than 2%. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, with LINK gaining almost 7%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was roughly flat.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each jumped over a percentage point after Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said the Fed was entering ""a restrictive stance of policy.""  At that point, I think it makes sense that we can slow down a bit the ... pace of increases,” she said. “We’re still going to raise the funds rate, but we’re at a reasonable point now where we can be very deliberate in setting monetary policy.”  Meanwhile, in crypto news, a well-known crypto trader linked to last month’s $114 million Mango Markets exploit failed in his attempt to find a similar vulnerability. The trader, identified on Twitter and tagged by blockchain analysts as Avraham Eisenberg, borrowed 40 million curve (CRV) tokens (worth $20 million at the time) using the decentralized lending platform Aave, then transferred them to the OKEx crypto exchange.  But after a series of wild swings in the CRV price, Eisenberg's position appears to have been liquidated. According to the blockchain analysis firm Arkham, Eisenberg borrowed the majority of CRV tokens on Aave by pledging $40 million in USDC stablecoin as collateral. Blockchain sleuths on Twitter speculated that he appeared to be building up a CRV short position – that is, to profit off a price decline.  Oanda's Moya was less than sanguine about crypto pricing in the weeks ahead. ""Bitcoin has support ahead of the $15,500 level but if that does not hold, technical selling could send prices toward the $13,500 region,"" he wrote. ​  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +7.5% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +7.4% Computing Cosmos ATOM +5.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Did Changpeng Zhao and Elon Go Too Far?  By James Rubin  What do billionaires and multimillionaires say about crypto?  Anything they want.  On Tuesday crypto exchange Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao add his voice to the chorus of crypto observers doubting that Grayscale, operator of the largest bitcoin trust, holds as much BTC as it says. But he then made a quick retreat.  Zhao initially tweeted numbers that, had they been true, would have undermined a position held by Grayscale and its partner, crypto exchange Coinbase, that such concerns were unwarranted. But he deleted his tweet after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong appeared to respond soon after on Twitter.  ""If you see FUD out there – remember, our financials are public (we're a public company),"" Armstrong wrote, referring to crypto parlance for fear, uncertainty and doubt. (Binance is a privately held company that doesn't disclose financial information.)  Zhao appeared contrite: ""Brian Armstrong just told me"" the numbers ""are wrong,"" he wrote, adding: ""Let’s work together to improve transparency in the industry."" (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  The Twitter interaction between CZ and Armstrong preceded a story by Semafor, a recent publication founded by Bloomberg and New York Times veterans, that Elon Musk wasn't always as down on the disgraced founder of troubled crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, as he's been in recent comments.  On Nov. 12, a day after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Musk said in a Twitter Spaces event: “To be honest, I’d never heard of him,” Musk said. “But then I got a ton of people telling me [that] he’s got, you know, huge amounts of money that he wants to invest in the Twitter deal. And I talked to him for about half an hour. And I know my bulls**t meter was redlining. It was like, this dude is bulls**t – that was my impression.”  But shortly after announcing his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter, Musk had invited Bankman-Fried to sink a $100 million stake he owned in the previously publicly traded company. And as Semafor reported, the two even had a phone call in late spring weeks before the deal closed about Bankman-Fried possibly joining a bid for Twitter. Bankman-Fried elected not to participate but contributed his $100 million in stock toward a now privately held company. An FTX balance sheet prepared after Musk closed on his deal, and circulated to investors earlier this month, listed Twitter shares as an “illiquid” asset.

Despite the bears’ dominance this year, many in the cryptocurrency industry see 2023 as the final chapter following a period of uncertainty. A quick rundown of MATIC: – MATIC down at $0.843512 – TradingShot analysts show that MATIC follows ETH price closely with a rejection by the 50-day MA – 2023 not likely to bring a strong rally for MATIC by Shelby3 According to TradingShot, MATIC’s price action is difficult to ignore because it mirrors Ethereum’s price action from 2016 to 2017. We all know that an investment’s past success is no indicator of its future success, but let’s see what this is about anyhow. Related Reading: Chainlink Rally In Social Activity Hits ATH Of 44,173 – Will LINK Price Climb As Well? What’s In Store For MATIC In 2023 Based on the data, it is clear that MATIC has been following in ETH’s footsteps throughout 2016 and 2017. Both were rejected at the 50-day moving average, a critical level because it was this situation that finally pushed the ETH bulls out of the bear market. TradingShot predicts that there will be a significant increase in MATIC’s price in 2023 if the fractal keeps being replicated. In contrast, the market in 2017 is radically different in terms of the crypto market’s size and the fundamental drivers that influence price movement. Considering prior external influences such as the LUNA fall and the recent FTX collapse, we can all agree that the market will be wary regarding these assertions. Another researcher by the name of Shelby3 contends that 2023 will bring far greater suffering. We may be able to discern a medium ground for investors and traders; 2023 will not deliver the anticipated significant rally, but it will end the bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Extra Eye On MATIC As of this writing, CoinGecko data is still flashing red across all timelines, indicating that it is losing value. Increasing exchange reserves for the token indicates a strong sell sentiment in the MATIC market. MATIC is trading at $$0.843512, down 10.3% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show, Wednesday. With MATIC continuing to trade at a red candle at $0.7846, which is coupled with a restricted trading range, it would continue to face agony until later this year and maybe until the first quarter of 2023. Investors and traders should be wary of MATIC on both the short- and long-term, as it continues to demonstrate a strong bearish bias. Even if MATIC follows in the footsteps of ETH, market forces and macroeconomic variables will eventually affect the price of MATIC.

QNT’s price continues to look weak as bearish market sentiments increase, with things looking uncertain for most traders and investors. QNT’s price looks weak and continues to trade below the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as bulls attempt to reclaim the region. The price action displayed by Quant (QNT) in previous weeks was not short of a spectacle but has yet to meet those expectations, with the price showing so much price action in recent weeks, rallying to a high of $240. Following the collapse of the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in, leading to the price of many altcoins, including Quant (QNT), battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga on investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of QNT struggling to hold above $100.

The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases leading to more sell orders than buy orders as the price of QNT is left on balance. FTX and Genesis’s news have hugely impacted the price of altcoins, including QNT, which has escalated the price to a region of $100 as the price bounced off this region to reclaim $107, just a few prices above key support of $100. After the price of QNT closed below the weekly high of $150, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of QNT looking weak. Weekly resistance for the price of QNT – $150. Weekly support for the price of QNT – $100. Price Analysis Of QNT On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of QNT remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $100 support after bouncing off from the region of $91. The price of QNT trades at $107; the price needs to hold strong above this region for the price to rally to a high of $120, where it would face resistance to trend higher. If the price of QNT breaks below $100, we could see more sell-off. Daily resistance for the QNT price – $130. Daily support for the QNT price – $100.

Is such a lofty price prediction realistic, considering the recent collapse of the crypto market? And can Wood’s call be trusted after the ARK Innovation ETF’s decline that is on par with Bitcoin? Here are all the factors behind the $1M per BTC target in less than a decade. Cathie Wood says Bitcoin will be worth 1 million per coin by 2030 https://t.co/GQFkjlb8vc pic.twitter.com/L8mw8u0SZO — Bloomberg Wealth (@wealth) November 22, 2022 Cathie Wood: Yes, Bitcoin Will Hit $1M By 2030 In an interview with Bloomberg, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood was asked about her past prediction that Bitcoin would make it to a price of $1M per coin by the year 2030. Wood, undeterred by the recent bear market in crypto and equities, recommitted to the bet. Wood says that the recent fallout from FTX and other top crypto firms only helps to “battle test” the “infrastructure and the thesis” of the first-ever cryptocurrency. She adds that Bitcoin comes out of this “smelling like roses.” Related Reading: ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood Puts Bitcoin At $1 Million In 8 Years, Here’s Why The comment is perhaps in reference to how third parties were heavily at fault in the recent collapse, while the thesis for a decentralized future sans any intermediaries has only been further proven.

42394096,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWZb,1669163400,'Personal Fiefdom': Some Takeaways From FTX's First Bankruptcy Hearing,"Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Yankees! For the rest of you, I’m counting on you to keep an eye on Twitter in case someone else files for bankruptcy. But today we’re looking at FTX’s first bankruptcy hearing.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Taking no prisoners  The narrative  FTX (finally) had its first day hearing on Tuesday, letting the company’s lawyers finally get a better sense of just what was going on with the bankrupt crypto exchange.  Why it matters  FTX’s collapse has kicked off the most complicated bankruptcy process so far for the crypto ecosystem, with 102 different court dockets and a first day hearing that took well over a week to schedule. Millions of people’s money is at risk, and that’s ignoring the broader contagion concerns within the crypto ecosystem.  Breaking it down  I live-tweeted FTX’s first day hearing on Twitter, but I wanted to highlight a few key takeaways.  Much of the hearing echoed the first-day filing that we saw last week. FTX is being investigated by state and federal regulators, it’s still unclear just what exactly FTX has in terms of assets and liabilities and “FTX was in the control of a small group of inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals. And unfortunately, the evidence seems to indicate that some or all of them are also compromised individuals,” an attorney for FTX said.  The lawyers representing FTX and its new leadership are taking no prisoners. James Bromley of Sullivan & Cromwell told a judge, “You have witnessed probably one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America,” calling the FTX worldwide organization Sam Bankman-Fried’s “personal fiefdom” and alleging gross mismanagement.  Once again, customer privacy is going to become a big question. Like we saw in the Celsius Network bankruptcy case, the parties are going to try and find a balance between publishing the names, addresses and email addresses of all the creditors (including FTX’s customers) and, well, not doing that. “There certainly is a pull and tug here between the right to privacy and the right to everybody involved,” Judge John Dorsey of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware said.  The jurisdictional fight between the U.S. and The Bahamas is at a cease-fire – at least for now. The Bahamas-appointed joint provisional liquidators have agreed to allow for FTX Digital Markets’ Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York to be transferred to Delaware to join the other 101 Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-former CEO, cannot stop talking. He spoke to a Vox reporter last week, he spoke to Tiffany Fong of Celsius call leak fame and he wrote a letter to his former employees earlier on Tuesday – which he couldn’t even share directly because it turns out he no longer has access to his company’s Slack.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Ticketmaster’s collapse when Taylor Swift fans tried to buy tickets is leading to congressional hearings and antitrust investigations.

(Semafor) We haven’t talked about Twitter in a minute.

4658961,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559992-ftx-crypto-collapse-begins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1669163321,FTX: Crypto's Collapse Begins,"Summary The FTX bankruptcy is the chirping canary in the crypto coal mine. Crypto’s central flaw is its self-importance. Money is most effective when it spotlights real goods and services values from the background. New financial market structures should always reduce costs and increase the simplicity and clarity of old valuation technology. Otherwise, they add cost without adding value. FTX is the first wave of a coming tsunami of collapsing bloated pretentious market structures. Less is more in financial valuation. Introduction The FTX (FTT-USD) bankruptcy raises the alarm for specialists in the creation of new financial market structures. The creation of assets such as cryptocurrencies -- assets with no role in the production of goods and services and that instead only substitute for cheaper more efficient fiat money will never succeed. The error behind the failure of ventures that produce a more grandiose version of money or a more elaborate means of asset valuation is the fundamental misunderstanding of the humble role of valuation. Money is the handmaiden of capital used in the production of consumption goods and services. It is never an end, always a means to an end. Early in the development of financial market structure innovation, creators should ask themselves a fundamental question. Why will the financial innovation in question reduce the cost and increase the simplicity and clarity of the process of market valuation? If there is no answer, the project is wasting scarce resources. Financial innovation, because it is not a change in pursuit of more goods and services, should be cheaper and simpler than the financial technology it replaces. Spending on new kinds of money and other financial innovations creates costs without resulting in increased production. New finance should thus be a cheaper simpler replacement for more expensive old finance. What have we learned from the collapse of FTX? The FTX bankruptcy is the predictable result of pouring resources into a complicated pointless enterprise. Yet the FTX bankruptcy is more significant to recent financial history than the end of a pretentious firm. This is the end of one of the many doomed assets that became popular during this decade of zero interest rates – assets that absorb resources for no purpose, promising nothing other than a profit from a glorified Ponzi scheme. Besides cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and meme stocks are part of the pointless parade. Enough. Crypto began its life promising more. It promised to be a form of money that worked better than fiat money – cheaper to produce, more stable, and unencumbered by state control – unlike fiat currencies including the US dollar. But cryptocurrencies are more expensive to use, less predictable in value, and in dire need of the government regulation that crypto mavens eschew. Those of us intrigued by the crypto concept forgot an important rule of thumb that should be applied to all financial innovation – if a financial innovation is not simpler and more retail-investor-friendly than the old way, it fails to meet the test of market structure innovation – lower cost and greater simplicity . Did finance gain something from the gathering crypto disaster? Was it worth the cost? The primary gain was an increased awareness of the relative unimportance of money compared to assets used to produce real goods and services. Crypto is money that wants center-stage, seeking to impress and increase the relative importance of financial assets compared to assets that further consumer-saver objectives. The experience with crypto has been outrageously expensive and pointless, absorbing our most important asset, creative minds. If we are to recover anything valuable from the crypto experience, it must be a tally of mistaken judgments. Moreover, we should apply the lessons learned in the crypto debacle to other financial enterprises. In summary, we should rethink the inflated importance of money, exchanges, and derivatives. They are a means to the end of allocating resources used in the production of goods and services consumer-savers value. Thus, they should function in the background and on the cheap. Money, exchanges, and derivatives become less useful as they increase in number and complexity. Identification of value – the function of money, exchanges, and derivatives – should always be secondary to the creation of real production of goods and services. Things we got wrong with new forms of money Money is simply less important than crypto fanciers think it is. Crypto money attracts resources by masquerading as an important end. Since money is less important than real assets it should be like standard fiat money. Nearly free to create. The mining that creates Bitcoin (BTC-USD), for example, is ridiculously expensive, more than $1,000 per Bitcoin (see here for world costs of Bitcoin production). One measure of monetary value is enough – two or more is less useful than one (read here ). In other words, crypto wealth is worse than pointless. It removes resources from the production of goods and services while reducing the contribution of the existing fiat currency to the valuation of more important assets. Government, however imperfect, is the best source of money. Crypto taught us that money designed to avoid government control eventually relies on government-controlled money to measure its worth (read here ). Things we got wrong with new exchanges Fewer exchanges are better than many (read here , and here ). Just as a single measure of value is ideal, a single source of market valuation of financial assets is ideal. Exchanges share with money their essential secondary importance compared to the importance of the real goods-producing assets they were originally designed to trade. The proliferation of futures and securities exchanges of the past 50+ years has been wasteful (read here ). Separate futures and securities exchanges once made sense because there was no overlap of traded instruments. But now that the technology is mature, this separation should end. Duplicate futures and securities exchanges multiply transaction costs in the same way many forms of money do. Markets should be redesigned, listing instruments directly connected to the production of goods and services (read here ). Futures exchanges have become too much like crypto exchanges, trading products that are too remote to the finance of assets that support production. Futures markets integrated with securities markets would participate more directly in the creation of assets valued by their contribution to production. Things we got wrong with financial derivatives Derivatives valuation and trading should not be so peripheral to the valuation of the more fundamental assets that support the production of goods and services – private sector equity and debt (read here ). The spot and futures markets would both function more effectively if combined in the trading of the most liquid summary securities – broadly diversified debt and equity instruments. A typical futures contract increases the liquidity of its related spot market only once every three months when the futures price and the spot price are equated through futures settlement. The spot and futures markets would both be more supportive of value creation if their values matched more frequently. Moreover, the liquidity futures generate would become synonymous with the liquidity of the spot market, eliminating the possibility of another LIBOR crisis. Derivatives should apply their essential trading innovations – the futures-style clearing house and instant costless clearing – directly to spot trading. Derivatives should drop the term “derivative” and simply replace the disastrously inefficient securities exchanges. Derivatives and the securities from which they are derived could be more cheaply and more usefully traded on the same exchange using futures trading and clearing technology. A centrally cleared market, that clears instantly at zero cost as financial futures do now, could apply futures technology to securities that pay dividends and interest, becoming a far more efficient securities market without breaking a sweat (read here ). Most importantly, the private sector’s creation of sustainable value is best focused on assets that produce goods and services. To devote the resources of the private sector to multiple forms of money, multiple duplicative exchanges, and duplicative complicated derivative instruments – is to waste them. We have too many markets trading things of little significance for the real economy. What should we do about FTX? The crux of the problem of establishing a more productive direction for financial innovation than the phony wealth cornucopia that is crypto is the innate difficulty in attracting resources to ventures that profitably replace older financial technologies that were inefficient because they generated more rich people than they supported. Entrenched greed is even more difficult to overcome than Johnny-come-lately ambition. Crypto excites the human imagination and will, I hope, never disappear entirely. There is no reason to be sure that the theory behind Bitcoin will never have applications in producing new important goods and services other than money. But hopefully, fewer of our brightest minds will trash their careers in the pointless pursuit of instant wealth after FTX. Conclusion Financial innovation has a different look from innovation in the production of real goods and services. Innovation in financial markets inevitably takes Occam’s Razor to the financial share of GDP in the long run and often in the short run too. Less is more with financial innovation. We had developed a very simple efficient financial system globally at the turn of the 21st century. We have applied electronic and computer technology quite effectively to that system since then, drastically reducing the cost of financial transactions and dramatically improving price discovery throughout the globe. Electronic and computerized trading adhere to the dictates of Occam’s razor. But beginning with the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreements circa 1970, exploding financial market price volatility has encouraged financial innovation that expanded the function of trading, appropriately absorbing new resources to assuage the increased pressure on financial institutions and markets. New risks reasonably justified new expenditures on financial innovations such as financial futures. But financial futures are duct tape and baling wire, temporarily modifying mainline financial instruments. Where is the integration of securities and derivatives that applies the more efficient futures market tech to the more important trading of securities? We need to consolidate. Too many duplicative assets and transaction systems have become weeds in the garden that is our innovative financial structure.

42413606,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA35C,1669162849,Binance US Steps Into National Politics With New Campaign PAC,"Withy campaign mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried and his FTX compatriots vanished from U.S. policy circles, their absence left a void in the crypto industry’s political involvement. Part of that may be filled by the U.S. arm of rival exchange Binance.  Binance.US has chosen this moment to step into the arena with its own political action committee (PAC), the Binance.US Innovation PAC. Though the company hasn’t yet detailed its intentions, the committee was formed with a filing to the Federal Elections Commission dated Monday.  The official treasurer for its foray into U.S. politics is Krishna Juvvadi, the head of legal at Binance’s U.S. operation and former top regulatory lawyer for Uber. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the new political venture, nor did company spokespeople. Binance Chief Risk Officer Sidney Majalya’s name was also listed on one of the filings as the designated agent.  One of Binance’s surviving rivals, Coinbase, had established a PAC earlier this year – also called Coinbase Innovation PAC – though it’s only given $38,000 so far, according to federal campaign records. The real spotlight for crypto political donations had belonged to two FTX executives – former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame, who has shared the helm of FTX Digital Markets, for their firehose that sprayed tens of millions of dollars into congressional campaigns across the country.  The Binance.US PAC arrives as the dust settles on this month’s congressional elections, so it has a full two years to gear up for the next federal races, including for the White House. Its CEO, Brian Shroder, has individually given relatively small donations to Democratic candidates in the past, including Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) when he was running the first time, and to the Lincoln Project formed by Republicans to oppose former President Donald Trump.  Meanwhile, a more general industry PAC, GMI, chalked up a number of political successes in the recent elections.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/23/binance-us-steps-into-national-politics-with-new-campaign-pac,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12e74379ee7c8d4fa94e67e3d4831676a77b2882-4256x3192.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
