In a notice posted online, the securities regulator said it was extending the review period for the ETF to Feb. 27, 2019. The proposal was first submitted by money manager VanEck and blockchain startup SolidX, who partnered with the Cboe exchange earlier this year.  Under SEC rules, a decision on the proposal cannot be delayed any further, meaning the next notice must either approve or reject the ETF.  The decision comes after months of uncertainty as a number of previous ETF proposals were rejected by the SEC, most notably in August when the regulator simultaneouslyrejected nine proposals submitted by ProShares, GraniteShares and Direxion. The rejections were suspended the next day when the SEC announcedit would review all of the proposals.  It later reopened a comment period, giving the general public until November 6 to share any new statements in support of or against allowing the ETFs to be approved.  The VanEck/SolidX proposal differs from the others in that its value is dependent on bitcoin itself, rather than futures markets like the other nine.  The SEC similarly reopened a comment period for this proposal, designating October 17 as the deadline for any statements and October 31 as the deadline for any rebuttals.  To date, it has received more than 1,600 comments, Thursday's notice said.

42381380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95R1L,1544126420,Binance Launches Multi-Account Feature for Institutional Crypto Traders,"Crypto exchange Binance is looking to aid institutional investors with a new sub-account feature.  Announced Thursday, these sub-accounts will allow institutions to set up multiple trading accounts for each firm, with different accounts being given different levels of access and control. The firms' main accounts will be able to control these sub-accounts, granting them permissions as needed.  A single institution may have up to 200 sub-accounts, according to the exchange.  In addition to the different levels of account types, Binance will allow different sub-accounts to transfer funds with no fees and unique API limits per sub-account, meaning they will be able to trade at a greater capacity than they might otherwise be able to do.  While sub-accounts will be able to oversee their own trades, create and edit their own API keys and place their own orders, the main accounts will be able to view all data, transfer funds between accounts and cancel any and all orders placed.  The new sub-account system will be based on Binance's existing institutional account structure, with any institutions tagged as Tier 3 or above able to set up these accounts.  According to a previous blog post, this means accounts with a minimum BNB balance of 1,000 and at least 4,500 bitcoin in trading volume over the previous 30 days will be eligible.  Binance joins a number of other crypto firms in looking to institutional traders as clients. In the U.S., security firm BitGo has been growing its trust and custody division, hiring a veteran banker as CEO of the new wing.  Similarly, crypto exchange Poloniex just launched its own trading services aimed at institutional investors, offering similar API services, though it did not list any similar sub-account feature.  Coinbase has likewise been looking to increasing traffic from institutional investors with its new over-the-counter trading desk. While the desk is still being tested, the exchange plans to take it live in the coming weeks.

42381388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95R7d,1544114728,Morgan Creek Is Betting $1 Million That Crypto Can Beat the S&P,"Morgan Creek Digital, an institutional manager focused on cryptocurrencies and digital assets, wants to bet $1 million that such assets will outperform the S&P 500 during the next 10 years.  The asset manager is challenging any professional investor or firm that believes cryptocurrencies are ""worthless"" or that public equities are a better bet to prove their belief with a long-term bet against the Digital Asset Index Fund, a crypto index fund managed by Bitwise Asset Management.  The bet will be structured like the famous Warren Buffett bet, which began in 2008 when the billionaire investor wagered $1 million that investing in a S&P 500 index fund would see a greater result than investing in hedge funds.  Buffett won his bet earlier this year.  Now, Morgan Creek Digital is betting that an index fund containing bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, monero, zcash, dash, iota and NEM will outperform the S&P 500 over the next decade.  In an email, Morgan Creek Digital founder and partner Anthony Pompliano told CoinDesk that the firm is confident in cryptocurrencies' performance outlook across the next 10 years, at least compared to public equities.  ""It outperformed over the last 10 years and we believe that will not change moving forward for the next 10 years,"" he added, though the firm is ""definitely not going off past performance"" alone.  Rather, he referenced a post outlining how bitcoin's fundamentals would support its growth as an asset class, noting that while the post references bitcoin specifically, his team holds similar views on the crypto space as a whole.  These fundamentals include the fact that the number of wallets and nodes supporting the network continue to grow, according to the post.

At press time, BTC/USD short positions on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex jumped to 37,891 – the highest level since Oct. 15 – and were last seen at 36,996. Notably, shorts have risen by 95 percent in the last three weeks, accompanying BTC's recent drop to 14-month lows near $3,500.  More importantly, the short positions remained elevated above 35,000 during BTC's oversold bounce from $3,500 to $4,400 and climbed to fresh multi-week highs on Thursday. Further, the long-short ratio of 0.73 is biased toward the bears.  BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex  The data indicates that, despite being so deep into the bear market, sellers appear to be showing no signs of exhaustion. As a result, the cryptocurrency may revisit the recent low of $3,474 as hinted in the technical charts.  The bearish sentiment, however, could soon reach extremes as the short positions are down just 7 percent from the record high of 40,289 that was reached on on Sept. 19. Moreover, the extreme bearish positioning is widely considered a sign that the sell-off is overdone and often presages a trend reversal.  Therefore, the prospects of sudden bullish reversal, similar to the one seen on April 12, would improve substantially once the short positions reach record highs.

42381383,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95R05,1544101221,BitGo Brings Banker Out of Retirement to Lead Institutional Crypto Custody,"BitGo has hired Richard J. Corcoran, a long-time veteran of the trust company industry, to head the crypto security startup’s institutional custody business.  Announced Thursday, Corcoran will oversee billions of dollars in value as CEO of a recently formed division called BitGo Trust Company, one of a growing field of crypto custodians courting hedge funds, family offices and mutual funds as clients.  “I understand the regulatory requirements and how to comply with those standards and maintain compliance as we serve customers,” Corcoran told CoinDesk, adding that the first big-ticket clients are now being on-boarded.  Indeed, Corcoran is especially familiar with the requirements of South Dakota, which granted BitGo a trust company license earlier this year, allowing the firm to hold cryptocurrency on behalf of institutional investors.  He retired from First National Bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2016, after 25 years leading its trust department. That same year he met Mike Belshe, BitGo’s CEO.  ""We met through the attorney representing BitGo who recommended that Mike talk to me about the trust industry in South Dakota in general,"" Corcoran said, adding, somewhat cheekily:  ""I think it was a setup.""  Crypto prairie?  Stepping back, institutional investors are generally required by U.S. law to use qualified custodians rather than safekeep assets themselves.  Although banks and broker-dealers can act as qualified custodians, the state trust company license has proved popular among crypto specialists such as BitGo, Kingdom Trust (which is also registered in South Dakota) and Coinbase (which set up a regulated trust company in New York this year).  South Dakota is “if not the top, one of the top trust jurisdictions in the country, and that's because of our very favourable trust laws and the manner in which we monitor these laws,” said Corcoran, who served on the South Dakota Governor’s Task Force on Trust Administration and Reform.  “When I came here in 1979 there were a total of 12 trust institutions; now there are over 100 independent trust companies alone here,” he added.  An attorney by training who reportedly helped draft more than half a dozen statutes, Corcoran explained that being a chartered trust company in South Dakota involves certain basic requirements. These, he said, include governance structure and accountability; compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money-laundering strictures; insurance coverage; periodic external audits; and capital reserve levels.  “From a banking standards view, I think we would be considered well capitalized,” he said.

42381395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95RFB,1544098853,"Swiss Post, Swisscom Developing New Blockchain Platform on Hyperledger","Swiss Post, the country's national postal service, and state-owned telecoms provider Swisscom have united to develop a blockchain platform.  The two announced Thursday that they are using Hyperledger Fabric to build their “simple, secure and sustainable” private blockchain infrastructure, intended to be utilized by their own, as well as other companies’, applications.  The infrastructure is designed to meet the high security levels required by banks, while all data hosted will remain within Switzerland, they added.  The announcement indicates that the system is more energy efficient than public blockchain offerings, stating:  “In contrast to ""public blockchains"" (e.g. bitcoin and ethereum), this private blockchain infrastructure requires much less energy, since it can only be used by identified users who have a contractual relationship with the providers of an application. This enables more efficient agreement procedures as well as significantly higher security and performance.”  The first pilot blockchain apps are scheduled for launch in Q2 2019, with use cases said to be focusing on corporates and government agencies desiring to digitize business processes in a ""secure and verified"" manner.  Swiss Post and Swisscom also said they are open to accepting other partners to join them on the project. Ultimately, they desire ""to enable the Swiss economy to quickly obtain a leading position when it comes to using this promising technology.""  The two companies are already using blockchain technology for several use cases.  Swiss Post's financial services unit PostFinance, for instance, launched a pilot project in May that provides smart energy billing via blockchain. It also stores temperature data on a blockchain for monitoring pharmaceuticals in transit.

42381400,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95RHh,1544095207,Bitcoin Still on Defensive But Price Rally Possible Over $3.9K,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the defensive despite a 4-percent recovery from nine-day lows today, but bearish pressure may weaken if prices rise above key resistance near $3,900.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,629 at 05:00 UTC on Bitstamp – its lowest level since Nov. 27. At press time, the price stood at $3,770, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Despite the quick recovery, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,500.  To start with, BTC closed below $3,711 yesterday, invalidating the short-term bullish reversal signaled by last Wednesday's 11 percent gains. The daily close also added credence to the bearish lower high carved out near $4,400 in the last few days.  Added to that, the bearish setup on the long duration charts suggests strong potential for a deeper sell-off.  That said, a minor recovery rally could be seen if prices cross resistance at $3,882 – upper edge of the falling wedge pattern – seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart  As seen above, BTC suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown yesterday, signaling an end of the corrective bounce and a resumption of the sell-off.  So, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as prices are holding below the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern (former support), currently at $3,850.  BTC, however, has also established a falling wedge – a bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the outlook as per the hourly chart would turn bullish if prices cross $3,882 (upper edge of the wedge).  The breakout, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $4,265 (Dec. 2 high) and possibly to $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).  Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100- and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.  Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100-, and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the lower high pattern, yesterday's bearish close below $3,771 and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (MAs) continue to favor a re-test of $3,474 (Nov. 25 low).  Notably, BTC struggled to close above the 10-day EMA during the recent corrective bounce. So, a daily close above that EMA, if and when it occurs, could be considered an advance signal of an impending bullish move.  That said, a more credible evidence of a trend reversal would be a convincing break above $4,400.  View  The probability of a drop to the recent low of $3,474 remains high while prices are trading below resistance near $3,900.  A break below $3,629 (daily low) will likely bring a speedy drop toward $3,474 (Nov. 25 low). A close below that would bolster the long-term bearish technicals and allow potential for a drop to psychological support at $3,000.  A falling wedge breakout on the hourly chart, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $4,265 (Dec. 2 high), above which major resistance is seen a $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).

According to a report from Jiji Press on Thursday, the data was released by the country’s National Police Agency (NPA), which indicated the cases were reported from January to October of that year.  The figure notably is 788 percent greater than the previous reported number of 669 cases for the period April to December, 2017.  The police agency believes that cases saw a sharp rise after Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) passed a law in April 2017 that brought crypto exchanges under anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.  ""It's already been some time since the reporting system began, and it has been embraced by the industry through guidance from the Financial Services Agency,"" an NPA official was quoted as saying in The Japan Times.  The delay in the number of reports rising following the new regulation was put down to exchanges getting acquainted to the new reporting system.  The FSA law mandates that exchanges must report suspected transactions in an effort to crack down on cases that use cryptocurrency as a medium to facilitate illegal financial activities.  It's worth noting that, despite the sudden rise, crypto transactions only made up 1.7 percent of the total of reported suspicious transactions.  The Japan Times indicates that the NPA said it had received 346,139 reports of suspected money laundering and other illicit financial transactions in the same 10-month period.

42381389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95RA9,1544086818,US Government Offering Up to $800K for Anti-Forgery Blockchain Solutions,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking to fund anti-counterfeiting solutions from blockchain startups with grants of up to $800,000.  The DHS, through its unit Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), announced the non-dilutive funding, to be spread over four phases, on Tuesday through its Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). Non-dilutive funding means an entity doesn't need to sell equity to receive financing.  The funding program is related to the DHS's November solicitation – “Preventing Forgery and Counterfeiting of Certificates and Licenses” – through which the agency is looking to enhance its capabilities to prevent fake documentation using blockchain technology.  “DHS has need of the innovations coming from this community to ensure we are at least a step ahead of national security threats,” said Melissa Oh, managing director at SVIP.  To qualify for a grant, blockchain startups need to present proposed solutions covering various use cases, including the issuing of digital documents related to travel, citizenship, immigration and employment authorization, as well as cross-border oil and raw material movements.  The funding is open to startups and small businesses that have not had a government contract in the last year totaling $1 million or more and that have under 200 employees at the time of application, the DHS indicates.  “The broad Homeland Security mission includes the need to issue entitlements, licenses and certifications for a variety of purposes including travel, citizenship, employment eligibility, immigration status and supply chain security,” said Anil John, SVIP technical director.  He added:  “Understanding the feasibility and utility of using blockchain and distributive ledger technology for the digital issuance of what are currently paper-based credentials is critical to preventing their loss, destruction, forgery and counterfeiting.”  The DHS has been interested in blockchain technology as early as 2015 when it started accepting research proposals from small businesses to better understand blockchain technology. Most recently, the agency released a pre-solicitation document that discusses the use of cryptocurrencies and if it is feasible to track transactions conducted using privacy coins such as monero and zcash.
