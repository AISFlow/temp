42424152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2l1Zh,1638487871,First Mover Asia: Markets in Wait-and-See Mode; Bitcoin Hovers Around $57K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin moved little, while the “tether premium” dropped as Huobi’s deadline approaches.  Technician’s take: Long-term momentum is starting to fade, which could limit price gains this month. For now, BTC is holding support above $53K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,604 -1%  Ether (ETH): $4,536 -1.1%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,577 +1.4%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $34,639 +1.8%  Nasdaq: $15,381 +0.8%  Gold: $1,768 +0.7%  Market moves  Bitcoin remained around $57,000 on Thursday as the market remained in a wait-and-see mode. The oldest cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume on centralized exchanges also declined.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across 11 major centralized exchanges sank from a day ago and was much lower than a week ago. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell slightly but remained in the $4,500-$4,600 range.  Meanwhile, the price for the USDT/CNY (tether/Chinese yuan) pair tumbled entering December,as the deadline approaches for Huobi, a popular crypto exchange among Chinese investors, to close the accounts of its existing users in mainland China. Amid China’s latest ban on crypto trading and mining, Huobi announced that it would remove all mainland Chinese accounts by the end of this year.  As a previous Asia First Mover mentioned, the market in China has been slowly rebounding from the country’s September crypto trading ban with tether’s quoted prices in the yuan on the over-the-counter (OTC) market recovering from a deep discount.  Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Asian currency, but tether had traded at a significant discount since China’s ban and turned into negative (as much as negative 5.31% yesterday) again after a brief recovery, according to data from feixiaohao.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Struggles Near Resistance; Support at $53K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to stabilize above the $53,000 support level after last month’s decline.  There appears to be a stalemate, however, between buyers and sellers because the cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Resistance is seen around $60,000, which has capped upside moves over the past week.  BTC was trading around $56,000 at the time of publication and is down about 4% over the past week.  The short-term downtrend in BTC is defined by a series of lower price highs since Nov. 10, as seen in the chart above. Recently, oversold signals appeared on the charts, which could encourage short-term buying from the $53,00 support level. A decisive break above $60,000 would reverse the short-term downtrend.  Still, there is strong overhead resistance between $60,000 and $65,000, which could limit price gains this month.

But he doesn’t think it works to buy coffee.  “You don’t want to pay for your coffee with your bitcoin, you want to pay for your coffee with a currency,” Saylor said in an interview with CoinDesk TV on Tuesday.  Saylor believes that bitcoin is the world reserve asset whereas the dollar is the world currency. That’s the main distinction between the two.  Saylor’s MicroStrategy has doubled its bitcoin holdings in the fiscal fourth quarter this year and now owns 121,044 bitcoins worth about $3.6 billion, which he says that he will likely “hold forever.”  Viewing bitcoin as an asset rather than as a currency also makes life easier from a regulatory perspective. “All of these regulations … they’re really regulations restraining your use of a digital asset as a currency rather than as a property,” Saylor said, adding that if you acknowledge that, it’s easy to see that the future of the industry is “quite bright.”  Saylor also addressed the issue of inflation, saying that bitcoin would provide the best hedge against inflation.  “There’s going to be volatility, but it seems to me that now we have universal acknowledgment that the world needs an inflation hedge,” he said. “So if you have bitcoin, don’t sell it.”  UPDATE (12/3/21 – 17:20 UTC): Clarifies language in first sentence that Michael Saylor thinks bitcoin is an asset, not a currency.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/02/michael-saylor-calls-bitcoin-the-worlds-reserve-asset-but-not-so-good-for-buying-a-cup-of-coffee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28444e36114dc10d2b4b39201e16b4d196ef188b-1024x697.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2l13h,1638486675,Riot Blockchain Raises 2022 Hashrate Guidance for Second Time in a Month,"Riot Blockchain (RIOT), one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, raised its 2022 guidance for its mining power to 9.0 exahash per second (EH/s) from its previous forecast of 8.6 EH/s, marking the second increase to its 2022 estimate within a month.  Riot attributed the increase to its purchase of 3,000 of Bitmain’s latest mining machines, the S19XP, which are expected to be delivered and deployed by December of next year, according to a statement.  The miner noted that the increase in its hashrate guidance doesn’t include any potential benefits from the adoption of its 200-megawatt immersion-cooled technology, which is expected to increase the mining power of its existing computers.  Riot also said that it mined 466 bitcoins in November, an increase of about 300% year-over-year but only a very slight increase from the 464 bitcoins it mined in October.  As of Nov. 30, the company held about 4,464 bitcoins and has mining power of 3 EH/s, which is about 2% of the total Bitcoin network’s hashrate of 149 exahash per second, according to data analytics firm Glassnode as of Dec. 1.  The shares of the miner were up slightly in post-market trading, after the shares of many crypto miners tumbled during normal trading hours on Thursday as crypto prices fell.

42424153,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2l1bh,1638484712,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Vulnerable to Rising Leverage Despite Short-Term Optimism,"Bitcoin continued to trade in a tight range on Thursday and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Some analysts are concerned that rising leverage in the bitcoin futures market could precede a near-term price drop, while others expect the current trading range to result in further upside.  CryptoQuant analysts pointed to the slower pace of whales, or large bitcoin buyers, buying as a cautious market signal. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest bitcoin’s price decline could stabilize at around $53,000, although upside appears to be limited beyond $60,000-$65,000.  With the end of year approaching, some analysts told CoinDesk that most investors will probably exit their long positions to lock in gains, which could make a sustained price rise to $100,000 BTC unlikely.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,974, +0.5%  Ether (ETH): $4,532, -0.7%  S&P 500: +1.4%  Gold: $1,769, -0.8%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.436%  Concerns about rising leverage  Open interest, or the total number of outstanding contracts, in the bitcoin futures market continues to rise despite the recent crypto sell-off.  “It is not common to see such a high open interest being sustained for such a long duration. This could suggest that the market is currently oversaturated with leverage,” Arcane Research wrote in a report earlier this week.  High leverage means bitcoin futures traders holding long positions could be vulnerable to liquidations (broad-based selling) if the BTC price continues to drift lower.  Slower bitcoin spending  The chart below shows the recent decline in the average lifespan (ASOL), measured in days, of all spent transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. High values indicate that old coins are being spent as long-term holders take some profits amid higher market volatility, whereas low values indicate a slowdown in spending activity.  “During corrections, declining ASOL is a signal that investor confidence is improving, and fewer coins are spent,” blockchain data firm Glassnode tweeted on Wednesday. A confirmed trough in the ASOL indicator could point to a short-term market bottom similar to what occurred in July and October.  Altcoin roundup  Badger DAO protocol suffers $120 million exploit: The decentralized finance protocol suffered an attack Wednesday evening, resulting in the loss of $120 million in BTC and ETH, reported CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman.

As of Wednesday evening, BadgerDAO’s BADGER token was down 21% to $21.64.

42394355,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDH1,1638484613,Jack Dorsey Takes Square Deep Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole,"As we wrap up a year jam-packed with high-profile adoptions of crypto by big players, yesterday may have given us the concluding exclamation mark. Days after Jack Dorsey announced that he was stepping down as Twitter CEO, the other company Dorsey runs announced that it was changing its corporate name from “Square” to “Block.” For those who have been paying attention to Dorsey’s trajectory, the signal here could not be clearer.  This article, part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, is excerpted from The Node newsletter, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Dorsey has spent the last five-odd years fascinated with cryptocurrency and blockchains, primarily Bitcoin. He has heavily promoted and supported the development of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and supported Bitcoin developers directly through a unit called Square Crypto (which will now be renamed, rather awesomely, Spiral). He added Bitcoin functionality to Square’s Cash App. At Twitter, he recently rolled out Lightning-based tipping, and before stepping down promised NFT (non-fungible token) avatar integration.  Now he’s going to turn Square into an entire cryptocurrency and blockchain company. There’s little other serious way to evaluate the name change to “Block,” as in the transaction batches processed on blockchains. (Already taken: “The Block,” a cryptocurrency research and news outlet; Blockchain.com, a wallet and block explorer; Blockworks; BlockFi; Block.One. I could go on.)  The potential here is huge. Square has a huge user base, between its small business checkout systems and consumer app. Its revenue from those two businesses has grown massively in recent years (though that growth has slowed recently), providing a firm financial and customer foundation. Dorsey will be able to look for real opportunities to improve those existing customer experiences with crypto. And his demonstrated commitment to public, open-access blockchains means those integrations will likely lift the whole sector.  Strangely, though, Square/Block seems to be downplaying the obvious “crypto” elements of the rebranding. The accompanying press release does list “blockchain” as a source of inspiration for the name, but includes it alongside pablum like “building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music”  That’s a huge contrast to the other major name change of the past month, which saw Facebook becoming “Meta.” Facebook went full-court press on announcing that pivot, and it got a lot of press coverage.  The difference is that Facebook was at least in part trying to change the conversation away from the regulatory and legal problems that have been bedeviling it. Another factor is that, frankly, the pivot from social media advertising to a virtual reality “metaverse” makes no sense financially, so Zuckerberg and company knew they had to wow the credulous rubes in the mainstream press with barbecue sauce jokes.  Square, by contrast, is a successful company that does not regularly facilitate crimes against humanity. There’s no reason to think the name change is a PR play. In fact, Square’s hesitation to talk about the name change in terms of “crypto” makes it clear it sees risk in the opposite direction: Square investors at this point know that they’re holding a growth company with an established model and might very well get squirrely if it seemed like Dorsey was about to turn it into his personal blockchain playpen.  This morning’s market seems to reflect that ambivalence: As the new world gestates in the flesh of the old, Block is trading flat.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,David Z.

Starting later this month, users of Mercado Pago, Mercado Libre’s digital wallet, will be able to buy and sell bitcoin, ether and the stablecoin Pax dollar (USDP), Mercado Libre said. The minimum amount required for a transaction will be 1 Brazilian real, it added.  Paxos will handle crypto trading and custody for Mercado Pago users in an arrangement similar to its integration with PayPal in late 2020 – a service that was widely seen to accelerate the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. and beyond.  Last week, Mercado Libre told CoinDesk that it was entering the cryptocurrency environment in Brazil together with “a world-class custodian,” adding that it was “analyzing all financial and regulatory aspects surrounding this technology.”  It said Thursday that the crypto service would launch in December but did not specify a date in response to a CoinDesk query.

We are thrilled to partner with Mercado Pago to make it possible,” he added.  “The complete management of crypto can be carried out from a free account, thus facilitating access to new opportunities for financial growth, especially for those currently outside the financial system,” Tulio Oliveira, vice president of Mercado Pago in Brazil, said in a statement.  Mercado Pago’s app will provide bitcoin, ether and USDP prices, as well as educational content about the three cryptocurrencies, the company said.  “The content will address the crypto assets ecosystem, as well as the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrency investing,” the company added.

The fund will back infrastructure protocols, decentralized finance (DeFi) open-source protocols and Web 3 applications.  Venture Fund II differs from Maven 11′s first fund in being closed-ended, or issuing a fixed number of shares, and having a wider group of backers including wealthy individuals, crypto entrepreneurs, family offices and institutions. The new fund has already deployed investments into gaming-focused DAO Merit Circle, lending platform Maple Finance, layer 1 blockchain Anoma and DeFi dashboard Zapper, among others.  “The traditional venture structure of this new fund allows us to take a multi-year time horizon on our investments,” Maven 11 partner Darius Rugys said in a statement. “This enables us to back protocols that need to grow from just a strong founder with an innovative idea towards a fully fledged DAO or proven protocol with strong traction among developers and users.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Rugys used Maple Finance as an example of how the firm works with companies in which it invests.  Maple Finance is a lending platform that specializes in liquidity pools made up of institutions. Maven 11 essentially acted as a pool manager for a group of borrowers and lenders. Rugys said his firm raised $150 million to $160 million for Maple Finance, and has a small team of employees working full time on that project.  “We invest in them, we are working closely with founders and we’re doing extensive work for the protocol,” said Rugys.  The Amsterdam-based investment firm is also focusing on internal hiring, including for its research and portfolio growth teams, said Rugys.

42417100,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4oSj,1638478933,The Radical Pluralism of Money,"A tree is an organism, but also a lumber reserve. After it is felled by a lumberjack, its story as an organism ends. But its story as a lumber reserve goes on, and its story as a house has not yet begun.  Similarly, money is more than one thing. Traditionally, it is three things: a means of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. It is easier to think about the future of money when you realize that the three different things called money might have three completely different futures.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Consider Marco Polo’s 13th-century description of paper money in Kublai Khan’s empire (written for Europeans unfamiliar with the concept). The Khan printed notes on mulberry bark paper and required his subjects to accept them as a form of payment on penalty of death. In Marco Polo’s simple retelling of this Promethean moment, he makes clear how the Khan’s currency united all three stories:  Unit of account: Everyone in the Khan’s empire accepts his paper as a valid yardstick of value, because they must. This requirement grates less because everyone else does the same.  Means of exchange: Traders and merchants actively prefer to use the Khan’s paper, because it is easier to transport and more divisible than jewels or metal.  Store of wealth: The Khan’s paper makes him the wealthiest man in the world. (Though, to be sure, he diversified his fortune by using paper to buy up jewels, metals, real estate and the like.)  In those times, the glue united money’s three functions in paper was the Khan’s iron fist. More recently, things have loosened. For example, U.S. merchants are under no obligation to accept dollars; the only truly guaranteed acceptor of dollars is the U.S. government. Further, anyone in the world can now mint a currency, and a lot of people seem to be interested in buying these non-state currencies. So the three functions of money have started to pull apart from each other slightly, like strands of a loosening braid. A couple examples:  Bitcoin functions well as a store of wealth, despite not being much good as a unit of account (due to volatility) or a means of exchange (due to transaction fees and technical impracticalities like key management).  Stablecoins nearly match fiat currencies as a unit of account and as a store of wealth, but remain less effective as a means of exchange.  In the future, the strands could pull apart more dramatically. We might have excellent means of exchange that are actively bad as stores of value (for example, because they employ demurrage) and powerful stores of wealth that are all-but impossible to transact (for example, due to staking schemes).  Most interestingly, I can imagine money’s unit-of-account function radically fragmenting. Bitcoin maximalists predict that bitcoin will become a sort of universal unit of account; and this is not the kind of prediction that can be disproved, because it will come true if enough people believe it. But I can imagine another future in which units of account dramatically pluralize, instead of becoming universal.  Emergent associative communities could measure value in their way, on their own terms. The more they took their endogenous terms seriously, the more they could use them to shape and stimulate endogenous commerce, thus enriching themselves with minimal dependence on global markets. That is much more interesting than a world in which everything is measured in dollars, bitcoins, Galactic Guilders or any such thing.  The Khan’s currency united all the stories about money because the Khan wielded all the coercive power. But the reverse is also true: He wielded all the coercive power because he united all the stories about money. Today, when we try to conjure one money to rule them all, we are implicitly seeking to concentrate coercive power in whomever holds that money. Yes, this is a critique of Bitcoin, but don’t fail to notice that it’s also a critique of “universal” basic income. I fervently wish to guarantee everyone a baseline of dignity, but there’s no telling what will be lost, or where power will end up concentrated, if a monetary baseline establishes a universal unit of account whose governance is not seriously accountable. “Local” or “community” basic income seem less dangerous.  Radical pluralism, including in our yardsticks of value, is the true source of wealth. Let’s just let the old universalist stories about money drift away, recalling economist John Maynard Keynes’ words when Britain abandoned the gold standard: “We have nothing to fear, honestly nothing.” Three cheers for a messier, more resilient world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Matthew Prewitt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/02/the-radical-pluralism-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c864f6a0f5039d6fe307274e04bf46300c4c7ca7-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Man are looking to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), not music streaming services, to sell their next platinum record.  The artists’ newest song “this is fine” is being sold exclusively as a collection of 1 million NFTs on the Mintbase NFT marketplace, which runs on the Near blockchain, with tokens going on sale Thursday.  Some 250,000 of these NFTs will be sold at Miami’s Art Basel festival for $1.29 a piece. The remaining NFTs will be sold as a mix of singles and bundled units and will come with additional rewards that have yet to be announced. A Mintbase representative told CoinDesk it has listed 68,000 tokens on its site as of Thursday morning.  In a rarity for a music landscape dominated by platforms like Apple Music and Spotify, the artists’ election to circumvent streaming services, and the largely unfavorable revenue sharing that accompanies them, is indicative of how musicians have been willing to experiment with blockchain to disrupt industry standards.  From concert ticketing to music streaming to NFT marketplaces, artists have used digital collectibles for utility largely similar to social tokens, where creators can continuously reward their token holders after an initial purchase is made.

Approval would have allowed retail and institutional investors to invest in a regulated financial product incorporating the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, without requiring them to invest in the crypto directly.  The decision comes seven months after the regulator said it would start evaluating the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, which the ETF giant filed with the Cboe BZX exchange in March. The agency delayed its decision in June and again in July, as well as its consideration of other bitcoin spot ETFs.  “The Commission concludes that BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest,’” the agency wrote.  The SEC’s decision was not unexpected as SEC Chair Gary Gensler has indicated multiple times in the past a preference for a bitcoin futures ETF over an ETF that holds bitcoin directly. Last month, the SEC rejected investment firm VanEck’s proposal for a spot bitcoin ETF.

Banks such as Goldman will not touch cryptocurrency spot markets but lean towards synthetic crypto products such as futures. Emulating tri-party repo type arrangements (a way of borrowing funds by selling securities with an agreement to repurchase them, involving a third-party agent), banks are exploring ways to follow the same path of not touching bitcoin, like other synthetic products.  It’s an opportunity that lays the groundwork for more integrated crypto prime brokerage services in the future, according to the sources CoinDesk spoke with. It’s also a continuation of Wall Street’s relatively sudden embrace of a $2.7 trillion asset class – albeit with somewhat niche products.  “Goldman was working on getting approved for lending against collateral and tri-party repo,” said one of the people. “And if they had a liquidation agent, then they were just doing secured lending without ever having bitcoin touch their balance sheet.”  Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Banking bitcoin  Goldman is not alone; a handful of big banks are following the trail blazed by crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature, both of which announced bitcoin-backed cash loans earlier this year.  “We’ve probably spoken to half a dozen big banks about [bitcoin-backed loans],” said a second person from a large institutional trading firm. “Some of them are in the next three to six months category and some are further out. What’s interesting is some of these banks will use their own balance sheet to make the loan. Others will syndicate this out.”  Read more: Signature Bank Goes Head-to-Head With Silvergate in Bitcoin-Backed Lending  The idea of banks accepting bitcoin as collateral was given a partial green light during the previous U.S. administration, when Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) chief Brian Brooks said bitcoin was the equivalent of cash and banks could be the safekeepers of it.  However, the U.S. regulatory stance on activity like this remains complicated. Depending on the bank and what exactly is being proposed, regulation could come from a mix of the OCC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Crypto providers join the party  Coinbase and Fidelity Digital Assets were cited as potential custodians the banks were in discussions with. (Coinbase already offers some institutional financing solutions within its Prime product, but this would be an additional feature.)  Coinbase declined to comment. Fidelity Digital Assets did not respond to requests for comment.  As well as the big banks, a rash of smaller lenders are also said to be considering ways to accept crypto as collateral.  “Non-bulge-bracket banks are also building in this tri-party lending area,” a third person said.

42424150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2l1Vh,1638471684,Goldman Sachs Sees Crypto Options Markets as ‘Next Big Step’ for Institutional Adoption,"Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street heavyweight, says the next major development for cryptocurrencies will be more liquid options markets as more traditional financial firms pile into the rapidly growing asset class.  “We are seeing a lot of demand for more derivative-type hedging,” Andrei Kazantsev, Goldman’s global head of crypto trading, said Thursday during a CoinDesk-hosted panel discussion. “The next big step that we are envisioning is the development of options markets.”  Kazantsev described cryptocurrency derivatives as being in the “infancy of product scope” when compared with more traditional markets such as equities or foreign exchange.  The bitcoin options market has already been seeing fast growth over the past couple years.  Open interest in bitcoin options, or the total value of outstanding contracts, stood at about $12 billion as of the latest data from Skew, a subsidiary of Coinbase that tracks data on cryptocurrency derivatives markets. As recently as the first half of 2020, the market rarely exceeded $2 billion.  Investors use cryptocurrency options to hedge out existing risk or take on additional market exposure. Options are a type of financial instrument called a “derivative,” which obtains its value from the price of another asset – in this case, the underlying cryptocurrency.  “There might be equity funds that have an exposure to a stock that has underlying bitcoin holdings,” explained Kazantsev. “In order to hedge that exposure, they might trade futures against that. For them, rather than rebalancing the portfolio dynamically, what they really want to do is hedge for the longer term, and to know the downside on the hedge that they can have. That’s where options become really important.”  “There are more versatile possibilities to hedge specific exposures with options than with futures alone,” added Kazantsev.  Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs re-established a cryptocurrency trading desk amid increased interest from its roster of clients, which include hedge funds, endowments and other institutional money managers.

After Months Of Downtrend, Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Shoot Up As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, on-chain data shows that BTC exchange reserves have spiked up in the past couple of weeks. The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin stored in wallets of all exchanges at a particular point in time. If the value of the metric goes down, it means investors are taking their coins off exchanges. Holders may be withdrawing their BTC to accumulate them as they might believe that the price would appreciate further. As a result, this trend could be bullish for the crypto. On the other hand, if the indicator increases in value, it implies holders are transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges, possibly for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins. Such a trend can prove to be bearish for the coin.

The ability for smaller merchants and businesses to operate internationally has been a game-changer. However, numerous payment problems have arisen resulting from the rapidity of the change, and financial services are struggling to keep up. Legacy infrastructure is holding back business It is frustrating for many SMEs that they can now operate across borders, but legacy banking infrastructure often labels smaller businesses as &apos;high-risk&apos;. This can make transactions difficult, risky, slow, and expensive. For example, a business receiving an international payment will probably use SWIFT and won&apos;t receive the money for between one and five days, on average. There is no transparency in the process, there will be fees attached and, probably, an unfavorable exchange rate. Then there are the risks for the merchant that arise from credit card fraud. The recent 2021 Chargeback Field report found that between 2018 and 2021, there was a 21 percent increase in criminal fraud. There are solutions available for P2P transactions and larger companies, but SMEs have been largely excluded.

42424159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2l1dh,1638467766,"Bitcoin’s Bullish Trajectory Intact, but December Jump to $100K Looks Unlikely: Analysts","Bitcoin needs to chart a 77% rally in the next four weeks to reach the widely forecast year-end value of $100,000. While analysts are bullish on the cryptocurrency, they don’t foresee a rally to six figures in the short term.  “The latest Commitment of Traders report shows net-long positioning on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with an increased commitment by asset managers,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital. The report was released on Friday. “Having said that, it won’t be enough to commit to the $100,000 rally this month as everyone is/was predicting.”  Kssis said the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to price pullbacks fueled by leverage washouts. “As much as the long-term trend remains positive, short-term pressures and liquidations, due to higher leverage being offered, remain high and will continue to put pressure on BTC price,” Kssis added.  While bitcoin futures open interest (OI) in U.S. dollar terms has recently declined along with the cryptocurrency’s price, the metric remains high when measured in BTC terms, indicating excess leverage in the market. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not liquidated with offsetting positions.  “The bitcoin denominated OI has now remained above 365,000 BTC for more than a month,” Arcane Research’s weekly noted published Tuesday said. “It is not common to see such a high OI being sustained for such a long duration. This could suggest that the market is currently over-saturated with leverage.”  Another signal: Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, has declined alongside a pickup in activity in the retail-focused Bybit exchange. In the past, increased activity on Bybit has paved the way for price pullbacks.  “Bybit’s share of the global open interest in the bitcoin futures has remained at high levels throughout November. Previously, Bybit’s OI has seen huge booms and busts as trades get crowded,” Arcane Research noted.  While a continued decline of liquid supply in the market leaves the door open for an outsize rally on large buy orders, a renewed institutional participation ahead of the new year looks unlikely.  “With the end of year fast approaching, most investors will probably unwind their risk-on position allowing them to present decent yearly performances,” Kssis said. “We do not see a bull run in 2021.”  Over 75% of supply can be considered illiquid at press time, according to Glassnode data. Illiquid supply is defined as the number of coins held in addresses that spend less than 25% of their incoming coins.  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said the chance of bitcoin rallying to $100,000 is getting slimmer by the day as the macroeconomic environment doesn’t appear price supportive, especially with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent hawkish turn. The central bank could discuss speeding up the bond-buying taper, or scaling back of asset purchases, at its December meeting, Powell said earlier this week.  “While we are bullish for the short term, there is growing doubt that $100,000 will be hit,” Dibb said. “Renewed interest is, however, being shown in ether and other coins associated with layer 1 blockchains.”  While bitcoin is down 1.4% this week, ether has risen by about 5%. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio has broken out of its multi-month consolidation, signaling ether leadership ahead or rotation of money out of bitcoin and into ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies in coming weeks.  “Right now, ETH is looking poised to make new highs vs. BTC – something we haven’t seen since the ICO (initial coin offering) mania of 2017,” David Hoffman, founder of the Bankless newsletter, noted. “One theme that we’ve seen throughout Ethereum’s history is that the ETH/BTC chart goes up in bull markets and down during bear markets.”  Hoffman added that the ratio’s potential break above 0.80 would bring another “wild period in crypto markets.” ETH/BTC is trading near the 0.80 mark on the Binance exchange.  “A bull run to $100,000 looks unlikely as there could be a major altcoin rally later this month,” MintingM, a Mumbai, India-based crypto asset management company, said.  Still, MintingM said bitcoin might surprise everyone if a major company or country accepts it as a means of payment or the U.S. Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) approves a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  According to historical data, bitcoin could rally to around $73,000 – about $29% above the current price of $56,400, should the macro situation improve and ether picks up a strong bid, lifting the entire market higher.  “The average return from Thanksgiving until year-end has been 29%, with a powerful 72% rally in 2020,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said in a blog post published Monday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/02/bitcoins-bullish-trajectory-intact-but-december-pump-to-100k-looks-unlikely-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1053cfbfadd69228b0685273f05aabcf31a8afc-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The change to Block “acknowledges the company’s growth,” the company wrote, noting that since its founding in 2009 the firm has added mobile payment service Cash App, streaming music service TIDAL and bitcoin-focused, open developer platform TBD54566975. In terms of crypto, Square is also in the process of building a hardware wallet and is considering creating a bitcoin mining service.  “The name change creates room for further growth,” the company concluded. “Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many people – individuals, artists, fans, developers and sellers.”  The company said “Block” has many associated meanings, including building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, and blockchain.  There will be no organizational changes as a result of the name change, although Square Crypto, a separate project of the company dedicated to advancing bitcoin, of which Square CEO Jack Dorsey is a big fan, will change its name to Spiral.  A legal change is expected to occur on Dec. 10, and the company’s stock ticker on the NYSE will remain as SQ.  The announcement comes just two days after Dorsey told investors he would be stepping down as the CEO of Twitter, though he will remain on Twitter’s board of directors until his term expires in the middle of 2022. Dorsey’s move has prompted some speculation that he would be focusing more of his efforts on bitcoin, either at Square or on his own.  In after-hours trading on Wednesday, Square was rising almost 1% after falling 6.6% during the day’s session.

This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Barter (or is it?)  A common story we are told is that money arises from the insufficiency of barter. Known as the “double coincidence of wants” problem, it is said barter was too limiting and a more flexible medium of exchange was needed. According to anthropologist David Graeber in his book, “Debt: The First 5000 Years,” this story is not true. To summarize his findings in ancient societies, what was found as “money” was delayed barter. For example, I don’t need item A now but I may need it in the future. I will give you item B and ask for A when I need it. This was the first creation of credit.  Barter, however, was necessary for dealing with strangers outside of your community because claiming credit from strangers was not possible. This was a weakness that limited foreign trade. Another weakness was scalability of trust; in the case of tribes, the number of people interacting with each other was small enough to be managed. But in the case of a country, the web of trust limits the parties available to trade with. To trade within a nation, the currency used must allow for trade with members outside of close circles of trust.  Commodity money  A “universal” agreement of value that allowed people to transact without knowing each other was needed. The agreement took the form of many things such as salt, cod and tulips, for example, but the easiest to remember is the use of gold. The problem with commodities was their inability to keep pace with an economy. The limited supply among a growing population and productivity meant instability and deflation. In other words, if the supply stays the same as more people need it, then there is less to go around. This stifles economic activity by not having enough to trade. The demand for the money drives up the purchasing power of currency and reduces the prices of goods and services which reduces production. The reduction of production means the loss of employment.  Fiat money  After departing from the gold standard, countries had national banks oversee the creation of money via commercial banks. Money bills are issued by the government; however, most of the money in current economies is digitally managed by commercial banks. This money is written into law as legal tender, effectively making the money as strong as the government. This type of money is called “fiat money” from the Latin word fiat, meaning “let it be done.”  The problem with this arrangement is the centralization of economic power. This was intended for banks to determine the creditworthiness of citizens and responsibly create money. As these institutions profit by lending, there is a heavy incentive to keep on lending and compete by risk exposure. These incentives lead to systemic issues and mismanagement as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.  Compared to previously mentioned deferred barter, as social capital is misaligned with financial capital the only way to capture risk is via interest.  The effects of interest have significant negative impacts. By being in the business of lending, customers must continuously be indebted. This incentivizes the growth of wealth inequality by having interest compounding on debts and creating money for only those that can already afford it.  The future of money  As we envision the future trajectory of money, we can start by highlighting desirable traits and then building on lessons learned from previous systems:  Currency stability via flexible money supply: The prices of goods and services are not heavily swayed by the scarcity of money. All prior monetary systems primarily aimed for this trait.  Collectively managed by a social contract: The management of money supply should belong to the people. This also can preserve the citizen’s economic agency.  Pluralistic and adapted to local conditions: In the case of a single commodity, certain areas will be endowed with large deposits leading to inherently unequal distribution. For credit based systems, the system should be able to match the actual value being exchanged for goods and services in its region of circulation.  Decentralized and transparent: To avoid mismanagement, centralization needs to be balanced with transparency to allow sufficient oversight.  What if we had a system that allowed liquidity to be created/destroyed as needed with democratic oversight? Instead of having money trickle down via a chain of institutions, what if we could “print” it so long as we followed the rules everyone had decided on – a system that is truly decentralized and aimed toward empowering all?  As it turns out there is a name for this: mutual credit.  Also part of Future of Money Week:  The Transhumanist Case for Crypto – Daniel Kuhn  Shiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money- David Z. Morris  7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of Money - Jeff Wilser  The Downside of Programmable Money - Marc Hochstein  Ethereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse? -Edward Oosterbaan  Mutual credit systems (MCS) are a generalized IOU network to be used as a medium of exchange. An example would be Alice paying Bob for bread. Alice’s account is debited 20 (balance = -20) and Bob’s account is credited 20 (balance = +20). Notice how there was no fiat money used here; it was “created” out of trust between Alice and Bob. In an MCS, members accept the money created between Alice and Bob. This means Bob can spend Alice’s credit for other goods and services. No bank was needed here and the credit created here has zero interest to prevent those holding debts from using that debt as a way to accrue wealth. The community trusts its members to honor their promises and bear the risks together.  Mutual credit systems have historically had their own weaknesses, however. They have yet to be adapted for the 21st century by leveraging the internet, communication and cryptographic technology. At Koru we are building what we believe to be the future of monetary systems by infusing mutual credit with modern technology.  But what about bitcoin? An oversimplification of bitcoin would be to call it “digital gold.” It artificially creates scarcity to derive value and exists on a trustless network. In many ways bitcoin has many similarities to commodities in both strengths and weaknesses. Bitcoin allows transactions between unknown members; however, its supply is not dynamic enough to match an economy, which makes it deflationary.  Other altcoins have a more dynamic supply, but we have seen the same issue of deflation and speculation making them unsuitable for stability. Algorithmic stablecoins are very promising; however, they are pegged to a national currency, making them unsuitable as money replacements unless they find a better peg.  Bitcoin sees trust as an issue and employs an algorithm to manage the supply to enable trustless payments. Koru sees trust as a human feature, but the allocation of trust should be decentralized instead of held and managed by institutions. In reality, there is a right tool for every job, which is why Koru is designed to work with other cryptocurrencies to cover cases where trust is not possible.  Beyond money  Money is often entwined with politics and economics, the reason being that many desire to accrue wealth. The obsession with money has led to many issues among ourselves. One can only hope that the future is a place where consumption is balanced and the primary objective is not to acquire money. In the case of Koru, the store of value is not reflected in your bank balance but rather in your reputation of creditworthiness among your peers. Therefore to invest in your community is to invest into yourself. This may have an effect of moving today’s perception of security, influence and importance via money to your community.  By aligning social capital with financial capital, we hope humans will be focused on helping their neighbors rather than extracting an imaginary value known as money.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SHIB,Imran Ahmed,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/02/aligning-social-and-financial-capital-to-create-better-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffa30dd765646af3ab8e3c7231044caa175e68b0-2400x1799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, the system could also be used by bitcoin to help clean up the largest cryptocurrency’s dirty image, according to Filecoin Green’s creator, Alan Ransil.  “If bitcoin miners are interested, they could set up a database where their energy use and proof of renewable energy use are recorded,” said Ransil in an interview. “The open-source solutions we are building and helping to test – such as the Filecoin dashboard and the Energy Web tech stack – could be leveraged to set up such a system.”  Filecoin acknowledges decentralized data storage and retrieval is energy intensive as is also the case in the centralized Web 2 world of AWS and the like. The approach Filecoin has taken is to estimate energy use and assume the energy is not renewable until it has been verified through Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). This involves matching energy use to renewable energy generation on the same power grid.  Crypto’s carbon footprint  Stepping back, Filecoin Green’s mission is to measure environmental impacts across a more decentralized internet, and allow people in different positions in the value chain (such as storage providers or miners) to mitigate those impacts. At its core is a reputation system designed to be both verifiable and interoperable in a way that wasn’t possible in Web 2, Ransil says.  Hardened bitcoiners, weary of fielding energy consumption critics, are probably rolling their eyes by now – that’s if they’ve even read this far. But Filecoin has more in common with bitcoin than you might think.  Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate  Filecoin uses a proof-of-storage consensus system in which energy use is linked to a valuable resource people are providing that is central to the entire enterprise: storing files and verifying over time that those files are stored.  “There’s no proof-of-stake version in which the energy to store files goes to zero,” Ransil said, alluding to the non-mining consensus mechanism used to secure newer blockchain networks. “Using Filecoin is always going to use a fair amount of energy. So we want to set up our ecosystem to demand renewable energy. It should make us a player in energy markets, and act as a strategic wedge to push green power grids.”  Ransil pointed out that Filecoin has taken a different strategy from the way people make renewable energy claims right now in proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin. The latter’s claims tend to be based on surveys, which are then taken as representative of the entire network.  “This is interesting data to have as a starting point,” Ransil said. “But in an industry dedicated to rigorous verifiability we should aim for actual renewable energy use to be certified and publicly proven.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIL | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/02/filecoin-might-have-a-way-for-bitcoin-to-fight-its-energy-critics-if-miners-use-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/176f3c14161e8372a84bca049a3d12f35ff680ea-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394360,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDbX,1638453000,Is Crypto Becoming More Diverse?,"Financial advisors and the digital assets industry share a lot in common. They both deal with investments, technology, and the needs, wants, fears and concerns of people everywhere.  But they also share an unfortunate lack of diversity.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Only around one in five financial advisors are women, according to the CFP Board. Anecdotally, after years of talking to people in the space, I’ve come across only a handful of women in leadership roles in the digital assets industry.  Now, this may be as much technology’s fault as finance’s because diversifying tech in terms of both gender and race has been a decades-long struggle, just as it has in the financial industry. Perhaps the digital assets industry has inherited one of the worst attributes of both worlds – the relative lack of diversity of their participants.  A diversity issue in digital assets  “This is not a new world – blockchain and crypto are just part of it,” said Jacob Mullins, managing director of Shasta Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm active in the blockchain space.  Mullins, who was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, is active in trying to diversify the venture capital industry. “This is a problem endemic to the tech industry, to the venture capital industry and to the finance industry that will not and should not persist. We’re actively trying to fund founders of all diversities, whether it’s gender or race or others, but is there a magic wand we can wave to fix the problem? Unfortunately not. It has to be an everyday focus.”  Mullins believes the entire economy could be rebuilt on blockchain technology, presenting a new frontier that could be populated by a much more diverse mix of peoples than the traditional economy.  But that frontier is closing fast, and thus far the early stakeholders have been far from diverse. By educating new venture capitalists to promote more Black, Latino and female founders, Mullins believes he is supporting pioneers who can help open these spaces to more diverse populations.  “These are not simple point solutions, it’s about creating a sustainable system and sustainable engine where you can promote these groups as investors, and then that will also enable the entrepreneur base,” said Mullins. “It’s like creating a new node that can then invest in people who resonate with them. There are a lot of entrepreneurial initiatives going to the diverse founder set; we partner with diverse venture capitalists and other organizations that promote them. That’s how we make hands-on, day-to-day change.”  This is a problem women in crypto recognize as well, particularly women of color, entrepreneur Tavonia Evans told Reuters last month, pointing towards women’s difficulty both in raising capital and awareness.  “There are quite a few women leaders in the crypto space who are well respected, who command strong influence within the space and have credibility with policy makers,” Evans said. “Their successes should draw other women to crypto.”  Diversity is key to crypto’s success  Greater diversity is often correlated with better financial performance and a better mix of ideas in finance. For those of us who invest in digital assets, it’s even more important. If we allow many women and minorities to be excluded from participating in digital assets, we throttle both the potential growth of our communities and the value of our assets.  But part of the sell for crypto assets has always been their benefit to diverse and disadvantaged communities, providing financial services to the unbanked and potentially clearing away a parasitic secondary financial system, like payday lenders, that has long fed on the working class. If these communities don’t have access to digital assets and a stake in their success, then part of crypto’s social potential will be lost.  I’m not alone in noticing the diversity issue in digital assets. Athan Slotkin, an investor, serial entrepreneur and business plan strategist, pointed to a lack of diversity in cryptocurrencies, describing a “crypto bro culture” that may be closing parts of the industry to women and minorities.  “I wouldn’t call it the boiler room kind of toxic bro culture, but it is 95% male, and all the features and interests tend to skew male, which creates a difficult environment for women to break into,” Slotkin said. “It appears uncomfortable, it’s a fast-moving, intense and very aggressive community; that alone means it doesn’t make for a very welcoming environment.”  Even though individual people are welcoming, outsiders have more difficulty finding support, information and funding to launch their own ideas using digital assets or blockchain technology, said Slotkin.  “You have to think that as the world goes towards being more blockchain-oriented, just as women are making more purchasing and financial decisions than men, it would probably behoove us to ensure that women are represented,” he said.  Slotkin has also noticed a lack of diversity in the non-fungible token (NFT) universe, where most artists and collectors tend to be male.  “I think we need to consciously invest in women’s projects and help them build communities in their projects,” he said. “Even if we’re not the intended audience, we can still support and take a back seat to the women in the community sometimes.”  Women-led projects include Evans’ guapcoin, a cryptocurrency intended to raise the economic profile of African Americans; Lightning Labs, a woman-led firm creating smart-contract technology; and the Bancor Protocol establishing convertible “Smart Tokens” that are governed by smart contracts.  And women like Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, serial executive Blythe Masters and former Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley have long staked women’s claim to a piece of the digital assets pie.  Groups like the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, SheFi and Women in Blockchain are also working to close the crypto investing and entrepreneur gap. There is a lot at stake. If women don’t embrace digital assets as early as possible, then they miss out on the best chances for outsized returns, which would likely widen a persistent global gender wealth gap.  Both Mullins and Slotkin argue that the digital assets space needs its own version of Girls Who Invest and Girls Who Code – two nonprofit organizations working to educate school-age girls in communities and foster an interest in finance and technology in hopes of creating more gender parity.  The industry moving forward  But Slotkin said the industry also needs to reposition itself to appeal to more diverse groups.  “How do you really bring more women into finance and technology? You need to start with examples of successful women and pioneers,” he said. “Grassroots initiatives need to start happening. We need more products and positions representing different kinds of people. It wouldn’t do to try to make something that’s just interesting to women as a whole, but products that appeal to a range of diverse people.”  “The best way to do that is to have diverse people actually creating those products. Men don’t know what it is like to be a woman. We need women to be designing products and running projects, and it’s the same for any other group in the country.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/02/is-crypto-becoming-more-diverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f79fcad5e629b4701b74186776a59731a16171bb-3648x2432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394368,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcEBR,1638453000,An Advisor’s Guide to Popular Crypto Wallets,"The volatile nature of cryptocurrency makes it one of the most intriguing speculative investments today. The trademark scarcity of bitcoin, in particular, has given it the reputation of “digital gold.”  Just like with any physical item of value, crypto investors should practice good digital security habits similar to putting large sums of cash in a safe or a savings account insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). When storing crypto, investors may keep smaller sums hosted directly on whatever exchange (i.e., a digital trading platform) they use. They can also choose to move their crypto off platform and into a crypto wallet. The wallet may be software connected to the internet (aka a “hot wallet”) or be an offline hardware device (aka “cold storage”).  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  “A lot of people bought cryptocurrency for the first time this year,” said Brittney Castro, a Los Angeles-based certified financial planner and founder of the media company Financially Wise. Millions of new investors are therefore learning about wallets.  What to do starting out  Step one for any crypto newcomer, according to Castro, is learning how both exchanges and wallets even work. One of the most popular exchanges for beginners, Coinbase, has been around since 2012 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. Coinbase allows users to buy/sell over 100 unique cryptos, which is a good starting point for most.  Step two is deciding how to store your crypto coins long-term. Advisors and financial planners should plan on helping clients decide what their personal approach or philosophy is, said Castro. If your clients plan to hold a large amount of crypto, for instance, they should research cold storage options. Cold storage is effectively a piece of hardware (sort of like a crypto USB drive) that functions as a digital safe.  However, if your clients just plan to spend a few hundred dollars buying and selling crypto, it’s probably OK for them to keep their coins on a trusted exchange, such as Gemini, that uses its own mix of hot and cold storage.  And finally, for those in-between sums that your clients still want to protect but also retain easy access to – say $500 to a few thousand dollars, depending on your client’s risk tolerance – a hot wallet is the most convenient choice. Each option has its own list of features and security protocols. Some even have a private version of insurance that works similar to FDIC insurance for traditional bank accounts.  Here’s a list of some popular crypto wallets for beginners. (This isn’t a comprehensive list, but rather a place to start. Crypto is an emerging technology, so encourage your clients to research thoroughly and keep safety top of mind.)  Free crypto wallet for beginners: Exodus  Exodus is a free crypto wallet that lets users access and store over 100 types of cryptocurrencies. (Trading fees do apply, like always.) The wallet lacks some bells and whistles that advanced investors might find imperative, but it comes with a simple user interface and built-in exchange, similar to Coinbase.  For clients looking for consistent customer service, Exodus also has them covered with 24/7 human support. However, the tech for this wallet is closed-source, which for some sort of goes against the decentralized ethos of crypto, and not everyone may like relying on the Exodus team for the security of their crypto.  Most popular crypto wallet: Coinbase  “Coinbase is definitely a place to start,” said Alexis Johnson, president of the blockchain public relations and events company Light Node Media. “It’s a wallet and an exchange as well.”  However, Coinbase has a limited supply of altcoins (non-bitcoin cryptos). Users will likely be able to buy/sell the most popular altcoins listed on the CoinDesk 20, which range in market cap and utility. Coinbase itself lists over 100 cryptocurrencies, yet there are thousands of altcoins investors can choose to buy and sell – and the number goes up every day.  Some altcoins are considered currency, whereas others, like ethereum, have more advanced functionality like smart contracts. Meanwhile, coins like Cardano’s ADA are thought of more like buying stocks in a promising new blockchain. And stablecoins like tether are cryptocurrencies tied to a fiat currency (in tether’s case, the U.S. dollar).  Choosing altcoins all goes back to my earlier point about knowing your clients’ crypto philosophy. Once your clients become more seasoned, they’ll likely have an idea as to which altcoins they want to buy, and why. Then, it may be time to branch out from their Coinbase wallet, said Johnson. In that case, have them research a more robust option.  Popular wallet for altcoins, DeFi and dapps: MetaMask  MetaMask’s wallets make popular hot wallet options for the Ethereum blockchain.  “For altcoins that are not listed on Coinbase, your best bet is MetaMask,” Johnson told CoinDesk.  Operating as an extension on popular internet browsers like Firefox and Chrome, MetaMask wallets don’t simply store digital coins. The functionality of MetaMask is nearly unparalleled, according to many crypto enthusiasts. MetaMask wallets allow users to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps) – two popular functions of the Ethereum blockchain which have utility in decentralized finance (DeFi).  A word of caution: MetaMask users were recently targeted in a phishing scam that prompted people to click phony advertisements that asked them for information on their wallet keys. Advise your clients to never give their key out to anyone and always go directly to the verified URLs to enter their information anywhere online.  Most popular cold wallet: Ledger  Ledger has two options for cold storage: the Nano X ($119) and the Nano S ($59).  The Ledger Nano X connects to devices with Bluetooth or USB through the Ledger desktop or mobile app. Meanwhile, the Nano S lacks Bluetooth capability, but both still support over 1,800 cryptocurrencies.  Bottom line  When exploring the best crypto wallets for your clients, don’t overwhelm them too much at first. Encourage them to try a few low-cost or free options with good security measures. Remember that the crypto community prefers open-source technology over closed-source, since coders can weigh in on potential security vulnerabilities that way. Your clients will likely start with an exchange such as Coinbase or Gemini, then move on to hot wallets when they buy more crypto than just a few hundred dollars’ worth. And when they’re ready to invest higher sums, steer them towards a cold storage solution with a slightly higher price tag and more robust security features.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/02/an-advisors-guide-to-popular-crypto-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e33b593e07d8e89442c8eeeda97cfc6a2bddd08-5271x3519.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The concept of liquidity provisioning, whether inbound or outbound, has quickly established itself as the essence for the burgeoning DeFi industry&apos;s continued growth, growing more than 1,000% since the March Covid market crash of 2020. However, as DeFi advances into the future at full speed, challenges to liquidity provisioning (LPing) continue to grow. A siloing effect has emerged in the industry due to a lack of interoperability between the different layer 2 and layer 1 solutions and their respective applications. Meanwhile, the success of liquidity provisioning is dependent on moving in and out of trade positions to maximize earnings at the slightest cost. Without interoperability solutions, transferring assets from different protocols on different layers becomes extremely difficult. This can ultimately discourage liquidity providers; the time and fees it takes to switch their LP position to one on another chain or layer may no longer be worth the new yield opportunity. Thus, users are unable to maximize their earnings, and the use case of liquidity provisioning falls short. Instrumental Finance presents a new solution that attempts to alleviate these interoperability problems for liquidity providers and the larger DeFi ...",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/how-instrumental-finance-corrects-challenges-in-liquidity-provisioning/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Kazakhstan has been facing severe electricity shortages, partly because of the influx of crypto miners in the country, but also because of pre-existing problems with its energy infrastructure. The national grid operator moved to ration electricity to crypto mines in September.  In November, the Ministry of Energy assured the industry that the government won’t restrict electricity to legal mines. But the rationing didn’t stop. Last month, miner Xive shut down a 2,500-rig facility in Kazakhstan because of energy shortages. Industry sources estimate legal mines with 200 to 500 megawatts of power have been cut off from the grid.  BitFuFu’s new machines have already arrived in the U.S., a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. The company previously told users that it was facing delays taking the machines through customs and transporting them to the mines because of the Thanksgiving holiday.  BitFuFu users have been watching their investments sit idly as the platform’s Kazakhstan facilities are offline.  One user told CoinDesk that BitFuFu’s machines have been completely offline for a little over one month, adding that he would leave the platform if it gave him his money back. Another said that disruptions started in mid-October and that they are worried, but not angry at the service. Users who spoke to CoinDesk refused to be named because their contracts with BitFuFu include anti-defamation clauses.  The mining platform acknowledged the problem stemming from Kazakhstan’s electricity rationing in an Oct. 14 Telegram message, saying it would compensate users by extending their contract for as long as their machines are offline.  According to the Financial Times estimates, BitFuFu has 80,000 rigs in Kazakhstan after moving there from China because of a government crackdown on crypto mining. A company spokesperson refused to comment on the estimate.  The BitFuFu spokesperson told CoinDesk the company might try to sell its machines in Kazakhstan, but hasn’t reached a decision yet.  BitFuFu is a platform that enables users to invest in mining without having to operate the facilities.

42396421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Fmu,1638431883,Large Traders Dominate DEXs as High Ethereum Fees Keep Retail Investors at Bay,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) came into existence to democratize finance, much like the internet made content accessible to everyone.  However, according to French digital assets data provider Kaiko, the adoption of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary remains restricted mainly to large traders, known as whales.  “Average trade sizes have increased on all DEXs over the past few months while the actual number of trades has stayed flat, which suggests that the profile of the average trader now skews more whale,” Kaiko said in a weekly research note published on Monday.  The average trade size on Curve Finance ranges from $500,000 to $1 million, while deals on other prominent DEXs such as Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, SushiSwap and Balancer V1 average between $10,000 and $20,000. That’s nearly 10 times larger than the average trade size of $2,000 to $4,000 seen on centralized exchanges (CEXs).  The daily trade count on CEXs, however, tallies into the millions while major DEXs process fewer than 50,000 deals per day, with Curve and Balancer V1 averaging fewer than 1,000 traders per day.  Kaiko analysts attributed whale dominance to the high transaction costs on Ethereum, the world’s largest blockchain for smart contracts.  “The large trades are likely due to Ethereum’s high transaction fees, which prevents more retail traders from using DEXs,” Kaiko’s weekly research note said. “Every trader on a DEX must pay Ethereum transaction fees for each trade, which frequently surpass $100 due to congestion and scalability issues.”  According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, DeFi’s growing popularity in wealthier countries is the main reason for DEXs processing much larger transactions than centralized platforms.  While several smart contract platforms facilitating cheaper and faster transactions such as Avalanche, Binance Chain, Polkadot and Solana have emerged over the past 12 months, Ethereum still leads the pack.  The total value locked in Ethereum-based DeFi applications stands at $178.5 billion. That’s more than nine times greater than Binance Chain’s TVL of $19.25 billion, data provided by Defi Llama shows.",NEGATIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/02/whales-dominate-dexs-as-high-ethereum-fees-keep-retail-investors-at-bay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e080e339e37e0df6ec4325003731bcf89e132354-1296x698.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Solice, a cross-platform PC and virtual reality (VR) game built in the mold of Decentraland and The Sandbox, announced the funding on Thursday. The round was led by Zhu Su’s Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital and Animoca Brands. Alameda Research, Jump Capital, Genblock Capital, KuCoin Labs, Solar Eco Fund, CMS Holdings, Rarestone Capital and others also participated.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Solice founder Christian Zhang said that the game will feature a native currency, as well as game assets backed by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The assets will also have in-game financialization elements.  “Landowners are able to stake parcels of land for an APY, but while staking there is a small chance to obtain rare loot. Users will have to complete a quest to upgrade the loot into a unique NFT,” he said.  Zhang is an industry veteran with experience at Fantom as well as in venture capital and consulting, and the VR development is being handled by an existing studio that has previously worked with companies like Baidu and Alibaba.  Zhang hopes that the new features and industry expertise will help Solice stand out in an increasingly crowded market that may be coasting on hype.  “Obviously gaming and NFTs have been taking off the past year,” said Zhang. “The only issue is, a lot of the projects out there, they have a good launch, but in the long term it’s important to look at a sustainable economic model.”  He pointed to Axie Infinity’s dual-token system as an inspiration and warned that many new projects emerging on the scene are “cash grabs” tacking blockchain features onto preexisting games that might not need or benefit from them.  “In the long run, if it doesn’t live up to the hype, it will slowly die down,” he said.  Read more: Axie Infinity Plot Sells for $2.5M  Solice’s token public token sale is currently on track to go live via multiple simultaneous initial exchange offerings (IEOs) in December, and a soft launch for the game is tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2022.  “Blockchain secures the immutability of our connection and access; VR brought us a new immersion that engages our senses,” Three Arrows founders Kyle Davies and Zhu Su said in a statement. “The metaverse offers a combination of both in what we might call a complete liberation of the human experience.”  UPDATE (Dec. 2, 14:45 UTC): Adds that DeFiance Capital and Animoca Brands co-led the funding round.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/02/three-arrows-leads-43m-round-for-solana-based-metaverse-project-solice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72b17ef19962e604e788bde6c896a1788328f2a8-1554x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Wednesday night an attacker drained funds from the wallets of dozens of users of the Badger DAO yield vault protocol using malicious contract permissions. Blockchain data and security analytics company PeckShield has concluded that the total loss amounted to about 2,100 BTC and 151 ETH.  Users first reported possible problems in the protocol’s channel on the Discord messaging app at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday. Speculation in online channels is that the hack is the result of an exploit in the Badger.com user interface, and not in the core protocol contracts. Many affected users report that while claiming yield farming rewards and interacting with Badger vaults, they noticed their wallet providers prompting spurious requests for additional permissions.  “It looks like a bunch of users had approvals set for the exploit address allowing [the address] to operate on their vault funds and that was exploited,” Badger core contributor Tritium wrote on Discord.  “Once we noticed we froze all the vaults so nothing can move and are trying to figure out where the approvals came from, how many people have them, and what next steps are,” he added.  Badger’s official social media channel confirmed the hack on Twitter:  A Badger representative didn’t respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.  While the bulk of the funds were drained Wednesday night, the malicious permission requests may have been made weeks prior to the attack. Though the protocol contracts are paused, community members are advising that depositors use tools like Debank and Unrekt to revoke permissions for the malicious contract.
