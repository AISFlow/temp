According to the email, the breach exposed “customer names, email addresses, residential addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, device IDs, public wallet addresses, transaction history, and account balances.” Although the email was sent Friday, Coinsquare discovered the breach last week and notified customers via Twitter.  “No passwords were exposed. We have no evidence any of this information was viewed by the bad actor,” the email stated.  Coinsquare suspended activities on its platform after detecting the vulnerability last week, triggering speculation of possible liquidity issues, given the momentous implosion of multi-billion-dollar crypto exchange, FTX, earlier this month. Full service was restored on Friday, according to a tweet.  “We want to reiterate that 100% of client funds are safely held in cold storage and are not used for business activities,” the company tweeted.
