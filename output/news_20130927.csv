42397267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4aP,1380295649,"Earn it, stash it, fritter it away: bitcoin's role in the journey of life","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 27th September 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Cashing in with cryptosalaries  Was it like this when money was invented? Imagine being a member of a tribe where you get your tools by giving the axe-maker a couple of goats, eat what you reap, and swap ten hours' stonework with a bloke from the next village for a handful of beads for the wife.  It all works well enough, until someone turns up with a handful of metal bits and says they're worth so many goats or so many arrowheads and why not make the leap?  Would you believe them? What if nobody else agreed? And what if the bloke from the next village would only give you metal bits in exchange for your work?  It's certainly like that for the early bitcoin pioneers – some of whom are now getting their salaries paid in BTC.  As Carrie Kirby reports, these hardy types aren't really getting much in return for their courage, but they're not losing out either.  If you've got enough old-fashioned money to make your cryptocurrency earnings part of a balanced portfolio, don't mind the extra paperwork at tax time, and live somewhere with a nascent bitcoin economy, it's actually quite fun.  It's a bit self-selecting. You have to have a pioneer's mindset not only to want to do this, but to enjoy the less-obvious results.  For once you've got a regular supply of bitcoins, the real problem is spending them on quotidian life items – rent, food, clothes, transport – and mostly, you can't do that. So you have to go out and make that happen, persuading local suppliers to start accepting the things.  The good news is that in places where bitcoin pioneers live, so do open-minded vendors. Bitcoin salarymen and salarywomen report that restaurants, bars and other small businesses are happy to take their digital money, once the details are explained and the mechanics sorted out.  Then the real rewards start, at least for the true pioneers, because once a business is in business as a bitcoin business, it's open to anyone to spend that way.  With a lot of the original objections to BTC drifting into history, the big question is how and why do the non-geeks get on board.  Getting small businesses signed up will answer a big part of that, and having people paid in bitcoin prepared to help that happen is just one more link in the chain.  After all, it worked before. When was the last time you bought a can of Coke with a goat?  Million-dollar mouseclick  One thing that was well-established long before money: gambling.  It's widely accepted that hunter-gatherer societies, far from living on the edge of starvation, only had to spend two or three hours a day actually hunting or gathering.  The rest of the time was their own: it wasn't until the Neolithic Revolution created agriculture that work expanded to fill all the hours available. John Law has yet to be persuaded that this was necessarily a good move.  So what did our idle ancestors do? Gamble.  Still a very big thing with nomadic societies, it encourages social cohesion, emphasises the role of chance in life, and when structured well helps distribute useful things while rewarding a careful approach to risk management. It's a model of useful work, and thus useful in its own right.  Bitcoin-powered games of chance may not be totally wholesome engines of society, but there are some intriguing parallels. A good case in point is Just-Dice, where you can throw a bunch of bitcoin into the pot to win or lose in a very straightforward and open manner.  It's very much like a game around a table, in that it's fast, very easy to join, and brings groups of strangers together.  What's more, the Just-Dice system is set up so that the house has a one percent advantage – if you play for long enough as a punter, you'll get 99 percent of your money back, with the tantalising chance of a big win.  Or you can join the house, putting a lump of bitcoin in as part of its liquidity, getting 101 percent back over time, with increasing certainty the longer you stay in – and the option of pulling out after some other punter's unlucky streak. Luck is a two-way process.  Lately, there's been something a bit more – the biggest win in bitcoin history. In one weekend, one gambler called Nakowa scored nearly 11,000 bitcoin, comfortably over a million dollars' worth.  Of course, not everyone believes that story. There's certainly a colourful history both of Just-Dice and Nakowa's interactions with the site: he's been gambling intensively and with varying amounts of success for quite some time.  But is he a group of gamblers, using their combined bank to try and score a big win? An insider? Just lucky? Choose your story.  There are lots of reasons why bitcoin is popular in online gambling – uniquely so.  If you can program web stuff, you can open a bitcoin casino. You don't need all that legal stuff that comes with real money, you can be anonymous, you can be a one-man band. And there are plenty of people with plenty of bitcoin from the early days, when it was easy to mine or cheap to buy.  Cashing out a million dollars' worth may not be a good idea, and there are only so many gins you can buy in hip Hoxton drinkeries.  Hunter gatherers gamble because it's good for their group and, through choice, they've got nothing better to do: a geek with all the online-ordered pizza they can eat and a giant stash of BTC may well be driven by the same curiously non-Galbraithian aspirations.  Just-Dice has done rather well out of such factors. It's been going for around three months, and has clocked up $160 million in bets, which makes the one percent house edge worth roughly what Nakowa has trousered.  But he or they are still betting away; if the maths is right, then most of that money will come back to the site over time.  It's the curious mix of transparency, anonymity and personality that makes the story so compelling: nobody knows who anyone is, but the process is utterly visible, the creator of the site – Dooglus – and Nakowa both have active, approachable, loquacious online persona, the maths behind the site is fully described, and the whole thing has the same engaging street-level vibe as your favourite punk band.  It's just that most punk bands don't do over a hundred million dollars worth of business in their first quarter's trading.  Like punk, it's best to enjoy these entertainments while they last. For if bitcoin is successful and becomes mainstream, then it may be the Neolithic Revolution all over again.  The early hunter gatherers will slide off into history – or, as the !Kung and Inuit have, fade into other undeveloped lands.  The rest of us working stiffs will be left with dreams of million-dollar wins that don't seem to mean very much, even if we do collect our salaries in the same cybercurrency that once made some punk rich.  Anarchy in the IP  The mainstream media – MSM, in hipsterspeak – had a whale of a time earlier this year when another young punk created and fired The Liberator, a plastic gun mostly built with 3D printing.  Moreover, the plans were put on the web. Is this the end of gun control? Quiet nights? Civilisation? Well, no: it remains quicker and easier to make a gun from household items and the tricky business of making ammunition remains beyond the scope of the sort of printer you can lash together with bits from Maplin.  But the 25-year-old creator of the plastic doom-machine has got a taste for publicity: as an ardent liberarian who dreams of the state 'simply fading away', Cody Wilson has now turned his attention to bitcoin.  He funded a lot of the Liberator's development through bitcoin, when his chosen crowdsourcing site threw him off for arms dealing (nonsense, he said, it's just information).  And as someone who is both smart and market-savvy, he has correctly identified one of the reasons that BTC is still a minority interest. It's too darned hard to use.  His solution, which is a good one, is to build what he calls a Dark Wallet in conjunction with a bunch of like-minded coders.  What sets this apart from existing wallets is that it will be a browser plug-in working with Firefox or Chrome, making it largely platform-independent and potentially extremely simple to get going.  Wilson's libertarianisn has set him at odds with all those who are working to make bitcoin part of the existing financial mainstream – he calls them counter-revolutionaries who are trying to uphold crony capitalism.  For their part, the lawyers, financiers and other pro-bitcoiners in suits tend to disagree.  John Law, being a veteran of such noisy fights, merely notes that since Dark Wallet is going to be open-source and open to everyone, it doesn't really matter what people's motivations are.  It matters somewhat more that it has a really simple user interface and doesn't scare your granny, and that detail remains to be be seen.  Crypto-anarchists, even really keen ones with a knack for being oddly media-friendly, are rarely strong on design.  Bitcoin may or may not need another William Godwin, but it could surely do with its own Steve Jobs.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Md,1380289141,"TerraHash shuts down, bitcoin miners upset with 50% refund","ASIC bitcoin miner manufacturer TerraHash has told customers that it has gone out of business. The company is now facing legal action from at least two customers, CoinDesk has learned.  The California-registered corporation announced on the Bitcointalk forum that several problems had caused it to cease trading.  “The failure of the Klondike project was one. Chase, our bank, shut down our accounts. Also the delay in the shipment of the chips has resulted in a lot of customers asking for [a] refund,” said someone using the TerraHash account in the official TerraHash forum.  “We already owe a lot of money to PayPal, and with all the refund requests, it is impossible for us to continue our operation profitably. So we have decided to dissolve the company.”  The company was one of several that was awaiting processor shipments from BitSynCom, which has repeatedly delayed shipments of the Avalon ASICs. It was to use Klondike, a third-party board developer for the ASICs, to house them.  TerraHash, which did not reply to CoinDesk's request for comment, said in the forum that it would be requesting a refund from Yifu Guo, founder of Avalon ASIC, at which point it would begin refunding orders.  “We will be able to refund about 50% of every order with this amount. We are trying to get our money out of Chase, which will help us refund another ~5% of each order,” TerraHash continued, adding that it would send additional pro-rated payments to each customer as it got more money back.  What seems clear at this point is that some of the money has been spent, and many customers will only be getting a proportion of their payments back. A crowdsourced spreadsheet showing TerraHash orders has been produced here.  TerraHash had been bullish about its business as recently as three weeks ago, when it announced a hosted mining service, offering up to 2 petahashes of capacity, to come onstream in November. It was negotiating with a manufacturer of 28nm ASICs at the time, it said.  The company had begun taking pre-orders in June, and then closed them again, before subsequently opening preorders for an assembly service for people who had their own chips, requesting a 5% deposit.  The closure leaves many out of pocket, and angry at the company. “It’s a big mess,” said Emmanuel Abiodun, founder of UK-based hosted mining firm CloudHashing, who had placed orders with the firm. He has now started legal proceedings against individuals associated with the company, he told CoinDesk.  “The biggest issue with TerraHash is they did not do a good job keeping their customers informed. The updates were few and far between,” said Michael Andrews, a computer consultant who had ordered $11,500 of equipment from the company on June 18 via PayPal and American Express, and had not yet received a refund.  “I also had issues with TerraHash changing their return policy. It was never proven to me if they changed it before or after the orders went out,” he said. “But I remember it reading we could get refunds up until the day they ship the product. That changed to ‘no refunds’.”  TerraHash changed its returns policy sometime in early July, stipulating that all orders were final, and refunds would be considered on an individual basis. FTC rules stipulate that merchants must provide refunds when the customer exercises any option to cancel before the merchandise is shipped, or when the merchant decides that it will never be able to ship the merchandise.  Andrews said that he would not pursue legal action, because he believes that American Express will refund his money. Three weeks ago, when he tried negotiating with American Express, TerraHash told the card company that it was still going to ship products.  He advises others to use a credit card when pre-ordering products. “I know we are all in the bitcoin world and we should embrace bitcoin as a transaction medium, but there has not been a single ASIC manufacturer that has earned enough trust to use a non-refundable medium like bitcoin,” he argues. “Delays of weeks or months can cause a bitcoin miner to become worthless and will not [deliver an] ROI.”  TerraHash’s website was still up at the time of writing, with no update on the cessation in sales, although the shop was listing products as out of stock.  The last update from Avalon at the time of writing was on 19 August, when it said that it was shipping around 40,000 ASIC miners per day. Refunds were also being processed, it said.  Bitcointalk member Zurg said that he wired the company $950 on Monday 22nd of July for a K64 mining board, and made another identical order, meaning that he is currently $1,900 out of pocket (orders #1213 and #1336 in the spreadsheet). “Had absolutely zero replies to refund since August,” he said.  Another Bitcointalk member, Bargraphics (orders 432 and 452 in the spreadsheet), told CoinDesk that he would also pursue legal action against the company.  TerraHash, Inc (entity number C3566232) was still listed as Active in the California company registry early this morning, meaning that the state has not yet registered any dissolution papers from the company’s directors. No bankruptcy filings for TerraHash, Inc or its known director, Amir Khan, could be found for this month in California or anywhere else in the US, as of 4am UK time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/09/27/terrahash-shuts-down-bitcoin-miners-upset-with-50-refund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4ba468377b9a977f1aa7297476e15842442da27-864x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397255,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Le,1380274057,Germany's government and media are bolstering bitcoin popularity,"Berlin has long been seen as something of a hub of bitcoin activity, but Germany as a whole has lagged slightly behind the UK in terms of bitcoin popularity… until now.  For the first six months of the year, the UK was home to a higher number of downloads of the original bitcoin client (Bitcoin-Qt) than Germany. Since then, Germany has taken the lead, with 19,248 Bitcoin-Qt downloads taking place in the country from 1st July to the time of writing, compared with 16,826 in the UK.  Those based in Germany have also been giving CoinDesk more attention over the past few months. In June and July, our fifth biggest audience was the Germans, moving up the ranks to fourth between August 1st and today.  Germany-based exchange Bitcoin.de has also experienced a surge in local traffic recently. Oliver Flaskämper, managing director of Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH, which operates Bitcoin.de, said the press is partly to thank for this.  He thinks the media's attitude towards bitcoin has become a lot more positive over recent months, which has helped to improve the public perception of digital currency.  ""While previously only the most negative associations, such as buying drugs on the internet, were discussed, more is now written about the growth of bitcoin acceptance,"" Flaskämper added.  Bitcoin regulation in Germany  He also puts bitcoin's recent growth in Germany down to the government's decision to take a stance on digital currency. Last month, BaFin (the German ministry of finance) announced it does not consider bitcoin to be e-money or a functional currency. Instead, it referred to it as ""private money"" and a ""financial instrument"".  This made Germany the first country in the world to have a clear-cut set of rules applicable to bitcoins, enabling companies in the space to carry out their business safe in the knowledge they are operating within the applicable guidelines.  Just last week, Bitcoin.de received confirmation from BaFin that it has no objections to the exchange's partnership with Fidor Bank. The partnership means customers will soon be able to trade on bitcoin.de in near real-time using a free FidorPay giro account.  Elsewhere in the world, bitcoin companies have been facing problems when it comes to finding banking partners. For example, US company Tradehill recently had to cease bitcoin trading due to ""operational and regulatory issues"" faced by its bank – the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union.  For now, bitcoin's status in Germany has been decided upon, which has somewhat legitimised the digital currency. Stefan Greiner, of German law firm Xenion Legal, said he has no idea whether legislation around bitcoin will be discussed in the future but said discussions seem to be on hold at the moment as a new government is being formed.  However, he believes the biggest risk for the bitcoin community in Germany still comes from within the government in the form of ""these elderly bureaucrats and politicians who think the credit card is the greatest invention of all time (in financial services) and that there's nothing to add to it"".  Merchant acceptance  Merchant acceptance of bitcoin in Germany, or at least Berlin, is going from strength to strength.  Joerg Platzer, who runs ""the first bricks and mortar business in the world that accepted bitcoin"" (bar/restaurant ROOM77), said he has seen a massive increase in the number of customers who pay in bitcoin.  ""From about one [customer] a month about 2.5 years ago when we first started, it has increased steadily to up to ten a day,"" he explained.  Platzer, who is also a founding member of the Berlin-based Crypto Currency Consulting Group, said Germany has a very large and innovative bitcoin community centred in Berlin's 'Bitcoin Kiez'. This neighbourhood is home to a number of merchants that accept bitcoin and host digital currency events. He added:  ""The shops, events and people living here are giving bitcoin high visibility and inspiring a lot of people to look into bitcoin. It is really the network effect starting up.""  German online game developer Bigpoint only started accepting bitcoin payments last week, but has already processed a few transactions ranging between $2 (around 0.016 bitcoins) and $100 (around 0.804 bitcoins).  The company's CEO Khaled Helioui said he's not surprised Berlin is emerging as a bitcoin hub because it has long been a hotbed of startups.  ""I can see bitcoins getting traction there as there is no specific attachment to local currency, extremely high international diversity and really high tech/digital penetration and savviness,"" he added.  Innovation  One company that has been closely following the rise of bitcoin in Germany is Bit-Card, which was founded in February of this year.  The company produces paper wallets, but in the form of coloured plastic cards that are the same size as a credit card. As well as empty wallets, the company sells pre-paid versions, which come already loaded with the user's selected amount of bitcoins. They can also be customised to include the customer's name and a picture/background of their choice.  Carsten Unger, managing partner at Bit-Card said: ""In an effort to make Bit-Cards as secure as possible we use purpose build cards that are not only thicker than normal credit cards, but also contain a black core. On top there is a unique, tamper evident hologram and additional security to protect the private key.""  Bit-Card is starting to make a name for itself and has provided personalised Bit-Cards as conference passes for the attendees of the European Bitcoin Convention that is currently taking place in Amsterdam.  This is by no means the first bitcoin startup to come out of Germany, and certainly won't be the last. If the bitcoin scene in the country continues at its current velocity, it's plausible that it could become the world's bitcoin epicentre, so long as those ""elderly bureaucrats"" don't get too involved.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/27/germanys-government-and-media-are-bolstering-bitcoin-popularity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c42de76895e0344deb5fee05426b1a0eb020be9f-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
