42403365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfqvN,1571264575,Telegram Looks to Cut Deal With TON Blockchain Investors After SEC Order,"Telegram has notified investors that the TON blockchain project will be launched later than planned, pushing the deadline from Oct. 30 to April 30, 2020.  In an email to investors reviewed by CoinDesk, Telegram cited its recent run-in with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which obtained a restraining order prohibiting the messenger app company from launching TON and issuing gram tokens. The agency deemed grams to be unregistered securities.  The email, which was sent recently to investors in the second of Telegram's two $850 million fundraising round from early 2018, says:  ""We had intended to launch the TON network in late October. However, the recent SEC lawsuit has made that timing unachievable. We disagree with the SEC’s legal position and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. We are proposing to extend the deadline date in order to provide additional time to resolve the SEC’s lawsuit and work with other governmental authorities in advance of the launch of the TON network.""  The additional time will be an advantage for companies working on applications for the TON network, Telegram said.  The deadline can be extended with the consent of investors holding a majority of the tokens bought in the round, the email says.  The two groups of investors, those who bought tokens in February 2018 and those who did so in March 2018, will need to approve the extension separately, and it’s possible that one group agrees to postpone while the other refuses:  ""In these circumstances, we propose to make certain limited amendments to the terms of the purchase agreements that remain in place to reflect the fact that fewer Grams will be issued and in circulation on the Network Launch Date.""  Investors in the second round must sign a form approving the extension before Oct. 23. If the majority chooses not to sign, these investors can get back ""approximately 77 percent"" of their money.  The first-round investors received ""a separate communication"" from Telegram, the letter says.  If the deadline is extended, Telegram plans to spend another $80 million before April 30.  ""We look forward to receiving your support to ensure we can proceed with our vision for TON,"" the letter concludes.  On Oct. 11, the SEC obtained an emergency restraining order to halt the launch of TON. Soon after the company notified investors it might postpone the planned end-of-October launch to resolve the situation.  A court hearing in the case is scheduled on Oct. 24 in New York.

42403373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfqyK,1571261414,Top Fed Official Says US Central Bank 'Actively' Debating Digital Dollar,"A top Federal Reserve official said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank is ""actively looking at and debating"" issuance of a digital currency, amid growing worries among current and former regulators that the dollar might be at risk of losing its status as the world's reserve currency.  Speaking at a local business event in Austin, Texas, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Rob Kaplan said:  ""We have not at the Fed decided to pursue or drive to develop a digital currency, but it’s something we’re actively looking at and debating.""  A former Goldman Sachs executive with the most extensive capital-markets experience among members and alternates on the Fed's key monetary-policy committee, Kaplan said the U.S. could suffer higher interest costs if a foreign government or another entity developed an alternative currency that received widespread adoption.  His comments came after former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo wrote in an op-ed piece that called for the U.S. to create a digital currency to avoid the risk that the dollar might lose its reserve status. Giancarlo now serves as an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a trade group focused on blockchain and crypto policy.  Because of the dollar's prominent role in international commerce and the dominant U.S. leadership position in global affairs over the past century, many foreign central banks, commercial banks and investors hold assets denominated in the American currency.  If that stopped happening due to the existence of an attractive and viable alternative, the thinking goes, then demand for U.S. assets such as Treasury bonds would shrink, in turn pushing up interest rates on the national debt, which is now approaching an unprecedented $23 trillion.  Kaplan noted that the U.S. government's interest payments could jump by some $200 billion if a loss of the reserve-currency status sent interest rates jumping by a single percentage point, or 100 basis points in the lingo of bond traders.  In response to a question from CoinDesk, Kaplan said:    ""It just reinforces, the dollar may not be the world’s reserve currency forever, and if that changes, and you tack on 100 basis points to $20 trillion, with relatively short average life, that’s a lot of money.""      ""It’s $200 billion a year and all of a sudden we've got a tremendous problem here, so it’s something we’re watching very closely.”    Fed Chair Jerome Powell and some U.S. lawmakers warned earlier this year that Facebook's plan to develop a digital currency, Libra, could instantly become so popular that it might displace the dollar and undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system.  Yet those concerns have faded recently as some top corporate backers of the project, including the payment networks Mastercard and Visa, have withdrawn their support.  ""I noticed Libra seems to be receding at the moment,"" Kaplan said. But ""somebody’s going to figure out how to do this.""  Kaplan said he talks to many foreign officials in his Fed role:  ""People around the world are working real hard to try to find alternatives to dollars and dollar infrastructure because the more they're invested in that, the more susceptible they are to sanctions, tariffs and what's going on right now.""  The U.S. trade war with China has weighed on the global economy, according to the International Monetary Fund, while agreements with other large trading partners, including Mexico, Canada and European countries have been upended or back on the table to be renegotiated.  The U.S. Treasury Department has also imposed stiff sanctions on regimes perceived as unfriendly or corrupt, including Iran and Venezuela.  Kaplan said:  ""I still think for the foreseeable future, the dollar will be the world reserve currency, we're able to refinance our debt at relatively low rates, but I don't think we should take that for granted.""

42403370,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfqxL,1571250656,French Central Banker: The World Needs to Standardize Crypto Regulations,"A French central banker is calling for a global regulatory framework on crypto assets.  In a speech  at an Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) meeting in London on Tuesday, Denis Beau, a deputy governor of Banque De France, said:  “There is indeed a need for overall consistency to prevent regulatory arbitrage under the ‘same activities, same risks, same rules’ principle.""  And the only way to ensure that, he said, is with a standardized regulatory regime.  The comments come as Libra, the Facebook-led digital currency project, has raised the ire of regulators and central banks as a threat to the financial world order.  Comparing Libra to central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDC), Beau said the yet to be launched coin “may achieve significant market power, thus posing risks to security and financial stability.”  Beau did not offer any direct answers to Libra’s challenge, other than to note the need for global regulations and hopes that central banks will experiment with CBDCs of their own.  He was bullish on the technology. In a global financial ecosystem reliant on costly, and often cumbersome, money transfer mechanisms, Beau said that distributed ledger technology ""could help remedy” many of the current issues.  But tokens available today cannot fill that niche, he said. Cryptocurrencies are generally too volatile and pricey to transfer funds effectively and lack the government backing he said is necessary to become a trustworthy store of value, Beau said.  “They can also bring material risks to our payment systems which, if unaddressed, might introduce new sources of fragmentation, instability and fraud.”  That should give central bankers reason to consider new ways to offer their money supply, he said.  “The potential role of a wholesale CBDC is, in my view, worth considering, if not desirable.”  Bank of France image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/16/french-central-banker-the-world-needs-to-standardize-crypto-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c30cf93b718baa8d077f24c53f8b6dfb35d4c68-1500x942.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal published Oct. 15, J. Christopher Giancarlo, former CFTC chair, and Daniel Gorfine, former director of LabCFTC, the watchdog’s experimental initiative, proposed a blockchain protocol to digitize cash To allow the dollar to compete “in the new digital era.”  Their USD-backed stablecoin is envisioned for daily transactions both domestically and abroad.  Created and administered by a non-governmental group, the program would be dependent on participation from the Federal Reserve, commercial banks, nonbank intermediaries, technology companies and social-media platforms.  Though reliant on “trusted, regulated intermediaries to maintain digital wallets and validate transactions,” this distributed ledger payment system would hold advantages over the current monetary system.  In particular, Giancarlo and Gorfine highlighted the higher transaction speeds, the ability to make micropayments, as well as increased security and transparency enabled by cryptocurrencies.  Beginning with a pilot, Giancarlo and Gorfine recognize that “no perfect solution exists to address the challenges and promises of digital currency, nor can anyone predict all the technological advances these efforts will generate.”  At the practical level, cash exchanged for these digital units could be escrowed by the Fed. They also point to the possibility of having multiple competing wallet providers.  Giancarlo and Gorfine warned that ongoing experimentation with cryptocurrencies by central banks and corporate actors could “erode the dollar’s status as the most popular currency for international exchange.”  According to the ex-regulators, the risks of letting the greenback lose monetary supremacy are systematic. Price stability, efforts to combat illicit finance and the global appetite for U.S. government debt would all falter.  Gorfine left LabCFTC  in August after spearheading the upstart agency to found Gattaca Horizons, a consultancy group for fintech firms.  Following a five-year stint at the CFTC, where he took a “do no harm” stance towards blockchain oversight, Giancarlo joined as an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a trade group focused on blockchain and crypto policy in the U.S., last month.

Jong Woo Son, 23, the owner of the Welcome to Video (WTV) site has also been charged and convicted in South Korea and is currently in custody serving his sentence there, the Department of Justice said.  The DOJ said 337 site users, including law enforcement officers, from 22 U.S. states and 11 countries around the world were arrested.  The operation resulted in searches of residences and businesses of 92 individuals in the U.S. The investigation has also led to the rescue of at least 23 minor victims residing in the U.S., Spain and the U.K., who were actively being abused by the users of the site.  WTV offered these videos for sale using bitcoin, rather than simply sharing the videos and images over a chat forum. According to the indictment, the site claimed more than a million downloads of child exploitation videos by its users.  Each user received a unique bitcoin address to create an account on the website. An analysis of the server revealed that the website had more than one million bitcoin addresses, signifying that the website had capacity for at least one million users.  A forfeiture complaint was also unsealed today. Law enforcement was able to trace payments of bitcoin to the Darknet site by following the flow of funds on the blockchain.

The virtual currency accounts identified in the complaint were allegedly used by 24 individuals in five countries to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children. The forfeiture complaint seeks to recover these funds and, ultimately through the restoration process, return the illicit funds to victims of the crime.  Chainalysis said that with the site’s listed bitcoin address, IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations were able to use Chainalysis Reactor to analyze transaction activity and build a graph showing the flow of funds in and out of the WTV address.  Know Your Customer (KYC) processes  enabled many of the exchanges involved to provide investigators copies of identification, addresses, and other relevant transactions associated with those accounts. In cases where that was insufficient, account information combined with open source intelligence and standard investigative techniques were enough to identify users.  Chainalysis  said in a statement:  ""We want to enable an entire economy powered by cryptocurrency, but sites like WTV destroy the public’s faith in the technology and slow down adoption in the legitimate economy. Fighting against them is a step in the right direction.""  Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Brian Benczkowski, said:  “Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior. This Administration will not allow child predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield.""  Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu said:  ""Our message for those who produce, distribute and receive child pornography is clear: you may try to hide behind technology, but we will find you, and we will arrest and prosecute you.""  On March 5, 2018, agents from the U.K., and Korean National Police in South Korea arrested Son and seized the server that he used to operate a Darknet market that exclusively advertised child sexual exploitation videos available for download by members of the site.  The operation resulted in the seizure of approximately eight terabytes of child sexual exploitation videos, which is one of the largest seizures of its kind. The website was also among the first of its kind to monetize child exploitation videos using bitcoin.  The images contained over 250,000 unique videos, and 45 percent of the videos currently analyzed contain new images that have not been previously known to exist.  The Indicted  The DOJ said that two WTV users in the Washington, D.C. area committed suicide after being served search warrants. In that metropolitan area, five search warrants were executed and eight people were arrested for conspiring with the administrator of the site, as well as for being its users.  Among the 36 Americans named in the indictment, at least three were federal law enforcement employees who had been arrested earlier in this long-term investigation.  Former U.S. Navy Petty Officer Don Edward Pannell, II, 32, of Harvey, Louisiana, was arrested in April and plead guilty in August. Pannell was assigned to Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic Detachment, New Orleans, and was also identified via his bitcoin use.  HSI computer forensic examiners found more than 1,000 images and 125 videos depicting the sexual victimization of children on Pannell’s home-built tower computer. The images and videos depicted pre-pubescent girls, including toddlers, engaged in sexual acts with adults.  Pannell faces five to 20 years in prison, up to a life term of supervised release, and a $250,000.00 fine, as well as registering as a sex offender. U.S. District Judge Greg G. Guidry will sentence him on Dec. 17.  Former HSI agent Richard Nikolai Gratkowski, 40 at the time, was sentenced in May to 70 months in federal prison on child pornography charges. The investigation showed that Gratkowski, in San Antonio, received hundreds of videos of pre-pubescent children engaged in a variety of sexual acts and had also bought access with cryptocurrency.  U.S. Border Patrol Agent Paul Casey Whipple was arrested, also, in San Antonio in December, 2017, for producing and sharing child pornography over the site. FBI agents determined the videos were produced in Hondo, TX, going back to 2015.

A digital ID solution for citizens, businesses and government bodies, the Perseid e-ID project is being carried out in partnership with identity program Perseid Network and decentralized credential verification protocol Shyft Network.  According to a press release from Shyft on Wednesday, phase 1 entails the establishment of the Perseid base layer to begin onboarding smart contracts such as Shyft Network’s Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) solution, as well as data and compliance criteria.  Bruce Silcoff, CEO at Perseid, said:  “When e-IDs are used in conjunction with a compliance-based regulatory framework and paired with best-in-class technology solutions, e-IDs can create a digital identity authentication mechanism and bridge for the residents of Bermuda to permission the exchange of attested data attached to that e-ID.""  While Perseid will build the higher level identity management infrastructure, effectively taking the base-layer smart contracts and infrastructure of external partners to make a packaged deployment system for the government, Shyft is handling the underlying blockchain tech, according to its chairman Joseph Weinberg.  ""All identities and all records are encrypted across Shyft's public key infrastructure,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The core blockchain facilitates and coordinates all cross participants such as enterprises, institutions, services and citizens.""  David Burt, Bermuda's prime minister, said in a statement that Perseid ""can be a great showcase of how this technology can be applied to solve complex challenges facing the financial services industry such as reducing the burdens of compliance while exceeding global regulatory standards and expectations.""  The Atlantic island has taken a forward-looking approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain systems. It also announced Wednesday the ability to pay taxes in the Circle-led dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC).  Bermuda isn't alone in developing a blockchain digital identity platform.

It's claimed to track finances in real time and ""create a single source of integrated financial and nonfinancial performance information to support decision-making.""  Mark MacDonald, EY's lead of Global Public Finance Management, said in the announcement that transparency, accountability and sound evidence for decision-making are vital in managing public funds. The firm's new tool is aimed to help those in charge of public finances to ""assess and improve"" their systems, he added.  The product has already been trialed around the world, the firm said, citing one pilot in Toronto where the city used the finance manager solution to track how reconciliations and fund transfers between departments are managed.  The system is built on EY OpsChain, a blockchain platform launched in its second iteration in April with claimed support for up to 20 million transactions per day over private networks.

The Government of Bermuda announced Wednesday it will accept payments in USD Coin (USDC) “for taxes, fees and other government services,” according to a press release by crypto finance startup Circle.  USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar launched a year ago by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and Circle. To date, over $1 billionhttps://www.centre.io/pdfs/usdc-report-sept-2019.pdf worth of USDC has been issued between the two startups.  In what looks to be the first for a sovereign nation, Bermuda will be supporting USDC as an acceptable tax payment for some 60,000 residents.  What’s more, support for other “decentralized finance protocols and services” outside of USDC are also in the works as part of a broader initiative to integrate cryptocurrencies into official government operations, the press release stated.  Bermuda also announced Wednesday it would be collaborating with blockchain startup Shyft Network to launch a digital identity program benefiting individuals doing business in the country.  About Bermuda’s push for USDC adoption, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk via email:  “Bermuda is focused on enabling financial services to be built and delivered using cryptocurrency and digital assets.”  The Bermuda government launched a blockchain task force in conjunction with the Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) in late 2017. It went on to pass legislation on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and create a regulatory sandbox for cryptocurrency companies.  As a result of the favorable focus on the crypto industry within the country, Circle recently moved its exchange operations to Bermuda in late July.  Others  Bermuda isn’t the first municipality to accept cryptocurrency payments.  Last November  , Ohio became the first U.S. state to allow taxes to be paid in bitcoin. A subsequent political administration in the state walked back the bitcoin tax policy earlier this month citing potential conflicts with Ohio state law.  Notably, other national governments such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the People’s Republic of China are working on their own state-regulated cryptocurrencies.  “Governments everywhere will need to respond to this fundamental innovation,” Circle said in a statement, adding:  “Hats off to [Bermuda] Premier David Burt, who continues to show more leadership on these issues and very much remains out ahead of other governments in the world.”  Bermudahttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/condo-development-along-shores-hamilton-harbour-253495171?src=Gn2SilMcqbF4c33zA07LFQ-1-39 image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,USDC,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | USDC | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/16/bermuda-now-accepts-usdc-crypto-for-taxes-and-government-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5b2e1735b6a9375e91d246c7ab14a1345b8bfe7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfr99,1571220065,Bitcoin Price Indicator Shows Bearish Mood Strongest Since February,"View  Bitcoin's weekly Chaikin Money Flow index is reporting the strongest bearish bias since February. Other weekly chart indicators are also calling a deeper drop, possibly to levels below recent lows near $7,750.  The daily chart indicators suggest the corrective bounce has ended and sellers are again gaining strength.  The ongoing risk aversion in the global financial markets could weigh over bitcoin.  The short-term bearish case would weaken if prices rise above the 200-day average, currently located above $8,700, although, as of now, that looks unlikely.      Bitcoin is facing strongest selling pressure since February and has potential to drop below recent lows near $7,750.  The top cryptocurrency by market value fell from $8,326 to $8,086 in the 60 minutes to 17:00 UTC on Tuesday, confirming a downside break of the recent trading range of $8,450–$8,250, as expected.  Since then, the cryptocurrency has stabilized around $8,100. Some observers are of the opinion that BTC has carved out a temporary bottom near $7,750 and the drop from levels above $8,300 could be a bear trap.  That argument is logical if we take into account the seller exhaustion signaled by a bullish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index – a widely used technical indicator – confirmed last week.  So far, however, that has failed to excite investors, as noted on Tuesday. Further, longer duration indicators continue to report bearish conditions.  For instance, the weekly Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes to gauge buying and selling pressure, is currently printing a value of -0.14 – the lowest since mid-February.  A below-zero reading indicates that selling pressure, or the capital flight from the bitcoin market, is much higher than the buying pressure or inflow.  Put simply, the indicator shows the market is now at its most bearish since February and the path of least resistance for bitcoin is to the lower side. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands around $8,120 on Bitstamp.  Weekly chart  The CMF (above left) fell below zero at the end of September, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change and is now seen at -0.14.  Historically, negative readings have marked major bottoms. For instance, the CMF hit a low of -0.15 in February following BTC remained flat-lined below $4,000 for almost two months before breaking into a bull market in early April.  The latest bearish signal, however, looks reliable, as there are no signs of a bullish reversal on the weekly price chart.  More importantly, the CMF continues to lose altitude despite the repeated defense of the 100-week MA over the last three weeks – a sign the investor sentiment is still quite bearish. The index would have risen due to increased capital inflow if investors were convinced by the defense of the 100-week MA.  Further, the MACD histogram is also charting deeper bars below the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bearish momentum.  What's more, the 14-week RSI has convincingly breached the support band of 53.00-55.00. That region had served as strong support throughout the 2016-2017 bull market. The 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  All-in-all, the stage looks set for a retest and possibly a break below the 100-week MA support at $7,758.  Daily candlestick and line chart  The 50-day MA holding below the 100-day MA is a bearish sign, according to Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets FX and contributor for Forbes.  BTC created a bearish outside bar candlestick pattern on Tuesday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the Oct. 11 high of $8,820.  The RSI remains in bearish territory below 50 and the MACD is now producing shallow bars above the zero line, indicating the corrective bounce from $7,750 has ended.  The bullish divergence of the RSI on the daily line chart has lost its shine due to the strong rejection at the 200-day MA last week.  Risk-off may weigh over BTC  The bearish technical setup is accompanied by price-negative developments on the macro front.  Global economic growth is expected to fall to 3 percent this year, the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis and down from 3.8 percent seen in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Further, China-U.S. political tensions are escalating. The US House of Representatives on Tuesday passed bipartisan legislation in support of human rights in Hong Kong.  China sees the move as an intervention in its internal matters and has warned of retaliation if the U.S. continues to push forward Hong Kong-related bills.  As a result, the risk assets are flashing red across the board. As of writing, stocks in the U.K., Germany and France are reporting modest losses. The Shanghai Composite index fell by 0.44 percent during the Asian trading hours and the futures on the S&P 500 are currently shedding 0.36%.  Meanwhile, safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen and gold are better bid.  The risk aversion may not bode well for BTC, as the top cryptocurrency is still viewed as a risky asset, according to a recent study and does not have a credible story as a haven asset.

As reported by the BBC on Tuesday, Glasgow resident Jen McAdams personally invested some £8,000 ($10,160) and encouraged her family and friends to invest a further £220,000 ($280,000), all of which has disappeared. Since speaking on a BBC podcast on the issue, McAdams says she has received sexual and violent threats from OneCoin supporters.  “It is horrible, the abuse is vile and the threats feel very real to me, I'm always looking over my shoulder now,” Adams told the BBC. ""It is taking its toll on my health but I will not give up until me and the thousands of other OneCoin victims like me see some form of justice.""  Based in Bulgaria, the scheme was said to have raised billions of dollars before OneCoin’s founder Dr Ruja Ignatova was charged with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering by U.S. authorities. She has since disappeared. OneCoin denies charges it’s a pyramid scheme and continues to be traded on some exchanges.  The BBC says some 70,000 U.K. citizens purchased £96 million ($122 million) worth of OneCoin alone and have yet to receive a refund.  “They invested their life savings, they remortgaged homes and they convinced their friends and family to get involved and they feel as awful as I do about it all because we were all duped,” Adams continued, adding that most of the threats have come via Facebook.  She further called on police and financial regulators to take action on the OneCoin project.  A global operation, people associated with OneCoin have been arrested in China and India to date. It's also taken criticism in remote regions like Samoa, where the central bank recently warned its citizens to be mindful of the scheme.

42382827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7YP,1571198408,Foxconn Founder: Libra Can 'Converge' With China's Digital Currency in Taiwan,"Terry Gou, Taiwan's richest man and the founder of manufacturing giant Foxconn, wants the island to roll out the red carpet for Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project.  In a recent, little-noticed speech, the billionaire and one-time presidential candidate said Taiwan could boost its status as an international financial hub by embracing Libra, rather than approaching the project with skepticism as other governments have done.  Gou also suggested the island could connect Libra, if and when it launches, with the digital currency being developed by the People's Bank of China.  “I know [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg pretty well, and I hope we can bring Libra to Taiwan in the future,” Gou said on Oct. 3 at the annual meeting of Taiwan’s technology association in Taipei.  “Mainland China has decided not to accept Libra and build its own digital currency,” he said. ""That creates a great opportunity for Taiwan as we can become a place where the two separate systems converge.”  To that end, Taiwanese regulators should establish a more welcome legal system for decentralized finance technologies, Gou said, arguing that fintech projects could benefit semiconductor and crypto businesses, both areas where Foxconn is active. He also announced that his own educational initiative would introduce a blockchain curriculum.  From Foxconn to politics  Gou, whose net worth is $6.7 billion according to Forbes, has gathered substantial economic and political clout since he founded Foxconn Technology Group in 1976.  The company, with a market capitalization of $33 billionhttps://www.foxconn.com/en/FinancialInformation.html, is the world's largest manufacturer of consumer electronics, raking in $173 billionhttps://www.foxconn.com/Files/Agm_e/108%E5%B9%B4%E9%B4%BB%E6%B5%B7%E6%9D%B1%E6%9D%B1%E6%9C%83%E5%B9%B4%E5%A0%B1E.pdf revenue last year. Foxconn makes smartphones, computers and electronic parts for a range of the world's IT giants including Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Lenovo.  The Taiwanese billionaire, also known as Gou Taiming, stepped down as Foxconn’s chairman earlier this year to pursue the 2020 presidential bid, but dropped out of the race in September.  Gou has not returned to Foxconn since he announced that he would not to explore his bid, but his comments belied ambitions for a larger role in bolstering blockchain technology adoption and education.  In his speech, Gou said he would promote Libra in Taiwan by publishing a textbook about the currency for the Terry Gou Institute (TGI), which aims to cultivate the island's next generation of political and economic leaders.  “I have been in talks with many venture capital firms and they want to find better investments and create job opportunities for young people in Taiwan,” Gou said.  Foxconn and crypto  The manufacturing giant is active in the crypto space via several initiatives and client projects, including a lending platform for members of its supply chain.  Via its subsidiary FnConn, in March 2017, Foxconn partnered with Dianrong, a well-known Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform. Its spinoff project Chained Finance helps non-bank lenders make direct loans in supply chains globally.  The initial demo run of its prototype yielded $6.5 million in loans being originated to members all along its large-scale supply chain.  Foxconn’s investment arm, HCM Capital, is one of the participating investors in the $250 million fundraising for crypto venture capital Galaxy Digital, founded by billionaire and former fund manager Mark Novogratz.  HCM Capital led a $7 million Series A round in identity services startup Cambridge Blockchain in May 2018. PayPal announced to take a stake in the startup in April.  Foxconn has also pushed blockchain projects for other companies, including blockchain mobile phone maker Sirin Lab, helping to develop Finney, one of the first blockchain mobile phones. The Finney cryptocurrency raised $227 million through token sale as of last December.  Foxconn debuted its first investment in the bitcoin space in October 2017, leading a $16 million Series B funding round in the bitcoin remittance app Abra.  Taiwan and crypto  Perhaps reflecting Foxconn’s influence in Taiwan, and Gou’s pro-blockchain stance, the island of 23.8 million residents has implemented policies to develop the sector.  Taiwanese financial watchdog the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) strengthened its regulations on crypto assets by further enforcing anti-money-laundering (AML) practices on bitcoin trading last year.  BitoEx, the largest crypto wallet and exchange services in Taiwan, has 80 percent of the local market. Its main business is selling bitcoin through ATMs in more than 5,000 convenience stores, or via regular bank ATMs with their over-the-counter services. Last May, the company claimed to have raised $10 million in the first five hours of its initial coin offering.  The firm has required ID to purchase bitcoin through its platforms since Taiwanese financial authorities started to crack down on anonymous crypto-asset purchases in November.

42382836,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7hD,1571190318,XRP Price Exits Downtrend to Hit Three-Week High,"XRP has been on the offensive, having ended a 3.5-month-long downtrend with a move to three-week highs.  The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization clocked a high of $0.2993 Tuesday, the highest level since Sept. 21, according to CoinDesk's price index.  As of writing, XRP has pulled back slightly and is changing hands at $0.2879, representing a 3.8 percent drop on the day after reaching its local peak.  Notably, prices are up more than 25 percent from the low of $0.2343 registered on Sept. 26. Further, XRP is the third-best performing top 10 cryptocurrency of the last seven days with a 2.2 percent gain.  Binance coin, up 16 percent, is the top gainer, while litecoin has dropped 4.2 percent and is the worst-performing top-10 cryptocurrency of the last seven days.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is currently reporting a meager 0.06 percent gain on a seven-day basis. Also, BTC has been up just 4.5 percent from the recent lows near $7,750.  XRP's price may continue to outperform BTC in the near future as the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the widely tracked 100-day moving average for the first time since July 10. The key average is currently seen at $0.2854.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's 100-day MA is currently located at least $1,500 above its price of $8,175.  Further, XRP's technical charts are reporting a bullish breakout, as seen below.  Daily chart  XRP jumped six percent on Monday, confirming an upside break of a symmetrical triangle represented by trend lines connecting Sept. 18 and Oct. 13 highs and Sept. 24 and Oct. 13 lows.  The previous breakout indicated the sell-off from June 26's high of $0.4923 had ended and the path of least resistance was to the higher side.  That outlook has been halted in the immediate short term, courtesy of a small sell-off witnessed Tuesday at 14:00 UTC that brought prices back to prior resistances seen Oct. 8 and Oct. 9.  However, XRP remains bullish in the mid-term should prices remain above the aforementioned 100-day moving average at $0.2854.  As a result, the next major resistance at $0.3218 (Sept. 18 high) stands exposed. The short-term bullish case looks stronger if we take into account the above-50 reading on the relative strength index and the higher bars on the MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength.  The recent price rise has excited the investor community and prominent traders such as Bagsey expect the cryptocurrency to trade better bid in the near future.  Even so, there is merit in being cautious, as bitcoin – the anchor for broader markets – is looking weak. If the top cryptocurrency slides, XRP will likely follow suit once more, trapping buyers on the wrong side of the markets.  That could yield a notable price drop. After all, failed breakouts are powerful bearish reversal signals, as noted by popular analyst Nicola Duke.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.
