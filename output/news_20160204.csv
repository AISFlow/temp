42426642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuojh,1454621743,Chilean Bitcoin Exchange SurBTC Raises $300k,"Chilean bitcoin exchange SurBTC has raised $300,000 in seed funding.  Digital Currency Group, Sauzalito Ventures, and Fernando Barros, founder of Chilean law firm Barros & Errazuriz, took part in the round.  The $300,000 adds to the $100,000 already raised through the Corporación de Fomento de la Producción de Chile (CORFO), a business innovation incubator operated by the Chilean government.  The exchange told CoinDesk that it will use the funds to develop bitcoin-focused products and services aimed at those with less understanding of the technology, with a particular focus on international remittances.  SurBTC cofounder and CEO Guillermo Torrealba that the company sees bitcoin as a vehicle for providing people living in South America with better access to financial resources.  Torrealba said:  ""We are convinced that this is the technology that will finally help millions of South American people, who are still unbanked, to be able to send money to their relatives abroad, buy online or simply get paid in something else other than hard cash.""  The funds will also be used to build up additional bitcoin liquidity, as well as to scout possible new markets in South America.

42426628,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoJh,1454614071,Blockstream Investors See Commercial Use Cases for Bitcoin Blockchain,"Public, private or permissioned?  The argument over which type of blockchain technology platform will gain market share continues to be a point of analysis for industry observers.  So far, major banks have cast their vote, lining up to invest big money in private or permissioned blockchain tech startups like Digital Asset Holdings and Ripple, which have together raised nearly $100m from investors including CME Group and JP Morgan & Chase.  However, with Blockstream’s latest $55m Series A, the startup is emerging as a well-capitalized counterpoint to these companies, promoting the commercialization of blockchain tech not through proprietary bitcoin alternatives but through products and services that aim to build on what it describes as the battle-tested bitcoin code base.  Comments from participating venture capital firms suggest the message that the bitcoin blockchain will be able to compete against alternatives for commercial applications is resonating.  Manish Agarwal, general partner at AXA Strategic Ventures, for example, said he believes that there is a future in commercial use cases for public blockchains.  Agarwal told CoinDesk:  ”We believe that the blockchain technology has the potential to dramatically reshape the financial services landscape. The public blockchain is a key part of that, in my view. We are not that interested in the actual bitcoin as a currency, but the tech is the key.”  The comments were echoed by Rocky Eda, head of communications at Digital Garage, which had previously only discussed bitcoin publicly as part of a conference held in Japan.  ""Linux dominates operating systems compared to proprietary [versions]. I think the same thing will happen with blockchain,"" he said. ""The open-source community is very tested.""  The comments echoed remarks by Blockstream CEO Austin Hill, who indicated in a blog post that the round aims to give his startup the resources to continue building an open-source infrastructure that would ""re-architect the very dynamics underpinning trust globally"".  Open-source alternative  Investors in the round were keen to express their belief that both permissioned and public blockchains will exist side-by-side, but that the bitcoin blockchain is a key part of this future.  Brad Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, said he believes the round will enable the ""sustained development of the bitcoin protocol"" as a component to this larger vision.  ""While we envision a multi-chain future, the bitcoin blockchain is the most secure, most robust blockchain with network effect benefits,"" he remarked.  Others see Blockstream’s sidechains product as being able to replicate the functionality of permissioned blockchains, albeit with the benefits of bitcoin's open-source code base as a foundation.  Eda said that he believes there is opportunity for sidechains technology to be used by companies developing applications for rewards points schemes or smart contracts in Japan.  ""Sidechains are the best solution to develop applications of blockchain technology, compared to the private blockchain that’s very proprietary and closed,"" he said.  Agarwal further suggested that he sees sidechains as having a value proposition that is closer to the original intent of the bitcoin blockchain, and that he believes this will be more appealing to entities seeking to leverage blockchain tech.  He added:  ""I believe a lot of the value in the technology is in the trustless nature and I think open-source validation is crucial for that.""  Room for competition  Yet another signal that Blockstream’s blockchain-first approach to bitcoin development may be resonating with a wider audience is that its code is set to be leveraged by Digital Asset Holdings and the Linux Foundation as part of the Open Ledger Project.  Future\Perfect Ventures founding partner Jalak Jobanputra said that she sees such collaborations as evidence the blockchain-focused groups have complementary expertise, and that open-source code development will be key to all manner of blockchain efforts.  ""Digital Asset was founded to focus on the financial market. It had a very clear mandate, they know the vertical extremely well. I view Blockstream as more of an infrastructure provider, as Digital Asset is using the tech they are producing,"" she said.  Jobanputra voiced the common refrain that any attention paid to the nascent bitcoin and blockchain market can be seen as a positive given that there are so many varied use cases for the technology.  ""These large rounds you’re seeing are because people are grasping the potential more, and want to participate in the upside,"" she continued.  Stephens agreed, saying that ""all blockchain companies"" benefit from the open-source development and volunteer work on the bitcoin blockchain.  He concluded:  ""Our view is that there will be certain applications where private technologies are what the customer wants. Public and private chains can and will co-exist and potentially interoperate.""  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.

42426641,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuofh,1454607641,Documents Reveal Divorce Dispute May Be at Heart of Cryptsy Issues,"Months before the digital currency exchange Cryptsy declared its insolvency and claimed it was the target of a debilitating hack and theft, CEO Paul Vernon's estranged wife claimed in a court filing that she was afraid her husband would flee the country with funds taken from businesses he owns, including Cryptsy.  Court documents obtained by CoinDesk offer new details about an ongoing legal battle between Vernon and his wife, Lorie Ann Nettles, who filed for divorce last fall.  The motion for injunctive relief sought a court order freezing the assets of Cryptsy and other entities owned by Vernon and preventing any sale or transfer of marital assets. The filing, submitted to the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida on 28th October, also placed a travel restriction on Vernon pending the completion of the proceedings.  At the time of the filing, Nettles accused Vernon of ""intentionally and willfully dissipating"" those assets.  The filing alleges that Vernon was maintaining an extramarital relationship and providing support to the unnamed individual, who is said to be a Chinese national.  The court document states:  ""The Motion for Temporary Relief included allegations of the Husband's transfer of substantial amounts of monies to his paramour, and his ongoing financial support of his paramour and his paramour's children. The Motion for Temporary Relief also reference the Husband's international business interests, at least one of which is located in China and is believed to be in the name of his paramour.""  Information about the case came to light amid a growing controversy surrounding the exchange, which for months has restricted access to customer funds. Last month, two Florida law firms filed a class action lawsuit against the exchange.  Cryptsy, which offers markets for alternative digital currencies, announced soon after that it had been robbed in 2014 and had outstanding customer liabilities of roughly 10,000 BTC.  Asset flight risk alleged  Nettles went on to claim that ""a majority, if not most"", of the marital assets were being held in the form of digital currency – a fact the filing argues necessitated the asset freeze.  ""Because a majority, if not most, of the marital assets under the husband’s exclusive control are virtual currencies, it is imperative that the court move quickly to prevent asset flight and prevent the need for expensive and complex asset tracing should the husband take any further action to dissipate these assets,"" the filing states.  Nettles also alleges that Vernon was, at the time, planning to depart the US for China ""to start a new life"", and that if he were to leave, ""it will be very easy for him to take with him all of his virtual currency assets and evade the reach of this court"".  Notably, Vernon told CoinDesk last month that he was traveling in China.  The filing goes on to state:  ""Should the husband leave the country, it will be very easy for him to take with him all of his virtual currency assets and evade the reach of this court, leaving the minor children and the wife without any adequate remedy at law. Likewise, the Husband should be expressly barred from transmitting any virtual currency wallet or assets to any third party or person.""  Vernon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Altcoin withdrawals open  Since announcing that it was insolvent, the exchange has allowed withdrawals for some of the altcoins it lists, though cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and litecoin remain unavailable for users.  According to a notice posted to the main Cryptsy page, trading and deposits remain inactive at press time.  On 4th February, Vernon posted an update to the Cryptsy blog advising customers to submit withdrawal requests as more altcoin wallets become active.  ""I apologize for the delay in updates – we've continued to open more wallets for withdrawal and I will post a full list of what is open shortly,"" he wrote, adding:  ""We suggest anybody having coins in these open wallets to remove them from the exchange as soon as possible.""

42426644,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuolh,1454600802,New App Seeks to Use Blockchain as Immutable Answering Machine,"LedgerAssets, the developer of an app called Uproov that timestamps photos on bitcoin's blockchain, has announced it is to launch an application for phone calls.  Called Call Recorder Blockchain, the app can be set to record users' phone calls in the background, automatically saving proof that that call was made at a certain point in time.  John Bulich, co-founder of Uproov and its Australia-based parent firm LedgerAssets, said:  ""These call recordings cannot be altered in any way – however you the customer are still in full control of the content and can decide who to share it with, if at all. [No one] needs to even trust Uproov with the audio files, they can all remain on the phone.""  Bulich framed the service as a way to provide evidence following misunderstandings in phone conversations with companies or individuals.  He further suggested that current standard call recording apps have had millions of downloads, but, as their recordings are vulnerable to editing, their utility may be in doubt.  ""Uproov takes it to a whole new level. It's impossible to change any part of the recording as its 'key' is written into the blockchain, which is of course immutable,"" he said.  Immutable record  To use the app to log a call, the recording mode must be switched to 'on' and every call will be saved, either locally on the device or, if desired, by uploading it to the firm's servers.  Once created, the audio file is hashed and a unique key created from it which is written into the blockchain. No information about the call or the user can be determined from the data stored on the blockchain, the firm says.  In future, if the user needs to verify the call recording is still in its original state, the recording can be hashed again using the same standard algorithms, which will produce the identical key for that audio file – providing no changes have been made.  Bulich said:  ""As there is no way to change the original blockchain record, if you alter the audio file the key will no longer match, therefore the recording has been compromised and cannot be relied upon.""  The app could be invaluable if a user ever needed to rely on the audio files in a legal dispute, he suggested. Although he did concede that the legal status of evidence recorded on the blockchain does not yet have precedent since the technology is so new.  The new app will be launched ""in the next few days"" for Android devices, said Bulich. Meanwhile, the call logging feature is already functional in the Android version of the Uproov app.  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/04/new-app-seeks-to-use-blockchain-as-immutable-answering-machine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e1e77af78ea3602e0e10af1f54a64bc029ff7f2-1500x1457.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoTh,1454556473,Beyond Regulation: Why Bitcoin's Pressing Problem is Civil Law,"Most startups and entrepreneurs in the bitcoin or blockchain space have confronted the reality that governments take money crimes seriously.  Dealing with regulators is critical to post-implementation success and survival. But what entrepreneurs may not yet understand is that their new ventures exist interdependently with legacy legal systems.  What happens when bitcoin and blockchain startups stop worrying about regulatory compliance and start intersecting with these existing ""real-life"" systems? Said differently, how will the constructs and systems created to handle civil litigation adapt to bitcoin and the blockchain?  ""Civil litigation"" generally includes all non-criminal legal dispute resolution matters. Although many controversies are determined outside of courts (through arbitration, as is common in credit card disputes), the majority of non-criminal disputes in the US are resolved by civil litigation.  The US legal system provides the mechanism for dispute resolution through the laws and the court system. US law honors both legislatively enacted law and judge-made precedent, ie prior opinions of courts.  Although most who track the industry are aware of regulatory laws affecting bitcoin and blockchain platforms, there are few legal opinions issued by judges related to bitcoin and blockchain technology.  A review on Westlaw, a well-known legal research provider, reveals only 34 published judicial opinions nationwide mention bitcoin. Of those opinions, six were criminal and four related to regulatory enforcement actions.  Only 12 relate to non-criminal matters, and most of those opinions are related to claims against mining companies for failing to deliver mining equipment, attempts to recover bitcoins lost in Mt Gox or they relate to the use of bitcoin to barter for or purchase other goods and services.  These opinions, so far, do not provide precedent sufficient to instruct potentially confused judges who may confront bitcoin for the first time.  Bankruptcy  Take the bankrupt individual debtor who owns bitcoins. Or, consider the blockchain startup owner who never makes it to market.  Although these debtors may have fallen on hard times, the US Bankruptcy Code allows for debtors to disclose their assets and obtain a ""fresh start,"" with the accompanying discharge of their debts.  But, what happens if the bankrupt party fails to disclose his bitcoin holdings? What if the examining Trustee never asks about bitcoin?  Even if the Trustee is unaware of bitcoin and fails to inquire about the debtor’s virtual currency assets, and even if there is no clear line item for virtual currency assets on the current form of bankruptcy schedules (virtual currency assets are property, according to the IRS), failure to disclose assets may result in the debtor losing his or her ability to obtain a discharge. As a result, that debtor could remain saddled with his or her debts.  Or, consider the blockchain startup that never makes it to market. That debtor entity is equally required to disclose its virtual currency assets.  Courts, confused by or unfamiliar with bitcoin and virtual currencies, may view them with suspicion. A court may consider a transfer made in bitcoin to be inherently fraudulent.  Courts already use certain circumstantial indicators, known as ""badges of fraud"" by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), when attempting to determine whether certain transfers of value are fraudulent. Among the badges considered, the court may look at a bitcoin transaction and determine that the transfer was (a) concealed, or that that the transfer was (b) made to conceal or remove assets, both of which are identified badges of fraud under the UFTA.  Although it is a fact-dependent inquiry, Courts will be forced to wrestle with and determine their policy positions regarding the intrinsic pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin with potentially uneven initial results.  One court may determine that bitcoin transfers are inherently concealed, while another court may determine that the use of bitcoin by itself is not intentional concealment.  Although this remains an unanswered question, the more reasoned conclusion is that transfers of value using bitcoin or a virtual currency, in the absence of other factors, should not be considered to be evidence of concealment or an intent to remove assets.  Divorce  Another instance involves divorcing spouses.  The husband, only understanding that his wife bought a large amount of computer equipment to mine bitcoin, files a petition seeking a divorce and wants to understand (and divide) his wife’s mining and bitcoin assets.  At her deposition, the wife says she never obtained any bitcoin over her years of mining.  How can the husband find out how much bitcoin she acquired? How does the husband’s lawyer actually discover evidence of her bitcoin holdings, or evidence of her transactions?  The husband’s lawyer can use the court’s power to obtain information (referred to in civil litigation as ""discovery"") that will allow him to determine if there are any virtual currency assets available. That lawyer may attempt to analyze the physical mining equipment, if it is still available, which will require a Court order and likely an expert.  The lawyer may serve written discovery to attempt to identify transactions on the blockchain, and may require an expert to analyze the transfers. He or she will likely depose the wife and rely upon her oath that she will testify truthfully, and inquire about her mining and bitcoin use.  However, without undertaking proper discovery to identify transaction IDs or public keys, the discovery process is entirely contingent on the wife’s desire and ability to testify truthfully and fully about her bitcoin dealings.  Can the husband attach to (ie obtain possession of) bitcoin held by his wife?  As a practical matter, upon a proper evidentiary showing, he is probably authorized to do so, but must be able to evidence where the wallet resides so the court is able to exercise jurisdiction over that wallet.  It is suggested that the wallet will likely be determined to reside in the location of the private key (which provides control over the assets held in the wallet), or in the case of a multi-sig wallet, private keys.  Education needed  Although the bitcoin and blockchain community has done an admirable job educating its regulators, the judiciary handles most routine business disputes, and to date, has yet to create a body of precedent, or a ""common law"" of bitcoin.  As bitcoin and blockchain technology looks beyond regulation, bitcoin users and blockchain innovators will inevitably find themselves in business lawsuits, divorces and bankruptcies and must be prepared to educate the judiciary about this new paradigm.  Andrew Hinkes will discuss these issues 4th February, 2016, at: Bitcoin, Virtual Currencies and the Law, in Rockville, Maryland.
