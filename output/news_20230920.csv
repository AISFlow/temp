17880110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552183,1695250844,Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery,"Shiba Inu could be gearing up for a rally after a metric has flashed bullish. This metric has to do with the recently launched Shibarium network whose usage is continuing to rise rapidly. This time around, the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain has seen a significant surge in the number of new verified contracts. Verified Contracts On Shibarium Record 530% Spike On Monday, September 18, the total number of new verified contracts on the Shibarium network saw an impressive increase. The figure rose 530% to mark a top 5 highest day for new verified contracts on the network. This figure had risen from 4 the previous day to 19 on Monday. Related Reading: This New Development Could Stop The Optimism (OP) Price Dead In Its Tracks Number of new verified contracts spikes | Source: ShibariumScan While there was a decline in the number of new verified contracts the following day, the numbers continued to come out larger than Sunday’s figures. On Tuesday, the total number of new verified contracts came out to 12, still 300% higher than Sunday’s figures. This spike in the number of new verified contracts saw the total number of verified contracts rise to a new all-time high of 430 as of Wednesday morning. The growth is also evident in other metrics such as total accounts which crossed 25,700, and completed transactions on the network almost at 2.7 million. However, it is not all ‘up-only’ for the network given that active accounts have been on the decline. As of Wednesday, active accounts on Shibarium stood at 589, down from its 7,729 peak recorded on August 26, 2023. Will This Trigger A Shiba Inu Spike? Shiba Inu plays a significant role in the Shibarium ecosystem as its governance token and increased usage on the network leads to higher demand which translates to higher prices. This could be the case here with the rise in new verified contracts. Usually, for networks that facilitate decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, a rise in new verified contracts means more developers are choosing to build on the network. More protocols can inadvertently draw in more users, meaning more demand on the network. Related Reading: How Much Will Dogecoin Trade At If It Attains The Market Cap Of Bitcoin Or Ethereum? However, Shibarium is still struggling to find its footing with only 20,000 new transactions recorded on Tuesday. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has also fallen from its all-time high of $1.47 million to $600,000 at the time of writing, suggesting dwindling interest in the network. The meme coin is also trading below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. While this can be bearish for the coin’s price, it could also serve as a lift-off point for the digital asset if the crypto market were to begin another bull rally.

17878918,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552214,1695247205,Huobi Global Faces Risks As Investments In stUSDT Surge To $1.8 Billion,"Huobi Global, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, is at risk as investments in the staked USDT (stUSDT) project soar to $1.8 billion. The project, spearheaded by crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, promises 5% returns tied to low-risk securities like government bonds. However, according to a Bloomberg report, Huobi’s heavy involvement in the project raises concerns about the exchange’s ability to manage sudden outflows of funds and the transparency of its reserves. Huobi’s Association With stUSDT Sparks Concerns And Triggers Institutional Withdrawals Per the report, Huobi’s close association with the stUSDT project has led to a significant transformation in the exchange’s crypto reserves. Altering by this shift and the lack of transparency surrounding stUSDT, institutional traders have withdrawn a substantial portion of their crypto holdings from Huobi. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Not See Lasting Bullish Momentum Until This Happens This withdrawal trend highlights the potential risks of Huobi’s concentration on the stUSDT platform. Notably, blockchain research firms have expressed concerns about the relative lack of transparency surrounding the stUSDT project. The absence of comprehensive information about its investments raises questions about the source and sustainability of the advertised 4.2% yield. Huobi’s reliance on the project exposes the exchange to problems that may arise within stUSDT, further magnifying its potential vulnerabilities. As investments in stUSDT have grown, Huobi’s Tether (USDT) reserves have plummeted, raising further concerns. While Huobi maintains that stUSDT is a separate project not overseen by the exchange, the heavy concentration of stUSDT in its reserves implies that Huobi’s fortunes are closely linked to the success or failure of the project. The dominance of tokens associated with Justin Sun, such as TRON (TRX) and Huobi Token (HT), in Huobi’s reserves adds another risk layer, as market participants could perceive it as a higher exchange risk. Huobi Global’s Average Daily Trading Volume Plummets Institutional clients, including crypto funds and market makers, have expressed concerns about the dominance of stUSDT and other tokens associated with Justin Sun in Huobi’s reserves. According to Bloomberg, these clients have withdrawn a significant portion of their digital assets from the exchange shortly after the launch of the staked Tether project. This departure from Huobi has contributed to a decline in the exchange’s average daily trading volume. The stUSDT project’s rapid growth and lack of transparency raise questions about its underlying investments and the sustainability of its returns. Investors and industry experts emphasize the importance of increased transparency and oversight to understand the sources of yield and mitigate potential risks. Per the report, the project’s management team intends to engage a reputable third-party verification entity to enhance community oversight. However, further details about the project’s structure and employees remain scarce. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Could Buck Downtrend With Move To $42,000 What is certain is that Huobi Global’s involvement in the stUSDT project has significantly impacted the composition of its reserves, raising concerns among institutional traders and industry experts. The heavy concentration of stUSDT, TRX, and HT tokens in Huobi’s reserves and the lack of transparency surrounding the project pose potential risks to the exchange’s financial stability. To alleviate these concerns, greater transparency and oversight are essential, ensuring the sustainability and credibility of the stUSDT project and Huobi’s operations in the evolving crypto landscape.

42419569,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwOr,1695247093,Vivek Ramaswamy Is Drafting a 'Crypto Policy Framework',"NEW YORK – GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy took the stage at Messari’s Mainnet crypto conference on Wednesday evening and announced plans to release a “comprehensive crypto policy framework” by Thanksgiving.  In a “fireside chat” with data company Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, Ramaswamy’s brief remarks – which touched on recent SEC rulings and crypto’s role as a disruptor for traditional finance – painted a generally rosy picture of blockchain technology and delivered a scathing indictment of “three-letter” regulatory agencies.  Selkis said he’d seen the framework and concurred with the GOP candidate that it’s currently “75% there.”  Ramaswamy said he has “relatively strong views on what the future of governmental interface with crypto should be,” zeroing in on what he called an “unconstitutional fourth branch of government” – regulators.  “That is the cancer at the heart of our federal government today,” said Ramaswamy. “Most of the political power is wielded by people who are never elected to their positions that sit in the back of three-letter government agency buildings in Washington DC in a three-letter regulatory alphabet soup.”  Following an appearance from Anthony Scaramucci – the financier famous for his brief stint as Donald Trump’s communications director – Ramaswamy’s remarks speak to crypto’s growing prominence in the U.S. political landscape. As Selkis noted as he welcomed Ramaswamy to the stage, “If you told me a couple of years ago that we'd have a major presidential candidate talking at a crypto conference, I don't think anyone would have believed it.”  Bitcoin’s founding ethos verges on libertarian, but the industry has generally managed to avoid strict categorization on any specific side of the U.S. political spectrum. Ramaswamy’s open embrace of crypto, however, could portend a rightward shift for the industry.  Ramaswamy was a pharmaceutical entrepreneur before he mounted his 2024 presidential campaign – fashioning himself as a youthful, tech-forward heir to Donald Trump’s populist MAGA movement. Even further to the right than Trump on many issues, Ramaswamy’s debate performance in August was something of a break-out moment for the 38-year-old – with attacks from Trump administration figures like Mike Pence and Nikki Haley underscoring the controversial political candidate’s rapid emergence as a serious political contender.  A CNN poll released Wednesday placed the political newcomer second to Donald Trump in the nomination race – ahead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was widely considered Trump’s main competition in the early days of campaigning.  Ramaswamy’s remarks on Wednesday weren’t the first time he’d spoken positively of crypto. Most recently, in a tweet last month, Ramaswamy celebrated a court ruling against the SEC in its case with Grayscale – a decision considered favorable to the blockchain industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/20/vivek-ramaswamy-is-drafting-a-crypto-policy-framework,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d09f06f7ed33730f366bd9b349929303363b0769-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17877733,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552168,1695243619,"Report Says Ethereum Is Trading Well Below Fair Value, What’s The Correct Figure?","Ethereum’s price may have been dealt a massive blow as a research report on the Ethereum valuation has revealed that the cryptocurrency giant has been trading below its fair price. Ethereum Trading Value Slips A new on-chain research report has delved deep into the fair value of the Ethereum cryptocurrency since its inception, segregating the cryptocurrency’s value into sections and utilizing its trading activities and active addresses to evaluate the network’s worth over the past years. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In Lewis Harland, an RxR analyst, revealed in the research report that Ethereum has been trading below fair value by a 27% discount. The analyst arrived at this conclusion after employing the Metcalfe law-centric valuation model which involves comparing active user base on Ethereum’s robust scaling networks and active user adoption to measure the network’s fair value. Harland explained that Ethereum’s network valuation can be measured and tracked slightly more accurately when the active user base of the blockchain’s scaling networks is integrated into the model. He stated that if the model excludes active user bases, then Ether’s (ETH) valuation would be trading significantly below its fair value of $275 billion. “Ethereum’s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum’s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,” Harland, stated in the research report. He added that “the updated model, which does factor in these networks, puts ETH’s valuation at $275 billion (current MCAP trading at a 27% discount), assuming no further user growth in perpetuity.” Going by Harland’s research, Ethereum should be trading at around $2,300 with a market cap of $275 billion. However, Ethereum’s price is currently sitting at $1,637 with a market capitalization of $197.62 billion. Analyst says ETH price is sitting 27% below fair value | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum’s Worth Revealed Through Value Layers While exploring the decline in Ethereum’s trading value, RxR disclosed its analysis of Ethereum’s supposed value using value layers. The research firm explained that Ethereum’s commodity value layer can be analyzed through the amount of ETH millions of users utilize to facilitate their crypto transactions daily. It further stated that the annual run rate of the transaction fees is well over $1.6 billion presently. It also described Ethereum’s equity value, stating that “the value of ETH is the present-day value of the sum of all of its future cash flows. To date, over 3.5m ETH ($5.8B) has been burned by EIP-1559.” Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Report Provides Valuable Insight Into The Stablecoin’s Performance So Far Lastly, the research firm represented Ethereum’s network value layer, and the analysis utilized Metcalfe’s law approach to conclude the recent data that revealed that the Ethereum blockchain network was trading below fair value. Ethereum’s price has been dealing with a series of strong declines that may push the growth of the ecosystem back a few years. The tenacity of the cryptocurrency’s native token Ether (ETH) was tested when it fell to a critical support level of $1,530 earlier in September. However, the cryptocurrency later made a slight recovery which pushed it back to a more stable position.

17876555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552174,1695240023,Is Bitcoin Bull Run Coming Soon? What Network Fundamentals Say,"Here’s what the Bitcoin network fundamentals have to say regarding whether the cryptocurrency could see a bull run soon or not. Monthly Average Bitcoin New Addresses Have Shot Up Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the possibility of a bull run starting soon for the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, “a bull run is often characterized by increased on-chain activity.” To measure the activity, Ali has used the “new addresses” metric, which keeps track of the total number of new addresses coming online on the Bitcoin blockchain every day. When the value of this metric is high, it means that many users have joined the network during the past day. This could suggest that the cryptocurrency is observing high adoption right now. On the other hand, low values imply not many newcomers are currently attracted to the blockchain, potentially a sign of a lack of interest in the market around the coin. Related Reading: Here’s Where Next Bitcoin Resistance Lies, From An On-Chain Perspective Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin new addresses, as well as the 30-day and 365-day simple moving averages (SMAs) of the indicator over the past few years: The data for the daily new addresses on the network since January 2018 | Source: @ali_charts on X The increased activity, which may be associated with a bull run, can be “spotted when the monthly average of new wallets (red) surpasses the yearly average (blue), which indicates strengthened network fundamentals and increased use,” as explained by the analyst. The graph shows that the 30-day SMA of the Bitcoin new addresses had been under the 365-day SMA during the bear market, but with the rally this year, the former had managed to break above the latter. The reverse cross had happened during the slowdown in May-June, but as the subsequent rebound in the price had occurred, the monthly average new addresses had broken back above the yearly average, and it has since stayed there. Recently, despite the struggle in the price, the 30-day SMA of the metric has only continued to rise sharply. This could naturally be a constructive sign for the asset, and going by historical precedence, it may even mean a return toward bullish momentum. The lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, @_Checkmatey_, however, has replied to Ali’s post, saying, “with the advent of ordinals, it is always a great idea to pair ‘addresses,’ and ‘transactions’ metrics with ‘volume’ metrics.” “Ordinals” here refer to inscribing data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain. They are utilized in various applications, including making non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Not See Lasting Bullish Momentum Until This Happens Such chain applications can skew the address-related metrics, as new ones may be created solely for using the blockchain in this way and not for actually trading the coin itself. The Glassnode lead explains that they assign a slightly higher weight towards the volume metrics because the Ordinals-related transactions don’t involve much volume. The exchange volume over the last few years | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X Unlike the new addresses metric, the bullish pattern isn’t yet forming for the exchange volume (which includes both inflows and outflows). This would suggest that the activity on the network may not be at a bull run stage right now. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $27,000, up 3% over the past week.

The decision aligns with market expectations and signals a continuation of the Fed’s existing policy stance. While the interest rate decision had no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price, cryptocurrency analysts anticipate a potential shift in market dynamics. Analysts Predict Bitcoin Reversal Following Fed’s Decision Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, has experienced a period of consolidation around the crucial $27,000 support level for the past two days. Despite the absence of significant price fluctuations immediately following the recent interest rate decision, market experts believe this stability could potentially signify the beginning of a trend reversal. Related Reading: Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van De Poppe shared his perspective on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the era of interest rate hikes may have reached its conclusion. Van De Poppe went on to indicate that Bitcoin is likely to embark on an upward trajectory from this juncture, noting the importance of exercising caution when interpreting price movements following major news events. Van De Poppe’s remarks mirror the sentiment among BTC enthusiasts who anticipate the Federal Reserve’s decision to act as a catalyst for the cryptocurrency’s resurgence. The prevailing hope is that this decision could mark the end of the current market downtrend, paving the way for Bitcoin to reach new yearly highs before the conclusion of 2023. BTC’s Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Bottom Formation Crypto Con, a renowned crypto analyst provided insights into Bitcoin’s price movements, focusing on its historical patterns and the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) deviation bands. Crypto Con’s analysis highlights the significance of BTC’s recent visit just below the green band, as seen in the chart above, drawing parallels to previous market cycles. Drawing on historical data, Crypto Con notes that Bitcoin spent approximately 10 months hovering around the bottom purple and blue deviation bands before making its second visit just below the green band. In 2016, this particular pattern marked a local bottom, and in 2019, it would have done the same if not for unforeseen circumstances such as the black swan event. Related Reading: Chainlink: Analyst’s Vision Of A 20% Rally And How It Could Happen Comparing the duration spent at the bottom during the current cycle to that of 2015, Crypto Con highlights a striking similarity. This observation raises the question of whether the significant downside experienced in 2019 was a consequence of the massive price surge that preceded it, with Bitcoin even reaching the cycle top band. The current value of the red band stands at $54,000, according to Crypto Con’s analysis. However, he assures that this value is subject to change as the market progresses toward “the endgame”. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $27,100, indicating no change in the 24-hour timeframe. As a result, the impact of the Federal Reserve’s decision on the cryptocurrency and the broader market in the short term remains uncertain. Whether this news will have a positive effect shortly or prove beneficial for the remainder of the year is yet to be determined.

The committee’s top Democrat accused Republicans of getting in the way of innovation with partisan legislation.  A crypto-related bill meant to stifle a future U.S. central bank digital currency is now heading toward consideration on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives after committee approval Wednesday, marking further progress for digital assets legislation in Congress.  Republicans in the House Financial Services Committee cleared a bill that Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the panel’s chairman, said would ensure “any U.S. CBDC must be explicitly authorized by Congress” and also “protects Americans’ privacy and our financial system from the risks a CBDC would pose.”  Even as Congress approaches the precipice of a U.S. government shutdown, House lawmakers took time to insist Wednesday that a so-called digital dollar is strangled before it’s conceived. The bill was designed to ban any CBDC pilot programs before they’re proposed, outlaw the Federal Reserve issuing a retail digital currency that could be used for citizen surveillance and require any progress on a government-backed token be explicitly empowered by Congress. While the House progress on CBDC legislation is unprecedented, its future in the Senate is more doubtful.  The House committee’s counterpart – the Senate Banking Committee – is led by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who doesn’t share Republican sympathies with the digital assets industry.  As with stablecoin and crypto market-structure legislation advanced previously by the committee, this bill was opposed by the panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).  “It will keep the United States behind other countries, including China, as a race forward to develop a global standard for central bank digital currencies,” Waters said, accusing Republicans of taking a “deeply anti-innovation stance” on the technology, which has been embraced by other nations. The legislation, she said, would “stifle that research and prevent us from moving forward, even if it means that the dollar loses its status as the world's reserve currency and even if it means that U.S. citizens lose out on faster, cheaper and simpler payments.”  The Fed’s top regulatory official, Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr, said earlier this month that the central bank won’t move forward without being directed by the White House and authorized with legislation from Congress. Despite Republican claims that the administration of President Joe Biden are pushing for a CBDC, the federal agencies haven’t yet proposed a digital dollar and are in the “basic research” phase on studying the ramifications of a U.S. token.  Even if Republican-led crypto bills are approved by the overall House, their reception in the Democrat-dominated Senate is unlikely to be enthusiastic.

In a new price prediction, he suggested that the decentralized oracle network is on the verge of a significant recovery. Rekt Capital, a prominent figure in the crypto community, took to the social media platform X to share insights on Chainlink’s recent performance. According to the analyst, LINK has shown resilience by respecting its range-high resistance, a crucial milestone following its notable surge in price back in July. This achievement has ignited hopes of a sustained upward trajectory. Despite its promising trajectory, LINK has experienced some fluctuations in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency dropped to a recent low of $5.76, a level that Rekt Capital points out as being close to the asset’s range-low support. Related Reading: Halving Hype: Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Parabolic Ride, Analyst Says However, Chainlink seems to be regaining its footing, with its current price sitting at $6.81 according to CoinGecko, marking a 1.2% increase in the last 24 hours and an impressive seven-day rally of 15.5%. These positive indicators have fueled anticipation within the crypto community. $LINK has rejected from its Range High resistance Price is down -13% since then But if #LINK were to drop into the Range Low support… Price would need to drop an additional -20% to the downside#Crypto #Chainlink pic.twitter.com/GS3C2IYeiw — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) August 4, 2023 A Bullish Prediction For Chainlink Rekt Capital’s analysis doesn’t stop at the current price trends. The crypto analyst predicts that Chainlink “should be able to revisit the range-high resistance,” which is situated at around $8.186. If this prediction holds true, it would represent an additional 20.5% increase from the current price, promising further gains for LINK holders. This price surge coincides with a notable uptick in Chainlink’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, as of the latest analysis, stands above 60. An RSI above 60 indicates a robust bullish trend in the market. Moreover, Chainlink’s price has climbed above the short-term Moving Average, previously acting as a resistance level. It is also approaching a position where it may surpass the long-term Moving Average, signaling potential for sustained upward movement. Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $6.81. Chart: TradingView.com Mysterious Wallet Activity Intriguingly, recent wallet activity has garnered significant attention in the Chainlink ecosystem. Data from Lookonchain reveals that over 35 new LINK addresses were established just three days ago. These newly created addresses have started withdrawing LINK tokens from Binance (BNB), with a cumulative withdrawal exceeding 755,000 LINK tokens, valued at over $5 million. We noticed that ~35 fresh wallets created 3 days ago started withdrawing $LINK from #Binance today. And have withdrawn a total of 755,687 $LINK ($5.08M) so far.

The motive behind these substantial withdrawals remains undisclosed as of now, leaving room for speculation within the crypto community.

As Chainlink continues to make strides in the crypto space, investors and enthusiasts will undoubtedly be closely monitoring its progress, hoping that Rekt Capital’s bullish predictions come to fruition.

42419572,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwRx,1695234648,Bitcoin Tumbles to $26.9K on Hawkish Remarks by Federal Reserve's Powell,"In a widely anticipated move, the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday held monetary policy steady, leaving the range for its benchmark interest rate at 5.25% to 5.50%.  Fed officials also projected keeping interest rates higher for next year at around 5.1%, a significant jump in expectations compared to 4.3% in the June prediction. They also see stronger economic growth for this year, expecting a 2.1% real GDP increase versus a 1% forecast in June.  ""In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" the Fed statement reads.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price remained flat around $27,200 in the minutes following the central bank’s announcement, but later tumbled some 1% to $26,900 as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference that the central bank will do more rate hikes if the economy remains stronger than expected.  Powell also said that the majority of Fed members believe ""one more rate hike is more likely than not appropriate"" to reach the Fed's goal during the remaining two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. He also acknowledged that the recent trend in inflation is going in the right direction, saying that the last three months' reading were ""very, very good.""  The FOMC’s next policy meeting is set for the start of November. Following today’s events, market participants priced in about a 71.5% chance there would be no rate change at that November meeting and gave a 53.4% odds keeping the rates at the current level until the end of the year, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.  What's next for BTC price?  ""It is hard for us to take today’s announcement with too much optimism,” Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at AltTab Capital, said in an emailed note. ""It came as a surprise that the report emphasized slower rate cuts moving forward than previously projected.""  ""The big news is the 2024 rates projection, [which is] higher than I expected. This is a very big signal,"" crypto and macro analyst Noelle Acheson said in an email. ""It's the message sent by effectively taking two rate cuts off the table, which also suggests that any rate cuts will come later than the market had been hoping.""  She added that ""higher rates, a stronger dollar and stock market drops are not good for BTC,"" but acknowledged that crypto markets took the news relatively well, which suggests there might be some ""buying support"" at current levels.  Market research firm Asgard Markets expected some profit-taking would ensue following the Fed's decision. ""Positioning and sentiment aren't as light [and] offsides as they were earlier this year, and there aren't many new catalysts on the horizon, meaning 'in-the-money' participants will take some chips off the table and reassess,” it said Tuesday in a note.  ""The Fed has embraced the idea of a soft landing: they see stronger growth and lower unemployment, and still expect to get back to their inflation target,"" Zach Pandl, economist at Grayscale Research, noted in a emailed note. Asset management firm Grayscale is owned by DCG, CoinDesk's parent company.  ""The last soft landing was in the mid-1990s, and this proved to be a terrific outcome for technology-related assets. While we can't be sure there will be a soft landing, that scenario could be positive for bitcoin and ether (ETH),"" he added.

42419562,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwGb,1695233090,The Sam Bankman-Fried Trial Is a Family Affair,"For months, Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, have stood at their son’s side as he faced multiple federal charges of fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations related to the collapse of FTX.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Now, the Stanford professors find themselves squarely at the center of the case, accused of misappropriating millions in company assets and playing a key role in alleged misdoings at the fallen cryptocurrency empire.  The SBF trial is becoming a family affair.  “[Bankman and Fried] were very much involved — from the founding of the FTX Group until its collapse.”  “Bankman and Fried exploited their access and influence within the FTX enterprise to enrich themselves, directly and indirectly,” the civil complaint, filed Monday, begins, listing multiple ways in which Joseph and Barbara quietly directed operations behind the scenes.  SBF has said his parents “weren’t involved in any of the relevant parts” of the business, but the case says “they were very much involved — from the founding of the FTX Group until its collapse.”  Bankman portrayed himself “as the proverbial adult in the room” as he worked “alongside inexperienced fellow executive officers, directors and managers responsible for safeguarding billions of dollars,” the complaint says. He “received millions of dollars in unearned ‘gifts’ and real property, flew on privately-chartered jets, expensed $1,200 per night hotel stays to the FTX Group, and even appeared in a Super Bowl commercial with Seinfeld writer Larry David months before the FTX Group imploded,” the suit say. Fried, meanwhile, was the “single most influential advisor” to SBF/FTX’s political contributions campaign, repeatedly calling upon her son to give millions of dollars directly to a political action committee that she co-founded and for which she served as President and Chairwoman.  You have to hand it to the SBF’s prosecutors. They know how to frame an anecdote and raise a telling detail.     In January, 2022, Bankman was unhappy with his $200,000 annual FTX salary. He emailed FTX’s U.S. head of administration, saying he was only receiving gross pay of $16,667 per month, when he was “supposed to be getting $1M/yr, starting in December.”  He then emailed his son: “Gee, Sam I don’t know what to say here. This is the first [I] have heard of the 200K a year salary! Putting Barbara on this.” SBF was caught between his parents, double-teamed.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Everyone but Himself for FTX's Collapse | The Node  Bankman was said to be an adult, but he was not above lobbying for access to FTX’s star network. He just had to be involved in FTX’s 2022 Super Bowl commercial if Larry David was onboard.  “OK, I’m not a star- fucker and don’t really care about meeting, say, Tom Brady. But Larry David....,” he emailed his son, the complaint says.  The parents’ lawyers described the filing Monday as a “dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins. These claims are completely false.”     But we can expect prosecutors to continue to widen their scope to the whole Bahamas-based cabal running FTX, turning insiders into informers and associates into accomplices in their legal efforts.  It all adds to our expectation for the trial due to begin in October (which CoinDesk will be covering extensively) and adds to the notion that “it takes a village” to create a clown-show as wide-ranging as FTX. SBF did not bring down a $40 billion empire on his own. He needed help, including from his parents, who, being the adults in the room, really should have known better even if their son did not.

17874078,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552169,1695232820,Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF,"On the back of its partial victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale has applied to the Commission for another Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Why Another ETH Futures ETF? According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Grayscale Investments filed this application on September 20. This development may come as a surprise to many, considering that the asset manager had filed an earlier application to offer this same investment vehicle. As such, this will represent its third application (Grayscale withdrew its first application due to SEC concerns before filing another one in July). Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In There is, however, a distinction between both applications, as WSJ noted. The latest application is filed under the Securities Act of 1933, a regulation under which spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s filed. Meanwhile, the initial application was filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a regulation which securities-based ETFs are registered under. While the exact reason for Grayscale’s action remains unknown, it may be a contingency plan in case the SEC denies its initial proposed Ethereum futures ETF, which is expected to launch in October, barring any denial. Grayscale’s filing under the Securities Act of 1933 isn’t the first, as Brazilian investment firm Hashdex filed its Ethereum ETF application under that Act. Last week, Hashdex applied with the SEC to offer a fund that will hold both Ether futures contracts and a Spot Ethereum ETF (the first of its kind). The firm justified this move by stating that a combination of both markets will help mitigate the risk of market manipulation. Hashdex’s application has been singled out for how distinct it is from other applications. The investment firm has proposed to use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to track the price of Ethereum and also plans to buy the Ether, which the fund will hold from the CME Market’s Exchange for Physical (EFP) transactions. ETH price holding above $1,600 support | source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum Futures ETF Imminent? Several Ethereum futures ETFs are expected to hit the market in October, barring a denial by the SEC. Rule 485(a) of the SEC Rules allows these ETFs to launch 75 days from their respective filing dates if the SEC doesn’t deny them before then. In line with this, the ETFs of fund managers like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, ProShares, and Roundhill will be the first to launch if they receive approval from the SEC. Related Reading: Lawyer Involved In Cryptoqueen’s OneCoin Scam Receives Shocking Response From Court Volatility Shares was the first among them to apply to offer Ethereum futures ETF. As such, it will gain the first-mover advantage, carrying a possible October 12 launch date, with others coming after. However, this is subject to any decision by the SEC. The SEC approving an Ethereum ETF will be a historical event that is expected to give the crypto market a much-needed boost as the bear market continues to linger. There are already forecasts that ETH’s price could rise above $2,000 when these funds launch.

42419578,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwX7,1695229681,The Protocol: Ethereum Struggles With Sprawl as Optimism Airdrops $27M,"Last week marked the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s historic “Merge” – the shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake network. But in some ways the largest smart-contract blockchain has become a victim of its own success: Staking is so popular that the number of network validators is mushrooming toward 1 million, introducing new concerns related to the sprawl. We discuss how Ethereum developers are addressing the issue with the EIP-7514 proposal.  Also in this week’s issue:  Exclusive interview with DYdX founder Antonio Juliano as the decentralized exchange launches its own layer-1 blockchain with Cosmos technology.  Optimism’s $27 million airdrop.  Are we all gonna make it? The infamous Avalanche developer Daniele Sestagalli is back with new project called WAGMI.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  Chart from Galaxy Research shows how the projected growth of Ethereum validators would slow based on the EIP-7514 proposal.  CROWD CONTROL: Ethereum has been so successful in attracting new validators for its proof-of-stake blockchain that the network is now starting to suffer from sprawl. There are nearly 800,000 active validators on the network, up about 41% since April’s “Shapella” upgrade, when withdrawals of staked ETH were first allowed, according to a Sept. 14 report by Galaxy Research’s Christine Kim. Based on certain assumptions, the number is on track to hit 1 million by mid-November and 2 million by June 2024. “Ethereum is getting close to reaching an unsustainable number of active validators,” Kim wrote. It’s pretty technical, but network “latency” is becoming a key problem, according to the report: There’s been “an increasing frequency of block reorgs and missed blocks in the first two slots of an epoch, likely due to increasing latency in attestation aggregation.” Developers have formalized EIP-7514 – an improvement proposal that would help, at least in the short term, by limiting entries of new validators to 8 per epoch (roughly 12 seconds), down from the current rate of 12. Another major concern from the rapid proliferation of validators, according to the Ethereum Foundation’s Dankrad Feist in a recent post, is that staking is becoming too concentrated in the hands of Lido, the biggest protocol for so-called liquid staking tokens. The plan to reduce the “churn limit” for new validators could be a stopgap measure for a more “elegant” fix down the road, Feist wrote.  OPTIMISM OPPORTUNISM: Much of this year’s news on the layer-2 blockchain Optimism network, supported by the developer OP Labs, has revolved around the OP Stack – a set of software tools that can be used to spin up new layer-2’s that are essentially modified clones of Optimism. Among them is Coinbase’s Base blockchain, which has quickly climbed in the project rankings since its launch last month, partly thanks to the popularity of the Friend.tech social media platform. But in terms of providing an additional jolt of, well, optimism into the project, there’s often nothing like free money giveaways. And this week, the Optimism Foundation announced its third community airdrop, with more than 31,000 unique addresses receiving about 19 million OP tokens, worth $27 million. Even in the depths of crypto winter, some teams are still flush with pools of money (often in token form) that can be used to incentivize users to transact on these nascent networks. A further 570 million OP tokens have been allocated to future airdrops.  ALSO:  “Many teams are running out of funds.” (Wu Blockchain)  Infamous Avalanche developer Daniele Sestagalli has started a new project called WAGMI – a common acronym in crypto-trader trash-talk for “We’re all gonna make it.” Sestagalli was behind once-top projects like Wonderland, a treasury-backed currency protocol, and Abracadabra, a platform that provides collateral based on yield-bearing assets deposited by users.  Coinbase “has shown no willingness” to return $1.06M validator fee netted from a trading bot in wake of July’s $73M hack of the DeFi protocol Curve – and it’s not obligated to.  Coinbase’s Base blockchain sets new record for daily transactions, at 1.88 million, higher than layer-2 rivals Arbitrum and Optimism combined.  Bitcoin miner F2Pool has returned 19.8 BTC to Paxos, after the crypto services firm mistakenly paid a $520,000 fee on a $2,000 transaction.  South Korea’s crypto ecosystem shakes off Terra debacle, with gaming dominating Web3 activity.  Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban lost some $870,000 worth of tokens – drained of U.S.-pegged stablecoins, staked ETH (stETH), SuperRare (RARE) tokens, and some Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. He told DLNews that it happened after he tried to open his MetaMask wallet “for the first time in months.”  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.

IOTA network looks for comeback with “2.0” release, featuring smart contracts, a focus on layer 2 blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, the introduction of a new ecosystem fund and an increase in the utility of IOTA tokens.  Messaging app Telegram has endorsed the TON network as its blockchain of choice for Web3 infrastructure, and will integrate it into the app's user interface. A self-custodial version named TON Space is being rolled out to all Telegram users outside the U.S. The rollout should be completed by November, TON Foundation said in an email.  Citigroup, the big U.S. bank, disclosed that it has started a tokenization service for cash management and trade finance for institutional clients using blockchain technology and smart contracts. ""The private/permissioned blockchain technology used is owned and managed by Citi and clients will not be required to host a blockchain node to access the services,"" according to a press release.  Injective, a layer-1 blockchain built for finance on Cosmos SDK technology, announced the launch of “inEVM, the first-ever Ethereum Virtual Machine capable of achieving true composability across Cosmos and Solana,” according to a message from the team.  Money Center  Fundraisings  Alumni from some well-known names in crypto and fintech are starting a new $60 million fund called Oak Grove Ventures to focus on the intersection of Web3, artificial intelligence and biotech.

The seed round will be used to scale Bastion’s operations, recruit top engineering talent and secure additional licensing to further diversify Bastion’s product offerings.  Blockchain Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm, has raised $580 million for two new funds – split between $380 million for its sixth early-stage fund, which will focus on newer companies and protocols in pre-seed and Series A rounds, and $200 million for its opportunities fund, which will target late-stage investments from Series B onward.

Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, “is launching The Metis Journey, a $5 million community growth campaign designed to increase on-chain activity with a torrent of new wallets, users and transactions from other chains, as well as new blockchain users,” according to a press release. “The campaign will start by allocating 100,000 METIS tokens [about $1.15 million worth at the current price] to Aave Protocol V3, which powers one of the largest liquidity markets in DeFi, to incentivize supply and borrow activity. Platforms also receiving incentives include Hummus, Stargate, Synapse and Unimaia.”  ZPrize, a competition with the goal of advancing zero-knowledge technology, is “kicking off ZPrize 2023,” according to a message from the organizers. “Teams will compete to win financial rewards of up to equity-free prize pool of $1.5 million in both U.S. dollars and tokens in a range of categories that aim to advance the development of practical and accessible ZK systems.”  Data and tokens  Balancer, DeFi protocol, said late Tuesday that its web front end was suffering from an exploit and urged users “not to interact” with the user interface until further notice.

Homing in on the ‘Coinbase 10’ Blockchain Address  The “Coinbase 10” wallet has seen a dramatic increase in its total ETH sent and received hourly. (Coin Metrics)  Blockchain sleuths have proven relentless in their efforts to identify the holders of key addresses – for insights on their underlying activity. in a report this week, Coin Metrics analyzed on-chain data for clues on the big U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase. “From the vantage point of an on-chain data analyst, Coinbase has historically proven to be a difficult entity to examine, as it has taken sophisticated actions to secure user funds across many accounts,” according to Coin Metrics. But the firm managed to identify an active address labeled “Coinbase 10” on Etherscan, and then plotted the hourly changes in ETH sent and received by the account. “With close to 150K ETH sent and received, this account is one of the top accounts by ETH volume in that same time period,” the analysts determined.(Dune Analytics/TokenInsight)  In Case You Missed It  Please check out CoinDesk TV’s interview Wednesday with Fahmi Syed, CFO of the Polkadot-focused developer Parity Technologies.

17872838,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552156,1695229201,"Toncoin (TON) Continues To Shine, Is $3 Mark Possible?","TON has gained 1% today, September 20. It trades at $2.47 with a 30% seven-day price increase. Also, TON’s price gains confirm the entrance of buyers and an accumulation phase, which will likely continue to push the rally. TON’s price gains in the past week are likely a result of its integration with Telegram. This integration exposes TON to approximately 800 million users on Telegram, leading to a spike in its price. TON Faces Resistance At $2.58; Will The Buyers Trigger A Breakout? TON is on an uptrend today, building on its gains from September 19 to rally to the $2.58 resistance level. After briefly slipping off the $2.5 price on September 16, TON found support at $2.3, preventing a decline. And as the bull returned, the asset pushed closer to the $2.58 resistance level. Related Reading: Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move? As buyers vie to surmount barriers to further uptick, TON trades near the upper band of the Donchian Channel (DC), expressing a strong bullish sentiment. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is firmly in the overbought zone, displaying a value of 76.6. The RSI’s value implies that the buyers are not yet done with the accumulation phase and will likely rally above the closest resistance level. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) still displays a strong buy signal. The MACD is above its signal line, and its green Histogram bars confirm an ongoing massive accumulation. Based on past price action, TON will likely repeat its September 12-16 uptrend to record more gains. However, it is already in the overbought region, and a retracement for consolidation will likely occur in a few days. Nevertheless, the exciting developments in the Toncoin ecosystem will likely result in a bull run in the last quarter of 2023. TON Records Massive Price Surge Following Telegram Update Exciting ecosystem developments could be responsible for Toncoin’s performance over the past few days. According to a recent tweet, social media giant Telegram extended its support to Toncoin and introduced a new wallet called TON Space. According to sources, the unveiling happened last week at the Token 2049 conference in Singapore. Also, the CEO of Telegram, Pavel Durov, shared this exciting news on his official Telegram account, confirming that TON is the preferred blockchain network for their crypto integration. Durov said: “Starting this November, TON Wallet will be included in the settings and attachment menus for all our users outside the US and some other countries.” This integration helps them expand Telegram’s Web3 infrastructure. Interestingly, users who installed the latest version of Telegram can access the wallet option from the app menu. Toncoin developers say the upgrade aims to integrate the token within Telegram Mini-Apps. In addition, Toncoin projects could utilize these mini-apps to increase their reach and adoption. Moreover, TON-based users get priority access to Telegram Ads, exposing the projects to over 37,000 communities and millions of Telegram users. Consequently, the TON wallet will operate The Open Network (TON) blockchain. Also, the wallet will be available to over 800 million Telegram worldwide users.

The cryptocurrency rose almost 5% in the past 24 hours to $1,320, approaching its early August high of $1,366, CoinDesk price data shows. Surpassing that level would send the price to a 16-month record.  MKR has vastly outperformed the broader crypto market this year with a 152% return. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 64% over the same period, while the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF), which tracks a basket of DeFi tokens, has gained less than 10%.  The surge happened as MakerDAO, which issues the $5.5 billion stablecoin DAI, is increasingly investing its vast reserve assets in U.S. Treasuries, benefitting from the high yields in traditional bond markets.  The protocol’s annual revenue has quadrupled to $185 million since the start of the year, while estimated yearly profit jumped to $58 million from $39 million, according to a Makerburn dashboard. MakerDAO also introduced a 5% reward for DAI last month to spur demand for the stablecoin. Its supply has increased by $1 billion since early August.  Two large crypto investors – also known as whales – have been accumulating MKR this month, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted, a sign of improving sentiment towards the crypto asset. One entity bought a total of $1.95 million worth of MKR starting on Sep. 4, while another whale purchased $1.63 million of the token this week.  Crypto hedge fund Ouroboros Capital said the price surge will likely continue due to rising DAI supply and revenues, adding that a bullish technical chart pattern points to a $1,600 price target.  “Nice cup and handle forming in MKR.

If price fails to move below support and makes another run for resistance, bulls might finally buck the downtrend with a powerful, measured move to $42,000. Recapping 2023 Using Classical Technical Analysis Methods 2023 thus far has been the year that Bitcoin went mostly sideways. The year began with a strong surge from bear market lows, but failed to instill enough confidence for instant continuation. Even an inverse head and shoulders pattern has yet to produce the expected upside target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly TD Sequential Buy Setup Appears, But Warns Of Potential Risk Instead, BTCUSD has spent months and months going sideways, unable to break above $31,000 or below $25,000 per coin. With the top cryptocurrency finding support at $25,000 a second time, bulls might finally be emboldened. Using classical charting methods such as a the inverse head and shoulders neckline support and a simple downtrend line, we can begin to understand the technical explanation for the pause around this zone. Bitcoin's target is $42,000 based on the measure rule | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Tale Of Two Retest And The $42,000 Target It is common of an inverse head and shoulders pattern for price to throw back to former neckline resistance and retest it as support. This allows buyers to get in at lower levels, while those who bought earlier take profit. After a retest, Bitcoin made a substantial move up breaking through a downtrend line drawn from all-time highs. However, the confidence was still not enough for proper follow through, so Bitcoin fell back to $25,000 to test the downtrend line it broke out from. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Uptrend Remains Unbroken, Here’s Why With the level tested now twice and proving to be seemingly unbreakable, bulls might finally have the confidence to meet the target of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.

Stablecoin Whale Supply Has Dropped To Lowest In Six Months During the past few days, Bitcoin has registered some rise and has managed to breach the $27,000 level. The asset has, however, been unable to build up any sustained moves above this mark so far. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency’s price has changed in recent days: Looks like the asset has gone through some net growth in the last few days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView While moves above the level have all failed, the asset is still more than 3% up during the past week, which is more than some of the other top coins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Now, as for whether Bitcoin can find a proper break toward higher levels, data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment may provide some hints. The indicator of interest here is the combined percentage of the stablecoin circulating supply that’s being held by the whales. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been sliding down recently | Source: Santiment on X The “whales” here refer to entities that are carrying at least $5 million in their addresses. These investors are among the largest in the market, so they can hold some notable influence. Related Reading: Here’s Where Next Bitcoin Resistance Lies, From An On-Chain Perspective From the graph, it’s visible that the total stablecoin supply held by these humongous holders has been on a net decline during the past few months. Following the latest drawdown in the metric, its value has hit 51.14%, which is the lowest observed since March 18th, about six months ago. What Does This Mean For The Bitcoin Price? Now, the main question is: what’s the relevance of this metric to Bitcoin? The answer to this question lies in the reason why these holders generally choose to hold stablecoins. Investors may want to hold their capital in the form of these fiat-tied tokens whenever they intend to avoid the volatility associated with other assets in the sector like BTC. Such holders are probable to return back into the market as if they were looking to completely exit the sector, they may have done so through outflows into fiat. Once these stablecoin investors find that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile side of the market, they swap their tokens for them. This act of shifting naturally provides a buying pressure on the prices of the coins that they are moving into. Because of this reason, the stablecoin supply could serve as a measure of the potential dry powder available for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As the whales are clearly the most significant entities in the sector, the stablecoin supply held by them is of particular importance. Generally, uptrends in BTC follow periods where the whales significantly shed their stable supplies, as it means that they are buying into the asset with them. Examples of such a trend are visible in the chart, as this pattern formed both prior to the January rally and the rebound in June. These investors have been decreasing their supply recently as well, but as BTC has gone down in this period instead, it’s likely that this decline is coming from withdrawals into fiat. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By Coinbase Users? Premium Would Say So A turnaround in this indicator may be the one to watch for, as it can be a sign of fresh capital injections into the sector. Perhaps only once the whales’ buying power would return to the same levels as it was earlier in the year when Bitcoin breached $30,000, the asset would be able to find a sustained upward move.

Overall, bitcoin (BTC) has clearly been setting the mood for 2023, as proxied by the CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI), and it feels like the majority of broad crypto market-moving headlines over the past few months can be placed within the bucket of the ongoing saga towards a bitcoin spot ETF.

To better understand the context behind the crypto market’s focus on a spot ETF, it’s useful to draw some useful historical parallels to the creation of gold ETFs and their impact on the gold market.  Like gold ETFs, a bitcoin ETF would make it significantly easier for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to bitcoin. It eliminates the need for investors to directly buy and store bitcoin. While this difficulty did not discourage early adopters, it can be a complex and daunting process for many (i.e., imagine walking a grandparent through the cold storage process). Fun fact: Before the first gold ETF was launched, investors could invest in clunkier closed-end funds, gold companies like miners or lug around the actual shiny metal. With an ETF, investor demand for gold increased. A bitcoin spot ETF could do likewise, leading to a surge in buying by retail investors who aren’t currently in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) or one of the bitcoin futures ETFs like the one from ProShares (BITO).  Related to the increased accessibility would be an increase in liquidity and trading volume in the bitcoin market. Increased liquidity and further diversifying the asset’s investor base could help stabilize prices and reduce price volatility caused by illiquid market conditions. This could also shift the investor base from tech-savvy retail investors and crypto enthusiasts to more mainstream, longer-term real asset investors looking for diversification from fiat currencies.  The launch of a bitcoin ETF could catalyze further institutional adoption of bitcoin, as it would delegate the acquisition and storage of the digital asset to qualified custodians. An ETF structure also provides a more familiar and regulated investment vehicle that institutional investors are comfortable using, which could lead to more hedge funds, asset managers and pension funds allocating capital to bitcoin.  Just as the gold ETF made it easier for investors to add additional diversification to their portfolios, a bitcoin ETF could serve a similar purpose. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios may allocate some of their assets to bitcoin through the ETF, viewing it as a store of value or an uncorrelated asset class. This addition of bitcoin to a greater number of investor portfolios would likely be small in percentage terms due to the relatively young and volatile nature of the asset class, but it would still result in a meaningful flow of capital into the cryptocurrency asset class.  In summary, the introduction of a bitcoin ETF could be seen as a sign of the market's maturation. It signals that bitcoin is evolving from a niche asset class to one accepted and regulated within the traditional financial system.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  SBF’S PARENTS: It’s no secret that Sam Bankman-Fried’s personal inner circle overlapped with this business inner circle. CoinDesk very much addressed that theme last year when it reported that SBF lived with some of his top executives, including ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who ran his trading shop Alameda Research. And it’s been long-discussed how significant a role his parents played. The folks restructuring FTX just asserted they played a large role and sued them. Within the case is an eye-catching scene involving SBF’s dad acting exasperated with his son and saying he’s going to pull his mom into the situation. It wasn’t a normal family squabble over a curfew or whatever. It was Joe Bankman being angry that SBF was only paying his dad $200,000 a year, not $1 million. He wrote: “Gee, Sam I don’t know what to say here … Putting [your mom] on this.” Everyone who has parents feels this one. Relatedly, here’s CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn arguing SBF is blaming everyone but himself for FTX’s spectacular failure.  MORE TO COME: U.S. officials going after Coinbase and Binance earlier this year was scary enough for everybody in crypto. But CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton reported this week on foreboding new comments from the head of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit at the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Hamilton’s words, David Hirsch said the SEC “isn’t done chasing down crypto exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects it sees as violating securities laws in the same vein” as Coinbase and Binance. To state the obvious: This is not the sort of regulatory clarity crypto folks were hoping for.  SHARP DROP: As Binance continues to face scrutiny from regulators and maybe law enforcement officials, its business is shrinking. Its seven-day average trading volume has dwindled by 57% since the beginning of September. And this appears to be specific to Binance, as the data from K33 Research shows volumes on other exchanges have been mostly flat. “The ongoing [U.S. Department of Justice] and SEC cases versus Binance may have dissuaded market makers from trading on Binance, explaining parts of the decline,” K33 Research senior analyst Vetle Lunde said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/20/a-bitcoin-etf-has-golden-parallels-from-history,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f4c315e2c9b75b5fed7fd55d513f5c1abb18d34-4195x2802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419576,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwV3,1695224700,Understanding the Economics of Ethereum Layer 2s,"Crypto is on the verge of spawning a new investable asset class globally. And then it will slowly change how just about everything on the internet works.  With the birth of a new asset class will come new business model analysis. New KPIs, metrics, and benchmarks as valuation criteria. New reporting and audit structures. New data providers. And new buy- and sell-side research structures.  Adding to the complexity, crypto investors need to understand concepts such as Metcalf’s Law, Moore’s Law, Lindy effects, the power of open-source technologies and composability. “Good enough technology” and “The 10-year window.”  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Furthermore, investors need a framework for how value flows throughout the tech stack to effectively analyze crypto networks, protocols and applications.  This is especially important today. Ethereum is nearing its “broadband moment” – where throughput constraints are solved via a layer-2 blockchain, unleashing scalable infrastructure to support new applications and the onboarding of the next billion users.  In less than two years, we’ve seen transactions on Ethereum’s largest L2 scaling solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism and now Base) grow by 3,438%.  But what does this mean for the Ethereum layer 1?  L2s provide execution services to the application layer of the tech stack by batching transactions, compressing the data and ultimately anchoring proofs of the data to Ethereum as L1 transactions (final settlement).  Therefore, investors need to know the economic relationship between an L2 and L1 to properly assess and forecast value accrual within the tech stack.  Let’s take a look at the margins of L2s to date.  In aggregate, L2s are keeping an average of 23.5% of all transaction fees running through applications that leverage their execution engines.  Ethereum validators are receiving the remaining 76.5% of user transaction fees paid on L2.  Therefore, L2s are complementary to Ethereum and to holders of ETH, its related asset.  Every product in a marketplace has substitutes and complements. A substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too expensive. For example, chicken is a substitute for beef. A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Think gas and cars. Or hot dog buns and hot dogs.  All else being equal, demand for a product increases when the price of its complements decreases. For example, hotels in Miami will go up in price if flights to Miami drop significantly.  If L2s are complements and continuously drive down costs that enable superior user experiences, this should ultimately drive more usage of the Ethereum L1.  Complements tend to get commoditized. Therefore, we expect to see L2 margins compress over time as competitors enter the market and Moore’s Law continues to play out.  Of course, this process is still very nascent. And there are additional layers of the tech stack to monitor as well – such as the application layer, Eigen Layer (restaking and “security as a service”), data availability (Celestia), data oracles, etc.  Crypto is on the verge of spawning a new investable asset class globally.  If you’re advising clients or investing within the crypto tech stack, you need to understand how value is created and captured at each layer.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | ARB,Michael Nadeau,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/20/understanding-the-economics-of-ethereum-layer-2s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/494c76c11fcd81406ac1cc696748dfe563b46fe4-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419558,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwDV,1695223800,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Empire Was Crushed by This Infamous Balance Sheet. Here’s More of the Story,"As we gear up for Sam Bankman-Fried’s day in court, it seems prudent to step back and unpack what happened in late 2022 that got us here today:  It is one of the most consequential documents in financial history, given that it caused the collapse of a $32 billion empire in just nine days and now to a highly anticipated criminal trial.  “It” is the infamous balance sheet of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, Alameda Research. Its explosive contents served as the basis for a Nov. 2, 2022, story by CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. The article raised questions about how sturdy the company’s financial underpinnings were – and, by extension, how safe Bankman-Fried’s better-known crypto exchange FTX was.  It turns out, not at all.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  For the protection of our sources we are not publishing the document itself but rather describing its contents – in finer detail than ever before. Labeled “Consolidated Balance Sheet 2022 Q2,” it gets into the nitty gritty of Alameda’s knotty empire.  Much of that empire relied on tokens of projects Alameda was unusually close with – particularly the formerly white-hot crypto startups it invested in. For example, it led eight-figure investment rounds in the closely linked projects Oxygen and Maps.me and counted nearly $600 million worth of those projects’ tokens (locked and unlocked) on its balance sheet. When FTX went bust it stranded 95% of those projects’ token supply in a state of limbo that seems to continue to this day. Those projects’ tokens have since lost much of their value but even back then they were unlikely to be worth that much in practice. Attempting to trade them at scale on the open markets would have shattered their value.  Alameda had multiple ties to Bonfida, the project behind Solana’s version of ENS, the popular wallet naming service in the Ethereum ecosystem. It was the primary market-maker for Bonfida’s native token FIDA. It acquired millions of FIDA tokens by investing in that startup. Notably, Bonfida developers inherited development duties over the purportedly decentralized Serum crypto exchange, another FTX production.  In SRM the bounds of reality and believability began to break down for Alameda. It was a token that FTX Group coders had conjured out of nothing for the benefit of Serum, the SBF-founded trading infrastructure for much of Solana blockchain-based DeFi. Alameda reported holding nearly $183 million worth of locked SRM and $300 million unlocked, plus nearly $320 million in SRM collateral and an additional $330 million in locked SRM as a liability.  But it was Alameda’s miles-deep holdings of FTT, the exchange token minted specifically by FTX, that proved to be the empire’s undoing. CoinDesk’s Nov. 2, 2022, article authored by Ian Allison revealed that billions of dollars of FTT backed up Alameda’s largess – a fact that spooked market participants and eventually set off a run on FTX. It was during that chaos that people began to realize that the emperor had no clothes.  Four days after Allison’s story came out, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted that “due to recent revelations,” his exchange would sell its hefty FTT holdings. That quickly drove down the price of FTT, putting Bankman-Fried’s companies into a tailspin.  Bankman-Fried was forced two days later to seek a bailout from Binance. But that proposed takeover fell apart in a day, something another Allison scoop revealed was likely to happen hours before it was made official. Then, on Nov. 11, Bankman-Fried’s companies were forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  Allison’s initial scoop on the balance sheet revealed above was widely cited as the catalyst for the collapse. Thousands of news stories credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast.  CoinDesk journalists went on to win a George Polk Award, one of the top journalism honors, for their FTX coverage. And they’re finalists for the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award; winners for that will be announced next week.  Logistics notes  Prosecutors expect jury selection (“voir dire”) to take about a day, and are asking the judge overseeing the case to treat Friday, Oct. 6, as a trial day instead of as the first day of a four-day weekend.  They’re also citing the need to schedule out-of-town witnesses as a key issue for the first few days of the trial, suggesting they may bring their heavy hitters – the FTX inner circle – out early.  — Danny Nelson, Nick Baker",NEGATIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | FTT,"Danny Nelson, Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/20/breaking-down-the-infamous-alameda-balance-sheet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 6-Year Slumber And Transfers $56 Million,"Movement of dormant Bitcoin addresses has been sporadic this year, with most causing a stir and rising interest amongst the Bitcoin community. In the latest record of whale transactions this year, on-chain data has shown that a set of dormant Bitcoin from 2017 has moved for the first time in six years. Peckshield, a blockchain security and data analytics firm, revealed in a tweet that the previously inactive address, which held 2,100 BTC has just become active, with its assets now transferred to a different address. Whale Wakes Up From Slumber, Moves $56 Million According to data from BitInfoCharts, this Bitcoin address initially had its first Bitcoin transaction of 2099.99 BTC on October 10, 2019. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at $5,618, putting the total value of the transaction at $11.79 million. Bitcoin has grown substantially since then, with a unit now going for $27,140 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price?

42419563,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwIf,1695222000,"'We Can't Build Something Like This on Ethereum,' Says DYdX Founder as Mainnet Nears","Antonio Juliano was a fresh-faced computer-science grad from Princeton University in 2015 when he joined the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase as a software engineer. He only stayed for a year, but he caught the blockchain bug.  Now Juliano oversees one of the biggest and most closely-tracked decentralized exchanges, dYdX, which he founded in 2017.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  He’s been in the news lately, because dYdX is on an odyssey – moving from a layer-2 network in the Ethereum ecosystem onto its own blockchain built using Cosmos technology. A test network was announced in July, and after some delays, the main network (mainnet) launch is now expected next month.  We spoke with Juliano last week about the transition, as well as some key blockchain issues that the industry is grappling with. Some highlights:  On the status of the migration: “We're just in the final stages of testing.”  On assembling a community of blockchain validators in the Cosmos ecosystem: “We're probably going to start with something on the order of 50 to 100 validators and then scale up from there.”  On the scaling advantages of the move: “We can't build something like this on Ethereum.”  On how fast dYdX needs the new blockchain to go: “We need more on the order of 1,000-plus transactions per second.”  On how his firm has managed to avoid the wrath of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission: “The most important thing to note is that dYdX has never offered derivative products to US customers.”  Q: You've got the main net launch coming in October, but you had previously targeted September. What's the status now? And what are the things that you have to do to get there?  Juliano: It's a pretty big project – building a whole layer-1 blockchain. We're also building some really interesting novel things into our blockchain. At a high level, we're building a decentralized but off-chain order book and matching engine, which is going to be way more scalable than anything else that's existed in DeFi. We've been working on this for a little over a year now. And I actually think that's a really fast timeline to be able to bring this to market. And at the beginning of the year, we'd set the end of September date, and it got pushed back. It'll probably be sometime early- to mid-October at this point. But I still feel really good about that. Obviously, we want to have a lot of confidence in the security and correctness and stuff of what we're launching. TLDR it's pretty much completely built. And we're just in the final stages of testing.  Q: You have to get your own community of validators, as opposed to other setups where you might just kind of inherit somebody else's security domain. What's involved in that? How do you find those validators? Or what's the challenge there?  Juliano: So it actually hasn't been that challenging, surprisingly. And it's not really something we're even involved in. We're really just focusing on building the open-source software. And I think one of the things that enables that for us is, dYdX is not a new project, right? We've been around for six years. We have around a billion dollars a day that's traded on dYdX. The brand is pretty strong. And I think for the people that are validators, and this has actually become a pretty robust community within Cosmos and some other appchains, where there's lots of people that have made a business out of running validators. To have a project like dYdX, come in with a really big user base with a really big brand already, it's very likely, without very much, or any effort from our part, or the rest of the dYdX community parts, that people are going to want to validate, because there's incentives to do so. So that's kind of how we think about it. We're probably going to start with something on the order of 50 to 100 validators and then scale up from there.”  Q: Can you talk about how the new dYdX chain might scale your project versus your prior versions of the protocol?  Juliano: We do need a really high amount of scalability, which is kind of the main reason that we're building what we're building. And the reason for that is, obviously, we can't build something like this on Ethereum. Maybe that's not even close to scalable enough. We considered building on some other chains like Solana or potentially other L2’s. We decided against Solana because it doesn't actually have enough scalability for us. Not to claim that our scalability is that much higher than its allotted high level. I think it will be higher because of the off-chain order book. But the other problem with that is that we don't have all of Solana to ourselves, right? So even if Solana it is every bit as scalable as the dYdX chain, for what we're building, to share it with other people, pay transaction fees, and that's not really the user experience that we're looking for. And then on the layer-2 side, there's kind of two problems with that. First of all, the layer 2s are just not even close to scalable enough yet. And we actually know that very well. Because today we are pretty much the biggest app that's been built on layer 2 to date. We've been running on StarkWare, not Starknet, but a proprietary deployment of the StarkWare protocol that they built for us. And that's been going really well, and that's been an awesome partnership. But the main problem is that it's not scalable enough. And because of that, we have to run components of our architecture off-chain.  Q: Can you break it down in terms of some numbers?  Juliano: So, L2’s right now can kind of process on the order of 100 transactions per second or so, which is great. That's kind of a 10x improvement over Ethereum itself. But we need more on the order of 1,000-plus transactions per second, just because of the nature of the product that we're building. So obviously, decentralized exchanges were targeted at financial derivatives. And our main customers are institutions and pretty advanced crypto traders, who need a really high amount of scalability and need an order book to be able to trade on. That's one of the key things to understand about dYdX – that while most decentralized exchanges these days are automated market makers, dYdX is not, at least, so far. We're an order-book-based decentralized exchange. And that requires a really high amount of scalability.  Q: Why is that?  Juliano: Just think about what's going on on the platform. We have all of these trading bots, market makers. Individuals are running that are placing and canceling orders all the time on this order-book-based architecture. That's just kind of how exchanges work before. When you're placing and canceling these orders, they're normally not getting filled. Maybe 1% of the orders on the chain will get filled. And market makers really want to not have to pay transaction fees, if they're just placing an order and it's not getting filled. Why would you want to do that? That's a terrible experience. So that was kind of the key insight that we had that brought us to the conclusion of, why we're building what we're building is that, first of all, we need a really high amount of scalability for placing and canceling orders. But we actually don't need that high of a scalability yet, at least for the trades themselves. Maybe 1% of the trades match, and those actually go into consensus.  Q: How does it work?  Juliano: What we're building on V.4 and the dYdX chain is what I term, a decentralized, but off-chain order book. And it is decentralized, because it's run by the validators themselves, kind of think of it like, you know, the mempool in blockchains. In general, we're effectively using the mempool to run this order book, but we're just customizing the mempool in a way that makes it really efficient for running dYdX. So people can place and cancel orders all the time, they're going to this decentralized network of the validators themselves. But the cool thing is, they're not actually going on-chain until they're matched. And that's awesome, right? Because again, like only 1% of the orders actually match. So that gives you pretty much 100x scalability right there. Because these things on the order book, you don't have to come to consensus on them. And that's just a really hard computer science problem, right? Like, how do you scale blockchains, we have some thoughts on that. But we're not going to be 10x better at scaling blockchains than everybody else that's out there right now. But we can kind of have these key insights and build something really custom for what dYdX’s unique needs are.  Q: You were saying you need on the order of 1,000 transactions per second. What do you expect to actually achieve, post-launch?  Juliano: When most general purpose chains do benchmarking, they'll look at, oh, maybe I could send you ether or send you a more simple transaction than something that's more complex, and it might take more gas. For us, trading is trading and we know what it's going to be. And we've tested with the network of, I think, on the order of 50 validators or so, and achieved 2,000 transactions per second so far, and that's pretty cool. Because, remember, again, there's no gas fees involved in this. So you can kind of get 2,000 transactions per second with no gas fees. And we'll continue to improve from there if there's a lot of low hanging fruits in the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, some of which we're working on ourselves to improve, some of which the Cosmos community is working on to improve, but that's actually the level of throughput that dYdX V.3, which is the current version of dYdX, has right now. It's on the order of 1,000 per second.  Q: So why did you need more?  Juliano: We want to grow, right? So I think if you were to look at a Coinbase, or a Binance, I don't have the stats in front of me. So we're topping out StarkWare, we're at sort of around 1,000. But let's go one level deeper and kind of understand that a little bit more. So the 1,000 transactions per second that I'm quoting right now is just on our backend. That's before you even hit StarkWare, and it's just the order book that's running on our servers in the cloud on AWS, then again, kind of remember the main metric, which is 1% of the orders actually fill. So if we have 1,000 orders placed per second, well, that means only 10 orders per second or so are actually filling. And that's the amount of throughput that's actually hitting StarkWare right now is probably on the order of 10 to 20 per second.  Q: With dYdX you've obviously got this more kind of hybrid, centralized/decentralized exchange model.  Juliano: Yes, definitely, I would characterize dYdX V3 as a great example of a hybrid exchange. There are some centralized components, and decentralized components, the whole thing is noncustodial. That's maybe there are tradeoffs that you're making from a decentralization perspective. And I think that's worked pretty well, for us so far. And I'm really glad that we did take that path. I think it allowed us to scale a lot, allowed us to iterate more quickly, find product market fit and build a product that our users really want. But the plan behind dYdX and I would argue most if not all DeFi platforms, I think, or at least the ones that that seem reasonable to me, is to become fully decentralized at some point or another. So that's how I've always thought about it as it's just kind of a step along the path. We do really want to build something that is fully decentralized, just because you can't get all the benefits of DeFi unless you are fully decentralized. And that's kind of the main thing, if you remember one thing about the dYdX chain, or V4, it is fully decentralized, whereas V3 was not.  Q: In the past year, community sentiment towards those sorts of hybrid models has shifted. Let's hear your take on how you pitch dYdX within that framing, and whether you've seen sentiment changing.  Juliano: There's certainly trade offs to both and there are honestly some people that care about decentralization, and some people that don't. I'd say institutions in some ways care less than retail about the centralization, not zero. One of the really cool things that's happened on dYdX and some other platforms recently, is institutions like Wintermute, and some other progressive trading firms have taken a really big stance in governance. And I think they actually value that a lot, kind of being able to be on a platform that's totally transparent, they know is fair, and they know they have some control over going forwards. Like that's just really, really different than trading on a Binance. Even if the Binance is every bit or better of a product experience for them. Just kind of like having this control. And this transparency is really valuable as well.  Q: What are you looking for in terms of the composition of your validators, and whether that’s more organic like Ethereum and Bitcoin or more institution-based?  Juliano: At least the state of the world right now on Cosmos is that the validators are indeed known entities and pretty much entirely, they're more institutional, smaller institutions like institutions and kind of the crypto sense. A lot of these shops are, OK, maybe it's a company, but it's just a few people running one of these things across a couple of different networks. And that's where we're at right now, I think there's a lot of development effort in Cosmos that's going into increasing the number of maximum validators that you have. And the reason for that is, so there's just kind of this relationship with how Tendermint works, that the more validators you have, generally, the less scalable the chain is. And as much as we can improve those things, then it's like, we can have more validators with the same or better level of throughput. And that's something that will take time.  Q: Antonio, you wrote this spicy tweet on Aug. 24 about single sequencers in the Ethererum layer-2 landscape. What was that all about?  Juliano: I do strongly believe that layer 2s will get to a point where the sequencer is a network, rather than just a single operator. And that will make the sequencers much more decentralized, censorship-resistant. But the problem with having a single sequencer on layer 2’s right now is, the single sequencers are not censorship-resistant, right? It's just like, literally a server, and the server can refuse to process your transactions if it wants to. Like, I'm not trying to pick on anyone, like literally all of them are like this, but let's just take like Coinbase or Base as an example. Coinbase is literally running a server that is the sequencer for the Base chain. And if they want to reject your transaction, for whatever reason, they can do that. And, you know, I think they're trying to be as impartial as possible. And that's awesome. But that is not totally decentralized, I may say. And just to prove the point that I kind of understand most of the arguments at least, OK, there's a way to get around the censorship-resistance switches. Effectively, you can go back to layer 1, and send a transaction to layer 1 and be like, Oh, Coinbase, you have to include my transaction now because I went to the layer 1. But that's a terrible product experience, right? Like maybe that works for some edge cases, or if like the less than 1% of the time when, for some random reason somebody's being centralized by a sequencer. But if there's a good amount of opportunity for a sizable amount of the transactions to be censored on a given sequencer, for whatever reason, then this may not be something that you want for your network as much.  Q: I would be interested in your thoughts on these recent CFTC settlements announced with some other decentralized exchanges?  Juliano: Yeah, I mean, it's something that we obviously pay a lot of attention to. So I think we have had, like, we have had conversations with the CFTC for six years now, which is the entire time that dYdX has been around. And we haven't had anything happen with dYdX so far, which I think has been a really great thing and I think speaks to the amount of compliance and thought that we put into being compliant with regulations. It's something we think a lot about: How can we be innovative but still within the bounds of the law, both as they are today, and then how can we be potentially change the law through policy going forward? So I think that's how you try to play it right now. In some ways, the laws are very clear. But in some ways, a lot of this precedent is still being established within crypto. And that's a great thing, right? But, you know, you can look at maybe a different example of Coinbase and the SEC. And Coinbase is now openly taking the position that they disagree with the regulators.  Q: What are some of the key differences for why those sorts of allegations might not apply to dYdX?  Juliano: I'm not a lawyer. And I can't talk about totally transparently everything we're doing internally, right? There's a lot of stuff that we do internally, from a compliance perspective, that does make it fundamentally different. I mean, the most important thing to note is that dYdX has never offered derivative products to U.S. customers. That is pretty much like the main thing right there, right? And we have had these conversations with the CFTC. But so far, obviously, we haven't gotten to a place where we feel comfortable offering our products to U.S. customers, at least with the laws as they are right now. And that's why we're trying to change them in the future. So users in the U.S. can get access to these safer products and aren't exposed to trading on these unregulated exchanges offshore, because none of the regulated ones can serve their needs. So I think that's kind of the fundamental difference is that we've been really thoughtful and careful about this. We were fortunate to be well funded, fortunate to have worked with all of the top blue chip investors in the space. That doesn't solve all your problems, but at least gives you access to the best resources, right? Like we have, like the best lawyers. And I think it is a little silly, but you know, this is kind of the way it is that, a lot of the details matter in these cases.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization experienced a significant upturn, clawing its way back from the $1,550 support level just last week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,655 according to CoinGecko, showcasing a commendable 5% uptick. This surge has bolstered investor confidence, prompting them to set their sights on challenging the overhead resistance trendline. Related Reading: BNB Trading Sideways In Last 30 Days – Is Stagnation Likely Until October? Battling The Resistance: A Critical Juncture The current phase in Ethereum’s price dynamics is marked by a descending resistance trendline. Over the past two months, the cryptocurrency has encountered this formidable resistance barrier twice, both instances leading to a sharp downturn in price. This pattern underscores the resurgence of selling pressure whenever the price nears this elusive boundary. Analysts are closely monitoring the situation, suggesting that should ETH breach the September 18 low of $1,610, it could open the floodgates for bears to push the asset below the $1,550 floor. Such a scenario could set the trajectory towards the $1,460 mark, representing a potential decline of 9.5%. The battle with overhead resistance remains a pivotal juncture for Ethereum, with both bulls and bears on edge. ETH market cap currently at $195 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Ethereum: Blockspace Profitability Concurrently, Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem is encountering a series of exceptional challenges. Insights from Blockworks data have illuminated a noteworthy aspect of Ethereum’s blockchain activity: it has consistently yielded profits since the network’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022. This transition was heralded as a pivotal moment in Ethereum’s evolution, aiming to enhance its scalability, security, and sustainability. Related Reading: Halving Hype: Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Parabolic Ride, Analyst Says Activity on the Ethereum network has dwindled, leading to September shaping up as the first month to post significant losses since the proof-of-stake upgrade. Throughout the month, Ethereum’s blockspace has recorded only one day of profitability, with losses accumulating to a staggering $15.9 million as of Monday.

The platform confirmed that a Domain Name System (DNS) attack targeted the DEX, preventing users from accessing the DEX. Related Reading: Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move? Ethereum DeFi Under Siege According to an official post, a team is investigating the DNS attack against Balancer. In the meantime, users were asked to avoid interacting with the DEX’s front end to prevent them from falling victim to the bad actors. In a DNS attack, bad actors can employ different strategies to compromise the security of a website and drain the users’ crypto wallets. Until the investigation is concluded, the team behind Balancer cannot guarantee that the attackers won’t target users. The team behind the DEX added the following, confirming the protocol’s Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) involvement in resolving the current situation: The Balancer DAO is actively addressing the current DNS attack and is working with all relevant parties to ensure the full recovery of the Balancer UI. In the meantime, please DO NOT interact with http://balancer.fi or http://app.balancer.fi until further notice. Independent crypto investigator ZachXBT reported that over $238,000 had been stolen from the DEX. The investigator confirmed that the funds were sent to this Ethereum address: 0x645710Af050E26bB96e295bdfB75B4a878088d7E. Further data from Etherscan confirms that the bad actors have begun moving the funds. The individuals use Tornado Cash, another decentralized exchange, to “launder” the stolen funds to gain anonymity. Pseudonym user Defi_Hanzo was the first to report this development and the first to lose money to the hackers to confirm the DNS attack theory. As seen below, the bad actors took over the Balancer front-end and asked users to change input in the chain where they hold most of their funds. Once this transaction was completed, bad actors could drain the user’s wallet. DeFi_Hanzo asked the team behind Balancer for a refund after falling victim to the attack. DeFi’s Public Enemy Number One Balancer is just one of the many DEX or DeFi applications that have been the victim of some strategy to steal their funds. As Bitcoinist reported, hacks, scams, and other criminal activities in the nascent sector were up 75% by the end of H2 2023 compared to 2022. Bad actors stole over $650 million over that period, which has continued to rise in the coming months. Of all of the sectors in the crypto industry, DeFi has been the most affected. The different protocols and applications supported by DeFi platforms lost almost $300 million by the end of H2, 2023. The North Korean affiliate hacker group “Lazarus” has been responsible for many attacks. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price?

42419559,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwEX,1695211353,Arbitrum Blockchain Traders Can Now Protect Against 'Impermanent Loss',"Decentralized trading service GammaSwap today launched on the Arbitrum network in a move developers say could benefit liquidity providers on the popular blockchain by offering a way of protecting against what's known as impermanent loss.  GammaSwap allows decentralized finance (DeFi) users to borrow liquidity provider (LP) tokens from automated market makers (AMMs) and “short” them, hedging against supplied collateral or creating low-risk trading strategies. Shorting is a strategy for profiting from a drop in the price of an asset.  Automated market makers are blockchain-based trading mechanisms that group assets together in a so-called pool and fix a trading ratio based on the balance between supply and demand. A liquidity provider – someone who provides an asset to the pool in exchange for a reward – takes on the risk that the ratio will change, resulting in an impermanent loss (IL).  Impermanent loss occurs when the pool rebalances. As the prices of the tokens in the pool diverge from their starting ratio, the liquidity provider position loses value. The higher the volatility, i.e. the more the ratio between the prices of the tokens diverges, the more the LP loses and the more likely they are to have negative returns. The loss is impermanent because it's erased if the ratio returns to the starting position.  Since market volatility and LP profits are inversely related, the liquidity providers are essentially “shorting” volatility, that is they profit when volatility is low and lose money when volatility is high. That's what GammaSwap is looking to tackle.  GammaSwap allows traders to “go long” volatility, rather than shorting it, by effectively “shorting” LP tokens. It allows them to take the opposite position to a liquidity provider and create an impermanent gain rather than an impermanent loss.  These features could help encourage more users to become liquidity providers as it allows them to hedge against falling token prices, and should therefore increase liquidity across Arbitrum.  A GammaSwap representative told CoinDesk that the team plans to deploy on more blockchains, such as BNB Chain and Ethereum, and provide support for Uniswap LPs – which lock billions of dollars worth of tokens across thousands of trading pairs.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Volatility, or the degree of price turbulence, in bitcoin (BTC) remains suppressed, consistent with the calm in U.S. stock and bond markets. The low volatility will likely continue after Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision, according to some crypto traders. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 14:00 ET accompanied by a statement, the Summary of Economic Projections and a new ""dot plot"" of interest-rate estimates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow with a press conference 30 minutes later. To tame inflation, the central bank has raised rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with the early phase of the so-called tightening cycle injecting volatility into the liquidity-addicted crypto and traditional markets.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s dad, Joe Bankman, was paid a $200,000 salary by FTX’s U.S. division, according to the filing from FTX’s bankruptcy estate, which just sued the parents. But that wasn’t enough, he said, telling an FTX executive in a Jan. 12, 2022, message that he was supposed to get $1 million annually starting the previous month, according to the filing. Then he emailed his son. “Gee, Sam I don’t know what to say here,” he wrote, according to the filing. “This is the first [I] have heard of the 200K a year salary! Putting Barbara on this.” Barbara is former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried’s mom, Barbara Fried.  Bitcoin trading volumes on Binance have tumbled this month as lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny mount on the world’s largest crypto exchange. According to K33 Research, Binance’s seven-day average spot BTC volume is down 57% since the beginning of September versus roughly flat readings at a number of other exchanges. Volumes at U.S.-based competitor Coinbase are 9% higher. The dramatic decline comes as Binance is in the crosshairs of regulators around the world following a string of lawsuits, license rejections and voluntary withdrawals. Prosecutors at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are reportedly weighing charges against the company, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) three months ago sued Binance, the exchange’s U.S. entity Binance.US and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, alleging breaches of multiple federal securities laws.

17865916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552122,1695209405,Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move?,"Ripple Labs has once again become the focus of much scrutiny and debate within the XRP community. Recent data points to a series of high-volume XRP transactions totaling 506 million tokens, valued at approximately $260 million, carried out over the span of 19 days. What makes these transactions especially noteworthy is not just their sheer volume but also the repetitive nature and targeted destinations. Ripple Transaction Breakdown Between the end of August and mid-September, a total of 15 significant XRP transactions were initiated by two Ripple-controlled addresses. These transfers were diligently logged by Whale Alert, a reputable platform that tracks large crypto transactions. The initiation of this flurry was a 31 million XRP transaction on August 30. Of significant note is the consistent pattern observed in many of these transfers. On numerous occasions, amounts exceeding 29 million tokens were transferred to the U.K.-based exchange, Bitstamp. This has ignited curiosity given Ripple’s acquisition of a stake in Bitstamp earlier this year. The specifics of this deal remain undisclosed, but the recurrent transfer of significant XRP sums to the exchange’s wallets post-acquisition does warrant attention. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions The address responsible for the majority of these transactions to Bitstamp, although initially unidentified by Whale Alert, is believed to be directly associated with Ripple Labs. This has led to intense speculation within the community. The direct involvement of Bitstamp in these transactions, combined with Ripple’s known stake in the exchange, raises questions about the nature and intent of these transfers. Another Ripple-associated address was also active, executing two prominent transfers on September 11 and September 18, totaling 175 million XRP in mid-September. Of these, 100 million XRP was moved to a wallet linked with the Canadian SideShift crypto exchange. In a previous instance, similar transactions were observed from the Binance platform to Ripple’s wallets, but no clarifications were provided by either party at the time. Market Implications The magnitude of these transactions has understandably caused ripples in the market, leading to speculations about potential systemic selloffs. The recent acquisition of financial services entity Fortress by Ripple has further added fuel to the fire. Questions are being raised about whether Ripple could potentially be leveraging its XRP holdings to facilitate such acquisitions. Related Reading: This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US Bill Morgan, an advocate in the XRP circle, queried the relationship between the XRP transactions and the acquisition of Fortress, hinting at the potential impact of such a move on XRP’s price. While these significant XRP transfers have undoubtedly stirred the crypto community, it’s essential to highlight that Ripple Labs has, in the past, regularly transferred large XRP sums for various operational reasons. “I wouldn’t want to think that Ripple sold a lot of XRP to fund this acquisition and bailing out of Fortress customers putting downward price pressure on XRP. But that couldn’t be the cause of the price fall today as the whole crypto market fell,” he tweeted. Currently, neither Ripple Labs nor Bitstamp has provided any official insight into these recent transactions, leaving room for speculation. As the crypto ecosystem awaits an official response, maybe the next quarterly report by Ripple will deliver answers when the companies presents news stats on its quarterly XRP sales. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5139.

A projected halving event should see the price of Bitcoin jump. Buying Bitcoin over a miner like CLSK, however, appears to be safer move. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) has been a volatile stock to say the least. It’s up nearly 75% since my original “Buy” write-up in March and up 20% since I took it to “Hold” in June . However, it’s also down -40% from its July 17 th intraday high of $7.599. Let’s catch-up on CLSK stock. Company Profile As a refresher, CLSK is a Bitcoin miner that owns and operates its own facilities. It doesn’t lease its space to any outside miners. Its main campus is located on over 16 acres in Georgia. It also has a co-location agreement with Coinmint for miners in New York. The company doesn’t hedge its holdings, nor does it regularly try to trade Bitcoin. However, it will sell the Bitcoin it mines to help fund its operations and grow. Management has said it doesn’t use any specific algorithms or programs to decide when to sell any Bitcoin. Expansion and Fiscal Q3 Results One of the big themes in my earlier write-ups was CLSK’s continued race to increase its efficiency and improve its hashrate. To remain competitive, this is something all Bitcoin miners must do. On this front, the company has been progressing nicely. CLSK has been in the process of expanding both its Washington and Sandersville campuses in Georgia. In mid-July, the company announced that phase 2 of its Washington mining campus was online. The expansion adds power capacity of 50 megawatts from more than 15,000 machines, of which 10,500 were in operation at the time of the announcement. The expansion will increase its computing power to 8.5 exahash per second (EH/s). The company has a goal to get to 16 EH/s by year-end. Meanwhile, the company acquired two turnkey Bitcoin mining facilities in Dalton, Georgia in June for $9.3 million in cash. CLSK said the deal adds 1 EH/s to the company’s hashrate, as it will add 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s that it purchased earlier this year to the facility. CLSK also continues to purchase computer power picking up 12,500 brand new Antminer S19 XP bitcoin mining machine for $40.5 million in early June. The price came out to $23 per terahash, which was an increase from the $13.15 per terahash it paid in February. While the company said the deal was at a discount, prices have since come down after its purchase. While the February deal was a great one, CLSK would have been better off waiting a month to buy new machines. Hash Rate Index On its fiscal Q3 earnings call , CEO Xachary Bradford said: “I want to take a moment and announce that we have fully funded our growth to 16 exahash. This includes machines, materials and everything else, nuts to bolts that goes into building a world-class Bitcoin mining facility and bridging the gap to 16 exahash per second. This creates certainty for our shareholders around our future and puts any questions to bed about our path to 16 exahash per second. We are building transformational infrastructure with almost 90,000 machines deployed and another 60,000 on hand or pending delivery for a total fleet of approximately 150,000 state-of-the-art miners, all fully funded. We are operating over 9 exahash per second, and over the next half of the year, we expect to add an additional 7 exahashes per second after energizing the expansion of our data center in Sandersville, Georgia. That expansion, I again would like to state is fully funded. I know this has been an important question for many of you. There is no longer any uncertainty about when we will have the funds in hand to pay for the expansion and the miners. That day is today. Our track record speaks for itself.” Being fully funded for its growth this year is important for a couple of reasons. One, it removes any uncertainty that the company would be able to get funding in a world of high interest rates and more scrutiny among lenders. It also allows the company to build-up its Bitcoin holdings and not have to sell them right away to fuel any growth. With its Washington campus expansion online, CLSK can now focus on its larger Sandersville expansion. The expansion is expected to take Sandersville from 80 megawatts operating capacity to 230 megawatts, a huge jump. The company will be waiting on the Municipal Energy Authority of Georgia to complete a nearby substation to help power the plant, so the timing for it to be up and fully running will be a bit out of its hands. For CLSK’s fiscal Q3 results, the company saw revenue rise 47% to $45.5 million, just below the $45.71 analyst consensus. EPS was a loss of -12 cents, better than the -17 cent loss analysts expected. Gross margins improved from 48% to 55%, helped by lower power costs. Its all-in cost of power for proprietary mining sites was $0.041 per kilowatt hour. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $13.3 million, up 160% year over year. At quarter end, the company had $22 million in cash, $18 million in debt, and 529 Bitcoin valued at around $14 million. Bitcoin traded between $20,000-31,000 for most of Q3, and the average revenue per Bitcoin mined was $27,982. It is currently trading just over $27,000. The direct cost to mine one Bitcoin at its owned facilities was $11,467. Conclusion With a mining cost of nearly $11,500 per Bitcoin in Q3 and nearly $10,500 per Bitcoin in other expenses not including D&A, CLSK is getting about $5,000 in profit per bit coin it mines. With its expansion and increased hashrate, CLSK should be able to reduce its costs, but energy costs are a big input, and those costs have been going up not down. However, with a Bitcoin halving projected for around next April, the price of Bitcoin will have to get to over $40,000 just for the company to be around breakeven on mining. As reminder, the Bitcoin block reward will be cut in half to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25 Bitcoin when this event takes place. Theoretically, the price of Bitcoin should rise 50-100% from today’s levels just to make mining worthwhile, and anything under $40,000 for an extended period after this event would likely cause many smaller miners to go by the wayside. Ahead of the halving event, it seems the more prudent move is holding Bitcoin over the miners, such as CLSK. Bitcoin prices must move a lot to make mining feasible, so while the miners could be a juiced way to play a Bitcoin price increase, they also carry a lot more risk and Bitcoin prices will need to double just to keep their economics the same. As such, I continue to recommend buying Bitcoin directly over CLSK or any other miners. I like what CLSK is doing to prepare for this event, but Bitcoin is the better value.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4636212-cleanspark-making-nice-progress-but-bitcoin-better-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17864628.jpeg

42392548,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg87Nb,1695204370,Volatility in $25 Trillion U.S. Treasury Market Slides. Here's Why It Matters to Crypto,"There is an uncanny sense of calm in the $25 trillion U.S. Treasury market even as the Federal Reserve shows its resolve to keep borrowing costs higher. The tranquility is supportive of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The MOVE index, an options-based measure of volatility in Treasury notes, fell to 96.61 on Friday, the lowest since the Fed began raising rates in March 2022, according to charting platform TradingView. At press time, it is down almost 50% from the peak of 198 registered this March.  Treasury debt securities, issued by the government and widely considered the world's safest and most liquid instruments, have risen to the apex of global collateral and securities finance.  Reduced bond volatility stabilizes leveraged financing, allowing the rehypothecation of collateral to create money. In other words, it alleviates liquidity stress in the global market, incentivizing higher borrowing and gearing of portfolios. That is a positive outcome for risk assets like bitcoin and stocks. Higher bond market volatility does the opposite, forcing leveraged players to sell assets and reduce their exposure to risk. Peaks in the MOVE index tend to mark bottoms in stock market indexes.  Bitcoin has regained some poise during the MOVE index's recent decline. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 8% since hitting a low below $25,000 on Sept. 11, CoinDesk data show.  The latest decline in the index helps ease financial conditions, while major central banks appear in no mood to deliver rapid rate cuts any time soon.  The index, however, may surge if an unexpected shock forces the unwinding of leveraged short bets in Treasury futures.  ""The current build-up of leveraged short positions in U.S. Treasury futures is a financial vulnerability worth monitoring because of the margin spirals it could potentially trigger,"" the Bank for International Settlements warned in its latest quarterly report.

42392535,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg86YJ,1695204314,UK Just Passed an Online Safety Bill That Will Apply to the Metaverse,"U.K. lawmakers on Tuesday passed a new bill covering internet safety that will also apply to the metaverse.

Companies must also come up with ways to mitigate these risks, a requirement that is expected to boost both freedom and safety online, according to a government press release.  As the metaverse – a collection of virtual worlds – grows, thanks in part to Facebook's grand rebranding to Meta, U.K. policymakers have viewed it necessary that the Online Safety Bill applies to virtual spaces.  “The metaverse is in scope of the bill, which, as noble Lords know, has been designed to be technology neutral and future-proofed to ensure that it keeps pace with emerging technologies,” Lord Stephen Parkinson, a member of the Parliament's upper house and minister at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said during a July debate on the bill.

17863928,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552125,1695204019,"Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In","The possibilities of how high the XRP price can go has triggered heated debate among crypto community members over the past week. One particular forecast put the price of the cryptocurrency as high as $10,000 as Ripple advances in the payments sector. However, the validity of this prediction is still heavily debated, leading crypto analysts to weigh in on whether this price point is possible. Analyst Explains Why $10,000 Is Not Possible One analyst who has weighed in on the XRP price to $10,000 debate is Zach Rector. Following the circulation of predictions that the altcoin could rise to this level, Rector came forward to explain why he doesn’t believe that the XRP price can climb that high. Related Reading: Incoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here’s Why In the post that was made on X (formerly Twitter), Rector points toward a currency reset and debt restructuring as the reason behind his belief. According to him, both a Currency Reset and Debt Restructuring would have to take place before the altcoin can mount such a rally. Explaining further, Rector points toward both of these taking place before the cryptocurrency could even rise to a much lower price point of $50. So he believes that instead of putting forward such price predictions, the question to be asked is, “How high will XRP go before we have a RESET?” Another X user chimed in in response to Rector’s tweet to say it is possible for the XRP price to reach $10,000. However, they believe that this will only happen if the current high inflation rates are maintained. In a follow-up tweet, the user gives XRP a 5% chance of actually reaching $10,000. “$10,000 is possible but that would be assuming that we maintain this disastrous inflation rate, XRP becomes worldwide cross border payment currency of choice with no competition, and Tokenization takes place and at least 10-20% of one of the top 10 markets worldwide utilizes XRP,” the tweet reads. Why The Sudden Bullishness On XRP Price? Indicators and investors alike first turned bullish for the XRP price following Ripple’s victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July. The price of the coin had risen over 60% in the days following the ruling as interest ballooned. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions The token’s rally has since slowed down since then, wiping the majority of its gains from the ruling. However, crypto analysts remain bullish. One analyst put the XRP price at $130, while another analyst sees it going as high as $500. XRP’s trading volumes, which have been nearly consistent above $1 billion, also show that investors are heavily involved in the coin. This sustained bullishness is further fueled by Ripple’s exploits in the payments sector, as well as working with various countries on their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

That growth has been in the company's self-mining segment. The more profitable cloud hash business is in decline. BTDR announced a $150 million share purchase agreement with B. Riley. The proceeds will be used for working capital and corporate purposes. Still one of the newest Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners from a publicly traded equity standpoint, Bitdeer Technologies ( BTDR ) is starting to make me look somewhat foolish for calling it a ""hold"" twice in the last five months. Data by YCharts Bitdeer is one of just three miners with a market cap over $1 billion. Many of the companies in the sector broke out of a consolidation range on June 20th. Since that breakout, BTDR shares are up over 20% while most of the other equities have completely retraced their breakouts. The company has a fairly unique model among the other publicly traded mining firms because, among other business segments, it also sells cloud hash rate to retail consumers. In my last Bitdeer article published in late-June, I noted the difference in profitability between the company's self-mining and cloud mining businesses: It appears somewhat apparent that selling the company's hash rate is a more profitable business than actually mining with the machines. Given that, I could understand keeping more of the proprietary mining capacity for the company if Bitdeer was actively trying to scale a BTC treasury. However, that doesn't appear to be the case. We're now seeing an interesting change in some of the company's recent production updates and in the latest quarterly earnings report. August Production In the month of August, Bitdeer reported self-mining 383 Bitcoin. That figure tied the company with Bitfarms ( BITF ) for the 5th largest August production haul. BTC Mined July 2023 August 2023 Change Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 1,176 1,072 -104 Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ) 1,022 965 -57 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 575 659 84 Iris Energy ( IREN ) 423 410 -13 BITF 378 383 5 BTDR 220 383 163 Source: Company filings, analyst's calculations Like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), which shifted capacity to energy credits due to the Texas heat, Bitdeer also took steps to curtail mining at its Texas facility though as far as I can tell the company didn't quantify what it earned from those credits. Bitdeer's 163 mined BTC increase over July gave the company the biggest aggregate month over month increase in the sector. That production growth was mainly attributable to capacity expansion at its Gedu Datacenter. Metrics August 2023 July 2023 August 2022 Total EH/s under management 21.3 20.6 12.2 - Proprietary hash rate 8.7 7.9 4.3 • Self-mining 7.2 3.8 2.5 • Cloud Hash Rate 1.5 1.6 1.8 • Delivered but not yet energized - 2.5 - - Hosting 12.6 12.7 7.9 Source: Bitdeer At the end of August, Bitdeer had 7.2 in self-mining EH/s versus 1.5 in cloud hash rate. In my view, the changes in these proprietary hash numbers are interesting because Bitdeer's capacity growth in the segment is coming from self-mining versus cloud hash services. Proprietary hash has doubled since August 2022 but the cloud hash rate EH/s is actually down 17% year over year. This could actually be negative for Bitdeer's bottom line because the cloud hash rate category has been more profitable than the company's self-mining segment. Q2 Earnings Looking at Bitdeer's second quarter 2023 financial performance, we see sequential revenue growth of 29% from $72.6 million in Q1-23 to $93.8 million in Q2-23. The growth in top line revenue was mainly attributable to the company's expansion of self-mined exahash. Revenue (millions) Q2-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 Self-mining $17.6 $13.2 $21.6 Cloud Hash Rate $34.9 $18.0 $18.0 General Hosting $30.8 $22.1 $27.8 Membership Hosting - $16.5 $23.9 Other $5.8 $2.8 $2.5 Total revenue $89.1 $72.6 $93.8 Source: Bitdeer While it was the highest top line revenue figure for Bitdeer since Q2-21, gross profit has been under pressure and was nearly cut in half from $27.6 million a year ago to $16.2 million during the most recent quarter. Data by YCharts Again, what we're seeing play out is a shift from the company's highly profitable cloud hash rate business to the lower margin self-mining business. Per the company's 6-k : Proprietary hash rate was 6.2 EH/s as of June 30, 2023, with 4.6 EH/s allocated to the Company's self-mining business and 1.6 EH/s to its Cloud Hash Rate business. At $18 million on 1.6 EH/s versus $21.6 million on 4.6 EH/s in the last quarter, Bitdeer's cloud business was roughly three times more profitable than the company's self-mining business: Revenue (millions) Q2-23 EH/s Rev per EH/s Self-mining $21.6 4.6 $4.7 Cloud Hash Rate $18.0 1.6 $11.3 General/Member Hosting $51.7 12.6 $4.1 Source: Bitdeer, analyst's calculations As I detailed in my previous Bitdeer article for Seeking Alpha, profitability in the cloud hash segment is essentially dependent on the company's cloud hash customers making low, and in some cases negative, margins on their cloud hash agreements. Given that, it's no wonder overall margins have been declining to the degree that they have. Per the previously mentioned 6-k for Q2-23: Cloud Hash Rate revenue was $18.0 million, compared to $34.9 million in the corresponding period of 2022, primarily due to changes in the amount of active Cloud Hash Rate orders. Bitdeer likely needs another digital gold rush in the price of Bitcoin for those margins to return to where they were in 2021 and early 2022. To further the gold rush analogy, the company makes more from selling shovels to retail than from doing the digging themselves on a revenue per proprietary EH/s basis. Cloud hash rate is a great business if churn is low. But I'd wager we need to see BTC make a fresh all-time high for the larger public to get excited about mining BTC again. To be clear, that's entirely speculative on my part. Bitdeer might work as a great retail Bitcoin FOMO trade. But there currently isn't much FOMO in the market from where I sit. Share Purchase Agreement In early August, Bitdeer disclosed a $150 million share purchase agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II. The impact on the shares outstanding will be dependent on what the average price of those share sold is. In a subsequent prospectus , Bitdeer shared the table below: Purchase Agreement Scenarios (Bitdeer) With this as a general guide, anywhere from 9.4% to 11.9% of Bitdeer's shares outstanding will be owned by B. Riley after the issuance. Per the prospectus: We expect to use any proceeds that we receive under the Purchase Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses, and the respective amounts we may allocate to those uses, for any net proceeds we receive. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these proceeds. At the end of Q2, Bitdeer had $130.2 million in cash and equivalents, $619 million in total assets, and $310.5 in total liabilities. At current share pricing, the cash raise through B. Riley is a fairly small amount of dilution relative to other mining peers. Summary Bitdeer continues to be a highly volatile, low volume Bitcoin miner. The balance sheet is in better shape than other BTC miners in the public equity markets and insider holdings of BTDR shares are high. The company has one of the more diversified models in the industry but there are definitely concerns to be aware of; specifically the decline in the company's most profitable revenue segment. I don't personally hold this one, but I wouldn't rule out a speculative long in the future. It's still a hold for me today.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4636200-bitdeer-bucking-sector-trend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17863149.jpeg

The bitcoin (BTC) price encountered resistance at $27,400 earlier in the day, failing to break above the 50-day moving average. In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) lost 0.2%, bnb fell 0.6% and Cardano’s ada (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) were little changed.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a weighted basket of hundreds of tokens, gained 0.44%.  A moving average (MA) is an indicator commonly used in technical analysis, and a rising moving average indicates an asset is in an uptrend, while a declining moving average indicates a downtrend.  Traders are likely waiting on key central bank interest-rate decisions in the coming days before deploying capital – which could explain the market’s current lull, Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in a note.  “All financial markets have taken a wait-and-see approach ahead of monetary policy decisions in the U.S., Switzerland, the U.K. and Japan,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that he remained bearish.  The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision on Wednesday at 14:00 ET (18:00 UTC) and the Bank of England will do the same at 12:00 BST (13:00 UTC) on Thursday. The Swiss rate decision is also due Thursday, and Japan's is on Friday.  “The situation for bitcoin is bearish if one looks solely at the technical picture on the chart. The corrective bounce in BTC is formally over; the price has fallen below the moving averages, and the short-term oversold condition is complete,” he said.  Analysts at crypto services platform Matrixport, however, said they expect crypto markets to turn bullish in the fourth quarter, citing historical seasonality.  “Q4 traditionally represents Bitcoin’s strongest quarter, with an average of +35% return over the past nine years,” Matrixport analysts wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. “If history is any guide, Bitcoin could reach $37,000 by year-end.”",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | DOGE,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/20/bitcoin-holds-above-27k-xrp-ada-doge-trade-little-changed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5027369eb961ce090a279ded1b8c3bba5212d5c5-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BNB has been treading water for nearly a month, caught in a tight range between the support at $205 and a stubborn resistance zone spanning $220 to $225. While on-chain metrics hint at the potential for a short-term price surge, BNB bulls are grappling with the challenge of breaking free from this extended sideways pattern. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, BNB is currently priced at $216.74, with a modest 0.1% gain in the last 24 hours and a seven-day rally of 2.8%. Investors and traders are eagerly awaiting a decisive move in either direction, but the market seems hesitant to make a commitment. Related Reading: Halving Hype: Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Parabolic Ride, Analyst Says BNB Bulls And Bears At Loggerheads Bulls and bears have been entrenched in a battle, with $205 serving as a crucial support and the $220-$225 range as the formidable resistance. This scenario has paved the way for a prolonged period of range-bound price action in the short term, leaving traders on the edge of their seats. Price analysis shows that the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator’s relatively muted movement presents two possible scenarios for the days ahead. The first scenario entails bulls launching a concerted effort to catch short sellers off guard by breaking above the $220 barrier and potentially surging toward the $240 mark. Such a move would inject renewed optimism into the BNB market. BNB market cap currently at $33 billion. Chart: TradingView.com On the flip side, a bearish rejection could usher in a third test of the $205 support level, with the ominous prospect of a breakdown toward the $188 support level, as seen on the weekly timeframe. This scenario could see the bears exerting their influence and pushing BNB lower. Related Reading: Arbitrum: What’s In Store For ARB Token After Unlock? Long-Term Prospects Hang In The Balance Zooming out to the larger timeframes, the situation remains tense, with BNB trading far from key levels. To regain control, another analysis points out that buyers must strive to push the price above the nearest resistance at $221.7. Only then can hopes for a potential bull run begin to materialize. BNB seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko While on-chain metrics hint at potential upward momentum, the resilience of the resistance zone is a formidable challenge. Traders and investors will be keeping a keen eye on the evolving OBV dynamics, as they hold the key to whether BNB breaks free from its current sideways drift or succumbs to further downward pressure as October approaches.

42392552,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg87nF,1695198669,DeFi Protocol Balancer Says Web Front End Is ‘Under Attack’,"Decentralized trading protocol Balancer said its web front end is suffering from an exploit and urged users not to interact with the website.  Tweets from Balancer and a warning from the Metamask wallet suggest the Balancer URL, or web address, has suffered a redirect attack and users are being sent to a malicious page rather than the authentic site. Cybercriminals carry our redirect attacks by exploiting users' trust of a website, inserting a redirection to a malicious page in the website's code or in a phishing email.  Hacks, exploits and scams across the crypto sector have caused losses of over $1 billion by early September this year, according to blockchain security firm Certik. Crypto traders lost $303 million in July alone, the year's worst month for losses from such attacks.  The attacker appears to be part of phishing group ""AngelDrainer"" according to crypto tracking platform MistTrack. They hacked the website using this method and induced users to approve transfers of funds.  A wallet address identified by internet sleuth ZachXBT appears to show that over $200,000 in digital assets may have been stolen. According to Nansen.ai data, the wallet’s current balance is just over $100,000, with most of the assets being stETH and DAI.  On-chain data suggests that the user behind the wallet has been moving some of the stolen proceeds to Aave.  MistTrack said that the attacker may have links to Russia based on ""relevant intelligence"" it has collected, without providing details.  The attack comes roughly a month after Balancer warned the public about an unrelated vulnerability in the protocol's pools and urged users to withdraw their assets.  Balancer has a total value locked of about $700 million, according to DefiLlama data, making it the fourth-largest decentralized exchange.

Based on Grayscale’s recent analysis by Zach Pandl, today’s announcement could be the critical juncture the Bitcoin and crypto community has been awaiting. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, the Federal Reserve embarked on a path of significant monetary easing to reignite the US economy. Their initial stance was one of unwavering support: “The Federal Reserve committed to overstimulating the US economy–with hopes to avoid the sluggish recovery that followed the 2008-2009 financial crisis.” This decision saw a bolstered Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Sudden Boost Amid Mt. Gox Rumors, But QCP Capital Targets $22,000 However, as Pandl points out, the tide seemed to turn in mid-2021 when the Federal Reserve had a revelation: “[The Fed] seemed to realize it was overdoing it.” What followed was a series of the most “largest and steepest funds rate increases in modern history.” As real interest rates rebounded, Bitcoin’s valuation, which had soared during the period of monetary easing, began to see a massive downturn. The Road Ahead For Bitcoin And Crypto Pandl’s analysis elucidates the heightened anticipation around the FOMC’s meeting. He notes, “We believe the FOMC is likely to keep rates on hold at tomorrow’s meeting.” Notably, this is in line with broader market expectations. According to the FedWatch tool, 99% expect a pause by the Fed. Despite hints earlier in June 2023 about potential rate increments beyond the 5.25-5.50% range, the current economic indicators, such as “benign inflation data” and steady “oil prices,” could influence the committee’s decision, argues Pandl. Yet, as the report astutely mentions, it’s not just about the immediate policy decision: “For crypto, whether the Fed hikes one more time or not may be less important than the fact that the broader tightening cycle is coming to an end.” This perspective, when viewed in light of historical data, suggests a potential upliftment for digital assets. After all, “After the funds rate peaked in the last five tightening cycles, real interest rates declined and equity market performance generally improved.” Related Reading: Wyckoff Support Holds Strong: Bitcoin Bulls Eyeing $31,000 In Near-Term Rally Although the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve at a rapid pace with “new applications, enhancements to existing protocols, and wider adoption,” its valuations haven’t always mirrored these advancements. Over the last few years, as Pandl underscores, “valuations have been heavily influenced by the macroeconomics backdrop and swings in Fed monetary policy–from ultra-easy policy in 2020 to steep rate increases more recently.” The potential conclusion of the Fed’s rate increases could signify a pivotal moment for Bitcoin and other digital assets. As we approach this juncture, the crypto market may find itself at a crossroads where “A possible end of the tightening process could remove a headwind to crypto valuations, and allow prices to more closely track the industry’s improving fundamentals.” At press time, BTC traded at $27,099.

42392538,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg86iZ,1695194430,"The Salvation of Domain Ownership May Lie in Tokenization, and One Firm Is Pressing Hard to Make This a Reality","Domains, the gateway to the internet, have been a fairly lucrative source of money making for almost half a century. However, these digital assets have a big problem: their lack of liquidity, which is why one company is trying to tackle this problem with the help of tokenization.  First, let’s rewind a bit and look at the history of arguably the oldest digital asset. Domain names are the atlas of the internet and a large part of what made the World Wide Web so accessible. Imagine the hassle of trying to surf the net if you had to type in IP addresses instead of website names.  This inherent utility of domains led to a wave of hoarding as people tried to cash in on this digital gold rush. But unlike other gold rushes, this one didn’t completely die down, because as the internet grew in size, value, and utility, so did the value of domains.  Now, with the advent of a new digital age, marked by the arrival of the third iteration of the internet, Web3, one of the predominant issues with domains may soon be resolved.  “Domains are a unique asset because they have a low carry cost,” Shayan Rostam, the chief commercial officer at D3, told CoinDesk during the recent Korea Blockchain Week. D3 is a firm founded by domain industry veterans that wants to modernize the domain market for web3.  Rostam, who has spent most of his career in the domain industry, explains that it may cost only $20 or so to hold a domain year-over-year, but the problem with holding these web addresses is that they remain illiquid until someone makes an offer.  In the coming years, there will be a massive transfer of property and assets from one generation to the next. With millennials and Gen Z set to inherit trillions of dollars worth of assets, there are bound to be a few domain names in that asset mix.  Unlike other assets, there’s no tool to get liquidity from domains, even though they have a low carry cost, unlike real estate, and may be worth millions. This is something D3 is looking to solve via tokenization.  Cheapcarinsurance.com  Before the era of search engines and the advent of search engine optimization, where people tried and optimize their websites to be better poised on search engine queries, people would simply add a .com to whatever they were looking for.  This spawned a gold rush for so-called premium domains, which are simple words that have a .com and the end of them. Think: wine.com, or cheapcarinsurance.com.  This led to speculators grabbing these words and combinations, before bigger businesses could and then putting ads on that page. These came to be known as ‘parking pages’.  “People registered longtail domains like cheapcarinsurance.com, paying around $20 a year. As long as they made more than $20 in revenue, they kept renewing the domain,"" Rostam said.  Fred Hsu, D3’s CEO, who owns a patent on a form of optimization for these parking pages, explained that the leasing process for domains was slow and cumbersome, which is why many preferred putting up the parking pages for monetization. Auctions are also an option, but the process isn’t too different from auctioning off a horse or a painting, as this process hasn’t changed since the last century.  ""Domain auctions are like traditional auctions, with paddles and excitement. But it's still an analog process for digital assets,"" Hsu, who’s been in the domain industry since the 1990s, said. ""You could lease domain names, but it's not a smooth process. There are issues with ownership and control.""  Through tokenization, owners of these domains would be able to sell off interest in the property, similar to tokenization of other real-world assets like real estate or rare liquor, building liquidity from something that otherwise just sits there.  For what it's worth, cheapcarinsurance.com’s cousin, carinsurance.com, sold for $49.7 million in 2010. At the same time, a study found that there are 137 million .com domains registered, with a third in use, a third unused, and the remaining third for speculative purposes.  For example, beer.com is a parking page, while wine.com is an active e-commerce platform.  Working with the ‘UN’ of the Internet  Certainly, D3 isn’t the first company to meld web3 and domain names. If you hop on to X (formerly known as Twitter), you will witness a plethora of crypto supporters with .eth domain attached to their profile. But the problem is, these aren’t real domain names. Type it into your browser and see what happens.  What makes a domain name real is when it's registered with ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the organization responsible for coordinating the global domain name system.  They are the “United Nations of the web,” Rostam explains.  You need to work with them to make the domain names real, and this is why D3 is also focussing on ICANN registration. The firm plans to register new crypto-themed top-level domains during ICANN's next registration window, which may open next year.  And if D3’s plan for tokenization and registration works out, then you may soon see an actual .eth domain, which could make a lot of money for many, many years.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | ENS,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/09/20/the-salvation-of-domain-ownership-may-lie-in-tokenization-and-one-firm-is-pressing-hard-to-make-this-a-reality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/805537f2e96f676d7934d589ed2235acc7e47bed-1920x1210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Infamous Avalanche developer Daniele Sestagalli is back with a project whose name seems to spur hopes among crypto traders about fortunes in a nearly flat market.  The new offering called WAGMI, a popular abbreviation of “we are gonna make it,” or a phrase that means to succeed financially, is an apparent rebranding of Sestagalli's Popsicle Finance.  Popsicle's ICE tokens are at the center of Sestagalli’s latest project. As of Wednesday, ICE holders can swap their tokens for WAGMI using a blockchain-based tool. WAGMI so far has a market capitalization of $2 million, Sestagalli tweeted, while ICE tokens have jumped 70% in the past 24 hours.  The restart of WAGMI was announced in July as a platform that would run on multiple blockchains and offer various decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and services to users.  Publicly available technical documents have not revealed the specifics of the project as of Wednesday.  “I’m pretty confident to say that the token economics and the $WAGMI project is my best project ever,” Sestagalli said in a recent tweet. “Not going to lie but damn I’m happy about it whatever the market is made to grow and snowball.”  Sestagalli’s previous Avalanche projects created a cult-like following in the 2021 bull run under the “frog nation” moniker. Most of these projects went live without a presale to venture capitalists, earning early followers several multiples on their capital.  Sestagalli is behind formerly top Avalanche projects like Wonderland, a treasury-backed currency protocol, and Abracadabra, a platform that provides collateral based on yield-bearing assets deposited by users. SPELL, TIME and MIM – three tokens associated with the two projects – had a combined market capitalization of over $6 billion at their peak, data from CoinGecko shows, making Sestagalli one of the most influential developers in the crypto ecosystem at the time.  Popsicle Finance’s ICE, which lets users earn yields on supplying liquidity to trading pairs, reached a $660 million capitalization at its peak. However, the project was hacked for $25 million in mid-2021 – failing to fully recover since.

42392545,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg87Sj,1695193512,Bitcoin Price Volatility Likely to Stay Depressed After Fed Rate Decision,"The Fed on Wednesday is likely to stick to its data-dependent stance, offering little surprises to the market, crypto traders said.  Bitcoin options expiring on Friday suggests the cryptocurrency may not move more than 3% post-Fed.  Volatility, or the degree of price turbulence, in bitcoin (BTC) remains suppressed, consistent with the calm in the U.S. stock and bond markets. The low volatility regime will likely continue after Wednesday's Federal Reserve (Fed) rate decision, according to some crypto traders.  The Fed will announce the rate decision on Wednesday at 14:00 ET accompanied by a statement, the Summary of Economic Projections, and a new ""dot plot"" of interest-rate estimates. Powell will follow with a press conference thirty minutes later. To tame inflation, the central bank has raised rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with the early phase of the so-called tightening cycle injecting volatility into the liquidity-addicted crypto and traditional markets.  On Wednesday, the central bank is expected to hold the benchmark borrowing cost steady between 5.25% to 5.5% and retain its long-favored data-dependent stance, offering no surprises to the market, according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata. Rates traders see a near 100% chance of the Fed keeping rates steady on Wednesday.  ""The Fed has been very adamant about remaining 'data dependent' and signaling the ability to 'hold rates higher for longer'. To me, this means the Fed can navigate this week’s FOMC meeting by keeping rates unchanged, but signaling rates will remain elevated while they monitor economic releases,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a note to clients on Monday.  ""In my opinion, this would make the FOMC [Fed] meeting a low volatility event,"" Magadini added.  Time and again, the Fed has maintained that the future course of action with respect to interest rates depends on how inflation and employment evolve, refusing to signal an outright end of the rate hike cycle that began in March last year.  The Fed is expected to repeat the same message on Wednesday as inflation looks to rebound. Further, markets, addicted to rapid rate cuts over the past four decades, might quickly price in renewed liquidity easing if the Fed signals an end of the tightening cycle, complicating matters for the central bank.  In other words, the probability of the central bank offering a hawkish or dovish surprise is low, favoring the current low volatility regime in bitcoin and traditional markets.  ""We doubt it [volatility] will come from this Fed itself,"" Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital said. ""Into the final three meetings of the year, we expect the appetite within the FOMC to hike again is extremely low. At the same time, we do not see how Powell can assuredly call an end to this hiking cycle, given the surging pump prices and rebounding inflation.""  ""With [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell likely to attempt his best volatility-killing fuzzy guidance yet again, it is unlikely that current market pricing of half a hike this year followed by three cuts next year will shift much,"" QCP added.  Bitcoin options expiring this Friday, which capture the Fed and Bank of Japan (BOJ) meetings, indicate these rate decisions could be non-events.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. It is common for currency traders to look to options to gauge potential post-event volatility in the underlying asset.  ""Based on Bitcoin options market pricing, traders expect that BTC will only move by 2.8% this Friday, a sign that nobody expects any market-moving comments from Chairman Powell,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.  ""In 2023, Bitcoin has only rallied by +1% shortly after the FOMC meetings and increased by +3% one week later,"" Thielen added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/20/bitcoin-price-volatility-likely-to-stay-depressed-after-fed-rate-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f96da102c80b8292bdacb83fb75ecaaaa16aa054-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein expressed optimism about the progress made in the past year and highlighted the bipartisan support for crypto-related legislation. Sonnenshein emphasized the importance of lawmakers’ understanding of the crypto industry and urged Congress to actively engage with the issue to foster innovation and create robust financial and regulatory frameworks. Grayscale CEO Urges Congress To Support Crypto Sonnenshein commended the “groundbreaking” work done by regulators and lawmakers in Washington over the past 12 months, acknowledging the efforts of Chairman McHenry, Congressman Hill, and Senators Lummis and Gillibrand. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLers Not Selling, Will Number Break Record Highs? The Grayscale CEO emphasized that crypto has become a nonpartisan issue, with members of Congress increasingly recognizing its long-term presence and importance. Sonnenshein praised the bills that have made progress and are set for further votes in the fall, highlighting the need for broader member support and ongoing engagement on crypto-related topics. Moreover, Sonnenshein underscored the growing involvement of constituents who are part of the crypto space and stressed the importance of elected officials aligning their positions accordingly. With upcoming elections and various catalysts on the horizon, Sonnenshein urged members of Congress to actively engage with the crypto industry, given its increasing significance and the need for comprehensive financial and regulatory frameworks, expressing optimism about the current momentum surrounding crypto legislation and the unprecedented level of engagement from lawmakers. Grayscale’s GBTC Inches Closer To ETF Conversion? Regarding the recent court order that vacated the SEC’s denial order for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) application to convert to an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), Sonnenshein addressed the ongoing process and emphasized the organization’s commitment to full and fair disclosures. Grayscale has been litigating to convert GBTC into an Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETF, as it would provide investors with additional protections, disclosures, and reporting obligations. On this matter, Sonnenshein stated that constructive dialogue with the SEC is anticipated once the 45-day process is complete, and the organization looks forward to pursuing the next steps expediently. Furthermore, Sonnenshein highlighted the significant recognition given to the crypto industry by global entities such as the G20 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), emphasizing the opportunity for the United States to establish itself as the center of the global capital markets ecosystem by implementing the right frameworks. Notably, Sonnenshein advocated for maintaining an open-door policy for innovation and positioning the US as a leader in the crypto space.

Capriole Invest, a prominent investment firm, has unveiled its Bitcoin Macro Index. This comprehensive machine learning model combines 40 influential on-chain, macro market, and equity metrics, providing valuable insights into Bitcoin’s fundamentals and shedding light on its potential future trajectory. Bitcoin Fundamentals Signal Renewed Optimism According to Capriole’s latest report, Bitcoin’s low timeframe technicals have continued to conform to the Wyckoff schematic over the past weeks, with a significant failed breakdown at the $26,000 level, signaling a locally bullish sentiment. This event has further bolstered the credibility of the structure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Member Reveals What Investors Should Do If They Want SHIB Burns After a two-month decline that contributed to Bitcoin’s price drop from $29,000, there are now encouraging signs of progress in the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. This suggests a potential turning point in the market. Per the report, analysts are now closely monitoring a potential break from support, particularly a close above $28,000, as this would confirm a continuation towards at least $31,000. Reaching this milestone would mark a crucial phase in completing the Wyckoff structure, potentially heralding the next major upward move for Bitcoin. Furthermore, while the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin in the $24,000 zone appears less likely, the failed breakdown and solid improvement in fundamental data present a more bullish outlook. Barring significant changes in data, Capriole Invest expects Bitcoin’s price to continue its upward trajectory, with a target of at least $31,000 in the near term. However, Capriole believes that BTC’s trajectory will be influenced by the support level at $26,000 and the performance of the Macro Index’s fundamentals. Persistent Resistance At $27,500 Amidst Market Suppression Bitcoin’s recent price movements have been met with strong resistance as it approaches the $27,500 mark, with market sell orders flooding the order book and impeding further upward momentum. Material Indicators, a leading firm specializing in market analysis, has identified this trend as a deliberate effort to suppress BTC’s price. This behavior is expected to persist, particularly in light of the upcoming interest rate hike announcement by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. Per the firm’s analysis, over the past eight hours, a significant influx of ask liquidity has emerged every time Bitcoin’s price has neared the $27,500 level. This surge in sell orders has effectively thwarted any potential breakthrough at this key resistance level. Related Reading: Terra Validator Opposes USTC Burning, Pushes Alternative Plan To Regain Dollar Peg This suggests that Bitcoin’s price may face significant hurdles soon.

The OPNX exchange, affiliated with the founders of collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), offered to buy a significant 75% ownership stake in troubled Hodlnaut in August 2023. Holdnaut, a Singapore-based crypto lender, was another of the numerous victims of the financial crisis that rocked the crypto space in 2022. The crypto company had to halt withdrawals after losing around $190 million to the Terra ecosystem’s crash. Hodlnaut Says $30 Million Offer Has “Speculative Value” According to a recent court filing reviewed by Bloomberg, Hodlnaut administrators have opted out of the acquisition deal of the crypto lending firm, arguing that the $30 million offer of FLEX tokens is “illiquid” and has “speculative value.” Meanwhile, most of the crypto lender’s creditors, who account for 60% of the total debt, supported this decision. In the report, Bloomberg alluded that the FLEX price has declined by more than 92% since OPNX made the acquisition bid in early August. According to CoinGecko data, the FLEX token was valued at roughly $7 at the time of the offer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By Coinbase Users? Premium Would Say So The cryptocurrency has been subject to extreme volatility lately, prompting its rise to $2.48 on Monday, September 18. However, the FLEX Coin has since undergone a significant price correction, with its current value at $0.584586. FLEX is the native cryptocurrency of the CoinFLEX exchange, which stopped withdrawals and filed for restructuring in June 2022. OPNX was launched by CoinFLEX founders Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, explaining the connection between the OPNX exchange and the FLEX token. Other Reasons For Rejecting OPNX’s Takeover Bid Besides the concerns about the FLEX token and its “speculative value,” the Hodlnaut administrators put forward other questions on the OPNX’s $30 million offer. One of these issues is the “no injection of cash or assets with similar liquidity.” Bloomberg revealed that the administrators implied liquid tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. The court-appointed interim managers also questioned the absence of “a timeline for repayment of creditors’ debt” and that there were “no details of payment beyond 30% of liabilities.” Related Reading: Lawyer Involved In Cryptoqueen’s OneCoin Scam Receives Shocking Response From Court It is worth noting that the involvement of the embattled Three Arrows Capital founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, in OPNX’s takeover bid has always been a source of worry. Davies and Zhu are in a legal battle with 3AC creditors in the United States. The Three Arrows Capital founders have also faced troubles outside the United States, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently issuing a 9-year ban against them.
