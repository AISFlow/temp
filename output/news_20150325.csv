42398290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7B6,1427316613,Hong Kong Official: Bitcoin Legislation Not Necessary,"A senior Hong Kong official has indicated that the government does not see a need for legislation that would regulate or ban bitcoin activities.  The statement by Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Professor KC Chan comes in response to a question submitted during a meeting of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong by council member Leung Yiu-chung.  Leung requested an update on the investigation into the MyCoin bitcoin investment scam as well as clarity on whether officials intend to regulate bitcoin activities more actively, according to a press release from the Hong Kong government.  In response, Chan described bitcoin as limited in scope, noting that it does not pose a substantial threat to Hong Kong's financial system given its current lack of widespread adoption in the region.  Chan said:  ""The Government does not consider it necessary to introduce at the moment new legislation to regulate trading in such virtual commodities or prohibit people from participating in such activities.""  Chan added that, should the need arise, Hong Kong regulators can draw from existing legal statutes, both domestic and international, to deal with instances of fraud or criminal activities that involve digital currencies.  “The police will take enforcement action if they find information which involves criminal conduct,” he said.  Watchful stance outlined  In his response, Chan suggested that his office and others will continue to watch developments in the bitcoin space.  Further, he outlined how financial institutions in Hong Kong are subject to strict reporting requirements ""when establishing or maintaining business relationships with customers or clients who are operators of any schemes or businesses relating to virtual commodities"".  Chang added:  “The Government and financial regulators will keep a close watch on the development of bitcoins and other virtual commodities, and maintain contacts with their counterparts in other places through active participation in meetings of the relevant international organizations (such as the Financial Action Task Force.”  Reiterating past warnings issued by the Hong Kong government, Chang stated that “the highly speculative nature” of bitcoin presents a potential risk to investors.  More Mycoin details  Local law enforcement officials continue to investigate the collapse of MyCoin, which resulted in millions of dollars in losses for investors in the scheme, according to Chang.  Police have since arrested several individuals in connection with the fraudulent enterprise.  ""The Commercial Crime Bureau of the Police is investigating the case, and has searched various locations and seized a number of computers, tablets, mobile phones, account records, etc.,"" he said.  Chang added that those arrested during the investigation have been released on bail.

42398302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Mu,1427311210,Sberbank-Backed FinTech Investment Fund Sees Blockchain Potential,"SBT Venture Capital, a $100m venture fund backed by Sberbank, the largest Russian bank, has suggested it is interested in bitcoin and blockchain innovations.  The statements, issued by SBT partner Mircea Mihaescu to online news source Roem.ru, stand in contrast to continued suggestions by government officials that the use of bitcoin will be formally outlawed this spring.  In the interview, Mihaescu was largely dismissive of legislation and regulation in general, stating his belief that laws often lag behind innovation, and as such, perhaps shouldn’t be a key concern for global entrepreneurs.  Still, Mihaescu suggested that SBT is interested in investments that impact the larger financial space, stating:  ""We have our own interests here. We are not interested in stocks investments funds, buying bitcoins, etc. Rather we’re interested in fundamental changes that will affect the whole financial sector.”  Mihaescu went on to suggest he sees bitcoin’s open ledger as an innovation that could have such an impact.  ""The current system where 10,000 banks are used to transfer funds can be replaced by the blockchain,"" he noted.  SBT was launched in 2012 with $100m in backing, though it was said that this figure could rise to $700m over three years. The fund has expressed an interest in a wide range of verticals, including big data, cloud computing, mobile payments and online banking.  Mining critic  Though largely positive about the technology, Mihaescu did suggest that SBT may be more keen to invest in bitcoin alternatives.  For example, he spoke out against the concept of mining, likening the process by which new bitcoins are created to a bartering market. However, he balked at the idea that banning bitcoin would be an effective approach to handling the potential disruption caused by the technology.  ""There is an opinion that cryptos are used by criminals, drug dealers. Do you know what they also use? Cash! Interesting, but no one is going to ban the cash money,” he said.  Further, he suggested that the larger innovations surrounding decentralization and elimination of third parties from the financial system “sound very promising”.  Bitcoin-friendly portfolio  While SBT has yet to invest in a Russia-based startup, the comments are suggestive of the evolving narrative surrounding bitcoin and blockchain solutions in the country. Government officials continue to suggest that the bitcoin ban will be passed this spring, a deadline originally set by the Ministry of Finance last year.  Since first announcing the proposed ban, Russia has seen many of its entrepreneurs relocate to more favorable jurisdictions, a development that has only accelerated as rhetoric worsened and proposed fines were introduced.  Still, individual members of major financial agencies such as the Bank of Russia have offered more positive comments.  SBT’s portfolio includes a number of bitcoin-friendly startups including risk management platform IdentityMind and social trading marketplace eToro, both of which serve customers in the bitcoin market.

42398299,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Jx,1427301417,First Plug-in Node Aims to Boost Bitcoin's Network Security,"Bitseed has launched the first plug-in bitcoin node to encourage users to contribute to the bitcoin network, hassle-free.  The $149 node, which comes preconfigured with the official Bitcoin Core client, is credited with using less than 10 watts of power – approximately 12 times less than the average computer.  As an essential component of the bitcoin network, nodes broadcast messages in order to validate and relay transactions. Unlike bitcoin miners, who are rewarded for confirming transactions, there is no financial incentive for node operators.  According to its website, Bitseed's product tackles the fact that the blockchain can no longer run on notebooks, mobile devices or PCs, due to its increase in size.  The company claims that their new product allows users to keep bitcoin running continuously without slowing down their computer ""or crimping your mobile lifestyle"".  However, there seems to be increasing competition on the horizon.  Addy Yeow, the developer behind Bitnodes, a website that monitors bitcoin nodes, spoke about his upcoming hardware solution, due to launch mid-2015.  ""The goal of Bitnodes Hardware is to provision ready-to-run hardware for everyday consumers to launch their own bitcoin node at home and to become part of the network,"" he said.  Declining numbers  The news comes amid increasing concerns about the declining number of fully functioning bitcoin nodes.  According to Bitnodes' data there has been a 0.16% drop in the number of reachable nodes in the last three months, with Yeow confirming that there had not been any positive increment for over a year.  He said:  ""Speculations aside, I believe the community has already acknowledged several technical factors that contribute to the decline with large storage requirement (by hosting standard), high bandwidth and slow bootstrap topping the list.""  ""Ideally, we want to see nodes dispersed across more ASNs [Autonomous System Numbers – a unique identifier for a network on the Internet] to improve the overall robustness of the bitcoin peer-to-peer network,"" Yeow added.  Industry incentivisation  The launch of Bitseed's Bitcoin Node follows on from other notable initiatives that set out to stimulate the growth in nodes.  CoinDesk previously spoke to Or Weinberger, the developer behind Fullnode, a non-profit open source project aimed at simplifying and automating the creation of full nodes with public donations in June last year.  A node is created once Fullnode's reaches $20 in bitcoin and is maintained for a month.  More recently, Yeow also launched the Bitnodes Incentive Program, experimental project that allows reachable nodes to receive weekly incentives paid for in bitcoin.  Yeow commented that four nodes had already received funds since launch four weeks ago, adding:  ""I would love to see more nodes getting verified and becoming eligible for the program as we have only 130+ eligible nodes at the moment.""

42398298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Iy,1427293899,CardinalCommerce Adds Bitcoin to Merchant Payments Solution,"Merchants using payment authentication provider CardinalCommerce will now be able to accept bitcoin alongside alternative payment options including PayPal and Google Wallet.  The announcement is the result of a partnership between CardinalCommerce and bitcoin merchant processor Bitnet that enables merchants with custom-built shopping carts to send API messages to Cardinal's platform through its One Connection service.  As part of the integration, CardinalCommerce handles updates and changes necessary to accept the payment method, and will help facilitate refunds through Bitnet.  ""As a merchant accepting bitcoin via Cardinal, if there was some change to the protocol or Bitnet's APIs, Cardinal would handle that. That’s a core value proposition that companies like Cardinal bring to their merchants,"" chief commercial officer Akif Khan told CoinDesk.  The service comes with a one-time access fee, as well as a monthly fee that includes additional costs based on customer clicks, not the dollar amounts of orders.  In statements, Cardinal SVP of merchant services Alasdair Rambaud suggested that the partnership is in line with the company’s goal of providing merchants with a greater variety of alternative payment methods.  Bitnet raised $14.5m in October of last year, and has since inked a prominent deal with Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten.

42398297,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Hz,1427291883,Coinkite Tor Release Lets Developers Bypass Bitcoin Bans,"Bitcoin wallet and technology provider Coinkite has announced Bitkit, its bitcoin wallet API, is now available for the anonymous communications software Tor.  The company framed the launch as one that will empower entrepreneurs working in countries with more restrictive laws against bitcoin, or that have moved to block bitcoin services, to build bitcoin apps and manage funds with its API.  “If you’re a developer making your site in a country that doesn’t allow you to do bitcoin properly, now you can access Tor through Coinkite and let us manage the operational wallet and you don’t have to worry about that,” CEO Rodolfo Novak explained.  The exec went on to say that services including the ability to send bitcoin via SMS and email, generate receiving addresses, check balances and import private keys are just some of the features that will now be enabled for Tor.  Still, Novak stressed that, despite Tor’s ability to provide greater degrees of privacy, he believes the API will most often be used for legal purposes.  Novak told CoinDesk:  “I’m always surprised by the amount of Tor users that are using bitcoin. If you’re an exchange and you’re using Coinkite as your operational wallet, now you don’t even have to reveal your IP or you can go through your country's firewall without issue.”  Novak framed the news as part of its continued support for Tor. Coinkite supports Tor access on its main website, an announcement first made last July.
