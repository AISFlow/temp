42425025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAfh,1373400448,Jon Matonis named Bitcoin Foundation's new executive director,"Jon Matonis has been named as the new executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, taking over from Peter Vessenes.  In an announcement on the foundation's blog, Vessenes said he believes Matonis' ""work experience and passion for Bitcoin will combine into something awesome"" at the Bitcoin Foundation.  ""I will be able to rely on Jon managing and growing the organization; this will allow me to do more of what I think I should be doing – strategizing, building relationships, fundraising and speaking,"" he added.  Matonis said in a post explaining his decision to take on the role that he is proud to have been associated with the Bitcoin Foundation since it launched nine months ago.  ""A non-profit organization for Bitcoin can add greatly to the political and economic discourse for cryptographic money and monetary freedom,"" he said.  The foundation will continue to offer a helping hand to those involved in the space while educating those who aren't. It will offer assistance in bitcoin-related legal cases, including pro bono legal defence, where appropriate.  Matonis, who is also a board director at Tradehill, explained he wants to focus on expanding the foundation to become ""more inclusive of the various constituencies within the global bitcoin community"".  In addition to his statement on the Bitcoin Foundation's blog, Matonis told CoinDesk the foundation is ""actively looking at having a strong NGO presence and focal point in the EU region by the end of the year"".  Matonis rounded off his post on the Bitcoin Foundation's blog by suggesting the road ahead for digital currency is by no means a smooth one.  ""Just as those against file sharing and BitTorrent technology were on the wrong side of history, so too are the institutional forces opposed to unfettered bitcoin growth. The great challenge and mandate for our time is in encouraging them to see it that way. Please join us.""  We're in for a rocky ride, bitcoiners, but CoinDesk says ""bring it on"".",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/09/jon-matonis-named-bitcoin-foundations-new-executive-director,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cce8bd44ec4e60d8151937f1509228e0c9e47fd-506x333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMJa,1373388685,Kipochi launches M-Pesa integrated bitcoin wallet in Africa,"Global bitcoin wallet service Kipochi has launched a product that allows people in Africa to send and receive bitcoins, plus convert them to and from the Kenyan currency M-Pesa.  This will allow Kenyans to transfer money in an easier, faster and more cost effective way than is currently offered by banks and money transfer companies, such as Western Union and MoneyGram.  Kipochi works on all mobile phones as it has SMS, USSD and HTML5 frontends, so there is no requirement for users to have the most up-to-date handsets.  ""We believe Bitcoin can truly help people in the developing world and wanted to develop a mobile wallet for it that works in a similar way to what people are already using. M-Pesa is by far the most successful mobile wallet in the world, which made it a pretty logical step for us to integrate with it,"" said Pelle Braendgaard, co-founder of Kipochi.  He went on to say M-Pesa has been around in Kenya for years now, so mobile money is a part of everyday life in the country, which means it will be easy for Kenyans to accept digital currency as the choice for international payments.  Kenyan natives live all over the world, plus there are several large expat communities such as Indians and Ethiopians in Kenya, so Kipochi's goal is to make it easier for people in these communities to send and receive funds through the bitcoin network.  ""We are primarily focused on Sub-Saharan Africa and our service is already available in most parts of the world, albeit without M-Pesa support. We are reaching out to local bitcoin exchanges and operators throughout the continent to make bitcoin as easy as possible to use,"" Braendgaard added.  LocalBitcoins.com has also recently turned its attention to M-Pesa, making this option available to traders in Kenya and Tanzania. The site revealed there are currently no M-Pesa traders using the service, but it hopes to attract some soon.  Jeremias Kangas, founder of LocalBitcoins.com, said there is a lot of potential for bitcoin in developing markets, since the cost of sending money via traditional remittance companies is very high.  ""One reason why M-Pesa got popular was because individuals could easily become exchangers and earn income that way. LocalBitcoins.com tries to solve the same problem, but with bitcoin and in global scale. Naturally the M-Pesa agents are the target market of LocalBitcoins.com as well,"" he explained.  Kangas agreed with Braendgaard about the likelihood of Kenyans being more willing to adopt bitcoin than other nations: ""M-Pesa has proved that people are willing to trust money transfers between mobile phones, and trusting Bitcoin instead of traditional currencies is not that huge a step.""  LocalBitcoins.com  recently launched a new affiliate program, which means users who refer traders can earn commission from the fees of those they refer. The site is also soon to launch a new solution, which offers a simplistic way of selling bitcoins in low-tech environments.  ""It will be something like Bitcoin ATM, but without the high initial capital costs. We see this product as very high-potential for developing markets. This is part of our mission to establish a global franchise platform, which allows small businesses and entrepreneurs to easily start bitcoin-trading spots globally,"" he concluded.

42397172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacM5o,1373380425,Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik on Satoshi Nakamoto and the future of Bitcoin,"Jeff Garzik could be considered one of the guardians of bitcoin. When we caught up with him, he had just finished working with others to stop a network-wide event – a DDoS attack that exploited some stray code in the reference bitcoin client (Bitcoind) to target certain parts of the cryptocurrency’s distributed infrastructure.  He became one of the core developers of the Bitcoin protocol after he began working on the project during its early days. He was involved in many of the early forum discussions with the mysterious Satoshi, and even exchanged a private email or two with him.  CoinDesk caught up with him to talk about Satoshi Nakamoto, the open source development community, and where the protocol is headed. One of the first things we asked him was how he viewed its current status.  “Bitcoin is out of its infancy and starting to mature. There are increasing numbers of merchants at BitPay, and people are starting to see it as money over IP,” says Garzik, speaking in his gentle North Carolina drawl.  However, there was no one single event that set the cryptocurrency on a course for success, he asserts. It was more of a slow, organic process. Over the last four years, the currency has matured to the point where it has continuous value. That’s pretty good going, in his book.  That said, there were promising developments along the way. The Central Bank’s activities in Cyprus in April prompted speculation in alternative currencies, he says.  “The FinCEN guidance was a positive turning point too, that happened right around the same time. In my humble opinion, that guidance said that bitcoin is ok. They're not interested in pursuing bitcoin users for selling and buying goods and services in bitcoin – they’re interested in regulating the exchange points.”  There was a turning point for Garzik, though, when he was hired by bitcoin payment processor BitPay in May. Overnight, he went from being a developer for Red Hat who worked part-time on the Bitcoin protocol to being a full-time Bitcoin developer. Now, he has more time to spend processing changes to the protocol, and thinking about its technical direction.  The currency’s development is following expectations, he says. “We wanted it to be a usable currency for anyone in the world regardless of country or economic status,” he says, adding that it’s spreading quickly, although he’s still hoping for more accessibility in less wealthier nations, on the African continent, for example. But he’s encouraged by bitcoin’s fast adoption in China.  This is just the start for bitcoin, however. Today, it’s little more than a currency system. “In a payment system you have many products built in many layers,” he says, likening the currency itself to the bottom layer.  “On top of that, you have a layer of banks, and lending, and futures and options trading, and shorting. That’s the next step for bitcoin, getting those advanced financial tools layered on top of bitcoin.” He eventually expects to see credit and debit cards denominated in bitcoin.  But Garzik is more of a coder than a macroeconomist. He enjoys the technology behind bitcoin, and with others, has been responsible for many crucial parts of the software that developed out of the Satoshi client.  A conservative team  “Satoshi was a fantastic designer and architect,” he says, adding that the originator of Bitcoin has thought about the system at a very deep level. “He spent a couple of years thinking about the system, and then according to what he said, he had to write the system to prove to himself that it would work.”  The software went largely unnoticed until news of it hit Slashdot in July 2010. He posted his initial code and it didn't really gain a lot of attention for 6-9 months and then it started getting a few tech mentions. Then it hit Slashdot in July 2010.  But in spite of being an excellent architect and designer, Satoshi’s coding practices were unconventional, says Garzik, adding that the original version of Bitcoin was Windows only, not very portable, and “a jumble of source code” with several half-finished projects.  “He was the oracle to which we would go for questions about the system, but he rarely followed standard engineering practices, like writing unit or stress tests or any of the standard qualitative analysis that we'd perform on software,” Garzik recalls. “Several things had to be disabled almost immediately upon public release of Bitcoin because they were obviously exploitable.”  Things have come a long way since then. Now, Bitcoin is a project managed by a group of core developers, with Gavin Andresen, Garzik and a core group of others managing the Github pulls.  “It's a meritocracy like every other open source project. Your contributions are valued if everyone else has consensus about it being a valuable contribution,” Garzik says.  This notion of consensus doesn’t necessarily make Bitcoin a push-button democracy, though; the core developers carry ultimate veto, and they’re notoriously cautious. “In general, the devs try to be very conservative. Typically, we don't introduce new features. We just try to ensure that the existing ones work.”  That isn’t to say that new features can’t happen. There’s a mechanism called the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BPI) used to put forward proposed new features for the protocol. But it’s controlled by the core devs. “If we want to extend it, we'll write up a BIP and publicise it through blogs, and we just try to judge through user feedback whether they like the feature, or don't understand it, or things of that nature.”  Still some gaps to fill  So, does Garzik see the need for any new features in Bitcoin?  “Recurring payments,” he says emphatically. Bitcoin is great if I want to send you some bitcoins once. But if I want to pay regularly for a subscription to, say, an online service, or for regularly updated content, it’s flawed. “Bitcoin is a push model where you push payments to someone else, but it isn't in the protocol that you pay someone on a regular basis. That needs to be filled in.”  Another must-have for Garzik is what he calls “transaction lifetime determinism” – the retrieval of bitcoin payments from limbo. Transactions on the bitcoin network have to be mined in a block, and the network calls for those transactions to be confirmed. The general recommendation is six confirmations (one per block), but in practice, the number of transactions required by a party is variable.  I don't think it's likely that the second generation will produce any useful, viable long-term cryptocurrency, but I do think that all this experimentation will absolutely inform the Bitcoin ecosystem  If a transaction isn’t confirmed, it becomes stuck in the network, and you need an expert to help you recover those funds. “A user always needs to know what is going on with their money. If it isn't confirming after a set period of time, it should just kick the transaction out of the system rather than just sitting around for weeks and months.”  Bitcoin activists and evangelists like me have a bunch of answers. It's borderless, it's irreversible, and there's low risk of fraud. Nonetheless, it's difficult to get on the radar of your average person.  Features like these should go into the core protocol, but there are plenty of other features that Garzik wants to see layered on top of the network, without affecting the core protocol.  Coloured coins is one. Garzik wrote one of the first implementations of this, called Smartcoin. This concept enables attributes to be assigned to a coin, so that it can become a token for ownership. They could be used for everything from exchanging ownership of physical assets, to marking stocks, bonds, and options.  “There are zero modifications needed to support coloured coins today,” he says. “Bitcoin wouldn't need to be upgraded.”  Read part two of CoinDesk's interview with Jeff Garzik, where he reveals his thoughts on alternative currencies, ASIC miners, and getting everyday users on board for bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/09/bitcoin-developer-jeff-garzik-on-satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-future-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c79ced860951cf6983210aa7c541866cd02a7191-995x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397176,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacM9k,1373371660,B1txr sends email to your bitcoin address securely,"A bitcoin user has created a way in which to use a bitcoin address to securely read email. The project, named B1txr, allows users to provide their bitcoin address, followed by @b1txr.com, to anyone as a way of avoiding giving out their real email address.  Of course, there are other ways to encrypt email. However, GPG/PGP encryption requires both ends to be using the same software, which is rarely the case. The same is the case for Bitmessage.  B1txr provides a simpler way to privately receive email. The site receives emails and stores them for you. When you login, you must prove that you own the bitcoin address by signing a string of text provided by B1txr. This relies on asymmetric encryption, just like Bitcoin and SSL, and so this is a practically unspoofable method of authentication.  Once signed in, you can see any messages that have been sent to that inbox. Note that B1txr is in early testing, and so storage on the server is limited. Therefore, this is not meant to be a long term storage measure.  This is an interesting proof of concept, but closer examination illuminates just how insecure email is. Any email that is sent across the Internet is sent using the SMTP protocol which is not encrypted. It is impossible to know whether a message has been read while it was on its way to the recipient. While there are various ways of encrypting the content of a message, there are currently none that hide the so-called ""envelope"" of the message. While the sender's address can be faked, the receiving address cannot be falsified or the message won't be delivered correctly.  In that sense, using B1txr is no different than setting up a temporary email address (e.g. mailinator). However, bitcoin addresses (and associated keys) can be generated offline with a bitcoin client, which is marginally better than setting up a fake email account. The developer clearly states that B1txr is subject to all the same legal requirements as any other email provider.  The project is in its early days, and therefore, there is no way to send email from the service.  You can read B1txr's FAQ here.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/09/b1txr-sends-email-to-your-bitcoin-address-securely,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95421d0e8461762dcb1b0245ca4592974df55970-995x625.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacM8l,1373355569,Crowdfunding campaign launched by New York-based bitcoin exchange Atlas,"A campaign to gain members and crowdfunding for a new bitcoin exchange has been launched by a New York-based company called Atlas Inc. It claims to use software that it describes as already being battle tested and to have Wall Street trading experts on its staff.  According to the campaign video, its software has already been used for large volume trading. It thinks this will give it an edge over other exchanges that have suffered long backlogs of trades due to spikes in trading volume. It calls the software the ""Atlas web-based workstation"". However, it does not identify the so-called battle-tested software that it is using as a trading engine.  The Indiegogo campaign includes a development roadmap that indicates Atlas is still at its first phase of ""beta testing with simulated trading"" and launching the actual funding campaign. Provided the company get the required funding, the next phase will allow users to fund their accounts in bitcoin only; funding with US dollars will come in the next phase. Following that, Atlas hopes to launch APIs for integration with professional traders, hedge funds and market makers.  Another key aspect to Atlas is that it is aiming to be fully compliant with US regulations. However, this isn't as simple as it sounds. We recently spoke with Jesse Powel who is the CEO of Kraken, another upcoming bitcoin exchange, and he told us:  It’s very difficult. That money transmission piece does make it very difficult to operate just because the process is so long. Every state has their own definition of money transmitter, even their own definition of money itself. They have their own set of requirements for getting licensed, their own application process. A different set of fees. It feels like a gruelling task to go after all of these licenses. It would cost at least a million dollars to do it. You would need to have huge capital reserves, and it would take you at least a year and a half. There are states like California that seem to just deny you arbitrarily, and they won’t tell you why they have denied you. It’s a difficult process, and the biggest problem is the amount of time it takes to do it. There’s enough money, and enough investors interested in the space that if it were just a matter of money it wouldn’t be a problem. It is the fact that it will take you a year and a half to actually do this and get the responses from states, so there’s some things you can do in the meantime like try to find some kind of agency agreement with someone who already has the licenses. Or work with a bank for an agency agreement, because federally chartered banks have an exemption from the money transmission rules.  Atlas says that if it reaches its first funding goal of $25,000, it will use the funds for further campaigns to increase the public awareness of bitcoin (including the role of exchanges) and to complete development of its exchange to allow for live trading. If it reaches its second level of $50,000 or more, then it will develop further features and engage in ""lobbying to help formulate the regulations that might govern the bitcoin community"".  At the time of writing, Atlas has raised just $25 of its $25,000 goal, and the campaign has 45 days to raise the rest. Other funding incentives for Indiegogo members include various lifetime membership statuses and a contribution of $15 will enable you to take part in the beta phase.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/09/crowdfunding-campaign-launched-by-new-york-based-bitcoin-exchange-atlas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0870d2993ceb23c79cd18a159548325312fb16e1-305x111.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
