42399256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihWu,1471039630,Blockchain Trials Accelerate as South America Sees Ethereum Uptake,"Argentinian wine and Brazilian timber are just the latest products being transformed by entrepreneurs building distributed applications on the ethereum blockchain in South America.  One of Brazil's largest banks recently built a smart contract designed to automate parts of the process by which a company goes public; a group in Chile is working to help scale the blockchain using the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS); and a team in Nicaragua is building a secure identity system using Ricardian contracts.  Other than ethereum, what all these projects have in common is a company in Brooklyn, New York, with a rapidly growing presence across industries and around the world.  Of about 100 employees scattered across five continents, three have taken a leadership position to run these diverse projects that push the limits of how a blockchain can be used.  One of those men was hired by ConsenSys in early 2015 after spending more than 10 years building financial markets software in his native Brazil and in New York City. ConsenSys blockchain specialist Daniel Novy tells CoinDesk he's been surprised by how quickly his country has adopted a diverse set of ethereum applications.  Having founded Brazilian bitcoin exchange Basebit in 2013, Novy saw firsthand how in those early days bitcoin's reputation for being associated with illicit transactions made it difficult to sell the technology to banks.  But he added that the stigma doesn't exist with ethereum, which is making his job of approaching companies to ""sprinkle a little blockchain on them"" much easier.  Novy told CoinDesk:  ""It seems all the companies I’m dealing with are searching blockchain. But in the end, they all come to ethereum because of the smart contracts. Many of them, especially the banks have researched bitcoin but they almost always, I think always, choose ethereum.""  A São Paulo stock exchange  Based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, a city surrounded by rainforest just north of Rio de Janeiro, Novy is the lead developer of Regis, ConsenSys' registry service and a consultant with many of the company's projects in both Brazil and Argentina.  Currently, he says he’s working with six financial institutions in the area, including multiple banks. But none is more advanced in its blockchain development than Bovespa, a stock exchange based in São Paulo, Brazil.  During Novy’s most recent meeting with Bovespa, he said he addressed a group of 20 people and helped them build a smart contract prototype that would automate part of the process by which a company goes public.  Beyond just building the prototype for the Bovespa employees Novy described working alongside employees of Microsoft, taking the exchange line-by-line through the code to teach them how to write the IPO smart contract to to deploy it.  The work is still in its earliest phases.  ""We started to think about what we should do in the afternoon to prove that this thing works,"" said Novy.  ConsenSys has confirmed with CoinDesk that they are meeting in Brooklyn with Bovespa in two weeks to discuss the possibility of working together on another project.  A Brazilian rainforest  Whereas Brazil once had a reputation for being slow to embrace bitcoin due to low visibility, Novy says the country is quickly adopting ethereum.  In June, timber tracking company BVRio announced it would use Novy's Regis tool for building decentralized registries to help track the origin of wood harvested from the Amazon rainforest and elsewhere in the region.  Using Regis, which logs identifying information on the ethereum blockchain, BVRio scores each beam of timber based on where it comes from and who harvested it to help ensure its legality.  Prices for the timber are in part determined by this score, according to Novy.  By decentralizing that registry using the Regis software, BVRio said in a statement announcing the project that ""the information is guaranteed to not change, given the immutability of blockchains, and it’s available publicly"".  Novy says he expects that project will go live by the end of the month.  Argentinian wine  But not all of Novy's work is limited to Brazil. Whereas he says his native country had a post of being late adopters, Argentina, with its history of rapid inflation embraced bitcoin early and has continued to experiment with ethereum.  Still in its stealth mode, Cora in Argentina's Uco Valley is a 2.5-acre vineyard using Regis to sell individual vines to investors.  Cora founder Lucas Abihaggle is working with Novy to integrate land tracking service These Three Words, which has divided the planet into 57 trillion three-meter by three-meter squares with Regis.  ""We want to organize a community to buy very valuable vineyards and tokenize the vines for each plant and sell those plants,"" Abihaggle told CoinDesk. ""In that way, [we can] save those vineyards that are in danger of being ripped out for real-estate purposes.""  As part of the effort to raise the project's visibility Novy says he'll be pitching it at the DevCon2 Demo Day in Shanghai this September.  According to Abihaggle, angel investors are backing the company but a few final details remain to be worked out before it can launch.  Chile, Nicaragua and beyond  Elsewhere in South America, ConsenSys is working to develop a wide range of applications of ethereum.  Herman Junge in Santiago de Chile is leading a stealth project INFURA to use IPFS to help scale the ethereum infrastructure.  In Nicaragua, lead mobile developer for Uport, Pelle Braendgaard, is using Ricardian style contracts to help ensure self-sovereign identity and key management to help ensure that people and things are what they appear to be.  Braendgaard told CoinDesk:  ""I have a strong interest in bring our services to the developing world.""  Novy shares Braendgaard's vision for connecting the developing world with the ethereum blockchain. In addition to BenBen, a land registration project currently being discussed with the Ghanaian government, Novy hinted an another African project that ""emerged from South America"" and could eventually result in a new way to protect rhinoceroses using the ethereum blockchain.  The wide range of projects being undertaken in multiple countries is resulting in a synergy of sorts.  When one of Novy's colleagues initiates a conversation with a bank or business in one country he may benefit from them starting that conversation in Brazil, and vice-versa.  ""They are working individually,"" he said. ""But we are always collaborating with each other.""

42399244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihM5,1471026693,Bank Regulator Calls for Broader Oversight of EU Bitcoin Services,"The European Banking Authority (EBA) has called for more details regarding the European Union's (EU) plan to impose tighter anti-money laundering (AML) controls on digital currency exchanges and custodial wallet services.  The regulator, which oversees banking activity in the EU, offered comment yesterday on a prior proposal from the executive branch of the EU to bring exchange and wallet services under the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Proponents say the move would end the perceived anonymity of purchases and transactions conducted using the technology.  Still, critics have attacked the proposal by the European Commission as too onerous or redundant, as it would ultimately fall on services already subject to national regulation. The European Commission has been publicly exploring options since earlier this year.  In comments, the EBA largely welcomed the European Commission's recommendations, but said that overall the proposal falls short, and that provisions focused on data collection should be strengthened.  The organization said:  ""...the Commission and co-legislators should ensure that competent authorities have the appropriate tools at their disposal to ensure the effective supervision of [custodial wallet providers] (CWPs) and [virtual currency exchange providers] (VCEPs) compliance with their AML/CFT obligations.""  Licensing vs registration  The EBA also suggested that the European Commission should provide greater clarity on whether digital currency services ought to be supervised under a broader European Union licensure or registration scheme.  The group said that this distinction should be drawn as EU member states are likely to ""adopt very different regimes"".  In the EBA's view, this would lead to a more complicated regulatory environment.  ""The EBA therefore considers that the EU Commission and co-legislators should take a decision whether either a licensing or a registration regime is most suitable and conducive to the aim of deterring terrorist financing across the EU or, should this not be achievable, at least provide clarity about the features that a national registration or authorisation regime should have,"" the group said.  Sanction powers pushed  Notably, the EBA said that it believes that regulators in European nations should retain the ability to impose sanctions on non-compliant exchange and wallet services that handle digital currencies.  According to the text of the directive, these sanctions may include financial penalties, public admonishments, bans on particular business employees or the rescinding of any nation-level licensure a company may have received.  ""In order to ensure that VCEPs and CWPs comply with the requirements, national authorities should have at their disposal effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for failure of these new type of entities to respect key requirement of the directive, including the reporting of suspicious transactions,"" the group said.  The EBA also raised doubt about when the measures would be formally adopted, calling on the European Commission to extend a January 2017 deadline for their approval to next year.  This, the EBA said, would give member states more time to absorb the changes and adopt the policies in question.  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the EBA was an association of banks, which is incorrect. The EBA is an EU-level banking regulator headquartered in the UK.

42399249,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihQ1,1471017338,Hyperledger Blockchain Project to Elect New Tech Committee,"Election season has begun for the Hyperledger project, the open-source, Linux Foundation-led blockchain initiative.  The project is preparing to elect a new technical steering committee (TSC) as well as a new chairperson for that committee this month. The transition comes less than a year after the Hyperledger project publicly launched in December 2015 as a way to create a ""business blockchain"" for use by enterprises.  The nomination process for the committee began yesterday, and runs through 18th August. Voting among the project's active contributor base – those participating in the development of the Hyperledger codebase – begins that day, and runs through 24th August.  To facilitate the vote, the project is turning to a platform called the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS). Developed by Cornell, it allows participating voters to create a slate of their preferred candidates.  The results will be announced on the 25th.  Once the committee is selected, those new members will vote between themselves on the a new chairperson, Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf said.  The committee membership is currently composed of some of the project's biggest backers, including IBM, DTCC, Intel and JPMorgan. The TSC, in turn, is currently chaired by Christopher Ferris of IBM.  According to Behlendorf, the hope is to staff the TSC with those who contribute the most to the initiative.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We bootstrapped the TSC with kind of the initial premier members of the organization, but we didn’t want that to hard-code in. We really wanted to instill, across the project, a 'do-ocracy', which is a term we brought over from Apache.""  Since launch, the Hyperledger Project has explored a range of blockchain use cases, with a number of notable companies involved submitting proposals for their own approach to the technology.  To date, more than 40 companies are taking part in the project.

42399251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihTx,1471014011,Report: Russian Government to Abandon Penalties for Bitcoin Use,"Russian authorities are reportedly planning to abandon efforts to institute criminal penalties for bitcoin users.  The news comes from a report issued today by Russian news agency Interfax in which it asserts that representatives from the country's Ministry of Finance, central bank and other government bureaus are increasingly supportive of this action.  According to the report, representatives from these groups are planning to submit a report to Russian President Vladimir Putin containing this recommendation sometime in 2016.  If true, the report would end nearly two years of speculation that Russia would seek to actively discourage the use of cryptocurrencies and other ""money surrogates"" through administrative fines and labor penalties.  As outlined in 2014 and 2015, ""legal entities"" that introduced their own digital currencies would have faced fines of up to $25,000, while those who distributed the digital assets could have been punishable by correctional labor.  However, it appears such a proposal will require additional research by the involved parties.  The report states:  ""At the same time, the meeting decided that it is necessary to monitor the use of virtual currency and further [analyze] the risks [associated with] using money surrogates for criminal purposes. With this in mind, it can be presented a proposal to amend the regulations if necessary.""  The latest statements come amid a softening by the Russian Ministry of Finance, formerly the most aggressive regulator domestically to push for the prohibition.  In July, deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev went so far as to suggest cryptocurrencies could be regulated as a kind of foreign currency, a development that can be seen as stemming from the larger interest in blockchain domestically in recent months.

42399258,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihYs,1471005104,WEF: Blockchain to Form Foundation of New Financial Infrastructure,"Distributed ledger tech will play a key role in the foundation of next-generation financial services according to a new report by the World Economic Forum (WEF).  Released today, the 130-page report aims to provide a “clear view” of how financial services could be reimagined by combining blockchains and distributed ledgers with existing and emerging technologies including mobile, machine learning and robotics.  Overall, the WEF report stressed that distributed ledgers should not be viewed as a ""panacea"" or held back by existing financial ""orthodoxies"". It further emphasized that applications of the technology will differ by use case, but that all will bring a great simplicity and efficiency to the global financial system.  Finally, the WEF sought to call on the full diversity of industry stakeholders to collaborate to bring about this future, stating:  ""The most impactful distributed ledger technology applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents, innovators and regulators, adding complexity and delaying implementation.""  Perhaps the defining feature of the report, however, is the clarity with which it outlines the benefits for distributed ledgers, calling immutability, transparency and autonomy ""transformative characteristics"" that are unique to the tech.  It identifies nine use cases that highlight its potential and six value drivers it believes are powerful enough to fuel transitions in these areas.  The report builds on previous work by the WEF to better understand the technology. To date, this has included mentioning blockchain as part of its 2015 ‘mega-trends’ report and holding distributed ledger workshops this year in Australia and New York.  Overcoming roadblocks  Also identified in the report are three primary hurdles for the technology. These include an uncertain and ""unharmonized"" regulatory environment, nascent standardization efforts and the absence of legal frameworks.  For instance, the report theorizes that in order to best reimagine global payments, banks will have to make additional considerations, such as how they would hold cryptocurrencies running on a distributed ledger as assets on their books.  In this light, the WEF stressed that bringing distributed ledgers to life will require infrastructure replacement, legal and regulatory changes and the alignment of industry participants who may today be driven by different interests.  Additional research is also needed, according to the WEF, which went on to outline four questions it believes need to be answered moving forward.  These included determining the ""financial viability"" of distributed ledgers, creating roadmaps for market collaboration, working on improved governance models and better understanding regulatory challenges ahead.

42399255,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihVv,1471002343,How Blockchain Could Make Robot Swarms Smarter,"The robots are coming, and they’re getting smaller, smarter and cheaper.  While today, businesses may own just a single drone, one day, large parts of whole industries could be overseen by a new generation of robots. But, how will groups of these robots perform useful tasks like collecting crop data or organizing around a common goal?  That's one role for the blockchain proposed in a new white paper from MIT Media Lab research affiliate Eduardo Castelló Ferrer. The eight-year robotics veteran believes that by using the blockchain to distribute information, whole armies of robots could solve problems and accomplish tasks more efficiently.  The idea is that in robotic swarms, each robot follows basic rules, drawing inspiration from creatures like ants and fish that often clump together. These small rules then add up to collective behaviors, such as distributed sensing or search-and-rescue missions, that emerge as a result of the interactions between robots.  So far, these ideas haven’t been deployed on a large-scale. But researchers have high hopes for use cases such as so-called ""precision farming,"" where fleets of drones could be used to inspect crops and paint a more granular picture for farmers.  As researchers are moving forward with this futuristic idea, they’re facing many security and logistical problems that have prevented robot swarms from moving from research labs to the real world. But, Ferrer thinks that the blockchain could lead to ""serious progress"" in swarm robotics.  The white paper explains:  ""The combination of blockchain with other distributed systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even profitable.""  Applying bitcoin to robotics has been theorized before for autonomous networks of driverless cars or drones that would deliver packages.  But this is different; the white paper sketches a blockchain-based system where robotic ""nodes"" organize in a secure, distributed way. One potential role for the blockchain is to help the robotic groups to come to agreement about a decision without a central authority.  It outlines a model where the robotic swarms use the blockchain by serving as nodes in a network and ""encapsulating their transactions in blocks"". Blockchain-based applications described in the white paper include secure communications between robots, distributed decision-making, behavior differentiation and new business models.  Robotic possibilities  With the declining costs of robotics, Ferrer argues that possibilities abound for robotic swarms.  ""Hardware is getting better. We can now make thousands of robots for research purposes, but also for industrial purposes,"" Ferrer said.  But one problem with current distributed algorithms, as the white paper describes, is that there are tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.  The idea is to leverage the blockchain for the best of both worlds.  ""Blockchain is an outstanding technology for ensuring that all participants in a decentralized network share an identical view of the world,"" the white paper explains.  Robots might come to agreement about which direction to move or which shape to transform into by voting on the blockchain, a use case that political groups, such as Australia’s Flux Party, have been experimenting with.  Say that a group of sensor drones are debating whether an image is of a cup or a two faces. (This example from the white paper uses the classic rubin vase visualization). One of the robots will detect the need to make a decision and issue a vote using a special transaction creating two addresses that represent each choice: a cup or two faces.  The outcome is determined by majority rule. Each robot casts a vote in the form of a transaction sent to the address that represents their choice. Since the blockchain is public for all the robots to view, they can quickly verify the result of the vote. The robots repeat this process for each decision the robotic swarm needs to make.  Each vote, of course, would need to happen in a timely manner, which is one of the issues with blockchain technology as it currently stands, as public blockchains often require a minimum amount of time to ensure that the transactions are secure.  Sidechain hopping  Robotic swarms will also need to jump from behavior to behavior to accomplish their objectives, according to the white paper.  To accomplish this, the groups of robots could use interoperable blockchains to swap control algorithms in a process the white paper calls ""behavior differentiation"". (Developers are currently trying to make this possible with ideas like pegged sidechains).  So, robotic swarms might switch behaviors when they move to another sidechain, as sketched out in the white paper. One blockchain might rely on decentralized control based on round-robin mining, for example, while another would have a ""leader-follower"" control mechanism.  Another differentiator might be private and public blockchains.  One sidechain might be a private company blockchain used for testing purposes and filled with company information, but it could be pegged to a public one. (Ferrer offers MultiChain, the build-your-own-blockchain company, as an example).  Those aren’t the only ideas described in the white paper. Blockchains could help create a system of trust to combat the rise of robots with malicious intent within the group, and these robotic swarms could also form Internet of Things markets, collecting information together and sending it to interested users.  Current limitations  But blockchains have some fundamental limitations, that Ferrer believes could block widespread use of blockchain-based swarm of robots.  For example, the 10-minute transaction confirmation time (roughly) of bitcoin stands in the way of quick voting on decisions. Robotic swarms probably don’t have 10 minutes to determine which way to move if they’re 30 feet from a potential obstacle.  Furthermore, if the bitcoin blockchain continues to grow, it might be too burdensome for each robot to carry or fly around with a copy of the full ledger.  Still, the white paper is optimistic about future of combining blockchains and robotic swarms:  ""This step could open the door not only to new technical approaches, but also to new business models that make swarm robotics technology suitable for innumerable market applications.""
