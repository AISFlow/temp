42383105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAMf,1577469871,Sovereign Powers Could Be Key to Mass Crypto Adoption,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ryan Zurrer is founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm focused on on-chain opportunities. Previously, he led investments at Polychain Capital and served as Chief Commercial Officer at the Web3 Foundation.      Nation states made a more substantive impact this year than the 10 previous years of crypto combined. China’s statist approach, in particular, may prove to be a catalyst to the still-elusive “mass adoption of crypto.”      In the U.S., the SEC made headlines with several high-profile enforcements including EOS, Telegram and kin, while federal lawmakers made their presence felt regarding Facebook’s Libra. FINCEN’s KYC/AML guidance factored prominently, and token sales and SAFT rounds slowed in 2019, driving much of the fundraising activity towards exchange platforms and causing a short blip of popularity in IEOs.      Regulatory action may have caused deal flow to slow, U.S. entrepreneurs and investors say, even if Silicon Valley will continue to produce some of the most compelling innovation in blockchain. As the industry moves forward into bitcoin’s second decade, there will continue to be high-drama friction as we try to reconcile crypto-anarchist ideals of pseudonymous participation with long-standing regulations around securities, KYC/AML and money-transmission laws.      We saw cross-border collaboration around the FATF enforcement recommendations, calling for exchanges to share customer information. But it remains to be seen whether this mandate will affect exchange activity or if it will drive a renaissance in decentralized exchange volume in 2020.      During the first three quarters, we saw China step forward and embrace blockchain technologies. The People’s Bank of China announced plans for a national sovereign digital currency, the DCEP. Industry observers and PBoC’s development team expect it to launch in 2020. President Xi Jinping’s comments regarding China’s desire to lead in blockchain technology were almost certainly strategically timed on the back of the Facebook hearings.      China’s leadership in our industry has been playing out for some time. More than two-thirds of bitcoin mining happens in China and exchange volume is dominated by Chinese markets (for example, more than 60 percent of Tether trading). Most importantly, more consumer-facing Web3 apps are coming out of China than any other market globally. At the time of this writing, eight of the top 10 dapps are developed by and/or for the Chinese market.      While Western crypto purists continue to point to concerns over privacy and surveillance of the DCEP, this is an overly simplistic evaluation in my opinion. I am confident Chinese ingenuity will lead towards a myriad of relatively seamless bridges between high-privacy crypto-networks and the regulated DCEP. I estimate the DCEP most directly impacts Chinese demand for Tether and other stablecoins going forward.    After years of waiting patiently in vain for “mass adoption of crypto,” I think we should be open-minded here.    The Chinese market also drove much of the bitcoin and ethereum market rebound in the first half of the year as Chinese investors sought to diversify their personal stores of value amid their nation’s trade war with the U.S. Enormous scams like the multi-billion-dollar Plus Token embezzlement caused regional governments to take a stronger stance on exchanges, driving down prices and showing China’s influence on crypto markets. Chinese officials are in the “blockchain not bitcoin/tokens” camp, but recognize crypto’s market popularity. It seems like many sovereigns are trying to reconcile the power and potential of blockchain technologies with unsettling risks.      Chinese consumers have a certain affinity for foreign crypto projects, possibly due to perceptions around security, privacy and technical prowess. But 2020 will bring forward the first crop of technically sophisticated mainland-based projects. Local startups have evolved beyond the early fast-follower experiments into a new generation of very legitimate technical teams with novel crypto-economic models (for example, Nervos, Sperax, Bihu).      Crypto may be remembered as one of the first industries (but certainly not the last) where China takes the position of technical innovator rather than fast-follower, sitting at the vanguard of development in Web3 technologies. In fact, we may even look back on the DCEP as a harbinger of China’s strategic shift towards reserve-currency status.      A statist approach to blockchain development, like other industrial policies in the past, might yet prove successful in this market. After years of waiting patiently in vain for “mass adoption of crypto,” I think we should be open-minded here. I often tell investors that if you don’t get comfortable riding the Great Red Dragon, you may get burnt in its wake. As we move forward into a new decade on the calendar and our industry’s second decade of existence, I’m excited for what’s on the horizon as we look East.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ryan Zurrer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/27/sovereign-powers-could-be-key-to-mass-crypto-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ace71519f04f8ca13cc1463325419019d6cd5cb-1200x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced in a Dec. 26 report titled ""Monetary Policy for 2020,” the Bank of Korea will hire experts to study the effects of distributed ledgers, cryptocurrencies and CBDCs on financial settlements and security. The group will also “keep an eye” on other countries’ experiments with CBDCs.      The task force could be formed as early as January 2020, reports CoinDesk Korea.      In the past year, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank announced investigations into digital replacements for cash, as the People’s Bank of China gets ready to pilot its “digital yuan” in 2020. State-backed digital currencies may improve international and internal settlements as well as mitigate fraud, say backers.      “[T]he bank will enact assessment principles, reflecting domestic conditions, to improve the effectiveness of its oversight of the payment and settlement systems,” bank officials said in the document.      Bank of Korea’s earlier research into digital currencies has come and gone. A previous task force was disbanded in January 2019 after a year of studying virtual currencies and CBDCs.      The bank found that CBDCs could adversely affect the demand for traditional banking services, which could impact financial stability.      In October, Hong Kyung-sik, the head of the Bank of Korea's Banking and Finance Bureau, said an advanced economy with a credit system would not benefit from CBDCs.      Still, the bank hired an expert to study cryptocurrencies this past September.      According to the Bank for International Settlements, a “majority” of central banks in developed and emerging economies (of 63 surveyed) are researching CBDCs.

42383098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uADr,1577448000,Ethereum's 'Bazaar' Development Model Will Pay Off in 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ben Edgington advises on Eth2 across ConsenSys. Prior to joining ConsenSys, he was Head of Engineering for Information Systems at Hitachi Europe.      My life would be much easier if I could give you an exact date when Ethereum 2.0 will go live, if I could show you a two-year committed roadmap or explain precisely how cross-shard transactions will preserve DeFi composability. I’m pretty sure failing to have answers on issues like these would have gotten me fired from my old, corporate job.      But I am completely confident of this: 2020 is Ethereum 2.0’s year of delivery. The signal event will be the genesis of the beacon chain in the early part of the year. With three or four production-ready clients and 500,000 ether staked, this new Proof-of-Stake chain will start completing the first and most challenging phase of Eth2’s delivery.      How can I be so sure of this yet relaxed about not having all the details nailed down? Well, that’s the magic of Ethereum’s development approach. It’s an approach I’ve learned to trust over the 18 months we have been building this. Amid all the market ups and downs and all the competitive uncertainties, this approach continues to deliver. I call it ethereum’s superpower.      Doing things the way they have always been done is not going to change the world. Ethereum’s ambition is to be world-changing. It has to be global, distributed, inclusive and empowering. Unless our development process is equally global, distributed, inclusive and empowering, then Conway’s law – that systems reflect the structures of the organizations that design them – says we’re going to fail.      So, as a developer community, we try to operate as openly as we can, encouraging participation through developer calls, GitHub issues, formal updates, informal updates and many other channels. All are welcome to participate, and many do. We nurture organic growth and are wary of any one party exerting too much control. To an extent, our approach resembles that of Linux, which has come to dominate much of the world’s computing. (Linux doesn’t have much of a roadmap either.)      This is the “bazaar” model of development described by Eric S Raymond in his classic work on open source software. But we’ve taken it further. We’re applying this approach to the development of the Eth2 protocol itself, its very design and the R&D behind it.      The idea is to inspire a broad community around a shared purpose and focus its collective energy on the task. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry put it like this, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”      This can look a bit messy. It can be a little chaotic and inefficient. The world can see our dirty laundry, which inevitably invites criticism. A report published in February recommended more “centralization of control” over development. A more recent article identified teams working “with different agendas and different timelines” as a risk area. In response I quote Scott’s Law: Never put order in a system before you understand the structure underneath its chaos.      Ethereum’s superpower is the engagement this approach inspires. By not insisting on being too tidy, we are able to engage a huge community. The sense of a shared endeavor draws in brilliant people who we might never otherwise have found. No fewer than eight independent client teams have delivered working Proof of Stake implementations. Do we need eight implementations? Perhaps not, but the engineering insight and expertise each brings serves to hone and improve the specification way beyond what any single team could achieve, across all areas from security to performance.      Another benefit of having an open, engaged community is getting fast feedback. Our initial scaling design called for 1,024 shard chains. People outside the core protocol team were able to review this and raise concerns about future developer experience that we were able to improve with a redesign. I am convinced that in a more traditional development environment this would have been addressed too late or not at all. We were able to pivot quickly, with very minor impact compared to the benefits gained.      Central to our approach is recognizing good ideas can come from anywhere. It’s fair to say that at the start of 2019, we didn’t have a clear view on how we would layer smart contract execution on top of the shard chains. The design space is large and there were many possible directions to explore. But, true to form, a proposal emerged on a community forum that was picked up by the Quilt team at ConsenSys that is now exploring and implementing the design.      Of course, our approach is not perfect. Some inefficiencies are real. But in our world it is a mistake to optimize for efficiency over engagement. In any case, our approach doesn’t seem to have slowed us down. We are very much on track with our expected development trajectory.      The real proof of our open, organic development approach will come in the first months of 2020. We are on track to go live with ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, and the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake will be officially underway – part of the vision of ethereum since its earliest days.      That’s the foundation on which we will continue to work towards massive scalability. I can’t offer you a detailed roadmap. But the brilliance and energy of our ever-growing community makes me confident that by early 2021 we will have a platform fit for one million devs. Why not come and join this extraordinary, future-changing community?",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ben Edgington,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/27/ethereums-bazaar-development-model-will-pay-off-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bdf1d1786a239f199d5b62570f4460ce0d0a211-710x458.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
