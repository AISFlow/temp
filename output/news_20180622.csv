42380935,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92dkj,1529705738,EOS' Blockchain Arbitrator Orders Freeze of 27 Accounts,"EOS, the blockchain network that has been live for just over a week, is raising eyebrows for its unconventional approach to governance – again.  In an ""Emergency Measure of Protection Order"" dated June 22, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) – a body set up to resolve disputes in the community – directed the block producers that maintain the EOS ledger to not process transactions from 27 different wallet addresses.  The relevant text reads:  ""It is hereby ordered that the EOS Block Producers refuse to process transactions for the following accounts and keys indefinitely. (Until further official notice and instruction from the ECAF.)""  Perhaps most controversially, the ECAF did not explain the reason for the order. ""The logic and reasoning for this Order will be posted at a later date."" It is signed ""Sam Sapoznick, in the capacity of ECAF Interim Emergency Arbitrator.  CoinDesk reached out to Sapoznick and the ECAF to confirm the document's authenticity but did not receive a response before press time.  Order outcry  The order has attracted a wave of criticism from within and outside the EOS community, although it also has its defenders. For critics, the order demonstrates that EOS is not, in fact, a decentralized network, but subject to control by something akin to a government.  ""Civil asset forfeiture meets blockchain,"" wrote one observer, referring to the law enforcement practice of seizing private property based solely on the suspicion that a crime has been committed.  Supporters of the move pointed out that the frozen addresses are likely involved in phishing scams that targeted investors during the occasionally chaotic migration from the ethereum blockchain (EOS' launch was funded by the sale of an ERC-20 token) to the freestanding EOS blockchain.  Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, a fund that has invested in EOS, told CoinDesk that ""the 27 accounts were doing spam attacks like the people who impersonate me on Twitter.""  ""I'm supportive of scaring the spammers out,"" he added.  Similar attempts at theft were behind the unanimous decision by EOS' 21 block producers to lock seven accounts implicated in the thefts on June 17, when EOS had only been live for a matter of days.  Now, less than a week after those first account freezes, the number of accounts that have been censored – or that the network's governance structure wants to censor – is swelling.  Blockchain constitution  EOS' approach to governance is new for a major blockchain project and, for now, largely untested. EOS' code was written by Block.One, the company that also conducted the year-long ICO to fund EOS' launch. Block.One stepped back prior to the launch, however, in order to allow the community to carry it out.  In a way, EOS' inception by the community, rather than a single organization, suggests a radical commitment to decentralization. Yet EOS was designed with high transaction throughput in mind, so it opted for a more efficient – but arguably less decentralized – consensus mechanism than bitcoin's proof of work.  Delegated proof of stake, as the consensus mechanism is called, gives the 21 elected ""block producers"" the responsibility to maintain the EOS blockchain – meaning they also have the power to censor transactions.  The ECAF, meanwhile, was created to resolve disputes – including, it would seem, by ordering block producers to refuse to process certain transactions.  To critics, this structure is overly centralized and anathema to the kind of censorship-resistant, distributed network pioneered by bitcoin. To those sympathetic to the experiment, such as this Reddit user, EOS' design represents a ""pragmatic"" point of view rather than a ""moralist"" one.  It is not certain at the time of writing whether the block producers will comply with the order.

42380940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92dtX,1529695277,Bitcoin Price Drops to Within $100 of 2018 Low,"The price of bitcoin fell to its lowest point since February today.  As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency's price went as low as $6,063, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), a significant drop considering the day's opening price of $6,717.20.  The near-$700 decline (which saw prices decline roughly 10 percent) effectively brought bitcoin to within $100 of its 2018 low of $5,947, reached February 6.  At the time, bitcoin was in free-fall amid regulatory uncertainty, with the decline occurring during the week in which the heads of major U.S. regulators were to meet and discuss the cryptocurrency's price rise with a committee of U.S. lawmakers. Ultimately, however, no action was taken and the price rebounded 40 percent on the week.  Conditions today, however, look different.  At press time, bitcoin's price – currently hovering just above $6,000 – is down more than 60 percent from the 2018 high of $19,783 set in January. Further, aside from some potential action against smaller Japan-based exchanges, no major news drivers are currently impacting the market.  Other cryptocurrencies are following suit as bitcoin continues to flirt with support levels, as shown in data published by sources like OnChainFX.  Litecoin, for example – the world's sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – hit its lowest level in 7 months on Friday. The price of ether currently at about $479, roughly 60 percent from its all-time high in December 2017.  As it stands, the overall cryptocurrency market cap is $259 billion, down from its high of $813 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Other indicators similarly depict the state of the market as it stands today.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator, demonstrates a weekly value of 41 according to Bitfinex exchange data, a level that was last seen in August 2015.  Compared to bitcoin's lowest weekly RSI level (27) for the prolonged bear market in 2014, current levels show scope for significant additional depreciation.

The world's sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $84.39 at 14:00 UTC – its lowest level since November 29, according to CoinDesk's Litecoin Price Index – and was last seen at $84.99, down more than 12 percent on the day.  Litecoin Price Index  At press time, LTC is the third-biggest loser among top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is reporting a 13.26 percent week-on-week drop, according to CoinMarketCap.  Further, its market capitalization stands at $4.88 billion, the lowest level since December 1.  Other major cryptocurrencies are also flashing red. Names like ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA), bitcoin cash (BCH) have depreciated by at least 10 percent each. Meanwhile, EOS is down 15.7 percent and is the biggest loser among top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to fresh 100-day low below $6,100 and likely dragged other markets lower with it. As of press time, BTC was trading at $6,131.74, down 8.7 percent since the start of Friday's trading session.  The risk aversion will likely worsen as the technical charts show bitcoin could find acceptance below $6,000 (February low) and extend losses towards $5,000 mark in the short-term.

42380936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92doV,1529679620,US Congressman: SEC's Stance on Ether Is 'Encouraging',"Congressman Tom Emmer has praised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for clarifying that ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether, is not a security.  As previously reported, the SEC's director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, told the audience at the Yahoo! All Markets Summit: Crypto conference last week that ""current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.""  With ethereum having built an ecosystem around its blockchain and smart contacts platform, a decision that its token must be governed under securities law in the U.S. – as suggested by some in the regulatory space – could have presented major difficulties for the project.  To gauge his reaction to the SEC comment, CoinDesk reached out to Emmer, a Republican who has previously spoken of the need to not over-regulate blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  ""Like many of the innovations generated from these new technologies, ether does not fit neatly into the regulatory boxes Washington has created,"" Emmer told CoinDesk in a statement.  The Minnesota Congressman continued:  ""Director Hinman's comments are encouraging, specifically his suggestion that the decentralized and useful nature of certain technologies may provide a means toward regulatory certainty, even for assets which once may have been considered a security.""  Further, he said he appreciated ""the light-touch approach the SEC and other regulators have taken so far.""  Echoing that view recently was acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Mick Mulvaney, who told an audience at the Future of Fintech conference on Wednesday that over-burdensome regulation is not good for the nascent industry.  While Mulvaney did not address the SEC's ether comment directly, he said ""we knew at an early point in bitcoin that, as with any developing financial technology, we needed to find that sweet spot.""  ""If we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences too,"" he said.  While some laws are helpful, in that they provide consumer protections, others may have an ""absurd result"" when applied to financial technology, Mulvaney said, adding that he considers it his role to ""identify and prevent"" such issues from occurring.  Emmer concluded on a similar note, indicating he was hopeful that regulators will ""take further steps to assure limited regulation and encourage investment here in the United States.""

42380924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92dZP,1529675313,Mt Gox to Enter Civil Rehabilitation in Major Win for Creditors,"Creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox just won a big victory.  According to a Friday release from Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings have been paused and a civil rehabilitation process will commence. The Tokyo District Court issued an order on June 22 approving a petition to begin civil rehabilitation, which was initially submitted in November of last year.  Those seeking to recoup funds  from the exchange – once the world's largest by trade volume before it dramatically collapsed in 2014, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses – could see their money sometime in the next year as the civil rehabilitation process moves forward.  Notably, Kobayashi's document implies that creditors seeking to regain their lost funds in bitcoin may receive larger amounts of cash than those who originally sought to be repaid in fiat currency when the exchange began bankruptcy proceedings.  It states:  ""In bankruptcy proceedings, non-monetary claims are converted into monetary claims based on the valuation as at the time of the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. In contrast, in civil rehabilitation proceedings, non-monetary claims are not converted into monetary claims at the time of commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings. Therefore, in the civil rehabilitation proceedings in this matter, claims seeking a refund of bitcoins ('Bitcoin Claims') will also not be converted into monetary claims after the commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings.""  The document continued, saying that ""the amount of voting rights of bitcoin creditors for resolutions on the proposed rehabilitation plan is based on the valuation of bitcoins as at the time of commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings.""  In other words, Mt. Gox's bitcoin holdings will not need to be sold, as has been happening, but can instead be distributed on a pro-rata basis. This means that future creditors may receive more than $440 per bitcoin (a value that comes from the price of bitcoin at the time bankruptcy proceedings began), a possibility that has previously been a source of controversy.  Kobayashi will report on the status of Mt. Gox's assets at a creditors' meeting on September 26 in Tokyo, he wrote. Claimants will then have until October 22, 2018 to file for rehabilitation, including submitting proof of their claim.  A proposal for fulfilling the rehabilitation requests will then be submitted to the court by February 14, 2019, according to Kobayashi.

42380931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92diD,1529668825,Fur Real? Businesses Test CryptoKitties-Inspired Ethereum Tech,"Sure the cypherpunks love CryptoKitties, but it turns out luxury fashion brands are also taking a shine to the digital fluffballs.  Or at least, they're into the technology behind the ethereum-based decentralized application that captured the hearts and minds of crypto enthusiasts in December of last year.  According to French startup Arianee, which boasts former employees and advisors from luxury brands such as Tiffany's, Omega, Balenciaga and the Richemont group, the same technology can be used to help these firms create unique identities for bespoke handbags and expensive watches.  What Arianee did to test that theory was create a new blockchain – a copy of ethereum which combines both permissioned and permissionless elements through its use of a consensus mechanism it's calling ""proof-of-authority."" It's permissionless in the sense that users who want to sell products to one another can interact with the blockchain, but the verifying of the ledger and issuance of new tokens is controlled by the participating businesses.  ""The consensus that seals blocks and adds blocks is not fully accessible. You have to register your identity within our governance to become one of those nodes, and in our case, that's really the brands or third-party experts,"" explained Luc Jodet, head of business architecture at Arianee.  The crypto tokens running over the blockchain are based on ethereum's ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens.  The ERC-721 standard is all about scarcity (non-fungible tokens are unique and distinguishable entities) and that makes for a logical solution to import from the gaming and digital collectible world to use for tokenizing luxury goods.  Jodet could not talk openly at this stage about which brands might be running nodes on the Arianee blockchain, but pointed to the startup's advisors at Richemont – a Switzerland-based holding company that owns Cartier, Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Purdey, Vacheron Constantin, and Van Cleef & Arpels – as logical candidates.  Commenting on the appropriation of these types of tokens for luxury goods tracking, Courtney Brock, co-founder and COO at Blockade Games, who's been an advocate for the use of ERC-721 tokens for multiple business verticals, said one of the benefits of this token type is that a single contract could work for all goods and include all the information for each product line, season, production number, etc.  ""The thing that 721s are really good for is tracking a unique asset,"" she said, adding:  ""If you were to use an ERC-20 or just a regular blockchain, you would actually have to create a new protocol for each line, like if you wanted to distinguish between lines.""  Handbags and glad rags  And with that, Arianee's team sees two main benefits to high-end businesses from its smart assets technology.  First, there's what it calls ""post-production traceability,"" which provides a readily verifiable authenticity stamp for each item. This can also carry details about the item's provenance or its service history (expensive watches have to be serviced every two years) and this information can then easily be transferred if the item is resold. The second, more subtle application is how the token connects the owner with the brand itself, as opposed to the intermediate retailer (again, useful for reselling luxury goods).  ""Because it's a token it can be transferred from one owner to another and can record information about the item's history, with the smart asset there remains a connection, a communication channel, that is always open between the current owner and the brand,"" Jodet said.  Arianee has built three prototypes: one for watches, one for handbags and high fashion items, and a third for champagne bottles.  In the case of champagne, post-production traceability becomes extremely important to track the bottle once it leaves the vineyard, making sure it was kept in a cellar and which shop actually sold or resold it, said Jodet.  And these three tests aren't the only ones on Jodet's mind.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This works for any luxury products you could imagine, such as jewelry. We have something with musical instruments we are exploring, and art as well.""  Lavish users  All blockchain technology needs a network effect and certainly one of Arianee's strengths is its heavyweight advisory board which could help create the adoption.  One of those advisors is Guillaume Boilot, chief operating officer at Vacheron Constantin, which has been creating paper ""passports"" for the last 260 years to go with its rather high-end watches (owners of Vacheron Constantin watches have included Napoleon Bonapart, Pope Pius XI and Harry Truman).  These watch passports pertain to three individual numbers: one on the case; another buried inside the watch; and a third issued by third party, Hallmark of Geneva, which would be a potential candidate to run a node on the Arianee blockchain should Vacheron Constantin decide to tokenize their products.  Boilot stressed that his company is presently at the testing stage with this technology, but added, as a brand under the Richemont holding company, that his parent company would be the most likely to run a node for all the brands under its umbrella.  Anything that enhances authenticity in a transparent and verifiable way is a win for luxury products, Boilot told CoinDesk, adding:  ""All our watches have alligator straps, for example, and we think that in the coming years our clients would like to know where does the skin come from.""  Interestingly, he said, much of the demand for his company's rare and collectible watches comes from the Chinese market, and this realization has also has been a motivation to explore blockchain, since China is one of the countries where people are taking a significant interest in the nascent technology.  ""We really think our clients, many of whom are Asian, will want to have the digital asset [representing their watch] in their wallet,"" Boilot said. ""We see that many of them know about bitcoin mining and trading and are familiar with blockchain.""

42380928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92ddB,1529665261,FCoin Crypto Exchange Draws Fire for Controversial Business Model,"China-based FCoin – a new crypto exchange launched in May that takes a novel revenue model – has come under the spotlight after its trading volumes appear to have almost immediately surpassed some of the largest exchanges.  While the platform's trading data is currently not visible on more notable third party sites such as CoinMarketCap, a similar service in China indicates that FCoin saw over $5.6 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours – more than the sum of the top-10 platforms on CoinMarketCap.  Seemingly contributing to that spiking volume is the service's new business model, called ""trans-fee mining,"" which is seen as controversial by the Chinese cryptocurrency media and has also been criticized by Binance, one of the world's largest exchanges.  Founded by Zhang Jian, the former chief technology officer of Huobi, FCoin touts a new business model that effectively turns cryptocurrency trading into mining, since it provides a means to obtain FT tokens issued by FCoin.  According to the platform's white paper, the total amount of FT is capped at 10 billion, 51 percent of which will be allocated to the public and 49 percent will be held by FCoin and its investors.  But instead of adopting an initial coin offering or an airdrop, FCoin is issuing 51 percent of tokens to the public in exchange for making transactions on the exchange. For instance, for every transaction fee a user pays to FCoin in the form of either bitcoin or ethereum, the platform will reimburse the user 100 percent of the value in FTs.  In addition, FCoin says, for all the bitcoin and ethereum it collects in transaction fees daily, it will distribute 80 percent in bitcoin to users who hold their FTs continuously throughout the day.  However, within a month of FCoin's debut, various media outlets in the Chinese crypto community had raised questions over whether traders are just using bots to send fake transactions to receive the FT coins. Zhang has denied the accusation, claiming all trading transactions are authentic.  Binance's founder and CEO Zhao Changpeng has also weighed in to criticize the platform, alleging that ""trans-fee mining"" is just another form of ICO.  He wrote on his Weibo account on Wednesday:  ""You pay transaction fees to the platform with BTC and ETH. Then the platform pays '100%' back to you with its token. Isn't it just buying platform token with BTC and ETH? How is this different from an ICO?""  Zhao went on, accusing the firm of, in effect, making money through price manipulation:  ""If an exchange doesn't get revenue from transaction fees and solely profits from the price of its token. How would it survive without manipulating the token price? Are you sure you want to play against a price manipulator? The same price manipulator who controls the trading platform?""  On another post on Thursday, Zhao further commented on FCoin's method of distributing revenue, likening it to interest in the form of bitcoin to users who hold FT tokens.  ""It may appear attractive that you just hold the token and let other people who make trades on FCoin to generate dividend for you. But in the long run, who would be that stupid to keep making trades?"" he said.  But, notably, OKEx, the Hong Kong-based crypto-to-crypto trading platform launched by OKCoin, announced on Wednesday that it too is launching a program that will help 100 new crypto exchanges to adopt the trans-fee mining model.  By holding 500,000 OKB, the token issued by the OKEx exchange, partners of OKEx would receive technical support from the platform in launch an exchange utilizing the new concept, the firm said.  Then, on Thursday, in a move possibly aimed to ridicule OKEx and FCoin, Binance made a seemingly sarcastic announcement that it is going to partner with 1,000 teams to open 1,000 new trading platforms adopting the same trans-fee mining model.  Commenting on the plan, He Yi, co-founder of Binance, said:  ""Now that people love trans-fee reimbursement, how about giving back 200 percent? One exchange is not enough, let's do a thousand. Users have different needs, so we are now providing different choices.""  As of press time, the price of FT, which can only be traded on FCoin's platform at the moment, has seen a 16 percent decline to $0.427 in the last 24 hours, reflecting a 65 percent drop since its recent high at $1.25 on June 13.  FCoin could not be reached for comment.

42380938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92dsH,1529661940,Bitcoin Eyes Bear Revival After Key Support Breached,"Bitcoin's (BTC) bears may be building for a strong comeback, having pushed prices to a eight-day low below $6,300 earlier on Friday.  The price fell to $6,286 on Bitfinex at 09:50 UTC, the lowest level since June 14, and, at press time, was changing hands at $6,326, down around 6 percent over 24 hours.  As discussed yesterday, the cryptocurrency's persistent failure to scale the $6,800 mark in a convincing manner had raised the prospects of another leg down in bitcoin prices.  It seems that process is now underway. Bitcoin breached the key support of $6,620 a couple of hours ago – signaling that the relief rally from the June 13 low of $6,108 has ended at $6,850 (June 18 high) and the bears have regained control.  The technical charts now indicate scope for a drop below $6,000 over the weekend.  4-hour chart        BTC's drop below $6,620 has confirmed a rising wedge breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern indicating the corrective rally has ended and the broader bearish trend has resumed.  The stage is now set for a drop to $5,090 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height subtracted from breakdown price).  The target looks feasible as the long-term technical charts are also biased to the bears.  Weekly chart  As seen above, the pennant breakdown confirmed earlier this month opened up downside towards 100-week moving average (MA), currently located at $4,551.  Meanwhile, the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving averages (MAs) also favors a convincing break below the immediate support of $6,000 (February low).  View  BTC will likely find acceptance below the immediate support of $6,000 (February low) over the weekend, and could drop to $5,090 (target as per the measured height method) over the next couple of weeks.  A daily close (as per UTC) above $6,850 (June 18 high) would abort the immediate bearish view.  A high volume break above the 50-week MA, currently located at $6,958 would signal long-term bearish invalidation.

42380922,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92bAx,1529654408,The Downside of Democracy (and What it Means for Blockchain Governance),"Taylor Pearson is the author of ""The End of Jobs"" and writes about entrepreneurship and blockchain technologies at TaylorPearson.me.      Following acrimonious debates within the bitcoin and ethereum communities over the past few years regarding governance decisions that ended in forks, there has been a wave of projects offering on-chain governance.  This is a system for deciding on changes to public blockchain protocols using formalized governance mechanisms encoded in the blockchain, rather than informal discussions offline. Prominent examples of protocols with on-chain governance include Tezos, EOS and Decred.  While these projects may have some value, I believe the push for on-chain governance is, in large part, the result of an intuition carried over from environments like nation-states and private companies, both of which are very different from crypto networks  Implicitly, their belief is that we are seeing too much exit and not enough voice and we need to build better mechanisms for voice via formal on-chain governance.  Let's step back a bit. What do I mean by voice and exit?  Members of an organization, be it a nation, a business or a crypto network, have two possible responses when they're unhappy with its governance.  They can exit – leave the relationship – or they can use their ""voice"" to try to improve the relationship through communication.  Citizens of a country can respond to political repression by emigrating (exit) or protesting (voice). Employees can choose to quit their unpleasant job (exit), or talk to management to try and improve the situation (voice). Unsatisfied customers can opt to shop elsewhere (exit), or they can ask for the manager (voice).  In crypto networks, users can try to change the way that the protocol operates through governance (voice) or they can choose to exit by either leaving the network or forking.  Spectrum of governance  The relative merits and drawbacks of voice and exit depend on the cost of exit.  For example, it's important that countries are democratic and have (on-chain) voting that allows citizens to formally express their opinions because the costs of switching your citizenship (exit cost) are very high.  The tradeoff of prioritizing voice over exit is that democracies tend to be very inefficient compared to more technocratic forms of governance. This is epitomized in moments such as Alaska senator Ted Stevens describing the internet as ""not a big truck, but a series of tubes."" Despite being the head of the committee ruling on net neutrality, Stevens displayed a very low level of understanding about how the internet actually worked.  Democracy fundamentally operates at the median of society, not the edge. It does that in order to maintain peace and allow for economic prosperity. On the whole, this has worked better than any previous governance system.  Private companies are more technocratic than nation-states. A relatively small group composed of top management and large activist shareholders effectively control the institution. This allows them to be more efficient but also makes them more prone to disgruntled stakeholders – be it shareholders, employees or customers.  This is less of an issue because, compared to changing your citizenship, it's much easier to change your job or sell your stock. That is, the cost to exit is lower so you're less likely to ""revolt."" If you don't like how Apple's key decision makers are behaving, you have the option to quit your job or sell your stock.  At the far end of this spectrum is open-source software. The governance of open-source software is captured in the phrase ""rough consensus and running code.""  Open-source software governance tends to be technocratic with a relatively small group of stakeholders controlling the project. The broader stakeholder community has very little voice. Even fairly large bitcoin holders and miners have almost no say over bitcoin core's development roadmap.  However, if the technocratic rulers go in a direction you don't like, you can much more easily ""revolt"" by forking the network. Facebook's employees and shareholders can leave but they can't take the database with them. In open source software and blockchains, you can.  It is the opposite of democratic nation-states in this sense. You have very low exit costs and so you can get the efficiencies of a technocratic system without the threat of revolution. The revolutionaries can just start their own competitor.  From a top-down perspective, this technocratic, fork-prone governance is uncertain and hard to predict, which is often perceived as an inefficiency. To the contrary, this uncertainty is a necessary pre-condition, a fertilizer, for opportunity.  Bloodless revolutions  Open-source source software (and software more broadly) is the source of so much innovation because it so uncertain and loosely governed.  It is prone to frequent ""revolutions"" but those revolutions do not end the same way as real-world revolutions because information is a non-rivalrous good. The revolutionaries can walk out the door and build the future they believe should exist.  Physicist Max Planck is frequently paraphrased as saying that ""Science advances one funeral at a time."" Democracies tend to be no different and organizations often advance one retirement at a time.  By contrast, open-source software advances one fork at a time. It is not bounded by biology or geography but only by non-rival, infinitely replicable information.  These forks may ultimately be proven as worthless by the market, but the dissatisfied faction need not wait to try out the approach they perceive as better.  Returning, then, to blockchains, introducing on-chain governance to crypto networks is likely to make them more like nation-states with the inefficiencies that entails. Is that the right tradeoff?  There are certainly some exit costs associated with crypto networks. Forking a blockchain is easier than forking a nation state, but still requires sufficient scale in terms of users, miners, and broader tooling (wallets, exchanges, etc.).  Network effects related to brand and real-world integration points are other important sources of friction that discourage forking. I suspect for specific circumstances, that some form of on-chain governance proves more efficient.  But for a technology with comparatively low exit costs, forking is more feature than bug. Many projects with strong technocratic leaders practicing loose consensus and running code form a robust and competitive ecosystem.

42380905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92aqp,1529647405,Korean Government to Lead 6 Blockchain Pilots With $9 Million Fund,"The South Korean government will invest 10 billion Korean won (or $9 million) to support blockchain development in the country, with plans to carry out six pilots using blockchain technology.  According to a report from CoinDesk Korea, the country's Ministry of Science and ICT published a blockchain development strategy on Thursday. The agency said the government plans to invest $9 million in total until the end of 2019 as part of the country's pursuit of ""a medium- to long-term plan for expanding blockchain technology.""  With that, the ICT ministry said it will take the lead to work with other government agencies to conduct blockchain pilots in the public sector. The works will focus on livestock supply chain management, customs clearance, online voting, real estate transactions, cross-border e-document distribution and shipping logistics.  The main goal, according to the document, is to improve the information sharing efficiency and transparency in these public services by using a distributed network.  For instance, the ICT ministry explained that it will collaborate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs to deploy a system that updates the information of livestock from their breeding, shipping to sales on a distributed ledger.  As such, each party on the supply chain that functions as a node on the blockchain can be informed more promptly so that in case of a problem, the follow-up period could be reduced from six days to less than 10 minutes, the document said.  Similarly, the blockchain pilot on the real estate industry will be carried out with the Ministry of Land and Transport. It expects that by integrating real estate, taxation and legal services with a blockchain, the real estate transactions can become more streamlined and efficient for consumers since their information can be shared automatically among different parties.  ""We will establish a roadmap for developing blockchain technology and plan to secure 90 percent of the technology level by 2022 compared to the world's top countries,"" the agency said.  In addition, the ministry said will invest 800 million won (or $720,000) a year for up to six years to expand a blockchain research center. The goal is to educate students on the nascent technology and to nurture 10,000 blockchain specialists by 2022.

42380907,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92as5,1529640011,Zcash Pays Off Developer to Avoid Blockchain Split,"Despite the best efforts of zcash developers to keep the cryptocurrency's coming upgrade, Overwinter, as seamless as possible, the $800 million network was faced with a plot-twist this week.  Mere days before the update (a hard fork of the code) was set to execute – a developer decided to effectively threaten to split the network – if he wasn't paid in return that is. In a forum post published Tuesday, the sole maintainer of the Windows zcash wallet software, D. Jane Mercer, said he was going to cease development of the clients and release a zcash competitor ""rebranded as another coin,"" if he didn't get further funding for his work.  See, last year Mercer was living off developer fees and donations for his work on the clients, but according to the post, the money had run out and he had been working for free for some time.  As such, Mercer decided to use the idea he might split the cryptocurrency as a way to air his frustrations.  On the forum, Mercer said:  ""Altcoin drama rage quit hard fork, as it were. Pull a bitcoin cash, as it were.""  And this message sent some in the zcash community into a frenzy.  That's because the Overwinter upgrade is scheduled to activate on June 25, but more importantly, that upgrade only adds limited features to zcash's protocol in an effort to prepare it for the Sapling hard fork upgrade, which looks to make zcash more scalable and private, in October.  If Mercer stopped development on the Windows wallet software, the most popular zcash wallet software, ""tens to hundreds of thousands of users"" would have been left without a workable wallet after the Sapling upgrade.  So, even though, blockchain splits have become, according to some, a healthy mechanism for asserting opposition of any decentralized cryptocurrency development, others do fear that these competing coins have the potential to split the community into fighting factions that confuse users.  ""It might be as simple as pay the man,"" zcash engineer Ariel Gabizon said.  And payment came. The zcash community quickly stepped to financially support the developer after the threat – at least for a little while. The amount donated to Mercer by several anonymous zcash addresses is currently at 80 ZEC, around $15,360, according to current metrics.  ""People have thrown enough in the kitty for a few months living expenses, so that's all well and good,"" Mercer told CoinDesk.  No more coexisting  Stepping back, though, it's notable in how the features packaged in the Overwinter hard fork made the theoretical hostage situation more dire.  One reason is that most developers support forks. While potentially disruptive to crypto economies, the guiding ethos is they allow a novel form of financial freedom. If users don't like what is going on with zcash, they have the ability to create another instance of the software.  This is different, proponents say, than traditional money systems. (Try as some might, you can't exactly fork the U.S. dollar and the elaborate banking system that enables it.)  In this way, Overwinter prepares the network for further upgrades and the potential for future hard forks, by including so-called ""replay protection"" to ensure that the network can bifurcate correctly in the case of a split.  However, the software still contains code called ""auto-senescence,"" which causes nodes running older versions of the software to shutdown after a period of 16 weeks.  Designed to remove risks when undergoing network upgrades, Mercer had prepared for feature.  In the newest version of his wallet software, auto-senescence remained, so that the software would eventually expire. However, having removed it from the old version, if the users stayed on the old client, it would cause a chain split, Mercer continued.  ""There is going to be a chain fork in one case, and then client death in another,"" he wrote.  While zcash developers were quick to counter that, saying that after Overwinter, older versions of the software will just be pushed into ""safety mode,"" which causes those versions to deprecate at some point without causing a chain split, Mercer still had the community in a tight spot.  ""Rock and a hard place you know,"" Mercer said, explaining the pressure he put on the community. ""Overwinter is coming, and you got an Overwinter wallet but it's gonna deprecate sometime between Overwinter and Sapling, so how am I going to get to Sapling.""  Mercer's orneriness was on full display at that time, but since he received the donations, he said, that he's dedicated to preparing the wallet software for the Sapling upgrade to come in about three months.  ""Overwinter broke crap in a bunch of places which we're only figuring out now how to fix that with Windows, but it's like, bootin' hell knows what Sapling's going to be,"" the developer said, adding:  ""Well now I'm funded by the community to find out and bring it forward.""  A timely lesson  Above and beyond the donations Mercer received, though, he also got on the phone with the Zcash Foundation as well.  ""I finally got one of the Zcash Foundation board members on the phone, and he managed to talk me back from the ledge from chain fork threats and fun things like that,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I'm all calmed down, everything is happy now, I hate altcoin drama and it's the only time I have stirred it up deliberately in my life.""  Still the episode has sparked an important conversation between Mercer and the Zcash Foundation – one that other cryptocurrency communities should be clued into as well – about how crucial independent developers are to these protocols and how to best compensate them for their work.  The Zcash Foundation, which receives donations from the so-called ""founder's fee,"" a piece of code that contributes a percentage of zcash mining rewards to the founders fund, has a recurring grant program.  For independent developers like Mercer, though, relying on crypto and its volatile markets to continue contributing code can be crushing. Zcash in particular was hit hard this year, down from $876 per coin in January to $192 at the time of writing.  ""The bear market really killed me,"" Mercer said. ""You know ... when the blood spilling happened, I woke up and 25 percent of my money was gone.""  And if the Zcash Foundation holds their reserves in ZEC, then the same rules would apply, whereby the grant program would be a little less healthy. As such, on a forum, executive director of the Zcash Foundation Josh Cincinnati said the organization is open to researching other funding methods as well.  Speaking broadly about the whole incident, it's has been a timely lesson on the importance of good developer relations, Mercer said, adding:  ""Developers, developers, developers! There needs to be someone to talk to third-party wallet providers and exchanges, directly.""  Crumpled paper image via Shutterstock  EDIT (11.45 UTC June 22, 2018): A former version of this article falsely stated that the feature ""auto-senescence"" is removed in the Overwinter upgrade. This has now been corrected.  EDIT 2 (12.15 UTC June 22, 2018): A former version of this article falsely stated that the Zcash Foundation was ""hard coded"" funds from the founders fee.

42380916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92b4f,1529625610,"ICON Token Swap Underway With 'No Issues,' Foundation Says","Millions of dollars worth of ICON tokens are now on the move - as the cryptocurrency project begins its token migration.  Designed to connect independent blockchain communities with a variety of governance strategies, the ICON protocol first launched its crypto token, ICX, on the ethereum blockchain, but – in what has become an increasingly popular process – is now moving those tokens over to its very own blockchain.  More specifically, the project, which launched its mainnet in January, is tasked with swapping around $42,750,000 worth of ERC-20 tokens with an equal amount of native ICX tokens from now until September 25.  And according to the ICON Foundation, the organization in charge of development, so far it's been smooth sailing.  Speaking to the process that started June 20, a representative for the foundation told CoinDesk:  ""No issues have been reported and we haven't had any on our end.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, only supported exchanges – Binance, Upbit and Bitthumb – can currently shift ICX tokens to the new blockchain.  Therefore, according to the foundation, token holders must transfer their tokens to one of those exchanges in order to start the migration process. Later this month, on June 25, token holders will also be able to use the ICONex wallet to migrate their ICX tokens.  As soon as the migration is complete, users will be able to resume ICX deposits and withdrawals, the foundation said, although an estimated completion date was not provided. However, supporting exchanges indicated that they will wait to reopen deposit and withdrawal services until the ICON mainnet has proven safe.  ""We will open ICX deposits and withdrawals again once we deem the ICX mainnet to be stable,"" Binance said on its website.  For now, ICX token holders must trust the ICON Foundation and the supporting exchanges to execute the swap successfully. However, the foundation stated it may yet provide users with oversight of the migration.  ""As of now there is no place to watch the process, however, we are exploring ways to make this possible,"" a representative for the foundation told CoinDesk.  ICON, a crypto with a collective market capitalization of about $800 million, is only one of the top thirty cryptocurrencies to attempt a token migration in recent weeks. Tron, which aims to use its blockchain infrastructure create a ""truly decentralized internet"" kicked off its token migration on Thursday. Likewise, the scalability-focused EOS protocol underwent a token migration earlier in June.
