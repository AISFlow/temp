42433731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4jnh,1614297539,Musk Says He Hopes Rumors He's in the SEC's DOGE House Are True,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his hope that rumors are true that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating his frequent tweeting about dogecoin (DOGE). ""It would be awesome,"" he said    The CEO of the electric vehicle maker, who has a hate-hate relationship with the SEC, seems to relish the idea of another go-round with the regulatory body. In 2018, Musk famously said, ""I do not respect the SEC.""  Because the SEC doesn't consider the meme-based cryptocurrency a security, an investigation by that body into market manipulation of DOGE would seem unlikely. However, because the SEC is known to be monitoring Musk's social media output as part of a settlement of charges that he'd committed securities fraud for misleading tweets, it's not out of the question.  Should the SEC start looking for evidence the CEO has been a vocal booster of DOGE, which is represented by a Shiba Inu dog, such proof wouldn't be hard to find. At one point describing himself as the ""dogecoin CEO,"" Musk has been a frequent tweeter of memes boosting DOGE. While other parents might buy their child a puppy, Musk tweeted earlier this month that he had bought his nine-month-old son a DOGE.  Musk's most recent DOGE tweet was Thursday morning:  And, per usual, the price of the cryptocurrency rose in response to Musk's tweet, sort of like Pavlov's DOGE.  It wasn't immediately clear where the rumor of an SEC investigation started. It's possible it is a false rumor and an attempt to manipulate the market. If that proves to be the case, the Tesla CEO will be denied the pleasure of his anticipated DOGE fight with the SEC.

42433729,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4jjh,1614295612,FATF Says It Is Open to Amending Crypto Travel Rule Guidance,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is open to amending the ""travel rule,"" its guidance for cryptocurrency exchanges and companies providing crypto services.      The anti-money laundering watchdog said Thursday it is confident the crypto industry will be able to implement complex data sharing requirements, known colloquially as the “travel rule,” by the time its 12-month review comes around in June.      A U.S. Treasury Department statement said FATF “agreed to seek public consultation on amendments to” the June 2019 guidance.      “The updated guidance will help countries and [virtual asset service providers] understand their [anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism] obligations and effectively implement the FATF’s requirements in key areas, including how the FATF Standards should be applied to stablecoins, travel rule implementation and how to address the risks of peer-to-peer transactions,” the Treasury Department said.      Thursday’s announcements came following a virtual meeting, where officials from FATF member nations met to discuss efforts to monitor or mitigate money-laundering concerns and evaluate whether any nations were failing to meet the standard-setters’ guidance.      The FATF has said previously the virtual asset industry had made progress but there's “a need for greater guidance to implement the revised requirements, including for low-capacity countries,” according to a statement accompanying this week’s meeting.      During a post-meeting press briefing, FATF President Marcus Pleyer was asked if any leniency will be shown to countries that might be slow to implement the recommendations for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in those jurisdictions. (This expected disparity in regulatory compliance from one jurisdiction to the next is referred to as the “sunrise problem.”)    Read more: ‘Evil VASP’ Simulation Preps Crypto Exchanges for FATF Travel Rule    “We are now consulting on updated guidance on progress within the virtual assets sector, including the travel rule,” Player said. “We hope to get feedback from the key industry players […] and I'm confident that we will approve it in June so that it can then be handed out to the industry after that.”      The FATF has now updated its guidance to address specific areas, including on how to apply the FATF standards to so-called stablecoins, how public and private sectors can implement the travel rule and how to address the risks of disintermediated peer-to-peer transactions, the FATF's statement said.      The FATF will publish the public consultation draft in March, it said. Feedback from the consultation will inform the final guidance, which the FATF expects to approve in June.

42433740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4jzh,1614292490,Coinbase: DeFi Could Hurt Us and US Regulations Make It Hard to Fight Back,"The top U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is cautioning investors that U.S. regulators may inhibit its ability to compete with rivals in decentralized finance (DeFi).      ""Economic freedom is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for human progress,"" CEO Brian Armstrong noted in a letter embedded within a new prospectus filed Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      One entity that could benefit from a little more freedom, the document implies, is Coinbase itself.    Read more: Coinbase Is Going Public: Everything You Need to Know    The company dropped its Form S-1 to much fanfare Thursday morning. The prospectus portion of the document is meant to give investors all the information they will need when Coinbase shares begin trading on Nasdaq, likely under the COIN ticker.      As a leading centralized exchange, Coinbase is understandably ambivalent about DeFi and the growth of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), writing:    ""By combining the best of crypto and traditional finance, we believe that we are well-positioned to execute on our growth strategy, enable the cryptoeconomy, and achieve our mission of creating an open financial system for the world. However, we do face significant competition from parties ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early stage financial technology providers and companies native to the cryptoeconomy, such as decentralized exchanges.""    The prospectus doesn't attempt to quantify how much buying of assets useful in DeFi (such as ETH, DAI and USDC) the DeFi boom drove on the platform; however, its overall revenue more than doubled from 2019 to 2020. Doubtlessly, DeFi's bonanza must have played a part as retail investors converted fiat currencies to crypto in order to participate.      ""We are the default starting place for new user journeys into the cryptoeconomy,"" the prospectus states. The product has nearly 3 million monthly users and more than 40 million verified users.      Those are numbers any DeFi product would envy.      Indeed, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried thinks Coinbase is waving DeFi around as a competitor only because it needs to have one.      ""My honest best guess is that it's intentional misdirection,"" Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk via email. ""If you say you don't have any competitors and also just reported $1.1B of revenue, no one will believe you. So they have to list someone. And so I don't think they listed DeFi as a competitive risk because they were scared of DeFi. I think they listed it because they weren't scared of it.""    DEXs ascending    That said, Coinbase is watching DeFi carefully.      It sees developments such as exchange offerings, yield farming and token wrapping as exciting and important, but also reasonably worries about its ability to keep up.      ""We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, which may be superior to, or render obsolete, the products and services that we currently provide,"" the prospectus states.      Like any smart market leader, Coinbase has invested in the protocols that could disrupt it.      For example, Coinbase invested in the DeFi money market Compound, hooked it up with a bunch of USDC for one of its key liquidity pools and then helped get its COMP governance token out the door.      ""We hold investments in various DeFi protocols. These protocols achieve their investment purposes through self-executing smart contracts that allow users to invest crypto assets in a pool from which other users can borrow without requiring an intermediate party to facilitate these transactions,"" the prospectus notes.      Still, Coinbase remains wary.      ""We do face significant competition from parties ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early stage financial technology providers and companies native to the cryptoeconomy, such as decentralized exchanges,"" the exchange wrote.      As just one example: Uniswap has appeared at times to have more activity than Coinbase, but Uniswap is just one DEX. There are lots of them, such as Kyber, Loopring, Curve, SushiSwap and PancakeSwap, to name a few.      Coinbase is well aware.      ""We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business may be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively against them,"" the firm wrote. ""Such platforms have low startup and entry costs as market entrants often remain unregulated and have minimal operating and regulatory costs.""      Coinbase specifically mentioned offerings on blockchains such as Polkadot and Solana.      Matthew Finestone, on the Loopring business operations team, argues that the DEXs built on layers above networks such as Ethereum could be a threat. He notes that Loopring's layer 2 is seeing $25 million in volume per day. That's tiny compared with Coinbase, but its users ""have an experience which emulates Coinbase, but with the non-custodial benefits,"" he wrote.      Decentralized exchanges have some significant advantages, not least of which is the ability to trade without counterparties or platforms needing to know the trader's identity.      To crypto natives, that is and always was how crypto should be. To regulators, that – one would suspect – is exactly the problem.    Regulatory goo    Users are leaving Coinbase because it plays by the rules.      ""We operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against unregulated or less regulated companies,"" the prospectus notes. ""In recent years, our commitment to compliance and the attendant customer-facing requirements, including customer due diligence requirements, have resulted in our customers transferring significant funds and crypto assets to these unregulated or less regulated competitors.""      Those entities don't have to worry about a shortsighted regulation steamrolling them worldwide, but Coinbase does. It writes:    ""Regulators worldwide frequently study each other’s approaches to the regulation of the cryptoeconomy. ... As a result, the risks created by any new law or regulation in one jurisdiction are magnified by the potential that they may be replicated.""    If regulators don't stymie its mojo, Coinbase appears to believe it can be very big. Even now, it's worth noting, all the DeFi products tracked by DeFi Pulse have a total of about $40 billion under their control. Coinbase says it has $90 billion in assets on its platform.      DeFi still has a ways to go, but Coinbase seems to be betting it can hold its lead and become a true giant.      ""Coinbase isn't, at its heart, basically Uniswap but with [know your customer rules]. Coinbase's core user base and revenue base isn't the same as Uniswap's; in fact, it has fairly little overlap,"" Bankman-Fried wrote. He sees Coinbase's users – the very casual retail investor and the very big institutional investor – as completely different from those deep in DeFi.      In short, Coinbase users may never go anywhere near PancakeSwap.    How Armstrong fights    Crypto is hard. So far, Coinbase has made it easier.      ""As Coinbase clearly recognizes, decentralized or non-custodial platforms represent a strong competitive threat, but up until now, Coinbase has had an important moat which mostly neutered the up and comers: UX,"" Finestone admits, although he believes platforms like his are catching up fast on the user experience front.      Still, Coinbase has bet that its users don't mind being subject to lots of state-mandated rules that come in from outside the blockchain. So far that bet has worked out. If it continues to, Coinbase seems to believe it can be very large.      Armstrong noted this in his letter:    ""Trust and ease of use will be as relevant in ten years as they are today, and our work here will never be done. We may not always move the fastest, or offer the lowest prices, but we accomplish our goal of being the most trusted and easiest to use, customers will continue to choose our products and services now and in the future.""    This is obviously modeled on an observation from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who famously said that his business is built on things that never change, like fast delivery and low prices.      It's one of the ways that Coinbase appears to signal in the prospectus that it believes it could join tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Google. For another example, the prospectus states:      ""In the early days of the internet, Google democratized access to information through its user-friendly search engine, enabling virtually any user with an internet connection to discover the world’s information. Similarly, Coinbase is democratizing access to the cryptoeconomy by enabling anyone with an internet connection to easily and securely invest in and use crypto assets.""      But that potential makes it a target of, well, everybody.      Coinbase is in an interesting spot. From the perspective of crypto natives, it's the incumbent, the suit-and-tie, the monolith. To the broader world, and especially that of finance, it's still an upstart.      Caught between the megabanks and the food-branded DEXs, Coinbase is a Goliath with multiple Godzillas on one side of it and a growing army of robot Davids on the other.      As if that's not bad enough, there's some chance U.S. regulators will leave it fighting both while standing in quicksand.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/25/coinbase-defi-could-hurt-us-and-us-regulations-make-it-hard-to-fight-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a153334105e9cd03d54f1dcaec4da8f2f3660076-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4k5h,1614290408,Coinbase Gave Silicon Valley Bank Stock Warrants for Access to USD Payments,"Banking services were so hard for cryptocurrency businesses to come by early on that as a fledgling startup Coinbase apparently had to throw in a sweetener to seal the deal.      In 2014, the crypto exchange gave Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) stock warrants as part of an agreement allowing Coinbase to send and receive U.S. dollars through the banking system, an exhibit in the company’s prospectus shows.      The warrant “is issued in connection with ... certain ACH Origination Services,” according to the exhibit. ACH is the automated clearing house, the system for sending domestic, low-value payments between bank accounts in the U.S. A business that pays or is paid through ACH is an “originator” in banking parlance.      The disclosure in Coinbase's long-awaited S-1 filing Thursday offers a rare window into the often murky relationships between cryptocurrency businesses and the limited number of financial institutions willing to bank them.      The warrant gives Silicon Valley Bank, a bank that caters to tech startups, the right to buy more than 400,000 class B shares of common stock at a little over $1 per share.      Class B shares have 20 times the voting power of the Class A shares that Coinbase is seeking to list on Nasdaq, according to the prospectus. The Class B shares, however, are convertible at any time, on a one-for-one basis, to Class A shares, which presumably would be more liquid once they are publicly traded.      In 2014, bank accounts for cryptocurrency firms were even more difficult to find than they are today. Most banks lumped bitcoin-related services into the same high-risk bucket as marijuana-related businesses and refused to work with them, fearing regulators would frown on the relationships.      Coinbase, which had an account and a line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, would later lose that relationship in 2015 after Silicon Valley gave Coinbase six months to find another bank, as detailed in the book ""Kings of Crypto"" by Jeff John Roberts.      “SVB is built for the needs of the Valley, taking on risky startups other banks wouldn’t touch and operating within a tight clique of founders, venture capitalists, and tech incubators,” Roberts wrote. “Still, even with its Valley-centric worldview, SVB wasn’t particularly enamoured of Coinbase of its promise. It had taken a special nudge from Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures [an early investor in Coinbase] to get SVB to take its business.”      Much has changed since those scrappy days; last year, Coinbase secured a banking relationship with JPMorgan Chase, which is also one of Coinbase's advisers on the direct stock listing.      Coinbase declined to comment, and Silicon Valley Bank did not return requests for comment by press time.

42433760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4kJh,1614288398,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Below $50K as Investors ‘Wait and See’ Amid Market Reset,"Bitcoin was trading within a narrowed range on Thursday, as investors and traders were cautiously optimistic after the latest pullback, which took bitcoin’s price down close to $45,000 earlier this week.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $49,194.33 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.13% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $48,091.13-$52,076.32 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Trading volumes were far lower than earlier in the week when traders scrambled to adjust positions as the market fell 15% in two days, the biggest such decline since the coronavirus-driven sell-off of March 2020. The eight exchanges tracked by CoinDesk had a combined spot-trading volume of less than $4 billion on Thursday as of press time. The figure had surged above $10 billion on Monday and Tuesday and was slightly above $5 billion on Wednesday.      In the derivatives market, bitcoin’s options open interest is slowly returning after it dropped Tuesday slightly from an all-time peak of about $13 billion on Sunday.      “Bitcoin’s market is rather quiet today,” Yves Renno, head of trading at crypto payment platform Wirex, said. “Its derivatives market is going back to normal after the severe contract liquidations suffered a few days ago. Close to $6 billion worth of long future contracts were liquidated. The market is now trying to consolidate above the $50,000 level.”      “Traders are still cautious today,” Renno added. “It's ‘wait and see.’”      As CoinDesk reported earlier, traders are also watching closely for any potential impact of surging bond yields on bitcoin. U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday on investors’ rising concerns about the sharply growing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Some analysts in traditional markets have predicted that rising yields, often a precursor of inflation, might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, which could send stocks lower.      Surging bond yields seemed to have less of an impact on bitcoin’s price on Thursday. The No. 1 cryptocurrency briefly surpassed $52,000 during early trading hours, moving in the opposite direction of equities.      “Every time bitcoin goes below $50,000 there are players accumulating, thus bringing the price back around $50,000,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, said.      Several market indicators suggest that traders and investors remain largely bullish after a volatile price run earlier this week.      Large outflows from institution-driven exchange Coinbase Pro to custody wallets imply that institutional investors are confident about bitcoin’s long-term value.      On the options market, the put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of put options open relative to call options, remains below 1, meaning that there are still more traders buying calls (bullish bets) than puts (bearish bets) despite the latest sell-off.    Ether moves with bitcoin amid a quiet market    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was lower on Thursday, trading around $1,575.65 and sliding 2.12% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The market for ether was largely quiet on Thursday, mirroring the activity in the bitcoin market and moving in a narrowed range of $1,556.38-$1,672.60 at press time.      “It's notable that most of ether's price action is actually driven by bitcoin, as it's still stuck in the range that it has had versus bitcoin since late 2018,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “I would continue to look at the ETH/BTC pair.""    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 were mostly in green Thursday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    cardano (ADA) + 9.22%  kyber network (KNC) + 9.12%  litecoin (LTC) + 7.8%  tezos (XTZ) + 3.37%    Notable losers:    cosmos (ATOM) - 3.36%  chainlink (LINK) - 3.25%  ethereum classic (ETC) - 1.01%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed up by 1.67% amid gains from Wall Street overnight.

Announced Thursday, Block.one has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to join the LACChain Global Alliance, which has 40 partners in 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.      “We are very glad to incorporate Block.one as one of the LACChain allies or partners, because Block.one is the largest entity in the EOS world,” said LACChain Technical Lead Marcos Allende in an interview. “During the past months, we have attracted and incorporated the EOS community, and within the next few weeks we will release the LACChain EOSIO network.”      Allende stressed the MoU constituted a collaboration, and any funding help was up to the members.      “New partners can contribute in kind or in cash or both. Over the collaboration there might be both types of contribution. We try to make sure that every new entity joining the LACChain Alliance has something different to contribute,” Allende said.      Previously, a number of LatAm-based developers, dubbed LatamLink, who work on the open-source EOSIO code, had been successful in pitching LACChain on enterprise and government-level use cases in the region.

42433747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4kBh,1614285776,I’m an Artist. Should I Make an NFT?,"If you are an artist besieged by the sudden interest in non-fungible tokens, you might be wondering if you should dip your toes in the crypto art pond. Is it difficult to do? Will you find collectors in this new space or succeed in interesting your current collectors? Will it cheapen your brand to participate in this new world, which seems to be populated chiefly by 3D-rendered naked women and trading cards?      Although the hype is counterbalanced by a great deal of hostility and fear, the fact is that putting a work on the blockchain is a winning action for the artist, and others as well. Join me by doing the following: open an account on Coinbase (or another exchange of your choice), link your bank and transfer in at least $100 in funds. Convert it to ethereum. Open a Metamask account, copy the address from it and go back to Coinbase. Transfer your ethereum to your Metamask wallet. You are now ready to create a piece of crypto art.    Digital mixed-media artist Anne Spalter founded the original digital fine arts programs at Brown University and The Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in the 1990s. She is known for large-scale installations and recent explorations in AI and crypto art.    I’m enumerating all these steps to show that although it's tedious, it's not as incomprehensible as some would make it sound.      Once you “mint” a piece – the NFT word for adding it to the blockchain – anyone can see the work (imagine Instagram but with purchasing capabilities). But although anyone can see the piece and link to it or even download it, it is only owned by one person at a time. Its blockchain instantiation is an un-misplace-able certificate of authenticity. This ownership, the purchase price and any subsequent owners and acquisition prices are visible and travel with the piece. This contributes to a level of market transparency that has never existed in the traditional art world.      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      Now someone buys the work! The person is excited to see quality fine art being offered and you get a good price. Unlike in the traditional art world where you may be paid in a week or a month or not at all, with NFTs you receive the funds instantly into your crypto wallet. Speaking as a long-time artist from that gallery world, it’s hard to convey the relief and excitement this can provide.      And it gets better. Your initial collector gets an offer on the work (remember it’s always visible) and decides to sell. Boom: 10% or more of the resale value instantly appears in your wallet (with most services). The first time this happened to me I almost cried.      This new form factor is especially convenient for works that are 3D or motion-based because those are difficult to sell as physical objects and seem happiest in their native digital space online. You also avoid issues of shipping and customs, and the work can be viewed from anywhere.      See also: It’s an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?      Is it all non-stop happiness? No, there are some downsides. Your work is tossed into a vast sea of other pieces, so you still need to bring it to the attention of potential collectors. Unlike a commercial bank site that can reset your password with a phone call, if you lose your wallet login information your money and any artworks owned are gone forever. There are strange fees called “gas” associated with every Ethereum transaction and they can rapidly add up. Recent calculations of the electricity used to create and keep track of each piece of crypto art are depressing. (Although companies are working hard on solutions to lessen this impact.)      On balance, I would still recommend trying out this new world. Tokenizing a work (putting it on the blockchain as described above) does not imply a transfer of any intellectual rights. You can still print the work and show it physically. The most you have to lose is some time and a gas fee. And, last but not least, the realm of crypto artists is an unusually friendly community. If you do join, please make an effort to keep it that way.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Anne Spalter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/25/im-an-artist-should-i-make-an-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b0424bc039ed373e0692d8c29f90464c9f91ad-1416x803.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That means the bulk of volume has shifted in recent years toward institutional customers, mirroring the broader industry shift as more big investors nose into crypto markets. But the growth rates of volume from each demographic remained roughly equal in the past year.      In the fourth quarter of 2019, Coinbase reported $5 billion in retail trading volume matched with $9 million in institutional volume. Fast forward to the fourth quarter of 2020 and the exchange reported $32 billion in retail volume – a 540% increase – matched with $57 billion from institutional clients, a 533% increase.      The shift toward more institutional business is reflected in recent reports of Coinbase serving as the agent or middleman for several high-profile bitcoin purchases. The company has assisted corporate investors including the business intelligence company MicroStrategy and the electric-vehicle maker Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, who has tweeted favorably about cryptocurrencies.      The second quarter of 2019 marked the first time Coinbase reported institutional trading volume exceeding retail volume since early 2018.

Meanwhile, the U.S. exchange Coinbase filed financial disclosures that could be one of the final steps before a public stock listing.      The largest cryptocurrency gained for the second straight day, easing concern that a big sell-off earlier this week might have further to go. Prices fell 15% on Monday and Tuesday, the biggest two-day correction in 11 months, and some analysts were quick to warn of the potential for a drop as low as $40,000.      “We believe the recent sell-off puts the market on sounder footing,” David Grider, director of digital asset strategy for FundStrat, wrote in a weekly report.      Bitcoin was changing hands at $49,472 at press time, up 1.95% over the past 24 hours, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.      The No. 1 cryptocurrency’s price went as high as $52,076.32 in the past 24 hours, after more than 13,000 BTC, worth roughly $650 million, were moved out of institution-focused Coinbase Pro exchange Wednesday afternoon. This move is usually a bullish sign for the markets, reflecting institutional investors’ support to bitcoin’s long-term value, as they move their bitcoin to custody wallets.      Read More: Bitcoin Outflows From Coinbase Suggest Institutions Are Buying the Dip      The regulatory filing by Coinbase also appeared to trigger a brief additional price pop of about $1,500, though some of those gains later reversed.      The Coinbase filing represents ""another positive move forward for our industry,"" Matt Blom, of the publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Thursday in his daily newsletter.      ""The onus is on the bears,"" Blom wrote. ""Failure to attack the market now is a clear sign that we will move back toward our all-time high.""      U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday, as investors worried about a recent rise in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Some analysts in traditional markets have predicted that rising yields, often a precursor of inflation, might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, which could send stocks lower. The potential impact of the surging bond yields on bitcoin, though, is still under debate among analysts and investors in crypto markets.      “It seems much of the narrative around the market, both crypto and traditional, have started to revolve around the inflation narrative,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, said. Rising bond yields “could mean that the market could go into more of a risk-off mode on equities. On the other hand, it is possible that the inflation narrative actually benefits bitcoin, as well as other commodities and real assets.”      “Regardless of whether inflation actually materializes or not, the fact bitcoin today has surged at all highlights the market is beginning to understand, and buy into, the value proposition,"" Artur Sapek, general manager at Kraken-owned crypto trading platform Cryptowatch.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/25/bitcoin-bulls-back-in-control-as-market-correction-seems-like-old-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d3a6a482eed680bc1913febfbd88290ebff6d54-1200x587.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4kHh,1614275151,Blockchain Bites: Coinbase's Impressive Numbers,"This article is excerpted from Blockchain Bites, a daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At stake    Institutions, confirmed      You may have heard the line about this being a different type of bitcoin boom.      In 2017, as bitcoin reached nearly $20,000, retail investors dominated the scene (and often lost their shirts in poorly regulated initial coin offerings). This time, the boom is more broad-based. It is banks and companies like Tesla and Square that are fueling the surge, along with high-profile names including Elon Musk and Paul Tudor Jones.      Coinbase's S-I IPO document, released today, backs up the notion, showing that institutional money accounts for an ever-higher percentage of the exchange's deal flow. In Q4 2020, institutions traded $57 billion worth of crypto compared to just $32 billion from retail investors. In Q4 2019, the split was just $9 billion to $5 billion.      Coinbase was a success story even before this institutional interest. But now it looks like a winner across the markets. It really couldn't find a better time to be going public.    Sound bites    Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the Hong Kong-based FTX exchange, joined First Mover this morning to discuss the outlook for crypto trading businesses.      The 28-year-old described Coinbase's mooted $100 billion valuation as very high based on its 2020 revenue. But he said it could be justified if the trading volumes we've seen so far in 2021 continue. Each trade means more revenue on Coinbase's balance sheet.      FTX has discussed going public internally and has no immediate plans as yet. But Coinbase and other imminent initial public offerings are driving interest.      ""A lot of players in the crypto space right now are at least trying to understand what’s involved in that process [of going public]. And the Coinbase valuation is one driver of that,” he said.      Watch the full interview here.    Other stories    Coinbase S-1      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has published Coinbase's S-1 filing, clearing the way for the crypto bellwether to go public on Nasdaq. Publication ""provides the first public view of its financial performance and how it intends to use the funds it raises,"" says CoinDesk's Nik De. The company generated net income of $322.3 million in 2020, with CEO Brian Armstrong taking home almost $60 million.       Digital dollar preconditions      With U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying 2021 is crucial year for the development of a U.S. digital currency, the Fed issued a working paper outlining key requirements. Privacy issues, ease of use, security access and delivery mechanisms should all be on the table as Fed officials work to “sharpen” a digital dollar with the public’s help, the paper said.      NFTs marry DeFi      With non-fungible tokens getting a good deal of market buzz, decentralized finance is entering the scene. A new service called NFTfi allows borrowers to post digital collectibles (like NFT artworks) as collateral, earning yield in the process. The project is just one example of a marriage between NFTs and DeFi, says Brady Dale, CoinDesk senior reporter.

China has become a global leader in the CBDC space, with the country’s biggest cities joining pilot programs this year. The U.S., meanwhile, is taking a much slower approach.      At Thursday’s press conference, Lee said China’s CBDC pilot will have little impact on South Korea’s well-established won-based payments system.      But the country has been working on its own CBDC for a while now. Lee announced the Bank of Korea had been exploring a CBDC in 2018.      In 2020, the nation’s central bank formed a legal panel to advise on how a digital currency might be launched. Later in the year, the bank announced that a CBDC pilot will take place in late 2021. Earlier this month, the bank published research showing a CBDC can be recognized as a legal fiat currency instead of a virtual asset.      Appearing before the National Assembly Strategy and Finance Committee on Tuesday, Lee said the CBDC pilot will be modified, and promised improvements to institutional and technical research, CoinDesk Korea reported.    ‘No intrinsic value’    CoinDesk Korea also reported that at the National Assembly on Tuesday Lee was somewhat bewildered by the recent bitcoin price run.      ""It is difficult to understand why the price of bitcoin is so expensive. U.S. Treasury Secretary [Janet] Yellen also warned against cryptocurrency investment,"" Lee said at the assembly.      “A crypto asset (cryptocurrency) is an asset that has no intrinsic value,” Lee also said.      He is not the only government official to express a wariness of cryptocurrency. Secretary Yellen has repeatedly warned in recent weeks about the use of cryptocurrencies to fund terrorist activities. Meanwhile, the governments of India and Nigeria are cracking down on local crypto markets. Shaktikanta Das, the governor of India’s central bank, said Wednesday the bank is worried about the risks cryptocurrencies pose to financial stability.      In 2017, at a government assembly, Lee rejected the classification of crypto assets as currencies, saying they are a kind of commodity. The following year, CoinDesk reported Lee still thought cryptocurrencies are not a legal form of currency.      However, at Tuesday’s event Lee acknowledged potential reasons for the recent mainstream appeal of bitcoin as an investment.      “As I understand it, the massive bitcoin rally is the result of various factors such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's purchase of a massive quantity, investors who see it as a hedge against inflation and some financial institutions beginning to offer bitcoin trading brokerage services.""

42433749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4kFh,1614270450,Coinbase Lists Unmasking of Bitcoin's Creator Among Business Risks,"Leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase identified some unique business risks in its prospectus released Thursday, including competition from decentralized finance (DeFi) and the potential discovery of the real identity of Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.    Per its prospectus, Coinbase noted that ""the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s Bitcoins"" as a risk factor.  The exchange did not elaborate on how unmasking Satoshi would affect its business. However, in May, for example, the cryptocurrency market was briefly rattled by on-chain data that coins possibly belonging to Nakamoto had moved, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  The list also included ""negative perception of Bitcoin or Ethereum"" and ""unpredictable social media coverage or 'trending' of crypto assets"" as risk factors.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) was also included as a risk. Coinbase said, ""We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business may be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively against them.""  Coinbase specifically names DeFi protocols including Ethereum, Tron, Polkadot, and Solana in explaining risks from DeFi growth.  Indeed, the growth in DeFi trading has been remarkable, with aggregate volumes setting new record highs in January above $50 billion, per CoinDesk's prior reporting.  Other identified risks are more standard, including the company's revenue being ""substantially dependent"" on the categorically volatile prices of digital assets, and the potential for platform security breaches, and ongoing as well as potential future litigation individuals or government regulators.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires stock issuers to identify the biggest risks to their business before and after going public, and the ""risk factors section"" of the prospectus and annual or quarterly report is staple reading for educated investors. Companies tend to err on the side of caution, including risks some may consider remote.  While there has been much speculation about the person, or persons, behind the Satoshi handle, the identity of Bitcoin's creator has never been conclusively determined, and media reports claiming to have solved the mystery have been roundly debunked.  As a sort of winking homage to Nakamoto, Coinbase included the Bitcoin network address associated with the cryptocurrency's creator in the ""copies to"" field of its prospectus, alongside lawyers and the like.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/25/coinbase-lists-unmasking-of-bitcoins-creator-among-business-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8112e2fe4df922fdee3d79fe3efbabf297634b29-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Launched in 2019, 1inch routes trading orders for Ethereum-based tokens (and now BSC tokens) through dozens of integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to get the best prices. It’s one of the largest DEX aggregators by trading volumes with some $450 million traded in the past 24 hours, according to Dune Analytics.      “The 1INCH token on Binance Smart Chain will be used for a bridge between the Binance and Ethereum networks,” a blog post shared with CoinDesk reads. “1inch users will get access to PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, StreetSwap, Venus, StableSwap, JulSwap, BakerySwap and other Binance-based DEXes and lending protocols.”      Bukov said Binance did not pay for the integration, but did participate in the startup’s seed round in August.    Read more: PancakeSwap Brings Whopping DeFi Volumes to Binance Smart Chain    1inch was forced to move onto BSC, 1inch CTO Anton Bukov told CoinDesk in a Telegram message, “because Ethereum miners killed the Ethereum network by not raising the block gas limit.”      Stepping back, each block on Ehtereum has an upper bound on how much gas can be used. That number has moved up a few times since the blockchain’s inception in 2015 depending on a few factors such as the uncle block rate, state size growth and transaction fee pressure. Historically high fees have garnered support for increasing the gas rate from application developers. It’s unlikely to happen, however, as a large increase in the Ethereum state size would further the risk of a denial of service (DoS) attack.      Many applications are looking elsewhere as the gas cap is unlikely to move. Some apps, such as Synthetix and dYdX, have chosen Ethereum-based rollups – a technology that bundles and processes transactions on Ethereum. Others are looking for alternative Layer 1 homes such as Compound Finance’s Compound Chain.      “BSC just has 10 times more gas every minute,” he added. “We are exploring what is really interesting for DeFi users.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/25/defi-exchange-1inch-expands-to-binance-smart-chain-citing-eth-gas-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/735db8601ff098ab40ef10c2fb69424a197812c3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQi23,1614264313,11 Projects Building a Strong Foundation Beneath the Marriage of DeFi and NFTs,"Digital collectibles on blockchains are driving the retail mania for crypto higher right now, in part because they are cool and in part because the market seems to have finally come to this consensus: Provable ownership of digital items can accrue real value.      When there is real value, there is finance. These collectibles, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), have proven lately to have very high values.      “NFTs are a foundational building block of the emerging virtual economy,"" Stephen Young, the founder and CEO of NFTfi, said in a press release.      The latest data point in the ongoing story of the marriage of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) is the new funding for NFTfi, a project that allows borrowers to post digital items as collateral. NFTfi announced Thursday an $890,000 investment round from backers including CoinFund, 1kx, The LAO and Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou, among others.      NFTfi is one of several companies making it a lot easier to get money in, earn yield and get it back out of the digital collectible space.    How it works    NFTfi is basically like DeFi giants Compound and Aave, both money markets, but those two use fungible collateral, like ETH or various stablecoins. NFTs are non-fungible and they are markets with less liquidity in them, making price discovery trickier.      That's changing fast with more and more products coming onto the market making it easier for liquidity to flow through the many creations. And remember, this is crypto: Changing fast means a wildly different thing in this industry than in the pokey old world of mobile phones and social networks.      ""As NFTs re-imagined how we produce and define ownership of digital content online, we’ll also, in turn, begin to re-imagine a whole new category of financial services based on these new building blocks,"" Lasse Clausen, a partner at the venture firm 1kx, said in a press release.      Beyond NFTfi, here are 10 more projects that are making the NFT market nearly as complex, flexible and liquid as the rest of crypto:    NIFTEX    The startup, whose platform makes fractional ownership of NFTs possible, is working on a new version with lots of new features. For example, it will be able to allow creators to earn royalties on trades of fractions, governance over the underlying NFTs for holders of a fraction and other tools that allow for more fine-grained ownership. Also, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is coming to govern the whole application. ""Fractional ownership of songs, books, other content is a no-brainer. One edition, lots of owners, uniqueness is king,"" co-founder Joel Hubert told CoinDesk in an email.    Ark Gallery    This company created a DAO that built wrapped CryptoPunks, which made Larva Labs' pioneering NFTs more fungible. Ark has subsequently created additional tools to enhance liquidity for the original non-fungible token, and probably deserves some credit for today's white-hot CryptoPunks market. It is currently working on Blank.Art. ""We will launch NFT projects that are appropriating financial concepts and themes for artistic purposes,"" Ark's Roberto Ceresia told CoinDesk in an email.    Mintbase    Mintbase is a platform that makes it easy to mint non-fungible tokens. It had an investment round recently led by Sino Global. Obviously it primarily enables users to mint on Ethereum, but the NEAR blockchain has gone out of its way to be compatible with the original smart-contract chain. Right now, Mintbase is launching a feature on NEAR that allows royalties on sales to be shared with up to 1,000 people. ""That really is the fractional ownership part everyone is talking about,"" COO Carolin Wend told CoinDesk.    NFTX    This one enables community-owned index funds so that one token represents ownership in many NFTs. It has tokens for specific categories of NFTs and others that represent a spectrum of the market. ""There are, however, many people out there that don’t have the time or knowledge to trade individual NFTs but would like exposure to NFT markets. These are the NFTX target users,"" the firm wrote in January.    Charged Particles    This protocol aims to enable any NFT to be wrapped or embedded with an ERC-20 token. So just in case there was any doubt an NFT had value, a user could wrap it with interest-earning tokens, such as the Aave tokens, and it would have value beyond any doubt. This is basically the same as what the forthcoming Aavegotchi game is doing. What will it mean for non-fungible and fungible assets to become roommates? Time will tell.    Zora Protocol    According to its white paper, ""Zora provides a cryptographically enforced registry of media independent of any platform."" One of Zora's creators, Jacob Horne, told CoinDesk in an email, ""We've directly built the market into the NFT, and we've created a net new auction model specific to NFTs. Zora auctions are perpetual, anyone can bid in any currency, the owner can accept any bid."" If that sounds head-scratching, check out this new genre of poetry built with the help of the Zora team.    Unifty    ""Unifty is an NFT management system. Think of it as 'the WordPress of NFTs,'"" Markus Medinger of the Unifty team told CoinDesk in an email. Unifty has a marketplace coming with new features around copyright management and value drops, among others. The platform is somewhat unique in that it largely functions off Ethereum. ""We already support xDai, BSC [Binance Smart Chain], Polygon [née Matic], Celo and Moonbeam Alpha. Multi-chain support is actually one of our expertise,"" Medinger added.    Upshot    This is an as-yet-unreleased project for crowdsourcing NFT appraisals. ""The next step for financialization is solving the NFT price discovery problem in a capital efficient way,"" CoinFund's Jake Brukhman told CoinDesk.    NFT Trader    A peer-to-peer trading project for NFTs, still in beta. Be careful!    Polyient Games    This group is all over NFT financialization, from investing in the sector to building tools to make it more robust. It runs a decentralized exchange for NFTs, has its own approach to fractional ownership and also has products built for NFT security. The company is teasing a game now that promises to make DeFi more game-like. ""Polyient Games is our decentralized ecosystem designed to drive forward NFT innovation, both internally and via third-party participation,"" Craig Russo, one of the co-founders, told CoinDesk in an email.    State of the market    The original DeFi players have not made a lot of noise directly around NFTs yet. Scott Lewis of DeFi Pulse is involved with NFTX and Aave invested in the video game that uses its tokens, Aavegotchi. “Aave community has enormous interest,” Stani Kulechov, CEO of the money market Aave, told CoinDesk in an email.      Normally this is the part of the post where we'd tell readers just learning about NFTs and DeFi that they should take a very small amount of ETH or stablecoins and just buy some little things and play around. None of this stuff really makes sense until a person tries it. Unfortunately, right now, it's impossible for most people to spend a negligible amount of money in DeFi because transaction fees (""gas,"" in Ethereum parlance) make everything expensive.      Layer 2 platforms are those that sit atop Ethereum and other blockchains, taking advantage of the underlying blockchain's security while also allowing cheaper, faster transactions. NIFTEX's Huber told CoinDesk he foresees layer 2 solutions being very important to this sector, but too little liquidity has moved onto any one layer 2 to make it worthwhile for an app like his to move there yet.      ""Gas has really made it hard to enjoy the DeFi playground on ETH mainnet,"" Marguerite deCourcelle of Blockade Games told CoinDesk. Blockade is in the middle of moving its users to the layer 2 now known as Polygon. ""I think we're about to see a lot more users and developers on L2,"" she said.      If the games go onto layer 2, the financial apps are sure to follow shortly.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/25/11-projects-building-a-strong-foundation-beneath-the-marriage-of-defi-and-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45c68917af208f1cdfab42d45600efa6aedb0e7b-2112x1436.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQhx1,1614262086,US Lawmakers to Examine Crypto's Role in Domestic Terrorism Funding,"Members of Congress on Thursday will discuss whether and how cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems may be used to fund domestic terrorism.      The House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy published additional details about its hearing on domestic terror financing late Wednesday, including witness testimony. While cryptocurrencies won't be the sole fundraising method discussed, their inclusion may indicate lawmakers are giving crypto similar importance as more traditional funding methods, as well as new-but-established tools such as PayPal.      Other government officials have likewise drawn a connection between terrorism and cryptocurrencies recently. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said she is concerned by crypto use by extremists, while members of Congress on the House Select Committee on Intelligence want more information on how extremists might have used streaming platform DLive, a unit of BitTorrent that is tied to the Tron Foundation, which rewards streamers in crypto, to raise or transfer funds using crypto.      The hearing, titled “Dollars Against Democracy: Domestic Terrorist Financing in the Aftermath of Insurrection,” was first announced at the beginning of February, but a hearing memo and witness list weren’t published until Tuesday evening. The hearing was originally planned for Feb. 23, but was rescheduled to Feb. 25 last week.      Lecia Brooks, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in her written testimony that encrypted and decentralized tools are being increasingly used by far-right extremists, especially after they were expelled from more centralized social media and financial technology platforms.      “Not surprisingly, boosted by this new mission and purpose, streaming donations shot through the roof, and some DLive streamers received nearly $44,000 from donations during November and December alone. Some of those same individuals ended up being featured by House impeachment managers as key perpetrators of the violence on January 6 when they once again used DLive to livestream the events inside the Capitol and on the grounds,” she said.      Daniel Rogers, the co-founder and chief technical officer of the Global Disinformation Index, also noted in his written testimony that cryptocurrencies were one tool being used by extremists.    Policy proposals    The hearing webpage listed four proposed bills aimed at boosting the powers of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.      Three of the bills don’t mention crypto specifically, but would allow FinCEN to freeze the financial assets of any individuals arrested on rebellion or insurrection charges, provide classified information to employees of private financial institutions, and require the agency to create educational materials for government agencies on how extremists can use public benefits for fraudulent purposes.      The final proposed bill, titled “The Domestic Terrorism Financing Study Act,” would commission a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study into how crowdfunding platforms, social media and virtual currencies are used to finance illicit activities.      This information could then be used to see how financial institutions and U.S. agencies could track or limit illicit financing.      Read more: State of Crypto: The US Government Keeps Mentioning Terrorism      The act also mentions a transfer of 13.5 bitcoin from a French blogger to wallets linked to far-right figures in the U.S.      To be clear, neither the hearing memo nor the proposed bill singles out cryptocurrencies specifically as a tool used solely for terror purposes, but rather includes them among a list of digital and financial tools.      The SPLC’s Brooks likewise recommends that the Biden administration study how technologies could be used to “detect and prevent online financial harms while preserving human rights.”      “This is especially critical as we anticipate a gradual move to a more decentralized technology landscape that, as we discussed earlier, presents many more challenges for tracking and stopping financial abuse,” she said.      Brooks also recommends that the U.S. central bank increase the number of cryptocurrencies included in its Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) data service, as well as the type of data collected. At present, FRED includes pricing data for only five assets, but that could be expanded to include transaction data and information on wallet companies, mixing services and mining platforms.      The government should not create a new criminal domestic terrorism statute, she said, adding that such a law could harm civil rights.

42386019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQi3J,1614259030,Bitcoin Outflows From Coinbase Suggest Institutions Are Buying the Dip,"Large investors look to be accumulating bitcoin at relatively bargain prices in the wake of the cryptocurrency's recent pullback.      That's the suggestion of outflows of the cryptocurrency from institution-focused Coinbase Pro exchange, which rose to over 13,000 BTC, worth roughly $650 million, on Wednesday. The figure represents the largest movement of bitcoin off the exchange in three weeks, according to data shared by the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.      ""The outflow went to multiple custody wallets, indicating U.S. institutional investors are still buying bitcoin on the dip,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. ""I think it's a bullish signal.""      The exchange's custody wallets are directly integrated with its over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions typically transact over-the-counter to avoid influencing spot market prices. Hence, outflows from Coinbase Pro that end up in its cold wallets for custody are taken to represent institutional activity.      The latest pickup in outflows is a sign that institutions remain undeterred by the recent price pullback and are confident about cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.      Bitcoin tanked from record highs above $58,000 to $45,000 early this week in a typical bull market correction. The cryptocurrency has largely traded the range of $48,000 to $51,500 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Spikes in outflows from Coinbase Pro have consistently marked interim bottoms (the end of price pullbacks and the start of reversals higher) throughout the cryptocurrency's four-month bull run from $10,000 to $58,000. If history is a guide, bitcoin could soon begin the next leg higher.      On a more cautionary note, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets of continued monetary stimulus on Tuesday and Wednesday. So far, however, that has failed to put brakes on the rally in U.S. bond yields. Notably, the 10-year Treasury yield has now jumped to a fresh 12-month high of 1.45%, according to data source TradingView.      Also read: Planning to Short Bitcoin? Better Check China’s ‘Tether Premium’ First      A continue rise in yields could stabilize stock markets, inviting selling pressure for bitcoin, as noted by trader and analyst Alex Kruger.

""We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve profitability or achieve positive cash flow from operations on a consistent basis, which may cause our business, operating results, and financial condition to be adversely impacted,"" the firm stated in the filing, adding:    ""For instance, although we generated net income of $322.3 million in 2020, we incurred a net loss of $30.4 million in 2019.""    Coinbase also confirmed that it is using Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Securities and Citigroup to ""assist us with respect to certain matters relating to our listing.""

42386012,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQi0n,1614253798,"Bitcoin 'Too Volatile' to Be Global Medium of Exchange, Says Berkshire's Charlie Munger","The 97-year-old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway dismissed bitcoin during a Q&A session Wednesday, calling it ""too volatile"" to be considered a global medium of exchange.      At the Daily Journal's annual meeting hosted by Yahoo Finance, Charlie Munger was asked by a member of the audience what he saw as the biggest competitive threat to U.S. banks over the long term.      The question, centered on the potential technological disruption from the likes of Amazon and Apple Pay, digital wallets and bitcoin, prompted Munger to respond that he did not know how the payments system would evolve.      The Berkshire executive said, though, he didn't think bitcoin would end up as the world's medium of exchange, calling it an ""artificial substitute for gold.""      ""Since I never buy any gold, I never buy any bitcoin,"" Munger said. ""I recommend other people follow my practice.""      The Daily Journal Corporation - the U.S. publishing company chaired by Munger – has equity stakes in Bank of America and U.S. Bank.      ""I do think that a properly run bank is a great contributor to civilization and that the central banks of the world like controlling their own banking system and their own money supplies,” he said.      Munger then went on to paraphrase an Oscar Wilde quote on fox hunting, saying bitcoin reminded him of those who buy the nascent asset class as ""the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.""      Multiple questions relating to bitcoin were posed during the almost two-hour-long session. Asked whether his opinion on cryptocurrencies had remained the same or if the Daily Journal would consider bitcoin as an asset on the balance sheet, similar to Tesla's recent investment, Munger summarily dismissed the possibility.      ""No, we will not be following Tesla into bitcoin,"" he said.

According to a Feb. 19 notice from Blockchain Australia (BCA), it issued a summons to Qoin on Jan. 29, asking Qoin to respond.      BCA said that, after reviewing Qoin's response and the ""circumstances of the matter,"" it terminated the project's membership, meaning that Qoin must cease using of the Blockchain Australia logo and name in connection with its business or promotional activities.      BCA aims to ""advance the adoption of blockchain technology throughout Australia,"" according to its website. It also provides members operating in the local industry an air of legitimacy.      When asked for specific reasons behind BCA's decision to remove its membership, Qoin chief marketing officer Andrew Barker told CoinDesk the firm had not received ""any extra documentation pinpointing any example.""      A ""formal"" public response to the notice posted Wednesday by Qoin, though, alleges the notice from BCA included ""false allegations"" around ""communication and disclosures"" on the project's website.      ""The timing ... aligns with the emergence of false and misleading comments ... made by certain antagonists on social media platforms including a previous board member,"" Qoin said in the post.      Some reports have suggested that the former BCA board member is Nuggets News CEO Alex Saunders, who alleged in a tweet that Qoin is the ""biggest crypto scam"" in Australia two days before BCA's notice was served.      Barker said that, while ""some have drawn that conclusion,"" because of the timing of the notice and because of Saunders' prior role, Qoin did not know that ""as a fact.""      ""We considered this notice a premeditated attack against Qoin,"" the project alleged in its post. It also claimed that during the period of its response and the final notice ""no questions were raised"" nor ""updates given"" by BCA.      Barker further alleged BCA had chosen to edit out three lines of the document that was forwarded to Qoin in the notice that was made public. He would not disclose the lines, saying the BCA should provide them.

42386002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQhtF,1614236458,Germany’s Solarisbank Launches Licensed Crypto Brokerage,"German fintech firm Solarisbank is building on its regulated crypto custody service with a brokerage and trading application programming interface (API).      Solarisbank, which provides Sumsung, among other companies, with a range of APIs for digital banking and payments, announced Thursday it will offer fiat-to-crypto trading and instant settlement from within its custody solution.      “We started with custody and now the next step is the brokerage API,” Julian Grigo, managing director at Solarisbank Digital Assets, said in an interview. “Our B2B customers will be able to get a bank account, store crypto and with the brokerage API, they can swap or exchange their fiat money to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.”      Custody is the first step into crypto for large regulated firms, which has been happening recently with the likes of BNY Mellon and Standard Chartered making announcements. Germany is one of the few places to offer a special crypto custody license via the financial regulator BaFIN. This has driven a hotbed of innovation with firms like Solarisbank and custody provider Finoa leading the pack.      There’s a strong pipeline for crypto services, said Grigo, pointing to non-crypto businesses tapping into the world of digital assets.      “We are building the rails for the institutional or the retail investor,” he said. “We see this in the U.S. with Square, or in the U.K. with Revolut. What’s happening globally is also happening in the German market, and we definitely see this demand.”    Read more: German Bank Launches Digital Assets Unit to Offer Custody Products    Thanks to a close partnership with Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, Solarisbank is touting “in-custody” brokerage and instant settlement. U.K.-based BCB Group (which also works with Bitstamp) offers a similar instant settlement network with banking from ClearBank.      This type of blockchain-enabled instantaneous swapping of crypto and fiat completely avoids the sorts of vagaries seen in the recent case of Robinhood and GameStop.      “It’s quite depressing to see some brokers in the crypto ecosystem copying and repeating this batched delivery of the real assets, like the old T+2 delivery of the stock market into the crypto market,” Gigo said. “But the blockchain never sleeps, and so we have instant settlement within our platform.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/25/germanys-solarisbank-launches-licensed-crypto-brokerage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d64225db646c778ba9eb8d9d635e44b16c30026-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQhoD,1614212467,Nvidia Estimates Ethereum Miners Contributed 2%-6% of Q4 Revenue,"Nvidia (NVDA) says Ethereum mining activity contributed very little to its Q4 2020 revenue.      Although it lacks ""the ability to accurately track or quantify” the end uses of its graphic processing units (GPUs), Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company estimates that between $100 million and $300 million – a ""relatively small portion"" – of Q4 revenue came from Ethereum miners buying GPUs to use in their mining equipment.      Nvidia reported a total of $5 billion in revenue for the Q4, implying mining sales represented 2%-6% of the total.      Ethereum’s hash rate has grown 124% in the past year, according to data from Coin Metrics, in tandem with the general cryptocurrency market’s rally. This has driven demand for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, much to the dismay of the company's gaming customers.      Nvidia said earlier this week it's altering its GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card to limit its own efficiency if the card detects it's being used for Ethereum mining, a move designed to ensure GPU supply is available to gamers. “We would like GPUs to end up with gamers,” Kress said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday.      In the future, though, miner-contributed revenue for Nvidia is likely to come from another of the company's products. To serve the mining community, the company is launching Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMPs), which are “optimized to improve Ethereum mining” and will give the company “more visibility” into the share of revenue contributed by cryptocurrency miners, Kress said.      Nvidia plans to sell its new CMPs to industrial Ethereum miners and expects the mining-specific product to generate roughly $50 million in revenue during its first quarter of sales. Nvidia also plans to quantify miner revenue contributions in all future quarterly earnings reports.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/25/nvidia-estimates-ethereum-miners-contributed-2-6-of-q4-revenue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fdec8ec82f015c92ad42adb9f14635c3eda7574-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
