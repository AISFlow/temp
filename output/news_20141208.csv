42398050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVvB,1418079326,"SEC Fines Defunct Bitcoin Exchange Operator $68,000","The operator of two unlicensed digital currency exchanges has been ordered to pay more than $68,000 after a lengthy investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the country's top securities regulator.  Ethan Burnside was the sole owner and operator of BTC Trading Corp, parent company of platforms BTCT Co and Litecoin Global Exchange (LTC Global) from August 2012 until trading and account activity ceased in October 2013. The amount Burnside will pay is equal to all profits he made from the exchanges, in addition to the fine.  Burnside cooperated with the SEC investigation and agreed to settle the case by paying $58,307.07 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest, plus a penalty of $10,000. He is also banned from working in the securities industry for two years, after which he will be able to re-apply to conduct business in the sector.  The SEC claimed BTCT Co had 7,959 registered accounts and had executed approximately 366,490 trades, while LTC Global had 2,655 accounts and processed around 60,496 trades. Further, 52 issuers entered into contracts to list their shares with LTC Global, while 69 issuers entered into contracts to list with BTCT Co.  The filing reads:  ""None of the issuers registered a class of securities with the Commission under the Exchange Act, and none of the issuers registered an offering of securities with the Commission under the Securities Act.""  The issuers paid 11,450 LTC and 210 BTC in listing fees, respectively.  At the time LTC Global launched, 1 LTC was worth $0.02, compared to $3.62 at press time. When BTCT Co launched a few months later, the price of bitcoin was $12.56, a substantially lower price than the $365 observed today.  The SEC filing indicated that Burnside cooperated with its investigation, helping translate data and retaining financial audit experts to form reports.  Lawyers' statement  Burnside was represented in the case by law firm Angeli Ungar Law Group of Portland, Oregon, who put out a statement after the conclusion saying they and their client were pleased the SEC had approved the settlement.  That statement said Burnside had advised Angeli Ungar as soon as he learned of the investigation, and stated his intention to do everything possible to protect BTC Trading website users. It also reiterated that he cooperated fully with the SEC.  ""Throughout the investigation, Burnside fully cooperated with the Commission staff, providing early and substantial assistance. He made himself available to Commission staff upon request ... and he retained financial audit experts to assist in the generation and formatting of reports in order to enable staff to quickly ascertain the scope and operation of his enterprises. Burnside’s efforts facilitated the staff’s investigation involving an emerging technology.""  Since the SEC investigation began, it added, bitcoin-based transactions have become increasingly prominent in the mainstream financial, political and regulatory conversation on virtual currencies. Burnside had ""appreciated the opportunity"" to share his understanding of bitcoin with the SEC despite the obvious challenge of the investigation.  Unregistered exchanges  According to the SEC filing, the two companies were ""unregistered, online, virtual currency-denominated securities exchanges and broker-dealers"" that sold and traded shares in digital currency companies using only bitcoin and litecoin.  BTC Trading Corp is registered in Belize, and is the owner of both LTC Global and BTCT Co, neither of which was an incorporated entity or registered with the SEC in any capacity.  Also mentioned was Burnside's litecoin mining business LTC Mining, in which he sold shares between July and September 2012.  ""Any individual or group was permitted to open an account and access the websites’ services after completing an online registration form. The only information required for registration was a valid email address, which allowed users of each website to maintain a certain level of anonymity. Registration was free. Once registered, users could view their account history and balance online,"" he filing reads.  In addition, the filing accused Burnside of soliciting users of the Bitcoin Talk forum to enroll in the service.  Trial of action  The SEC has for some time now been pursuing digital currency exchanges and investment platforms that have failed to register or comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The agency suspended trading of Imogo Mobile Technologies Corp in early 2014, and in a memorable email exchange said it was investigating exchange MPEx owner Mircea Popescu over the sale of popular gambling site SatoshiDICE for over $11.5m in bitcoin.  An SEC investor alert in May 2014 warned that bitcoin-based investments had a ""heightened risk of fraud"" and posed a risk to inexperienced investors rushing to embrace cutting-edge technologies. A previous warning cautioned investors of potential Ponzi schemes and other investment scams, while a separate bulletin from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) warned ""Bitcoin: More than a Bit Risky"".  Even if investment platforms are not outright scams, the warnings suggested, their unlicensed nature mean their operators do not fulfill the strict disclosure, net worth or income requirements with which 'traditional' investment companies needed to comply in order to do business.

42398059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW24,1418078125,Bitmarkets Launches Decentralised Bitcoin Marketplace With Tor Support,"A new decentralised marketplace called Bitmarkets has launched, with privacy-preserving features, a novel escrow system and a requirement for vendors and customers to transact in bitcoin.  Bitmarkets is designed to operate over anonymity-preserving network Tor from the start. This is unlike the much talked abouthttps://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/blob/master/README.md decentralised market, OpenBazaar, that launched without native Tor support.  The creators of Bitmarkets, a group of four developers and designers, said they integrated Tor because they believe privacy is a ""basic human right"".  ""We don't like the possibility of a world where every transaction you make over your entire lifetime will be tracked,"" said Steve Dekorte, the lead developer on the project. ""We feel this is a basic human rights issue.""  Both Bitmarkets and OpenBazaar are open-source efforts. The latter launched in August, but only began working to allow users to connect over Tor in Octoberhttps://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/pull/860.  OpenBazaar has gained traction among developers and users. There are no official statistics kept on the number of its merchants or customers, but a crawler written by a user called Bizarre Co Browse shows that the marketplace currently hosts 164 stores selling 289 products.  Some 58 developers have contributed code to OpenBazaar, according to the project's official blog.  Bitmarkets has a lot of catching up to do. It was first made available for public download for Mac OS X in November, and it only has a handful of listings.  Lean escrow system  Bitmarkets' escrow system could make it more attractive to users, however. OpenBazaar's is different in that it works with three parties consisting of the buyer, seller and a trusted third-party. Funds can only be released if two of those three parties sign off on a multi-signature account.  Bit markets cuts all the fat out of a transaction, relying solely on the buyer and seller. Sellers have to 'lock' in funds equal to the price of the item being sold. Buyers do the same, but lock double the amount. The locked funds are held in escrow in their Bitmarkets wallets. When a transaction is completed smoothly, the locked amounts are released and the seller is paid.  By Dekorte's reckoning, a three-party system is open to abuse because bad actors can game reputation systems to make themselves look trustworthy and could collude with a buyer or seller, for example.  ""Two-party escrow ensures that both parties have an economic incentive to complete the transaction without the need for a trusted third party,"" he said.  One drawback of Bitmarket's structure is that the price tag for any individual item can't be too high, or the deposit requirements will be too heavy for a buyer. Bitmarket's lack of a reputation system also means that it's not suited for real-world transactions – like, say, an on-demand car service – because either party could coerce the other into releasing the locked funds.  As a result of those limitations, Dekorte recommends that Bitmarket be used only for transactions up to the equivalent of $500.  Decentralised markets could grow  Sam Patterson, who leads quality assurance at OpenBazaar, said the two-party system could work well with experienced bitcoin users who are zealous about cutting out middle-men in their transactions. He warned, however, that some users wanted transactions with someone they could appeal to should something go wrong.  ""The public at large also wants to feel secure in their trade,"" he said. ""[With a three-party system] if there's a problem, they have someone to turn to for help. The two-party escrow system doesn't have anyone to turn to if something goes wrong.""  Bitmarkets was developed as a part-time project over nine months. Much of the application relies on pulling together the capabilities of existing systems, such as Tor and BitMessage, a peer-to-peer messaging system. Bitcoin, of course, is used to settle transactions.  Four people developed Bitmarkets, including Dekorte; Chris Robinson, who designed the minimalistic, white-on-black user interface; Rich Collins, who integrated bitcoin payments; and Adam Thorson, who worked on building on top of BitMessage and Tor.  Whether Bitmarkets or OpenBazaar succeed in fulfilling the potential for decentralised markets remains to be seen. But more attention is being focused on the area, and for OpenBazaar's Patterson, it's only a matter of time before a decentralised solution trumps existing marketplaces.  ""Once a market offers a simple way to control your own trade online, people will begin using it because it's a better product. Much like bitcoin, it won't be an overnight process, but it will happen eventually,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/08/bitmarkets-launches-decentralised-bitcoin-marketplace-with-tor-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91428a04d0d62a016491e62a25bf5ced1cf54784-1422x454.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uZZ,1418074525,Emerging Startups Take Stage at Latin American Bitcoin Conference 2014,"The second annual Latin American Bitcoin Conference took place in Rio de Janeiro this weekend, drawing 37 speakers and more than 200 attendees from 6th to 7th December.  The wide range of speakers at the event included bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, BitPay’s Toni Gallippi, BitGive’s Connie Gallippi, Bitreserve’s Juan Llanos and Ethereum’s Anthony Di Iorio.  Latin America  provided a complex backdrop for the event, as many countries in the region face a mixture of social, political and economic pressures. In turn, bitcoin development has been impacted by this uncertainty, even as Brazil and Argentina look to lead the region's industry into a new wave of growth.  Bitcoin Argentina’s Rodolfo Andragnes, one of the organiser's behind the event, expressed this optimism about the future of bitcoin in Brazil to CoinDesk, stating:  ""The Brazilian community believes that next year, and thanks to new services, a bigger adoption will be achieved and Brazilians will be prompt to new technologies.""  Though the announcement of bitcoin core developer Sergio Lerner as the latest full-time hire by the Bitcoin Foundation was perhaps the most high-profile news, the event saw a number of smaller developments over its two-day run that showcase bitcoin expanding in a key market.  Two such services, BitInka and Ripio, set their official launch dates during the weekend of the conference, as did the newly established Fundaçao Bitcoin Brasil, a local bitcoin foundation.  Bitcoin invoicing comes to Brazil  Argentinian bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos launched its Ripio service in Brazil at the event.  The expansion builds off the company's similar partnership with mobile phone service TeleRecargas, which allowed it to extend bitcoin buying and selling to roughly 8,000 stores in its home market this August.  However, Ripio will function differently in Brazil, allowing consumers to settle boletos bancários using bitcoin.  A boleto is a government-issued financial document of a specific amount of money to be paid to a merchant by the consumer within a certain period of time. In Brazil, users can select it as a payment option when making purchases online.  There are 48,000 locations nationwide where Brazilians can pay their boletos, including at banks and through online banking. Bitcoin users are now able to pay with the digital currency by registering an account with Ripio and submitting their invoices through the platform.  ""For BitPagos, Brazil is one of the most important markets. It’s the largest country in population and GDP of the region and is the fifth largest smartphone market in the world,"" BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano said. ""A big part of our focus for 2015 is going to be increasing bitcoin adoption in Brazil and the region.""  BitPagos was also in attendance to participate in the event's Latin American startups panel.  Peru-based wallet and exchange launches  BitInka  launched its novel wallet product officially on Saturday morning.  The bitcoin exchange and wallet service aims to integrate users’ bitcoin finances into daily life by executing all conversions and transactions against its bitcoin price index. Further, it emphasizes fiat currencies, using bitcoin as a means with which to provide a better money sending service.  To send money, the user inputs the amount he would like to send and the currency in which the recipient is meant to receive it. Before confirming the transaction, the application will show the user how much the recipient will receive and the bitcoin price by which that amount is calculated.  The sender bears no cost for the transaction, but the recipient incurs a 1.5% fee.  For example, if a user wants to send $100 in Peruvian nuevo sols (PEN) he would deposit funds by linking his bank account. At press time, $100 equals 295.70 PEN; measured against the BitInka price index it’s 0.27 BTC – making the amount to be received 296.77 PEN, including the deducted 1.5% fee.  “When youre sending money through our platform, you’re actually buying and selling a bitcoin instantly – that's why you have an index,” said founder Roger Benites.  Users must have a bank account to withdraw fiat funds; users without a bank account can hold bitcoin but must be verified. Transactions sending or receiving bitcoin impose no fee.  BitInka operates in Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela and plans to expand to the rest of Latin America.  Bitcoin comic book attracts bidders  The event, however, wasn't all business, as the conference organizers planned a Twitter-based auction of Alex Preukschat and Josep Busquet’s Bitcoin: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto.  Andragnes set the opening price of 0.01 BTC in a tweet using the hashtag #bidcomic. Ten other bidders participated on the social media platform, including Di Iorio and Juan Llanos.    @laBITconf Está genial!!! Quiero mi comic! #bidcomic 0,01 btc      — Rodolfo A.

42377886,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uHx,1418062959,ChangeTip Taps Blockchain Product Manager to Accelerate User Growth,"Just one week after raising $3.5m from an impressive cast of VC firms, bitcoin micropayments startup ChangeTip has announced Dan Held will join its team as VP of product management.  The acquisition will potentially provide ChangeTip with an experienced addition to its growing team, as Held most recently served as a product manager at bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain and formerly co-founded real-time news and market data app ZeroBlock, a startup that was purchased by Blockchain in an undisclosed deal in late 2013.  In an interview regarding the move, Held expressed his intent to help grow ChangeTip's daily active user totals, even amid its recent surge in popularity. The ambitions are notable given the company's claims to have processed 10,000 transactions in a single day.  Held told CoinDesk:  ""I want people to be using ChangeTip on a daily basis for tipping, for paying content creators, for sending money, almost like a Venmo. I really see us being that bitcoin wallet that people use daily.""  Overall, Held lauded the work of his former employer, while acknowledging that the move may have been made on short notice.  ""Blockchain is a really cool company, they have a lot of exciting products and they've stepped up to the major leagues, developing products for potentially millions of users,"" he said.  Held indicated that the transition is indicative of his desire to work for a company that could help bitcoin go mainstream by appealing to a more novice audience. Further, he also cited Blockchain's aim to consolidate its offices outside San Francisco as another reason for his departure.  Blockchain, which most recently raised an industry-record $30.5m this October, reported that overall product management will continue without interruption as employee Keonne Rodriguez has served as product lead for Blockchain’s core product since June.  ""We’d like to thank Dan for his time on the Blockchain team. We wish him the best at ChangeTip as we are excited to see what the team is building there,"" Blockchain CEO Nic Cary told CoinDesk.  Held's last day at Blockchain will be 14th December.  Building momentum  Despite the recent increase in interest surrounding ChangeTip, Held framed the company as a startup that is only just beginning to deliver on its potential.  In particular, he cited the team's recent addition of former Bitcoin Magazine and CoinDesk contributor Victoria van Eyk as its VP of community development as key to the firm's recent success and a sign of the company's momentum.  ""I think ChangeTip has a pretty serious team,"" he said. ""CEO Nick Sullivan and COO John Smith are really, really smart and experienced guys. Victoria and I are more bitcoin-centric, I think we're in a spot where we can identify features and products that people will love to use.""  Held said he met Sullivan at a recent event held by the company and bitcoin API specialist Chain, and that this meeting quickly blossomed into a mutual desire for collaboration.  ""I think a lot of our vision is aligned, and when Nick laid out his vision for ChangeTip, from there on I knew I had to be part of it,"" he explained.  New challenges  Held suggested he has been brought on board by ChangeTip to help it accelerate its growth due to his established history working on consumer-facing bitcoin products. At the time of its purchase, for example, ZeroBlock was the most-reviewed and highest-rated bitcoin app on the Apple iOS App Store.  ""At the core of it, you have to remember that ZeroBlock is an everyday app for a consumer,"" he explained ""So from day one, we thought, 'How do you make an app that's complex, boil down the parts and make a really fun, intuitive user interface where people can use the app?""  Held went on to suggest that ChangeTip will bring a new set of challenges when compared to his most recent position. ""While Blockchain is a wallet, ChangeTip is kind of your hot, hot wallet, it's money in your pocket wallet,"" he said.  While Blockchain strives to educate its users about private key security and other more nuanced facets of bitcoin ownership, Held said, ChangeTip caters to a different audience.  ""With ChangeTip, I'm able to focus on the really fun aspects of bitcoin and that's what's so exciting about it,"" he added.  Ultimately, however, he suggested that he sees long-term potential in the company's approach, concluding:  ""I think that ChangeTip will be one of many companies that make bitcoin go mainstream, and it will be cool to work with them and develop strategies.""

42377899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uX3,1418049124,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Prices Stay Flat While Volume Declines,"The price of bitcoin has registered another flat week with a slight decline, as it opened the week at $378.64 and closed just four dollars down at $374.26 on 7th December.  The biggest intra-day swing was a one-day rally on 5th December that saw the price rise from a low of $365.68 to a high of $378.65, adding $18 over 24 hours.  Trading volume, however, dropped sharply compared with last week, with just over two million coins traded across all exchanges tracked by Bitcoinity. This represented a 42% fall in traded volume compared to the previous week, which saw 3.6 million coins change hands.  While the price of bitcoin over the last two weeks has been flat, traders saw significantly more action in the earlier period, that is, the closing week of November. That week saw an intra-day swing of $35, or double the biggest swing of last week, despite the price closing just $1.85 higher over the seven days. This was supported by robust trading volume that fell just 2.4% compared to the previous period.  Among exchanges, the biggest drops in volume for the week were experienced by OKCoin, Bitfinex and Huobi. Exchanges that gained volume were ANXBTC, Localbitcoins and LakeBTC.  Regular readers may recall last week's Markets Weekly that highlighted Localbitcoins' apparent ascendancy among traders of US dollars and Russian rubles.  More analysis of the peer-to-peer marketplace for bitcoins was offered this week by sometime cryptocurrency analyst Tuur Demeester, who edits the Dutch financial newsletter MacroTrends. Demeester looked at LocalBitcoins trends among six currency pairs including the dollar, pound, euro and Australian dollar, and tweeted:    Localbitcoins sees strongest growth in highly regulated US, Australian markets pic.twitter.com/xCtZCvPxNk      — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) December 7, 2014      Demeester's analysis found trading volume on the marketplace rising in the US and Australia – a change he says indicates that peer-to-peer bitcoin buying is growing in markets that are highly regulated.  Australia has imposed a value-added tax on buying bitcoins, which has been influential in at least one bitcoin startup leaving the country. The US remains in a state of regulatory uncertainty, while the New York 'BitLicense' is being prepared and politicians call for a debate on the appropriate regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.  Politicians make the right noises  It's regulation, or perhaps the lack of it, for bitcoin that politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are discussing this week.  A member of the Parliament Treasury Select Committee, the legislative body that scrutinises the United Kingdom government's financial institutions, told the House of Commons that bitcoin doesn't need further rules. The committee member, Steve Baker, explained to CoinDesk that digital currencies could function perfectly well within existing laws, while more regulation threatens to strangle innovation.  Baker's view was echoed by another British politician, Chi Onwurah, who is a shadow cabinet minister with the opposition Labour party. Onwurah, speaking to CoinDesk two weeks ago, said it is too early to devise a regulatory framework for digital currencies, and besides, cryptocurrencies hold the potential to reduce the amount of power concentrated in the hands of big banks.  Onwurah's view appears to be shared by US congressman Steve Stockman, who submitted a bill to the legislative chamber asking for a moratorium on digital currency regulations at both state and federal levels for a five year period.  Stockman invoked Apple founder Steve Jobs' name in justifying the move, hypothesising that the technology visionary would never have gotten his company off the ground in the '80s if onerous regulations had been in his way.  USMS auction fails to affect price  The US government may not have settled on a legal framework for bitcoin at all levels yet, but it is clear on one thing: selling seized bitcoin assets for US dollars is perfectly legitimate. The US Marshalls Service completed its second auction of bitcoin from a seized stash belonging to Ross Ulbricht, the alleged Silk Road kingpin on 4th December.  Bidders were lukewarm about putting money on the table. The number of bids compared to the inaugural June auction of similarly seized coins fell by nearly 60%, while the number of registered bidders fell by three quarters.  The federal agency put 50,000 BTC on the block this time, up from the nearly 30,000 coins auctioned in the summer. The winner of all the coins in the first auction, Tim Draper, won just a small chunk of 2,000 coins this time.  The bitcoin price was unaffected by the latest USMS auction, trading in the $370s all week. In the build up to the first auction, the price rose gradually, but did not budge when Draper revealed himself to be the sole winner. It did, however, begin a steep decline weeks later.  However, all this news – positive or not – may matter little in the long run, according to the reliably bullish Martin Tillier of Nasdaq. Tillier poses the following question to his readers: if you had $375 to spend on a Christmas gift, would you put it in dollars that are guaranteed to gradually fall in value, or spend it on bitcoin?  He writes:  ""If bitcoin fails you have the same result [the recipient still has one bitcoin]. But if stability continues and is a sign of maturity then that future generation will be thanking you forever. That seems like a risk/reward ratio too good to turn down.""
