42377650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gcd,1411077936,BitPay API Update Lets Apps Enable Easy Bitcoin Refunds,"BitPay has introduced the newest version of its BitPay API, a representational state transfer (RESTful) service that will allow the customers of all API-using developers the ability to initiate refunds directly from those applications.  The updated API follows a string of recent releases for developers from a number of key bitcoin companies, including Coinbase and CEX.io, which revealed new offerings for this community this past week.  For BitPay, however, the emphasis of the release was on the convenience the update will provide for the customers of API users, who will now be able to interact with merchants in a manner more familiar to the users of other payment methods.  BitPay's Eric Martindale wrote in the official announcement:  ""We hope [this] will lead to more smooth Bitcoin payment experiences for everyone, regardless of platform or wallet.""  Outside of this update, Martindale said that BitPay's primary goal was to better ensure the security of transactions on its platform, and to increase the number of resources available in its API without adding complexity.  For merchants, the company also updated its Billing API so companies that accept bitcoin can automate the submission of bills, allowing them to request future payments.  The API integrates BitPay's earlier offerings with BitAuth, the company's decentralized authentication tool. Further, as it uses the Bitcoin Payment Protocol, BitPay refunds will work with any bitcoin address or wallet service.  Move toward tokenization  Yet, another emphasis point for the company was that this latest version of its API cryptographically secures interactions with BitPay through tokenization.  Martindale indicated that all requests made to its API will now need to be signed with BitAuth keypairs. These signatures, he explained, are then matched against other parameters to verify that the security of the payment.  Expanding on the possibilities of this latest addition, Martindale wrote:  ""Tokens can be restricted to an identity, requiring a signature by that identity to utilize, or even a list of identities – perhaps a group of devices (such as point of sale tablets) or a list of people and their keys.""  Notably, the movement by BitPay toward tokenization follows Apple's use of similar security methods for Apple Pay, its new payment product introduced last week.  Open-source API  Overall, BitPay framed the release as one that also opens up the abilities of developers to interface with its API in new and more creative ways.  As such, the post concluded with the company directing users to contributions developers have made to Bitcore, the company's open-source Javascript library unveiled in February.  BitPay ended this post by further stressing this call to action, adding:  ""We look forward to seeing what you build.""  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gf9,1411074909,Bitcoin Think Tank Coin Center Launches with Star-Studded Support,"Coin Center, a new public policy organisation dedicated to digital currency research and advocacy, has launched with widespread backing from the bitcoin industry.  The Washington, DC-based group is supported by prominent figures such as VC investor Marc Andreessen, SecondMarket chairman Barry Silbert, bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and a host of the industry's most prominent companies.  In an open letter to the community, executive director Jerry Brito said that one major goal of the group is to help shape the global regulatory debate that could decide the fate of digital currency usage in the US and abroad.  Brito, a former executive director and research fellow at noted market research organisation Mercatus Center, wrote:  “Digital currencies like Bitcoin will be an important part of our economy, and policymakers are now beginning to consider how to regulate their use. As a result, there is a need for an organization that can be a trusted and credible source of information about the regulatory implications of digital currencies. We seek to be that trusted and credible source.”  Notably, Brito recently co-authored a critique of the BitLicense that was published by Mercatus. He formally left the organisation on 18th August, cryptically announcing by email that we would be moving on to another venture.  Star-studded support  In addition to Brito, Andreessen and Garzik, the group’s board of directors includes angel investor Alex Morcos; Stanford professor and Ripple Labs advisor Susan Athey; and Andreessen Horowitz general partner Balaji Srinivasan.  Coin Center will have an initial budget of $1m to support its efforts.  The organisation received funding from a variety of well-known bitcoin investors, companies and venture groups including:  Andreessen Horowitz  BitGo  BitPay  Coinbase  Hudson River Trading  itBit’s Charles Cascarilla  Liberty City Ventures’ Emil Woods  RRE Ventures  Union Square Ventures  Xapo.  Move toward advocacy  The group’s emergence comes at a critical juncture for digital currency adoption as regulators and governments worldwide debate if and how the technology should be regulated.  Further, it joins other organisations also focused on bitcoin public policy, including fellow Washington DC-based Chamber of Digital Commerce, led by former Forbes correspondent Perianne Boring, and the industry's oldest support group, the Bitcoin Foundation.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Jeff Garzik explained that there is demand for more information about bitcoin, both on the policy front and beyond, and that as a result, new groups are being formed to fill this need.  Given the fact that regulators are still working out how they plan on defining digital currencies, he said that ""new policy research and study is needed"".  ""The time was really right for this effort,"" he argued.

42397943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiWO,1411071912,Optimism Grows as Isle of Man Bitcoin Conference Draws to Close,"The island's growth has been helped in recent years by the number of online gambling companies who base their operations there. The world's largest online poker firm, Poker Stars, for example, had only four staff when it started on the island, but employs nearly 300 people today, Corlett said.  ""We can now pat ourselves on the back for our successful e-gaming sector, but there were plenty of mistakes in the early days [...] But you have to take risks, we have tried to innovate responsibly, but we do need to protect our consumers and protect our reputation,"" he said.  Corlett underlined the importance of the ˝e-business˝ sector, which includes digital currency companies, in the projected growth of the island's economy.  ""It's front and centre for us as an economy and as a government. We need to create the right environment for e-business to thrive,"" he said.  Currency and beyond  Corlett's talk followed presentations by Bruce Fenton of the non-profit group Bitcoin Association and David Johnston of the Decentralised Applications Fund.  Fenton discussed the technological impact cryptocurrency will have, even if bitcoin as a currency doesn't take off, saying:  ""Some die-hard people in the bitcoin space think it's going to wipe out banks or governments or something like that. But, it doesn't have to come anything near that. The technology is here to stay.""  Johnston, however, explored the potential of applications built on top of the block chain, emphasising the myriad ways in which decentralisation could create value for users.  ""We now have lower level protocols, but it's starting to evolve into higher level applications that we can build on. We will see an explosion of decentralised applications,"" he said.  Business showcase  Before the talks, conference delegates could have face-to-face sessions with a variety of professional services providers based on the Isle of Man.  These included global consulting and accountancy firms like KPMG, a major sponsor of the conference, and local firms like Boston Trust, which provides consulting services to firms, especially in the online gambling sector.  Some local startups also set up booths in the courtyard of the Sefton Hotel, where the conference was located on its second day.  One of them was TGBEX, which makes physical bitcoins out of a variety of metals, including gold and silver. The firm was launching its products, hoping to start marketing in time for the Christmas gifting season, said co-founder Richard Owusu-Awuah.  Each coin is engraved with a map of the world, with a private key hidden behind a holographic sticker on the back. The public key is printed on the sticker.  Movie star entrepreneur  Delegates rolled into the conference following a dinner the previous night that featured a speech from GoCoin co-founder and active angel investor Brock Pierce.  Pierce took the podium in the restaurant of the Claremont Hotel after a trailer of the 1996 movie First Kid was played. The movie starred Sinbad as a bodyguard of the US president's son, played by Pierce.  ""I don't think I've seen any of my movies since I was 15 or 16 [years old], probably because I didn't want to be reminded of how bad I was,"" Pierce said of his early career as a child actor.  ""Talking about this can make me blush,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/18/optimism-grows-as-isle-of-man-bitcoin-conference-draws-to-close,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/870ce88ab333b9d52d7db829e364884b57533031-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiPV,1411065941,Bitmarket.lt Takes Bitcoin's Fight Against Big Banks to Court,"A close look at recent headlines reveals the current reality for the bitcoin industry – that despite the potential world-changing promise of its underlying technology, its businesses are still facing hurdles when attempting to bring their products and services to market.  However, not all startups are taking the indecision of banks lightly.  Lithuania-based bitcoin startup Bitmarket.lt is fighting back against its former bank, Swedish financial services giant Swedbank, after it shut down the company's accounts. Launched in late 2013, the dispute created headlines in Lithuania, and as of September, it's still being fought in court.  Speaking to CoinDesk, founder Audrius Ramanauskas said that Bitmarket.lt has since found a stable banking partnership, but that now, he's carrying on the fight for the greater community good.  Ramanauskas told CoinDesk:  ""I want to fight for the bitcoin industry, at least in Lithuania. I would like to create precedent. I mean if we win against Swedbank, it will be easier for other players in this market and around the world.""  Legal issues aside, the 42-year-old serial entrepreneur has used his connections and business savvy to promote bitcoin in a part of the world where digital currency awareness remains low, most recently by signing notable national airline Air Lituanica to its payment processing service.  Despite the trials he's faced, Ramanauskas remains a bitcoin believer.  ""Bitcoin is the future of e-commerce payments,"" he said. ""So, I made a decision to start a bitcoin exchange and to promote bitcoin in Eastern Europe.""  Bitmarket.lt targets Europe  Though Bitmarket.lt has global ambitions, the startup is currently focused on providing bitcoin exchange and processing services to the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian markets.  Each market is home to a dedicated Bitmarket website – Bitmarket.lt, Bitmarket.lv and Bitmarket24.ee, which are united under the umbrella brand Bitmarket UAB, though the company promotes itself as Bitmarket.lt. The company is not affiliated with Bitmarket.pl.  Ramanauskas, however, is looking beyond providing basic services to these markets.  Founded in 2002, his online travel agency, Interneto Partneris recently launched Abitsky.com, a bitcoin-only airline booking service. Interneto Partneris UAB operates Bookinghouse.ee, Eticket.fi, Flyhi.se, and other travel services companies in 12 countries, and provides web service and ticketing solutions to Air Lituanica  For Ramanauskas, bitcoin is an extension of his history in the travel industry, where he saw Interneto Partneris bear the burden of significant expenses from bank transactions, currency exchange, fraud and other side effects of legacy banking.  Ramanauskas recalls:  ""Every month, my company was spending huge amounts of money on these costs. Keep in mind, that profit margins in travel are very small. Bitcoin can resolve these problems.""  Case against Swedbank  Lawyers representing Bitmarket.lt told CoinDesk that Swedbank opened the company's account in mid-November of last year, first allowing Bitmarket.lt to use it for money transfers. But, after just weeks, the account was closed, a fact Ramanauskas realized when his business payments were declined.  Jonas Bložė, a partner at Vilnius-based Zeta Law, told CoinDesk that he is confident his client has a case to overturn the decision because neither the EU or Lithuania has outlawed bitcoin.  Bložė said:  ""Even Lithuanian Bank (as supervising body) doesn’t have clear opinion regarding bitcoins, only guidance for consumers, who they say could be misguided because of bitcoin's volatility.""  Swedbank claims that Bitmarket.lt never revealed its intention to buy and sell bitcoin. Speaking to 15min.lt in December about the decision, the bank said that the account was closed because it was deemed high risk.  In a separate yet notable move, the bank also closed the account of one customer for selling bitcoin in October, 2013.  Confidence to win  To date, however, Bitmarket.lt has not fared well in court, losing its first round when the court deemed that bitcoin posed a significant risk for Swedbank due to its possible use for terrorism and money laundering.  Ramanauskas said Bitmarket.lt isn't optimistic that the case it will move forward soon, either, suggesting this could still take six to nine months. Bitmarket.lt has since filed an appeal of the original decision, and intends to return to court at the beginning of 2015.  Still, he is confident that Bitmarket.lt will triumph in its efforts, remarking:  ""Banks are not a government institution and do not have any right to decide. [...] Lithuanian law is quite strong describing what a bank can do or not do with clients' bank accounts. I strongly believe we will win this case, because we are absolutely right.""

42397932,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiNX,1411060874,CoinTerra Opens Pre-Orders for First 16nm Bitcoin ASIC,"CoinTerra has announced the AIRE Miner, the company’s first bitcoin miner based on 16nm silicon.  The Texas-based mining hardware maker said the AIRE will deliver a substantial increase in efficiency and performance when it ships in the first quarter of 2015, as the chip will be one of the first commercial products based on 16nm technology.  CoinTerra  CTO Timo Hanke framed the offering as one that would benefit the wider consumer market, saying:  ""With exceptional hashing performance and power efficiency, we are ready to put the power of high performance bitcoin mining back into the hands of bitcoin enthusiasts the world over.""  The SHIVA ASIC employed in the miner has not taped out yet, but the company said a date has been scheduled for late September.  Most bitcoin ASICs shipping today are based on the 28nm process. For example, KnCMiner launched the 20nm Neptune miner back in June, making it one of the first 20nm chips available on the market.  Unprecedented power efficiency  Cointerra said that moving to a new node allowed it design an ASIC capable of delivering “unprecedented” power efficiency. Further, it claims the new SHIVA ASIC delivers a five-fold increase in performance-per-watt.  The development of the 16nm SHIVA chip reportedly took more than nine months, for CoinTerra and its partner Global Unichip Corp, which designed the chip.  Louis Lin, vice president of Global Unichip’s design service, said working with CoinTerra on the state of the art 16nm ASIC design gave the company a “chance to push the boundaries of modern technology”.  The AIRE Miner is now available for pre-order, retailing for $2,499 plus shipping and handling.  New chip efficiencies in 2015  Looking ahead to 2015, many chipmakers are shifting their focus to 14nm and 16nm processes.  The need for such improvements was recently heightened by Apple’s launch of the A8 System-on-Chip, used in its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones. The sheer volume of Apple’s massive orders from Taiwan Semiconducor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reportedly resulted in capacity issues for the foundry.  Earlier this year, the world's biggest foundry-for-hire revealed it will now be able to commence volume production of 16nm silicon in the first quarter of 2015, and the company is not alone.  Samsung and GlobalFoundries have teamed up for a 14nm push early next year. At the time, the companies said the new process would deliver 20% more performance, 35% better power efficiency and a 15% reduction in die size.  Intel launched its first 14nm processors at the Intel Developers Forum in San Francisco earlier this month. The first Core M processors (codenamed Broadwell) should appear in retail soon, though it should be noted Intel’s 14nm node is reserved solely for Intel products.

42397922,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiEg,1411057248,Isle of Man Residents Could Soon Settle Tax Bills in Bitcoin,"Isle of Man residents and businesses could soon have the option to pay their taxes in bitcoin, according to a government representative who indicated the option is under serious consideration.  ""Everything from paying your car tax to your income tax bill, we're seeking to operate a wider range of choices for citizens and businesses for how they can settle their account with the government,"" said Chris Corlett, chief executive of the government's department of economic development.  The island's government is currently inviting expressions of interest from payment services providers, including those dealing in digital currencies, so that they may be considered for inclusion in the payment options available. Companies must submit their expression of interest by noon of 3rd October.  Corlett said the number of new payment providers will not be capped, meaning multiple new providers could be selected. He also said a date for the selection of new providers had not been decided yet, although he noted the process typically takes about two months.  ""We'll need to ensure the organisations are suitably competent and all parties have their monies protected. This is the best way of showing we are open-minded about digital currencies,"" he said.  More payment methods needed  The Isle of Man is a self-governing dependency of the British crown. The local government currently takes payments in person, at counters around the island, where people can pay with debit and credit cards. It also accepts payments in the form of direct bank transfers.  Payment platforms like PayPal, which allow users to store payment details using an online wallet or to enable repeat payments, are not currently permitted to be used, according to the official noticehttps://www.gov.im/media/1345724/pin-notice-provision-of-pay-payment-merchant-services-closing-3-october-2014.pdf announcing the call for expressions of interest.  Rather, the government is seeking digital currency services that will let customers perform transactions at ""points of presence"", using card services or over-the-counter methods, as well as facilitating transactions online. The notice also says the government is seeking card services providers with points of presence and online capabilities.  ""Reassure us that you have the right KYC, AML and governance procedures that we can rely upon. If you convince Government Technology Services and Treasury of that, we can hopefully add several to our list of payment providers,"" said Corlett.  Government won't hold bitcoin  Corlett stressed that the government would not hold digital currencies, even if bills were settled that way. However, he said that the decision to seek digital currency payment solutions was a ""simple one"" and was not subject to much objection within the government.  ""There is an evolution here, given what we've learned about digital currencies in the last year, it was a relatively simple decision to take,"" he said.  Professional services providers on the island welcomed the announcement.  Kevin Perks, director at consultancy I-Cap, which provides services to companies looking to relocate to the Isle of Man, including several digital currency-related companies, was enthusiastic about the potential for digital currency payments to the government:  ""I think it's extremely bold. In terms of the day-to-day reality, I'm not sure how many people will actually choose to settle their bills in [cryptocurrency]. But it's about sending a message to the outside world, to say this jurisdiction is open to this type of business. It's part of a revolution.""  Corlett's announcement came as he gave the closing speech on the second day of Crypto Valley Summit, an event meant to focus attention on the island's attractiveness to cryptocurrency businesses.

42397936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiQU,1411049475,Luxembourg Startup CoinPlus Closes Seed Funding Round,"CoinPlus has successfully closed a first round of investment, which saw the firm add €172,500 to its coffers.  The Luxembourg-based bitcoin startup reports the seed funding will allow it to speed up the operational and technical development of its impending product and add new members its team.  Though not yet launched, CoinPlus is developing a multi-support payment processor and a currency exchange platform.  Regulatory framework attracts bitcoin businesses  The startup was incorporated last July, following a ruling by the Luxembourg financial regulator, which found that bitcoin could be used as a means of payment.  Thanks to that ruling, Luxembourg became an attractive jurisdiction for bitcoin entrepreneurs.  CoinPlus CEO Christian Bodt said:  “Luxembourg was the obvious choice for us. The country offers state-of-the-art technical and administrative infrastructure, providers at the forefront of technology, a government that is accessible and great open-mindedness. The Luxembourg market is also a safe bet for all the players in the financial world.”  Bodt said CoinPlus is starting the process of applying for the ministerial approval in Luxembourg. While aware that there are still a number of steps to take before it can reach that “grail”, he is optimistic that it will succeed. Additionally, Bodt said he expects another funding round later this year.  CoinPlus has been created and developed so far with the support of Technoport, a state-owned incubator located in southern Luxembourg.  Confident in bitcoin’s potential  As a Python developer with a background in financial industries, Bodt said he originally discovered bitcoin in 2010 and he quickly became interested in the concept.  He met with Gavin Andresen in 2011 and became convinced that he had to join the community, which he did with the creation of his first bitcoin client. Bodt was also active in the fledgling bitcoin communities of both London and Paris.  Bodt said that bitcoin as a currency has some advantages over the traditional monetary system:  “The advantage of bitcoin as a unit of account is that it can store value without any risk linked to other people’s actions. The euro, for example, requires confidence in both the European financial and political system and the European central bank.""

The China-based bitcoin exchange company launched BitYes at its first anniversary celebration at Beijing's Shangri-La Hotel last Saturday.  BitYes  will feature 24/7 English customer support available through multiple channels including Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, with a VIP system providing additional services to 'high-value' users.  It has a 0.2% standard trading fee, 0% BTC and LTC deposit/withdrawal fees, a 1% fiat currency deposit fee, 2% Egopay withdrawal fee, or 0.1% fee for withdrawal to bank card.  Marketing to new customers  Huobi is offering special introductory deals: the first 1,000 users may trade free for 30 days, as well as the first $1,000 depositors.  BitYes is aimed squarely at international customers, but it is registered to Bit International Financial Services Ltd, a Hong Kong-registered subsidiary of Huobi. The company says this will produce both better service and a more secure legal environment.  BitYes has also collaborated closely with leading law firms to ensure regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions.  Growing product mix  Huobi's  product family has grown markedly over the past couple of months with a series of launches and acquisitions, many offering something completely separate to the original and comparatively straightforward exchange business.  Each new product appears to appeal to a wider variety of digital currency traders and reduce the company's dependence on the mainland Chinese market, with its regulatory uncertainty. All new services have been launched simultaneously with English and Chinese versions.  These include BitVC, also part of the Hong-Kong subsidiary, a non-fiat exchange offering margin and futures trading, Yubibao interest-bearing wallets, the multi-signature Quickwallet, the Qukuai/Blockinfo block explorer, mining-linked investment products and an upcoming P2P lending platform.  Quickwallet provides users with the ability to make instant-confirmation deposits from their personal wallet to the exchange. This product will also be integrated with BitYes to provide the same functionality.  A recent cryptographic audit of Huobi's acconts showed it held 103% of claimed bitcoin reserves. It also claims a perfect security record over its one year of operation and, like rivals OKCoin and Huobi, have found a way to operate within a Chinese regulatory framework that once threatened to stifle the country's nascent bitcoin industry.

42397926,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiGe,1411042775,Politician Keen for Vancouver Citizens to Pay Taxes in Bitcoin,"A Vancouver politician says the city should allow residents to pay their taxes, fines and fees using bitcoin.  Jason Lamarche won 37,286 votes in a recent council election, and now he says he would solicit bitcoin donations if he chose to run again.  In an interview with the Georgia Straight, Lamarche questioned why municipal politicians aren’t discussing bitcoin’s disruptive potential. He pointed out that many people describe Vancouver as the Silicon Valley of the north, yet the city is not doing much to promote new technology.  Lamarche explained:  “Well, when we have companies that are working on the type of innovation that we’re seeing related to bitcoin, why aren’t we helping to promote and use this technology, which clearly has had massive uptake around the world?”  However, the city said it has no plans to consider accepting bitcoin payments at this time.  Bitcoin donations are legal in Vancouver  The issue of whether political donations made in bitcoin are legal was addressed by Nola Western, the deputy chief electoral officer at election information resource Elections BC.  Western confirmed parties and candidates taking part in Vancouver’s upcoming November elections can accept bitcoin donations. She explained bitcoins are treated as non-monetary property and candidates simply need to report the dollar value of bitcoin donations.  The value is set on the day the donation is received, so if the bitcoin price goes up or down in the meantime there is no need to report any changes in value.  However, anonymous donations are limited to $50 and anyone wishing to donate more will have to disclose their identity, complete with address, full name and other details. Such donations have to be reported by the recipient. Western also cautioned that if a candidate received a lot of anonymous $50 donations in bitcoin, questions about their source would be raised.  Bitcoin campaign funding elsewhere  The use of bitcoin in political fundraising is not new. The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) made it clear that political campaigns and action committees can accept bitcoin as a form of in-kind donation.  A number of US politicians and political groups started accepting bitcoin over the past couple of years. Earlier this month, the Republican Party of Louisiana became one of the first state republican parties to accept the digital currency.  Although most US politicians who decided to embrace bitcoin tend to have libertarian views, but many others do not – they come from across the political spectrum.

42397927,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiIc,1411038020,CoinJar Launches Bitcoin Debit Card Trial,"CoinJar is set to begin a national trial of a bitcoin-to-debit card system called Swipe, which can be used to pay at any store that accepts electronic payments and to withdraw cash at some ATMs.  The Australia-based exchange and payment processor's debit cards will work on the country's electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) network, which is supported by all major banks and has 826,769 payment terminals nationwide.  ""CoinJar Swipe is our way of making bitcoin accessible to everyone,"" Asher Tan, CEO of CoinJar, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Swipe lets CoinJar customers spend their bitcoin at any retail outlet that accepts EFTPOS, or withdraw cash from EFTPOS-compatible ATMs. It's all part of CoinJar's plan to build a simple, usable bitcoin ecosystem.""  According to the Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA), over 17 million transactions take place via the country's ATM and EFTPOS terminal network per day.  Testing, testing  About 100 CoinJar users will participate in the trial over the next couple of weeks before the company makes the service available to its entire 30,000-strong user base.  Customers will load bitcoins manually onto their debit cards, which will be converted into Australian dollars and incur CoinJar's standard 2% fee. There is no extra charge for using the EFTPOS feature.  The cards are planned to be issued by local company Emerchants.  Benefits of bitcoin  Tan said the card scheme was more about getting more people using bitcoin and understanding its benefits, and that CoinJar wasn't expecting to make much of a profit from the project.  Those benefits included instant and almost free transfers from anywhere in the world (which could benefit freelance workers), to easy payments between individuals. Users can receive bitcoin, load the EFTPOS card and be out spending within minutes, Tan said.  CoinJar has processed about A$50m (US$44.8m) in transactions so far. The company also offers a bitcoin wallet and an iOS app. As well as updating the iOS app for iOS8, it will also launch a new app for Android in the near future.

42397938,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiSS,1411030370,New Exchange SFOX Aims to Find Traders the Best Bitcoin Price,"One of the remarkable – and perhaps most confusing – aspects of bitcoin is the fact that every bitcoin exchange seems to have a different price for the cryptocurrency.  Of course, no two exchanges are ever alike because they all serve different markets. When it comes to how much it costs to buy or sell bitcoin, this is especially true.  The reasoning for this has to do with bitcoin being a global and largely unregulated market. Because it is bought and sold all over the world, there are numerous prices for it – with no centralized entity dictating any one.  A new startup called San Francisco Open Exchange (SFOX) aims to fix that. Or, at the very least, its platform will allow users an opportunity to potentially capitalize on the spread across different bitcoin exchange markets.  Akbar Thobhani is the co-founder of SFOX. He told CoinDesk that his platform allows people to get the best price for bitcoin – a Kayak of sorts for the virtual currency – saying:  “What does Kayak do? It finds you the best liquidity across airlines. We do the same thing [with bitcoin]. We get you the best price and the best liquidity across multiple bitcoin exchanges.”  The idea  SFOX is essentially a platform for users to trade bitcoin and USD in both buy and sell mode. The goal is to provide users the very best price, similar to what an E*Trade or Scottrade offers with more traditional financial instruments like stocks and options.  Thobhani and co-founder George Melika started SFOX with entrepreneurial backgrounds and an understanding of the global payments market.  Thobhani previously worked at mobile payments company Boku before heading up growth at travel website Airbnb, where he said the lodging startup had to send money to over 190 countries, giving him key insight into what it takes to process payments on a global scale.  “I learned that moving money was so complicated and I had no idea about it,” said Thobhani. “I wanted to build technology to make that easy.”  Melika has experience building trading platforms for financial institutions.  Right now, bitcoin is not generally considered a traditional financial instrument because of regulatory concerns from banking institutions. Even so, SFOX does not believe that banks are the enemy of bitcoin.  “I wouldn’t define [banking] as a problem,” Thobhani said.  Bankers, he added, are just doing their jobs:  “I think banks – you just have to work with them. You have to understand what they are. Banks are responsible for following the compliance and the laws that are set in countries.”  It's possible that someday platforms like SFOX will be integrated into something like E-Trade, a financial services company with which investors can by and sell securities on an ETF or by phone.  But for the time being, startups like SFOX will build a place to be a sort of foreign exchange for decentralized currencies. This could eventually make it desirable to banks, because of its experience with bitcoin.  “Banks want to be involved [in bitcoin], they just have to be comfortable,” Thobhani said.  Algorithmic bitcoin trading  SFOX sees its platform as becoming increasingly useful as cryptocurrencies grow as financial assets.  Despite bitcoin's $6bn market capitalization, Thobhani believes BTC has room to grow, bringing specialized algorithms for the financial markets into the cryptocurrency space.  “These algorithms are very special. They have to be rewritten for the world of cryptocurrency,“ said Thobhani.  SFOX sees its main customers as traders who will need access to multiple exchanges at one time. While much there has been much talk about derivatives and options or futures to provide liquidity, SFOX is just managing trading across exchanges as an easy starting point to integrating more complex instruments.  Said Thobhani:  “We [will be] the window into all of these instruments we can trade. We just want to make it super simple and easy for traders to manage that.”  For larger bitcoin deals on the exchange platforms it can be difficult to transact bitcoin in buy and sell orders because of a general lack of liquidity. SFOX offers itself to payment companies and perhaps bitcoin-accepting merchants as a broker of sorts.  “Payment companies [are] going to need a mechanism to trade in large numbers,” Thobhani told CoinDesk. “In a manner that doesn’t move the market – they need to buy or sell one currency or another. We offer liquidity.”  Y Combinator and beyond  SFOX was one of few bitcoin companies that were accepted into Y Combinator’s Summer 2014 class. Others, including Onename.io and card company Shift Payments were accepted with a more complete product to show YC's partners.  However, SFOX came through the renowned accelerator building its product; the founders only applied with the concept for the platform.  Said Thobhani:  “We applied to YC with an idea. Which is rare. Companies come to YC to accelerate growth; we were fortunate to join YC with an idea and leave with a growing company.”  There are a number of companies that are somewhat similar to SFOX – especially by offering a trading platform.  Thobhani argues the startup is doing something unique amongst the competition. The idea for SFOX, he says, is something many in the bitcoin community will need, similar to how the conventional currency markets operate right now, he said.  “There’s a lot of working with other partners in a currency market, and we don’t see how bitcoin is going to be any different. Bitcoin is an open technology, and we are an open platform. We see this as an opportunity to work with the community,” said Thobhani.  SFOX is currently in limited beta. Anyone can sign up but deposits and withdrawals are currently restricted. For full platform access, go to the SFOX deposit page and follow @sfoxtrading on Twitter.
