35755475,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651670,1730849436,"Bitcoin At $200,000 By 2025? Bernstein Predicts Target Despite Election Impact","Less than a day before the polls closed in the United States, crypto analysts continued to offer their two cents on the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, many Wall Street analysts say wild BTC market prices will continue after the elections. Other analysts and observers have shared their price predictions based on who will win this Tuesday. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 Gautam Chhugani of the Berstein Group projects that Bitcoin can increase to $80,000 or even $90,000 if the Republican Donald Trump wins the election. If Kamala Harris wins the polls, Chhugani expects the BTC price to dip to $50,000. But Bernstein didn’t stop making Bitcoin predictions immediately after the election; the group remains bullish on Bitcoin in the short term and expects the digital asset to hit $200,000 by 2025. According to Bernstein analysts, the other key factors driving Bitcoin’s price are the increasing demand for spot BTC ETFs and rising US debts. Bernstein Adjusts BTC Price Predictions: $50K Under Harris, $80-90K With Trump Bernstein analysts have adjusted their Bitcoin price estimates based on the potential outcomes of the upcoming U.S. election. If Harris wins, they foresee Bitcoin dropping to around $50,000, while a… pic.twitter.com/Z1zJ21aJ48 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 4, 2024 Bernstein’s Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Next Year Analysts at Bernstein are betting on Bitcoin and expect its price to reach $200,000 by the end of next year, regardless of the election results. Gautam Chhugani made this bold prediction days before the Americans visited the polls and added that the results would not impact the long-term outlook for the asset. The analyst’s bullish project on Bitcoin is anchored on several factors. He even likened the asset to a “genie out of the bottle” and said stopping its price trajectory is difficult. Chhugani identified a few factors that can drive the asset’s price, including increased interest on the BTC ETFs and higher government’s national debt. Last month, Bernstein’s top analyst targeted $100k for Bitcoin but soon revised his projection to reflect changes in market trends. BTC’s Erratic Price Action Ahead Of Elections This year’s election battle between Trump and Harris is among the most highly debated and anticipated. In addition to traditional polling, data from betting markets like Polymarket became famous, too. For example, at Polymarket, Trump remains the favorite, cornering 63% of all wagers, with Harris getting 38%. Bernstein analysts say that regardless of the results, the asset will have short-term price movements. However, they expect BTC to benefit more from a Trump win. In the same Bernstein analysis, Bitcoin may increase to $90,000 if the Republican wins. Currently, Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $69k to $68k due to profit-taking. Also, analysts noted the weak inflows this week to ETFs. Most analysts agree that Bitcoin is still poised for an end-of-the-year rally.

For example, in a Harris presidency, Ether may gain due to heightened regulations that can limit the performance of its competition, like Solana. However, Chhuhani offers a differing view, saying if the SEC adopts moderate policies, these can propel Bitcoin and other assets. This year’s election cycle puts crypto and the blockchain at the center of debates. Both candidates have shared their thoughts on crypto, with Trump offering more crypto-friendly solutions. Initially, Democrat Harris was reluctant to offer policy proposals, but she shifted her tone as the campaign moved forward.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged to $70,500 earlier during the day from around $67,000, then shed 2% in an hour to briefly drop below $69,000. It was trading at $69,000 at press time, still up more than 2% over the past 24 hours.. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index booked 3% gain during the same period, led by native tokens of Near {{NEAR}}, Aptos {{APT}} and Hedera {{HBAR}} advancing 6%-7%.  Ether {{ETH}} continued its streak of dismal performance relative to bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio dropping below 0.035 for the first time since April 2021. ETH lagged with its 0.4% daily gain, while litecoin {{LTC}} was also flat.  The abrupt selloff happened as Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the company behind Truth Social social-media platform founded by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, plummeted 20% and was briefly halted from trading Tuesday afternoon. There wasn't any immediately clear catalyst of the price drop, as odds for Trump winning the election dipped only slightly to 61% from 62% on blockchain-based prediction venue Polymarket. Traders perhaps took profits after DJT share prices earlier today spiked 18% from yesterday's closing price, and are still up 178% from the September lows.  Zooming out, bitcoin is still trading within a narrow range below its all-time record heading into the U.S. election night, which is viewed as a key source of uncertainty for crypto prices.

35751359,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651647,1730844046,"Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Possibility Of Bitcoin Price Reaching $100,000","Recent action has seen Bitcoin price retest the $67,000 price level. Particularly, the Bitcoin price declined by about 8.9% in seven days from $73,464 on October 29 to $66,895 on November 4, as many short-term traders exited their positions. At the same time, a few long-term holders also offloaded their Bitcoins, likely to lock in gains. According to technical analysis, the ongoing correction is absolutely normal and fine for Bitcoin. Particularly, technical analysis shows that the $100,000 price target for Bitcoin is well in play. Interestingly, this outlook is based on drawing parallels with the price history of gold. Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has long been referred to as the digital gold in terms of its use as a hedge against inflation. However, their respective price actions over the years point to more similarities than many investors realize. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Daily Transactions Surge To 4.68 Million, Will This Push SHIB’s Price Toward $0.00008? Crypto analyst Tony ‘The Bull’ Severino took to the social media platform X to share an intriguing trend he observed on the Bitcoin price chart to relay an optimistic perspective on the cryptocurrency’s long-term trajectory. Severino pointed out that Bitcoin’s price movements appear to be following a similar path to historical patterns seen in gold, which went through comparable price tops, price bottoms, breakouts, and retests. According to the price charts shared by Tony Severino, he highlighted notable similarities between Bitcoin’s price action on the 2-week candlestick timeframe with Gold on the 2-month candlestick timeframe. Particularly, Bitcoin’s price action has mirrored that of Gold in multiple instances. Therefore, the analyst compared to the current price breakout/retest in the Bitcoin price to that of a similar breakout/retest in Gold in 2023. Back in March 2023, gold went through a breakout and retest pattern, which set the stage for a prolonged rally over several months up until the time of writing. Severino believes Bitcoin could follow a similar trajectory for a multi-month rally. What’s Next For The BTC Price? According to Tony Severino’s analysis, the Bitcoin price correction is ending very soon and is set to go on a notable surge for the rest of the year. In terms of a timeline, he noted the creation of a new all-time high by the end of 2024 and a $100,000 price for Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Although the analyst’s projection is based off of Bitcoin’s correlation with Gold, the price target resonates with similar price predictions with other technical analyses. For instance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as CoinLupin highlighted a similar price timeline based on the Bitcoin MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio. Using this ratio, he predicted a price target range of $95,000 to $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,714 and is down by 3% in the past 24 hours.

42390191,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjhJL,1730842482,‘It’s So Early’: How Solana Is Competing With Ethereum for Institutional Interest,"Solana has garnered notoriety for its meme coin connection.  But financial institutions are also interested in using the network to build their products.  While Solana is newer than Ethereum, it doesn’t face the same challenges when it comes to transaction throughput and cheap fees.  It would be easy for a casual observer to think that the Solana network is for memecoins and Ethereum for financial institutions.  While BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has preached the gospel of tokenization on Ethereum — his firm even launching a tokenized fund, BUIDL, on that blockchain — Solana has often made headlines this year thanks to the success of pump.fun, a protocol that allows users to create memecoins in minutes.  That, however, doesn’t mean Ethereum has a monopoly on institutional interest, according to Hadley Stern, chief commercial officer at Marinade Finance, a Solana-based DeFi protocol that provides staking services for that blockchain's {{SOL}} token.  “On the institutional side, it's so early,” Stern, who was the founding president of Fidelity Digital Assets and global head of digital asset custody at BNY Mellon, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We could probably count on one hand the amount of TradFi products that are being built or have been built on Ethereum and Solana.”  “I was brought on [Marinade] because there’s a lot of product discovery around strong interest from institutions,” Stern said. “Asset managers, high net worth holders, individual holders, hedge funds … are interested in [staking on Solana].”  Launched in March 2020, Solana and SOL exploded on the crypto scene during the 2021 bull market partially thanks to support from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. SOL cratered when FTX collapsed, but staged a comeback in 2023 and, at $79 billion, is now the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Stern’s assessment comes as financial giants such as Franklin Templeton, Citibank and Société Générale all announced new Solana-based projects last September during Breakpoint, the network’s biggest yearly conference. And he wasn’t the only one electrified by such institutional enthusiasm.  “At Breakpoint, it was eye-opening to see how many people are now building on Solana,” Tristan Frizza, founder of Solana-based decentralized derivatives exchange Zeta Markets, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Institutions are doing pretty crazy stuff.”  Solana vs Ethereum  At first view, building on Ethereum can seem like a no-brainer for financial institutions. After all, it’s the oldest and largest smart contract blockchain, it has the largest number of developers in the crypto ecosystem, it settles the majority of stablecoin transactions and it’s the birthplace of DeFi. “If you work at a large bank and you're trying to tokenize an asset, you're not going to get fired for putting it on Ethereum,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan recently told CoinDesk.  But Ethereum isn’t risk-free, according to Leah Wald, CEO of Sol Strategies, a crypto holding company that also runs a large Solana validator.  “The uncertainty that continues around transaction fees certainly doesn't make anyone comfortable,” Wald told CoinDesk in an interview. “If you're going to be if you're an institution, and you're thinking 10 years out, you can't be building on a blockchain that you're concerned about.”  “BlackRock’s BUIDL is based on Ethereum, and for what they're trying to build, I think that's perfectly fine,” Wald added, but any kind of projects with high-volume transactions, like real-time payments or trading, might struggle. “If we’re talking about a more sophisticated on-chain fund, or a financial platform, then there's a real opportunity for Solana.”  In other words, nothing currently guarantees that Ethereum’s scalability strategy, which hinges on layer 2 blockchains, will pay off, and the transformations the network has undergone in the last few years — like its monetary policy change, or its transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake — show that Ethereum is still figuring itself out.  Solana’s cheap transactions and low throughput, by contrast, don’t hinge on the accomplishment of a complex and technical roadmap. And that can make all the difference.  Wald noted, however, that in the U.S., Ethereum benefits from more regulatory clarity than Solana. The fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot ether exchange-traded funds this summer is likely a reassurance for institutions, even as inflows into those new funds have been disappointing. A spot SOL ETF might be years away, depending on the outcome of today's presidential election.  A different mindset  Another point where Solana tends to be underestimated, Frizza said, is in terms of technical innovations. While Ethereum is famous for its army of developers, builders on Solana tend to fly under the radar, even when they come up with new tools and products that can have an impact on crypto ecosystems beyond their own.  “People underrate what Solana enables from a structural perspective — and also the mindset that Solana builders have,” Frizza said. “They really care about users, the product, building things that scale and that address user needs.”  To Frizza, that attitude means that, if another crypto mania occurs again, fascinating apps will come to light on Solana. Speaking of Zeta Markets, he said one priority was to “bring down UX barriers and make it feel as easy as trading on Robinhood. That's when you can really start opening up the funnel and bringing a lot of people in.”  Stern concurred. Memecoins aren’t an innovation in themselves, he said, but the fact they were able to flourish on Solana in a way they couldn’t on any other platform is a symptom of developers working at the highest level: pump.fun is simply taking advantage of a technical breakthrough. “Ethereum has a very hands-off relationship with an open source viewpoint, whereas I think the Solana Foundation does a better job from a business development standpoint,” Stern said. “Sort of guiding the ship, but not in a completely controlling way, and letting a thousand flowers bloom.”",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/05/its-so-early-how-solana-is-competing-with-ethereum-for-institutional-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9330e446966503fdb5a2a005d656af4984e9ac53-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390193,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjhTb,1730840400,Live Updates: Trump Wins 2024 U.S. Presidential Election,"ND (4:25 p.m. ET, 11/7/24) Republican Dave McCormick defeated incumbent Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey, flipping another Senate seat red and giving the GOP at least 53 seats, with two more races — in Arizona and Nevada — left to go, AP projected Thursday. Both Democrats running for those seats are currently in the lead. McCormick was endorsed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and has been outspoken in his support for the crypto industry, though he did not receive any backing from the major crypto-affiliated PACs.  Fairshake and its affiliated PACs did notch another few wins over the past day or so, with Democrats Eugene Vindman (Virginia), Don Davis (North Carolina) and Nicole Budzinski (Illinois) all winning their House races. There are another 11 House races with Fairshake-backed candidates that have yet to be called. Nine of those candidates currently hold the lead in their vote counts. Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, also leads Republican opponent Kari Lake in a race that has yet to be called.  ND (3:30 p.m.) Democrat Elisa Slotkin will be the next Senator from the state of Michigan, after defeating Republican Mike Rogers in the closely contested race to represent the Great Lakes State. She will take the seat of retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Slotkin, currently a congresswoman from the state, voted in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and a resolution overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. The Fairshake super PAC supported her run for Senate to the tune of $10 million.  ND (11:10 a.m. ET) As of right now, Republicans have easily picked up the White House and Senate majority. There are six Senate races left to be called — Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Maine. Pennsylvania's Bob Casey (Democrat) is trailing Republican Dave McCormick (Republican) by about 50,000 votes, with 97% of votes counted. In Michigan, Fairshake-backed Elissa Slotkin (Democrat) has a very narrow 9,000-vote lead against Republican Mike Rogers. Similarly, in Nevada, Republican Sam Brown is less than 1,000 votes ahead of Democrat Jacky Rosen, per AP.  It's still unclear which party will control the House of Representatives. Republicans have 199 seats, to Democrats' 180. The first party to reach 218 seats will win a majority. Polymarket bettors project Republicans may keep the House, giving that party a trifecta in government.  On the Fairshake front, Illinois Democrat Eric Sorensen won reelection. There are 16 more races that Fairshake supported which have not yet been called by AP.  SR (7:44 a.m. ET) Republican Tim Sheehy defeated Montana Democrat Jon Tester, adding to Republicans' pickups in the U.S. Senate during a night that saw the party flip control of the Congressional chamber.  SR (5:44 a.m. ET) Donald Trump won Wisconsin, gaining 10 electoral college votes to secure 277, more than the 270 needed to win the presidency, according to AP's real-time tracker.  ND (3:30 a.m. ET) Representatives Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, and Shri Thanedar, a Michigan Democrat, have won their races, the AP projected. As of press time it was still unclear which party may win the House of Representatives, and while Trump's victory has not yet been confirmed, he is a mere three electoral college votes away from securing his second term as president. AP's real-time tracker showed that Trump still holds a roughly 5 million popular vote lead, and held leads in Michigan, Wisconsin, Alaska, Arizona and Nevada. Just one of these states would confirm him to another term.  ND (2:50 a.m. ET) ""We're going to make our country better than it's ever been,"" Donald Trump said in a rambling victory speech that saw Elon Musk, Dana White and J.D. Vance briefly speak. Trump held a 5 million vote lead in the popular vote, in addition to his likely electoral college win.  ND (2:28 a.m. ET) The AP is also projecting that Donald Trump won Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral college votes, as well as Maine's second district and its single electoral college vote. The former president is now just three electoral college votes away from securing a second term running the U.S.  ND (1:30 a.m. ET) Decision Desk HQ is projecting that Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral college votes. He is also expected to win Alaska (three electoral college votes) and Maine's second district (one electoral college vote), potentially confirming him to a second term as president of the U.S. The AP has not yet called Pennsylvania, and shows that Trump has a roughly 225,000-vote lead in the state with 92% of votes counted as of press time.  ND (1:15 a.m. ET) Another swath of Fairshake-backed candidates have won their reelection bids, including New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer, Texas Republican Monica De La Cruz, Texas Democrat Julie Johnson, Iowa Republican Zach Nunn, New York Democrat Thomas Suozzi, Wisconsin Republican Bryan Steil, Nebraska Republican Mike Flood and Montana Republican Troy Downing, per the AP. There is still no AP call for Senate candidates Elissa Slotkin (Michigan) or Ruben Gallego (Arizona), both Democrats backed by Fairshake.  As of press time, Republicans hold 184 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 159. Decision Desk HQ projected that Democrats would flip the House, similarly to how Republicans flipped the Senate.  In the presidential contest, Donald Trump holds 247 electoral college votes, winning Georgia and Nebraska's first district. Kamala Harris holds 214 electoral college votes, winning New Hampshire.  ND (12:18 a.m. ET) The Republican Party has retaken the U.S. Senate after flipping a handful of seats in the evenly held body, raising hopes for comprehensive crypto legislation in the next Congress.  The Senate was composed of 50 Republicans, 47 Democrats and three independents during the last legislative term, though the independents caucused with the Democratic Party. Because the Democrats also controlled the White House during that time, they held the majority, with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as the tie-breaker on evenly split votes.  Republicans were expected to flip the Senate during 2024's election, with a number of seats – including Montana and Ohio – predicted to turn red. Ohio, where Democrat Sherrod Brown lost his seat, and West Virginia, where Joe Manchin, an Independent who caucused with Democrats, retired.  With the Republican win, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is likely to become the chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Development, letting him steer the agenda for at least some crypto legislation. During a panel talk in August, he floated the idea of a subcommittee focused on digital assets.  Democrats will need to choose a new leader for the committee after current chair Brown lost his reelection fight against challenger (and crypto fan) Bernie Moreno.  ND (12:10 a.m. ET) Democrat Adam Schiff will be the next Senator from California, AP projected earlier Tuesday night. Republicans have 50 Senate seats as of press time, with Wyoming's John Barrasso keeping his seat. While the AP has not yet called Montana or Nebraska's Senate races, it's projecting a narrow Republican win in Nebraska for Debra Fischer, and Republican Tim Sheehy leads against incumbent Democrat Jon Tester in Montana. If either one of these races is called with its current project, Republicans will have an outright majority and flip the Senate.  As of press time, Donald Trump still leads in the electoral college with 230 votes. Kamala Harris has narrowed the lead somewhat, and now has 210 electoral college votes, after winning Colorado and New Mexico. Nebraska's second district is also being called for Harris, as is Hawaii. Maine's split electoral college votes have yet to be called by AP, and Nevada has not yet begun reporting. The first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes will win the presidency.  JH (12:10 a.m. ET) As Election Day has turned into tomorrow, a couple more races went to crypto-backed future members of Congress. At last count, 31 of the Fairshake 58 had won their contests. The latest included Bob Onder, a Missouri Republican, Shomari Figures, a Democrat from Alabama and Representative Angie Craig, a Democrat from Minnesota. Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who served as the House Majority Whip for the last two years, also easily won reelection. But several of the remaining races are close, leaving them more difficult for the Associated Press to declare a winner.  Democrat Brad Sherman, a vocal crypto skeptic, similarly won his reelection bid to represent California for another two years.  MH (11:45 p.m. ET): Polymarket now has 91% odds of Trump winning the popular vote, 95% of winning the election. Bitcoin is up 9% on a 24-hour basis to $74,651.88 after reaching a 24-hour (and all-time) high of $74,977.44.  ND (11:29 p.m. ET) Republican Bernie Moreno, a staunch crypto supporter and former blockchain entrepreneur, unseated Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, bringing the GOP just one seat away from flipping the U.S. Senate, AP projected Tuesday night.  Brown has run the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Development for the last four years, and while he's held a number of hearings on crypto and crypto-adjacent issues, the lawmaker has not moved any legislation addressing the sector. He faced heavy opposition from the crypto industry, with the Fairshake super political action committee pouring $40 million into unseating him and supporting Moreno.  With his loss, Democrats will need to choose a new leader for their caucus on the committee. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), perhaps the archetype crypto skeptic in the Senate, has the seniority to take Brown's spot.  In the presidential race, AP projects Donald Trump will win at least 230 electoral college votes, while Kamala Harris will win at least 187. Trump added Idaho and North Carolina to his running total, while Harris won Oregon, Washington and California, as well as Maine's first district. Maine's second district (one electoral college vote) and stateside vote (two electoral college votes), as well as Nebraska's first and second districts (one electoral college vote each) have not yet been called.  JH (11:22 p.m. ET) Of the 58 candidates backed by the industry's Fairshake PAC, the 24 contests that the Associated Press has called are all in the win column. That's – so far – 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans. The latest names heading to or returning to the House of Representatives include five Democrats from New York: Timothy Kennedy, George Latimer and incumbents Daniel Goldman, Ritchie Torres and Ryan Patrick. Also in the Democrat column are Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, Johnny Olszewski of Maryland, Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, who'd won her primary contest by 39 votes after $1.4 million in crypto industry support. The latest Republicans to win were Tim Moore of North Carolina and incumbent Representative Dusty Johnson of South Dakota.  ND (10:45 p.m. ET) Utah has voted in John Curtis for Senate, AP projected. Curtis, a Republican Congressman who ran against Democrat Caroline Gleich, received around $2 million in support from Defend American Jobs, a political action committee affiliated with the Fairshake super PAC. As a congressman, Curtis voted in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, as well as a resolution that would overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121.  Rep. French Hill, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee and the chair of its digital assets subcommittee, won reelection as well, per AP.  MH (10:15 p.m.) Prediction markets have flipped on the popular vote, with both crypto-based offshore platform Polymarket and regulated U.S. exchange Kalshi now calling it for Trump, at odds of 68% and 60% respectively.  ND (10:15 p.m.) Texas Senator Ted Cruz is projected to win reelection, leaving Republicans just three seats away from taking the majority in the Senate. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown remains in a tight race against Republican Bernie Moreno, while results in Montana, where incumbent Democrat Jon Tester faces longshot odds to keep his seat, have only just begun trickling in.  MH (10:10 p.m. ET) Bitcoin is up 8% on a 24-hour basis at $73,415.45 according to CoinDesk data and nearing its previous all-time high just shy of $73,8000, likely reflecting enthusiasm over positive early returns for Trump. Other data sources have BTC already past ATH.  JH (10:00 p.m. ET) The Fairshake 58, as predicted, are so far blazing their way into Congress with no losses yet among the races called by the Associated Press. The House of Representatives will get a lot of new names who received heavy crypto backing, plus the return of several incumbents with records of industry support, such as Representative William Timmons. The South Carolina Republican is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, the committee that's made the most progress in crypto legislation, and has authored a bill himself. Other newly minted House members will be Wesley Bell, a Missouri Democrat, and Sarah McBridge, a Delaware Democrat. This marks the first dozen wins for Fairshake.  ND (10:00 p.m. ET) Utah and Montana are expected to support Donald Trump, the AP reported.  CL (9:40 p.m. ET) Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been re-elected in New York. Gillibrand, along with Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) (who is not running for reelection in 2024) introduced a bipartisan stablecoin bill earlier this year and has been a strong supporter of the crypto industry.  ND (9:15 p.m.) The AP called Ohio and Texas for Donald Trump, growing his electoral college lead to 177 votes, versus Kamala Harris' 99. The Ohio Senate race between Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican Bernie Moreno appears to be too close to call, and has been see-sawing between the two candidates all night. Roughly 51% of votes have been counted, with Moreno seeing a slight lead as of press time, AP said.  JH (9:05 p.m. ET) The wins keep coming in the Fairshake 58, with nine victories so far called by the Associated Press, including the first Democrat: Rob Menendez Jr. from New Jersey, the son of Senator Bob Menendez. The latest wins among Fairshake-backed Republicans include Riley Moore of West Virginia, Craig Goldman of Texas and Tom Cole of Oklahoma.  ND (9:05 p.m. ET) The AP has called Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, two of Nebraska's districts and Louisiana for Donald Trump, bringing him to 120 electoral college votes. Kamala Harris is projected to win the state of New York, bringing her total to 99 EC votes.  ND (8:40 p.m. ET) The AP is projecting Kamala Harris won the states of Illinois, New Jersey and Delaware, adding to her electoral college total with 71 overall EC votes. Donald Trump is projected to win Arkansas, bolstering his electoral college lead by bringing it to 101 total votes.  JH (8:39 p.m. ET) Representative Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky, will keep his seat in the House of Representatives, bringing in almost two thirds of the vote in the ongoing tally on election night. That means he'll likely stay in the running for taking over the gavel in the House Financial Services Committee if Republicans retain the House. Barr had put himself forward to replace the retiring Patrick McHenry to lead the committee that's been the tip of the spear for crypto legislation in Congress. In this election, Barr had been among the 58 congressional candidates backed by industry PAC Fairshake, so the crypto sector has hopes for him. He's among at least five early winners among the Fairshake candidates, with no losses on the board, yet.  ND (8:15 p.m. ET) Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, bête noire of the digital assets industry, kept her seat after facing a challenge from Republican (and crypto supporter) John Deaton in Massachusetts.  Warren, one of the most crypto-skeptical members of Congress, ran well ahead of Deaton, a consumer attorney perhaps best-known in crypto circles for his work with XRP holders in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Ripple.  Deaton told CoinDesk in September that he expected the race to be close, though polling through October suggested he never ran less than 20 points behind Warren.  ""This race is winnable,"" he said at the time. ""I believe that we're going to be pleasantly surprised at how competitive this race is going to be.""  ND (8:10 p.m. ET) The Associated Press is projecting Donald Trump won the states of Oklahoma, Missouri, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina, while Kamala Harris won the states of Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Trump now has 95 electoral votes, to Harris' 35.  In more local results, Republican Brian Jack will represent Georgia in the House of Representatives for the next two years. Jack received $1.3 million from Defend American Jobs, a political action committee affiliated with the Fairshake super PAC. In New Jersey, Democratic Congressman Andy Kim will succeed Senator Bob Menendez in representing the Garden State in the Congressional body.  Trump's odds of winning the election have risen to as much as 70 cents on Polymarket, though had dropped slightly to 68.5 cents as of press time.  CL (7:42 p.m. ET) Republican Jim Justice has won a senate seat in West Virginia, replacing outgoing Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. Justice, the current governor of West Virginia, received over $3 million from pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake. He has previously said that he supports a ""clear regulatory framework"" for digital assets and is against the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). His win brings Republicans one step closer to potentially flipping the U.S. Senate from Democrat control.  The Associated Press projected Donald Trump would win West Virginia's electoral college votes, bringing his total to 23.  TC (7:40 p.m. ET) Bitcoin and Solana rise as Trump Polymarket odds in Georgia and Pennsylvania surge  BTC and SOL are up 1.7% in the last 30 minutes and trading at $70,800 and $170 respectively, possibly because of former President Donald Trump’s rising odds in the swing states of Georgia and Pennsylvania. Bettors on Polymarket now give Trump a 79% chance of winning Georgia, compared to 68% as of 6:25 p.m. ET, and a 58% chance of winning Pennsylvania, compared to 54%.  ND (7:05 p.m. ET) Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) won election to the U.S. Senate, AP reported just past 7:00 p.m. ET, and will succeed Sen. Mike Braun, who successfully ran for governor of the state. Banks, who defeated Democrat Valerie McCray, received $3 million in support from Defend American Jobs, a political action committee affiliated with the Fairshake super PAC.  The AP also said Sen. Bernie Sanders won reelection to represent the state of Vermont; Donald Trump is projected to win the electoral votes from Kentucky and Indiana, while Kamala Harris will win Vermont's electoral votes.  Mark Messmer, an Indiana state legislator who received $500,000 in backing from Defend American Jobs, won election to the U.S. House representing the state.  TC (6:25 p.m. ET) WHAT'S POLYMARKET SAYING ABOUT THE SWING STATES?  Users of crypto betting site Polymarket seem to think that Trump has the advantage over Harris in a number of swing states.  As of around 23:40 UTC, the market is giving Trump 54% odds of winning Pennsylvania, a 68% chance in Georgia and in North Carolina, 56% in Nevada, and 82% in Arizona. Harris, meanwhile, is leading in Michigan with 61% odds of winning. The two candidates are tied in Wisconsin. At the time of writing, these markets each have between $9 million and $25 million in bets.  Polling aggregates from FiveThirtyEight show Harris and Trump neck-to-neck in Pennsylvania and Nevada, with Trump leading Harris in Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. Harris has the advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin.  The Super Model's analysis of top-performing Polymarket traders' state-level bets has flipped. It now favors Trump to win the electoral college 281-257. Polymarket as a whole sees him winning 297-241.  The reversal ""suggests early bits of data are good for Trump but not yet understood by the broader market,"" where the signal has mainly stagnated, says trader Flip Pidot. ""The battlegrounds have gone from showing Harris undervalued in 7/7 states to now just 4/7 (with Trump undervalued in Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania).""  CRYPTO LOOKING FOR A LIFT  Crypto is hoping for an post-election lift, because it’s been an ugly year for most major crypto assets so far. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and exchange tokens — is up 12% on the year, that’s mostly thanks to bitcoin {{BTC}}, which has gained 59%. Bitcoin is weighed at 31% in the index, while ether {{ETH}} is worth 20%. The fact that these two assets are up year-to-date means that the bloodbath suffered by most of the other cryptocurrencies in the index has been somewhat concealed.  Polygon {{MATIC}} has plunged 71% since the start of the year, despite the breakout success of betting website Polymarket, which is hosted on the blockchain. Cosmos {{ATOM}}, polkadot {{DOT}} and avalanche {{AVAX}} — smart contract platforms that rose to prominence in 2021 — also performed badly, down 64%, 55%, and 41% each. Ether, of course, has disappointed expectations despite gaining its own spot exchange-traded funds, but at least the coin is up 6%.  The real winner of the year is dogecoin {{DOGE}}, up 76% since December. It’s worth noting that the original memecoin put in most of that performance in the last couple of months; the coin began rising in early September alongside bitcoin and former President Donald Trump’s odds on Polymarket, just as Tesla creator Elon Musk ramped up his efforts to help Trump get re-elected.  JH (4:30 p.m. ET) FAIRSHAKE HAS MOVED ON TO 2026  If the crypto sector enjoys what Fairshake did with its mountain of money, the firms will probably like 2026, too. Of the $169 million raised in this cycle, officials of those affiliated political action committees said about $30 million was left over for the next congressional elections.  That $30 million paired with another $25 million promised from Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and a $23 million commitment from a16z — both said to be planned for the opening of the next cycle — will start the industry PAC off with a whopping $78 million for an election cycle that doesn't even include a presidential race. The campaign-finance dominance from the crypto industry is only just beginning with Fairshake's 2024 performance, it seems. Starting with the GMI PAC in 2022, the sector has a definite strategy toward a crypto-friendly U.S. Congress.  WHAT THE BIGGEST TRADERS ON POLYMARKET SAY  Flip Pidot, co-founder and CEO of American Civics Exchange, an over-the-counter dealer in political futures contracts ... ""curated a list of the top performing traders on Polymarket and built an electoral college forecast based on their bets alone. As of mid-afternoon Tuesday in New York, this ""elite"" model projects Harris will win 276-251, whereas Polymarket as a whole sees Trump winning 287-262.  DIVIDED CONGRESS MAY BE … GOOD?  The best way to get a good crypto bill at this point — meaning one that will last and stand up to party politics — would be if the chambers of Congress remained divided, as they are now, argued Jaret Seiberg, a longtime financial policy analyst in Washington.  ""Divided government is likely the most important outcome for crypto as we believe that is what produces a bipartisan regulatory structure that will remain intact regardless of what happens in future elections,"" he wrote in a note for TD Cowen clients. In this session that's winding down, the Senate has been controlled (barely) by Democrats, and the House had a very narrow majority in the House of Representatives, leaving the two chambers in divided hands. Crypto legislation did manage to wind its way through the House for the first time, but it made no real progress in the Senate. If it had, it would have required a carefully negotiated compromise.  ""That matters as we see policy stability as critical to the further development of the crypto sector,"" Seiberg argued. A bill driven entirely by one side of the aisle becomes an easy target when the tables turn.  FINAL OUTCOME OF 2024 POLLING IS A SHRUG  Two of the most prominent U.S. polling-analysis operations – 538 and Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin — based in similar statistical and political modeling, both concluded after careful study that the outcome of the presidential election is … a total mystery. Both operations suggested Vice President Kamala Harris has an advantage so slight that it's laughably unhelpful in the polling world, in which margins of error knock any meaning out of such a tight conclusion.  In a hundred election simulations run by 538, stirring in the witches brew of battleground analysis and economic conditions, she wins 50 matchups to former President Donald Trump's 49. The other goes to an electoral-college tie, which favors Trump. In most scenarios, Harris easily wins the popular vote — an outcome without political meaning, thanks to the U.S.'s electoral-college approach to the election.  Nate Silver's own secret sauce, he needed to stretch the decimal places to indicate the distinction: Of 80,000 final simulations run by his site, Harris won 50.015% of the time, to Trump's 49.985%.  All seven battleground states have been so close that they're within the polling's margins of error, as well, leaving this closely examined contest a genuine coin toss, according to the analytical gurus.  FAIRSHAKE SET UP FOR A HAPPY ELECTION NIGHT  Crypto's campaign-finance arm Fairshake drew so much attention in the 2024 elections, and for good reason, since the industry dominated the political donations scene with its $169 million war chest. But the Fairshake political action committee and its affiliate PACs — backed mostly by crypto firms including Coinbase, Ripple and a16z — devoted their spending to congressional races only, choosing not to get into the presidential contest. The outcome: The effort is almost guaranteed to pay off with at least a couple of dozen new members of Congress that crypto dollars helped into Washington.  And Fairshake made a careful division of its party giving (managing to anger both sides in the process). Its final list of 58 congressional candidates the groups supported included 30 Democrats and 28 Republicans. Many of those were already incumbents and crypto allies, but the PACs pursued a strategy during the primaries to help elevate crypto-friendly winners in districts in which their candidate's party was strongly favored to win in the general. That way, the general election is meant to be a night of victorious news.  The same strategy worked for its earlier iteration, GMI, in the 2022 congressional elections.  CRYPTO'S OHIO RISK  Crypto PAC Fairshake's biggest focus was in Ohio, where the PACs dedicated tens of millions to sink crypto skeptic Sherrod Brown, the state's longtime Democratic senator, and lift blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno, a Republican.  The industry arm took a controversial risk with this one. Sherrod Brown is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which will likely have a major hand in whatever crypto legislation clears Congress. If the Republican challenger doesn't manage to knock Brown off, the crypto industry has cemented its antagonistic relationship with Brown as he keeps walking the Senate halls — a possibility that has some in crypto lobbying circles nervous.  However, this chess is definitely three-dimensional. Because the Senate is statistically more likely to swing into Republican hands in this cycle, the committee chair may be Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina. And he's recently come out as super excited about crypto. So, the industry might be able to clear a Senate bill without Brown's support if the crypto industry fails to get Moreno into that chamber.  PREAMBLE  The U.S. crypto industry is waiting with bated breath for the results of the 2024 election.  Nearly $200 million from crypto-aligned political action committees has gone into supporting favored candidates, but some of the biggest races remain too close to guess who may win.  CoinDesk will cover the election results live over the coming day (or days, depending on how things go), with market commentary and up-to-the-minute alerts on major races we're following – and how they may affect the crypto industry's chances for legislation, regulatory updates and more across the coming months. The biggest race is obviously the U.S. presidential election, with Kamala Harris facing off against Donald Trump.  Polls begin closing on the east coast at 7:00 p.m. EST, but due to the tight nature of some of the races we're following, we may not learn results immediately. Significant lawmakers running for reelection include Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who runs the Senate Banking Committee, Elizabeth Warren, Jon Tester and Debra Fischer.  Read more: Here's Why Today's U.S. Election Matters for Crypto  The electoral map favors Republicans regaining the majority in the Senate. Similarly, Democrats are expected to regain the majority in the House of Representatives.  In the House, there's an open question as to who will succeed retiring Congressman Patrick McHenry, who chairs the powerful House Financial Services Committee. A handful of Republican lawmakers are running to lead their party on the committee.  Crypto political action committees, including the Fairshake super PAC and its affiliated entities, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have supported dozens of candidates across the House and Senate.  We'll also be keeping an eye on the prediction markets, especially crypto-based betting site Polymarket.

35747230,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651694,1730838640,"‘Crypto Has Already Won’, Regardless Of Trump Or Harris Win: Bitwise CIO","Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, declared in an investor note today that the crypto industry has secured its place in the financial world, irrespective of the outcome of today’s US presidential election between President Donald Trump and Senator Kamala Harris. In his note titled “Crypto Has Already Won,” Hougan stated, “There is nothing left to say about Tuesday’s election.” He provided a succinct assessment for investors: “Short-term, a Trump victory is better than a Harris victory. Long-term, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins will thrive regardless of who wins. Altcoins have more regulatory risk in a Harris regime than a Trump regime.” Hougan cautioned that the only unfavorable scenario for crypto would be a Democratic sweep. “It would embolden the fringe element of the Democratic Party that is overtly hostile to crypto. But even in that scenario, I’d buy the dip,” he wrote. Reflecting on the industry’s resilience over the past four years, Hougan emphasized, “If there’s one thing the past four years has taught me, it’s this: Washington can’t stop crypto. It can alter the trajectory. It can speed things up or slow things down. It can bring more confusion or new clarity. But it can’t stop it.” Related Reading: Crypto Expert Discloses ‘Hidden Altcoin Gem’ With 1,900% Upside According to the Bitwise CIO, the presidential election serves as a milestone to evaluate the crypto sector’s growth since November 2020. Despite a combative regulatory environment—including “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” numerous SEC lawsuits, and a host of contradictory or ambiguous statements—the progress made is remarkable. Hougan noted, “We focus so much in crypto on the moment-by-moment movement of prices that we often lose sight of the long-term trends. The presidential election provides a nice opportunity to step back and see how far we’ve come.” ‘Crypto Has Already Won’ He presented compelling statistics comparing November 2020 to November 2024. Bitcoin’s price increased from $13,677 to $69,492, a 408% rise. Ethereum went from $388 to $2,492, marking a 552% increase. Solana experienced a meteoric rise from $1.49 to $165.12, an increase of 10,982%. In terms of trading volume, the CME Bitcoin Futures Open Interest in October surged from $0.57 billion to $10.58 billion, a 1,756% increase. The seven-day moving average of crypto daily exchange volume expanded from $9.68 billion to $39.32 billion, a 306% increase. Decentralized exchange volume in October soared from $12.6 billion to $156.5 billion, reflecting an 11,142% increase. Assets under management also saw significant growth. The Bitcoin spot ETF assets under management, nonexistent in November 2020, reached $71.46 billion by November 2024. Stablecoin assets under management dramatically increased from $3.87 billion to $177.83 billion, a 4,495% rise. The total value locked in decentralized finance platforms increased from $9.57 billion to $139.3 billion, a growth of 1,356%. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Network activity showed substantial increases as well. Monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network grew from 9.28 million to 20.48 million, a 121% increase. Monthly transactions considering Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions saw a massive rise from 33.3 million to 385.8 million, a 1,059% increase. Mainstream adoption indicators also highlighted crypto’s integration into traditional finance and politics. The number of top 20 asset managers with tokenized funds increased from none in 2020 to three in 2024. BlackRock’s adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum, nonexistent in 2020, is one of the biggest stories in 2024. Because of all that, Hougan expressed strong confidence in the continuation of these positive trends. “The question to ask yourself as you look at the above statistics is whether they will continue. From my seat, the answer is a resounding yes,” he affirmed. He outlined several key expectations: spot crypto ETF inflows will continue; stablecoins will continue to grow rapidly; institutions will continue to ‘get off zero’ and add allocations to Bitcoin and crypto; Wall Street will continue to embrace tokenization and real-world assets; blockchains will continue to get faster and cheaper; and real-world applications like Polymarket will continue to break through and gain mainstream adoption. While acknowledging the election’s significance, Hougan minimized its long-term impact on Bitcoin’s and crypto’s trajectory. “Make no mistake: What happens in Tuesday’s election matters, particularly in the short term. But as I see it, over the long term, Tuesday will prove to be something between a speed bump and a wind gust. Neither is going to stop this train,” he concluded. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $68,932.

35744994,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651787,1730835765,"Will The US Elections Propel Bitcoin Past $74,000? Key Metrics To Track This Week","In the wake of the US presidential election, Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing the expected volatility that often accompanies major political events. Tuesday’s trading saw the largest cryptocurrency fluctuating between $68,000 and $70,000, with the latter level acting as resistance since Saturday. Market analysis firm Crypto Birb has released insights into the potential impacts of the election on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, suggesting that, based on current indicators, Bitcoin could reach new record highs above $73,700 in the days following the election. Bitcoin Price Could Soar To Over $263,000 In a recent social media update, Crypto Birb highlighted several key figures for traders and investors, including the upward trends in the 200-week and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $59,200 and $40,700, respectively, which point to a bullish long-term outlook for the Bitcoin price. The firm notes the presence of over $470 billion in volume from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in BTC, further contributing to market liquidity, which is critical for Bitcoin’s price movements to the upside. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum, Will DOGE Smash Through $0.18? However, a market bloat of 51%, measured by the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), indicates that a significant portion of Bitcoin holders are in profit, potentially leading to increased selling pressure if prices rise too quickly. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV-Z Ratio), currently at 1.86, projects a potential price target of over $263,000, suggesting substantial room for growth. Notably, Bitcoin’s low correlation of 0.16 with the S&P 500 indicates that its price movements are largely independent of traditional equity markets, which could attract investors seeking diversification. Historical Trends Suggest Strong November Ahead Despite the bullish long-term outlook, the firm suggests that traders should be cautious of short-term volatility. Crypto Birb noted that the market is experiencing a spike in “price randomness,” common occurrence during election cycles. Key resistance levels are identified at $70,700 and $72,000, which could prove critical in determining Bitcoin’s immediate path. The daily trend shows that $70,000 is a pivotal breakout point, and the firm suggests that a successful move above this threshold could trigger further upward momentum to retest all-time high records. The firm also highlights the current sentiment in the crypto market, which is currently characterized by a “Fear and Greed” index reading of 70, indicating a state of greed among investors. Crypto Birb contends that this sentiment often leads to heightened buying activity but can also signal a potential pullback if prices rise too quickly. Additionally, mining costs are estimated at around $80,700, suggesting miners are operating at a loss if Bitcoin remains below this threshold. Related Reading: XRP Price Gears Up: Is a Major Move on the Horizon? Further strengthening the case for Bitcoin, historical data shows that November has been a strong month for BTC, with an average gain of 14.96% over the past nine years. This means that if the cryptocurrency follows past movements, it could reach $79,000 by the end of the month. In addition, the fourth quarter of the past few years has shown an average gain of 50.86%, with the maximum quarterly gain recorded at 470.44%, suggesting that BTC could be poised for a significant rally in the coming weeks, regardless of the US election results between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $69,830, up 3% in the 24-hour time frame.

The findings indicate that a strategic inclusion of bitcoin and ether within a traditional portfolio framework can significantly enhance risk-adjusted returns, even with a conservative allocation. Focusing exclusively on a portfolio comprising bitcoin and ether we tested various weighting combinations to determine the optimal mix for maximizing the Sharpe ratio. Across all evaluated time periods, the optimal allocation to the ideal cryptocurrency portfolio increased proportionally with the level of risk assumed. In recent years, interest in cryptocurrencies has shifted from being predominantly retail-focused to becoming a significant consideration for financial advisors and institutional investors. While retail investors may have accounted for as much as 80% of exchange-traded-products (ETPs) purchasers, some forward-thinking investment advisors and pension funds have begun to accumulate positions following extensive due diligence. A significant narrative driving this growth is the unlocking of access to ETPs at more broker platforms, which we expect to accelerate in the second half of 2024, and into next year. One of the key pitches for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is its role as a monetary asset and a hedge against chaos and inflation, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin offers a non-correlated, provably scarce asset to diversify portfolios. On the other hand, ether ( ETH-USD ) is more of a pure technology investment, allowing exposure to the growth of tokenization, NFTs, and DeFi (decentralized finance). For investors wanting to capitalize on tokenization, investing in ETH may be the best approach. This comprehensive study evaluates the impact of incorporating bitcoin and ether into traditional investment portfolios, highlighting the potential benefits and risks associated with their inclusion. The analysis underscores how a strategic allocation to cryptocurrencies can enhance portfolio performance, marking a significant evolution in asset allocation strategies. Analysis Overview We conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the impact of incorporating bitcoin and ether into a traditional 60% equity/40% bond investment portfolio, covering the period from September 1, 2015, to April 30, 2024. The analysis comprised five main components: Optimal Constrained Allocation in a Traditional 60/40 Portfolio: We assessed the ideal allocation of bitcoin and ether in a portfolio consisting of 60% equities and 40% bonds, with a maximum combined cryptocurrency allocation of 6%. This analysis utilized 169 sample portfolios with incremental additions of crypto exposure. Indexes Used : S&P 500 Index : Representing 60% of the equity portion. The S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index : Representing 40% of the bond portion. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based benchmark that measures the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, fixed-rate agency MBS, ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency). MarketVector Bitcoin Index: Measures the performance of a digital assets portfolio that invests in bitcoin. MarketVector Ethereum Index: Measures the performance of a digital assets portfolio that invests in ether. These indexes are used as benchmarks to represent broader market performance. Direct allocation to bitcoin and Ethereum may result in different outcomes due to factors such as transaction costs, liquidity and market volatility. To maintain the desired allocation proportions, all portfolios were rebalanced on a monthly basis. This rebalancing helps keep the portfolio aligned with the strategic allocation targets. Drawdown and Sharpe Ratio Analysis: We examined the drawdown and Sharpe ratios of a subset of 16 representative portfolios to understand the risk-return tradeoffs. Our findings indicate that adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially enhance the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with a relatively minor impact on drawdown. Monthly rebalancing was used to manage the allocation proportions and mitigate the effects of price volatility, helping the portfolio maintain its risk and return characteristics over time. For investors with a high-risk tolerance (up to ~20% annualized volatility), an allocation of up to 20% continues to improve the risk/reward profile of the overall portfolio. The optimal bitcoin and ether weights were approximately 70/30, providing the best risk-adjusted returns. Optimal Bitcoin and Ether Allocation in a Crypto-Only Portfolio: We analyzed various permutations of bitcoin and ether weights in a portfolio composed solely of these two cryptocurrencies, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio and determine the ideal BTC/ETH allocation. Efficient Frontier Using the Optimal Crypto Portfolio: We investigated the optimal weighting of the ideal BTC/ETH portfolio to maximize returns at various levels of volatility. This analysis illustrated a segment (with reasonable volatility levels) of the efficient frontier when integrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional 60/40 portfolio. The inclusion of a monthly rebalancing mechanism allowed the portfolios to adapt to market changes while keeping the strategic allocation intact. Time Dependence of Efficient Frontier Results: We considered the impact of different starting points on the results from component 4. The analysis demonstrated that a larger crypto allocation consistently enhanced portfolio risk-adjusted returns across all available time periods. 1. Optimal Allocation in a Traditional 60/40 Portfolio The primary objective was to determine the optimal allocation of bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether within a traditional 60/40 portfolio, with a constraint limiting the combined weight of cryptocurrencies to a maximum of 6%. The analysis involved constructing 169 model portfolios with incremental crypto exposure, up to 3% each for BTC and ETH. The results demonstrated that a portfolio comprising 3% BTC and 3% ETH, in conjunction with 57% S&P 500 and 37% U.S. Bonds, yielded the highest return per unit of risk (standard deviation). In essence, maintaining a conservative overall allocation of 6% in cryptocurrencies, the maximum allowable allocation achieved the highest risk-adjusted returns. Monthly rebalancing was applied to maintain these allocations, helping to manage the volatility and ensure the portfolio stayed aligned with its strategic targets.

The findings indicate that a strategic inclusion of bitcoin and ether within a traditional portfolio framework can significantly enhance risk-adjusted returns, even with a conservative allocation. 2. Drawdown and Sharpe Ratio Analysis To evaluate the risk-return tradeoffs, we analyzed 16 representative 60/40 portfolios with incremental increases in cryptocurrency allocation up to the maximum limit of 6%. The key findings were: Sharpe Ratio Improvement: The portfolio Sharpe ratio improved significantly as the cryptocurrency allocation increased. Minimal Impact on Drawdown: The maximum drawdown increased only marginally, making the higher cryptocurrency allocation an attractive tradeoff for many investors. The data on maximum drawdown and Sharpe ratio demonstrated that a 6% cryptocurrency allocation resulted in a Sharpe ratio nearly double that of the traditional 60/40 portfolio while only modestly increasing drawdown. This highlights the favorable risk-return tradeoff when incorporating BTC and ETH into a traditional portfolio.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Sharpe ratio is a measure used in finance to evaluate the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (such as the return on U.S. Treasury Bonds) from the rate of return for a portfolio and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. This ratio helps investors understand how much excess return they are receiving for the extra volatility that they endure for holding a riskier asset. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return.

These findings show the potential benefits of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional investment portfolios, providing improved risk-adjusted returns with minimal increase in risk. 3. Optimal Bitcoin and Ether Allocation in a Crypto-Only Portfolio Focusing exclusively on a portfolio comprising bitcoin and ether we tested various weighting combinations to determine the optimal mix for maximizing the Sharpe ratio. The analysis revealed that the ideal allocation was 71.4% bitcoin and 28.6% ether. This configuration yielded the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating the best risk-adjusted return for a crypto-only portfolio. The findings emphasize the importance for investors to hold both cryptocurrencies to maximize benefits. Additionally, the naïve allocation of 50% BTC and 50% ETH also demonstrated substantial advantages, reinforcing the value of diversification within the crypto asset class.

The Efficient Frontier When Including Cryptocurrencies To determine the optimal allocation to cryptocurrencies within a traditional 60/40 portfolio while maintaining acceptable volatility levels, we analyzed the optimal weighting of an ideal cryptocurrency portfolio composed of 71.4% bitcoin and 28.6% ether. The objective was to maximize returns while maintaining specified volatility ranges (13%-25%), thus constructing an efficient frontier portfolio using these assets. These volatility levels are typically associated with broad investor portfolios. The resulting scatterplot indicated that integrating the optimal cryptocurrency portfolio into a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially enhance returns with varying degrees of risk.

Time Dependence of Efficient Frontier Results To determine whether different starting points have an impact on the risk/reward profile of the combined ideal crypto and 60/40 portfolios, we repeated the analysis in component 4, while repeatedly moving the starting point one quarter forward. Our only constraint was to include at least three years of returns. As such, we produced 23 sets of results and removed time dependence as a variable from the analysis. Our findings were: The analysis consistently indicated that, across all evaluated time periods, the optimal allocation to the ideal cryptocurrency portfolio increased proportionally with the level of risk assumed.

The study's findings indicate that Sharpe ratios generally exhibited an upward trend with increasing volatility and higher allocations to cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The analysis provides robust evidence that incorporating a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) into a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio can significantly enhance the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio while maintaining a relatively minor impact on drawdown. The optimal risk-adjusted returns for a crypto-only portfolio were achieved with an allocation approximately split 70/30 between bitcoin and ether. While individual risk tolerance should guide investment decisions, the data indicates that a balanced inclusion of bitcoin and ether can offer substantial benefits in terms of return enhancement relative to the incremental risk introduced. These findings underscore the potential of cryptocurrencies to enhance portfolio performance in a controlled and quantifiable manner.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading (for example, the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses). Hypothetical or model performance is designed with benefit of hindsight. Index performance is not representative of fund performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. General Digital Assets Disclosures Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

42415657,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntg9Q,1730833608,"Will U.S. Election Change Crypto? Maybe, but TradFi Giants Likely to Plow Ahead Regardless","Global markets are jittery as traders watch the U.S. election. For crypto, a big unanswered question is whether the results might persuade the giants of finance to curtail or ramp up their ambitions for the industry.  Several experts CoinDesk spoke with agreed that, regardless of the outcome, TradFi is unlikely to back away from crypto.  Crypto traders are betting that Donald Trump winning a second term as president would be positive for digital asset prices, at least in the short term, and a victory by Vice President Kamala Harris would be negative. Large financial institutions, however, seem to be looking past that action in markets and viewing the election as a temporary catalyst that won't derail the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology over the long haul.  “Adoption of digital assets at the institutional level will very much continue globally no matter who wins the election,"" said Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of Identity.com, a non-profit organization providing decentralized identity verification.  Amid the cacophony leading up to Tuesday's election, it's been easy to overlook several positive developments on that front this week. Swift — the TradFi interbank messaging system — partnered with UBS and Chainlink to test allowing digital asset transactions to settle with fiat payment systems across more than 11,500 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. Meanwhile, Citigroup and Fidelity International developed a proof-of-concept for an on-chain money-market fund that includes a digital foreign exchange swap.  That's just this week, building on many other similar stories this year. The point is: Firms such as Swift and Citigroup would be unlikely to announce such things if they feared this week's elections were likely to kill these initiatives.  That said, there is a catch. The question isn't whether the election result will stop the adoption; it's whether it will affect timing.  ""It’s pretty clear to me that the outcome of the election will have a significant impact on the pace of such adoption,"" said Shoemaker. ""If Trump were to win, I think we’d see a flurry of new ETFs in the United States for a wider variety of digital assets. We’d also see an acceleration in the use of stablecoins for payments, along with more and more corporations incorporating digital assets in one way or another into their strategies,"" he said.  Echoing his sentiment, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, the world’s first blockchain geospatial oracle network, said: ""If pro-crypto candidates win out in these elections, then we would see not only broader institutional adoption in the United States but also international organizations like the IMF and World Bank really warming up to crypto in a way that we just haven’t seen yet.""  On the other hand, a Harris win may slow down the pace of adoption due to a more restrictive regulatory regime. (The Biden administration that she's served in since 2021 has tended to be highly restrictive on crypto.) ""If Harris were to win, I still think institutional adoption would happen. But it would happen more gradually,"" said Levin, pointing out that the Democrats are slowly coming around to crypto, including Harris herself, which means ""it will just take more time for growing this Democratic support for the industry to have a material impact on the broader crypto market.”  Shoemaker, however, has a slightly different take on a potential Harris win. He thinks prices of bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH} would be fine under her presidency, given that both assets have already been allowed to be packed up as exchange-traded funds in the U.S. Where it might be troublesome and potentially harm the pace of institutional adoption is how the Democrats will treat other digital assets.  ""I worry that altcoins could tank,"" he said. ""I say this because there’s a decent chance that those like [Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler would be empowered under a Harris Administration, and in turn, a number of digital assets might continue to face intense regulatory scrutiny. In such a scenario, adoption at the institutional level in the United States would likely be slowed and restricted.”  Both points resonate. It wasn't long ago that the crypto industry was drowning in not only an unrelenting crypto winter but also intense regulatory crackdowns. In the wake of FTX's spectacular implosion, many wondered whether something dubbed ""Operation Choke Point 2.0"" — an alleged coordinated effort by the Biden administration to cut the cryptocurrency industry off from the U.S. banking sector — was in action. Many industry players took their businesses out of the U.S. and set up shop overseas.  It wasn't until recently—albeit after Trump's endorsement of the industry this year—that this sentiment started to shift slightly among the Democrats, leading to a softer stance on the sector. However, Gensler will continue to remain a question mark for the Democrats, given his tough stance on crypto, despite the call for his replacement by even Democratic crypto voters.  Read more: How Democrats Have Shifted on Crypto  Also, large institutions crave regulatory clarity. So if Harris wins, the uncertainty around how she really feels about crypto might make them a bit cautious about their exposure to the industry. ""The current market data suggests that institutional investors are particularly sensitive to regulatory clarity, and a Harris administration would need to change their historical stance to provide the predictability they seek,"" said Brian Dixon, CEO of Off the Chain Capital.  ""Institutional adoption under Harris could follow a more conventional path, with an emphasis on compliance and integration with existing financial infrastructure,"" he added, noting that a Trump win, on the other hand, will ""catalyze"" more dramatic market moves.  With election results coming in the hours or days ahead, it's easy to get bogged down in the short-term debate around how the outcomes will change the crypto landscape. However, zooming out, it's worth noting that despite many turbulent market conditions and regulatory roller coasters, the digital assets industry has continued to advance and gained not just more crypto supporters but the attention of giant traditional institutions.  The value of crypto to ""bank the underbanked"" continues to drive innovation in providing better financial services to those who otherwise wouldn't have access to them.  As put by Michael Casey, CoinDesk's former chief content officer who is now chairman of The Decentralized AI Society: “These shorter-term fixations on the market miss the bigger picture of what’s at stake in terms of the place that blockchain technology should occupy in the evolution of the technology that’s impacting our lives.""

35743093,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651676,1730833240,"Dogecoin Price Rally Gains Momentum, Will DOGE Smash Through $0.18?","The Dogecoin price momentum is heating up as it makes another move toward the key $0.18 mark, a level that previously set an all-time high for the popular meme coin. The recent surge in the Dogecoin price has captured the attention of both traders and long-term holders, sparking speculation about a possible breakout that could take it to new heights. With bullish pressure picking up, the widely circulating question is whether Dogecoin has the strength to break through its resistance and finally establish a new milestone. This article aims to explore the recent surge in Dogecoin’s price and assess its capabilities to break through the pivotal $0.18 resistance level. Through technical analysis and a look at current market sentiment, this piece provides insights into the driving forces behind DOGE’s rally and evaluates the breakout chances. Bullish Momentum Builds For Dogecoin Price DOGE has consistently maintained its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, signaling sustained upward movement and a strong bullish foundation. This steady hold above the SMA line indicates a supportive trend for further gains, as buyers have continued to show resilience in defending key levels. Recently, the Dogecoin price rebounded from the $0.149 support level, fueling positive market sentiment and reaffirming the strength of buyer interest at this critical point. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals renewed bullish potential, as the RSI has risen from the oversold zone above the 50% threshold. Currently seating at 65%, this upward shift suggests that buying momentum is gaining traction, indicating a transition from a bearish phase toward a more neutral, possibly bullish stance. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised for a Move: Will It Start a Fresh Increase? Furthermore, the daily chart reveals that Dogecoin is experiencing a strong move on the upside, highlighted by a series of positive candlesticks that suggest sustained buying pressure. This optimistic trend is reinforced by DOGE’s position above the 100-day SMA, a key level that signals continued strength in the current uptrend. As the Dogecoin price maintains this trajectory, market sentiment grows increasingly hopeful, creating a favorable setup for more gains as it approaches the $0.18 resistance level. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is now at 65%, recovering from a previous dip to 56%. If the RSI continues to ascend, it may signal enhanced strength in DOGE’s price action. Moreover, maintaining a position above the 60% mark could significantly increase the likelihood of ongoing bullish momentum and possible breakouts, solidifying the asset’s positive sentiment. Will DOGE Power Through Or Pull Back? The Dogecoin price is nearing the critical resistance level of $0.18, prompting speculation about its potential for continued gains. Should DOGE successfully break through this threshold, it could set the stage for a substantial rally, potentially reaching new highs. possibly leading to the establishment of a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? However, if DOGE is unable to surpass the resistance, it could result in profit-taking, which could cause a drop toward the $0.149 support level and other additional downside targets.

Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} grip on the whole digital asset class rose to a fresh 3.5-year high on Tuesday as alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins continued to struggle against the leading crypto with the U.S. election looming over the market.  While BTC was down less than 4% from last week's near-record high of over $73,000, large-cap altcoins like Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} and Solana's native token {{SOL}} both dropped nearly 10% from their recent highs. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 declined nearly 6%  Smaller cryptos fared even worse, as the combined market capitalization of altcoins excluding the top 10 largest cryptos, shown as OTHERS on TradingView, plummeted to the lowest relative to bitcoin since early 2021.  The price action propelled bitcoin’s market cap dominance, which measures BTC's share of the total crypto market capitalization, to 60.6%, its strongest level since April 2021.  ""Altcoins are now seeing severe drawdowns whenever BTC pulls back,"" Bitfinex analysts said in a Monday report.  ""With BTC absorbing most of the capital flow into crypto assets, altcoins are struggling to keep up, and without a fresh catalyst, their prospects for a comeback in the near-term appear slim,"" the authors added.  Speculative interest that supported altcoin outperformance during brief periods have vanished, as funding rates on perpetual futures markets normalized, the report noted.  Bitcoin's winning streak against alts may continue for a while, Bitfinex analysts forecasted.  ""We believe that the altcoin market may experience further declines relative to bitcoin in the mid-term, primarily due to the apathy of speculators.""

This means that the election results and the perceived outlook for digital asset regulations will matter more for smaller cryptos than BTC, the report added.  ""Bitcoin’s attributes and wide availability position it to thrive in the medium term, regardless of the [U.S. election] outcome,"" K33 Research analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman said. ""For altcoins, the election is more sensitive,""  ""This implies that the medium-term path dependency in alts should be more sensitive to the election than BTC,"" they added.  Macro strength could provide a tailwind  The elections, and the uncertainty around the outcome weighing on the market, might as well be the inflection point for altcoins starting to catch up with bitcoin, according to David Duong, head of research at Coinbase.  ""I would expect bitcoin dominance to start to kind of plateau here as altcoin names are probably going to take more of a front seat due to the fact that people are going to play them more because of the elections,"" said Duong in an interview with CoinDesk.  He said the election will be a catalyst for crypto prices but likely won’t have an outsized impact, as favorable macro conditions will provide a tailwind to the whole asset class.  ""I would actually say I'm fairly optimistic through probably early to first half of the first quarter of 2025, in part because I think we're in a very strong macro environment and it's been very favorable,” he said. “I do think that we're gonna see us benefit from the elections as well, regardless of who wins.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/05/bitcoin-price-crushing-altcoins-heading-into-us-election-is-there-an-alt-rally-coming-after,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8af7ff792bb5bb88244e907e5c3f3a7359d9593-2808x1678.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35739128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651639,1730827840,"Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again?","Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has revealed that the Dogecoin price has marked a local bottom. He further provided insights into what could come next for the foremost meme coin, with a 100% price rally from its current level on the cards. Dogecoin Price Forms Local Bottom In an X post, Trader Tardigrade mentioned that the Dogecoin price has formed a local bottom signal. He explained that whenever the DOGE Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) bearish cross forms, Dogecoin tends to trade sideways for a week before starting another bull run. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Daily Transactions Surge To 4.68 Million, Will This Push SHIB’s Price Toward $0.00008? With the bearish cross happening now, the DOGE price is gearing up for another leg up, which, based on Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, could happen a week from now. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could witness up to a 100% rally as it rises to $0.28 from its current price. The chart also showed how the Dogecoin price has formed local bottoms and then enjoyed another leg up since its bull run began in September. The DOGE price is up over 53% since September, outperforming the top 100 cryptos by market cap during this period. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi, who had rightly predicted the start of the Dogecoin bull run, also recently suggested that the meme coin was ready for the next part of its bull run. In an X post, he stated that it was nice to see the Dogecoin price back above $0.16, seeing as the meme coin has successfully retested previous resistance levels and confirmed them as support. Master Kenobi further mentioned that the next levels to watch out for after the Dogecoin price reaches $0.23 are $0.33 and $0.73, its current all-time high (ATH). Once the meme coin reaches $0.73, the analyst remarked that the DOGE price will “moon,” indicating a parabolic rally. Daily And Weekly Golden Cross Pending For DOGE Self-acclaimed DOGE lead analyst on X Kevin Capital revealed that a daily and weekly golden cross is pending for the Dogecoin price. The analyst noted that this was happening right before a potential Donald Trump victory and Elon Musk’s implementation of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Analyst Reveals Bear Case That Could Send Price To $28,000 A Trump victory could be the catalyst for a Dogecoin price breakout above $0.20, considering that it will pave the way for Musk’s D.O.G.E proposal which continues to impact the meme coin positively. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently analyzed Dogecoin price action and said that the meme coin was the perfect trade right before the US elections. Indeed, the meme coin might be the perfect trade as it has decoupled from other crypto assets and is the top gainer among the top 100 cryptos by market cap ahead of today’s elections. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.165, up over 10% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Swift’s infrastructure showcased blockchain integration, enabling seamless off-chain settlements for institutional investors on a platform they are familiar with.  Blockchain company Chainlink, global financial messaging platform Swift and the asset management unit of Swiss bank UBS said they successfully wrapped up a pilot testing the ability to settle and redeem fiat cash from tokenized funds.  The project, completed as part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) Project Guardian, showcased how Swift's infrastructure can facilitate off-chain cash settlements for tokenized funds.

""We've been emphasizing for years the need for the large institutional market, where most of the world's value currently resides, to flow into the blockchain industry.

42415673,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntgfY,1730823300,Here's Why Today's U.S. Election Matters for Crypto,"It is Election Day in the U.S. At some point in the coming hours, days and weeks, we'll know which major party wins control of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump might get most of the headlines, but which political party controls Congress probably means a lot in terms of how cryptocurrencies will be treated in the nation, especially in the short term.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  What's next  The narrative  Today is Election Day in the U.S. There are numerous seats up for grabs in municipalities, state legislatures and governors' mansions across the country. There are 435 races in the U.S. House of Representatives, 33 races for the Senate and, of course, voters will choose who will occupy the White House for the next four years.  Why it matters  The next president of the United States will have an important role choosing regulators and potentially even advocating for crypto regulations, taking executive action or lobbying for legislation. This could — likely will — shape the crypto markets in the U.S. for years to come (and, in fairness, this was also true in 2020 and 2016). But this also stretches beyond this one single industry. The makeup of the House and Senate will likewise determine what sort of legislation, if any, is passed in the next few years and how that legislation might actually be implemented. From all accounts, the 2024 elections will be historically tight. Various House and Senate races and the presidential contest appear to be a coin flip.  In other words, if you're reading this, can vote in the U.S. election and haven't yet, your vote may matter a great deal.  Breaking it down  On the crypto front, there exist several paths for legislation at the moment. They largely depend on the outcome of the election — which, it's worth pointing out, we may not know immediately. If one party wins the White House, House and Senate (they take office in January), we likely won't see any further progress toward crypto legislation this year, said Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican and current majority whip. That's because if a single party is poised for that trifecta, lawmakers can just wait a few months to craft a bill that wouldn't require heavy compromise with the other party.  ""If Republicans are in charge, I believe you will see some of FIT21 [the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act] in the final deal. But it may have to wait until — if President Trump is victorious — it may have to wait until he's inaugurated to actually get put into law,"" Emmer said.  If different parties control the House and Senate next year, as groups like Cook Political Report predict, things get more complicated, and a lot more subjective. In that event, lawmakers may be more willing to compromise on legislation this year, Emmer said during an interview in early October. This could see crypto legislation advance as part of the National Defense Authorization Act or a funding bill, whether that's a continuing resolution or a proper budget.  Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat and current majority leader, told listeners at a Crypto4Harris event in August that he believed it would be possible to pass a crypto bill by the end of 2024. Just what that legislation might be is still anybody's guess. FIT21, a crypto market structure bill championed by retiring Republican Representative Patrick McHenry, has long odds of becoming law this year, but it is the bill lawmakers have brought up most when asked in recent months.  Representative Andy Barr, a Republican running to succeed McHenry as chair of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, said last month the bill should be reintroduced next year if it doesn't pass through and become law this year.  ""I think if we do have to reintroduce in the next Congress, if we don't get it done in this Congress, then it does present an opportunity for us to look at changes that might improve the product,"" he said. ""And if the reason why it fails in the lame duck is that we didn't do a good enough job getting enough Democrats on board, then it gives us an opportunity to maybe see what we can do to get the job done.""  Another, longer-shot option is a yet-to-be-introduced bill from the Senate Agriculture Committee, which would be spearheaded by retiring Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow. This bill has faced complications (it hasn't even been introduced yet and faces opposition from the leading Republican on the committee) but in the event of a divided Congress, lawmakers may well decide it's a better vehicle than starting from scratch in 2025.  Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott discussed how this could play out during an appearance at a SALT symposium in August. Under their hypothetical, the bill would likely see some combination of commodities provisions, stablecoin provisions and other banking issues attached to what may end up as a ""very broad financial services bill and then it's got enough flow to pass.""  One issue, she said, was whether there would be enough legislative days after the election for lawmakers to go through this entire process.  Another issue, Emmer said in October, is the Senate has not gotten past the idea stage yet.  ""This is not a time for ideas,"" he said. ""This is a time for something that's already been drafted, vetted and passed. I am not telling you it's going to get in that final deal, but if there is a final deal before the end of the year on funding the government and taking care of this budget … it is possible, with Patrick McHenry retiring at the end of the term, that some or all of that FIT21 bill finds its way into that final vehicle. It's possible. I wouldn't rule it out. I wouldn't bank on it, but I also wouldn't rule it out.""  Representative Wiley Nickel, a Democrat who is leaving Congress at the end of this term after his seat was redistricted, said in an interview last month that a bipartisan combination ""gives us the best chance of moving the bill.""  Again, noting that some of this depends on how the election turns out, he also pointed to FIT21 as a possible bill that can move through the House and Senate before the year ends. Bipartisan support for whichever piece of legislation does move will also ensure it's more lasting, he said.  ""There are really good bipartisan majorities on all these issues,"" he said. ""The point that I just keep making, though, is it's important — if we really want to get things done — we do it together in a bipartisan way.""  Crypto's guide to the election  CoinDesk will run a live blog Tuesday evening in the U.S. tracking election. There are a number of House and Senate races that this industry is closely watching, whether because a candidate has expressed views about crypto legislation or because industry groups have put money into ousting incumbents — or both.  In the Senate, the industry, largely through the Fairshake super political action committee and its affiliated PACs, has pumped nearly $80 million into a handful of races, with half of this — $40 million — going to unseat Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the current chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and support Republican challenger Bernie Moreno; that race is largely even, according to 538's aggregation of polls.  Some $20 million has gone to directly supporting Democratic Senate candidates: Ruben Gallego, a congressman from Arizona running to succeed Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who isn't seeking reelection, and Elissa Slotkin, a representative from Michigan running to succeed Senator Debbie Stabenow, who is retiring. Gallego currently leads against Republican Kari Lake, according to 538. Ditto for Slotkin against Republican Mike Rogers.  Another $10 million indirectly supported Democratic Representative Adam Schiff in his bid for California's Senate seat, by running ads against fellow Democratic Representative Katie Porter during the primary. Schiff won the primary, and now enjoys a sizable lead against Republican Steve Garvey, per 538.  Another $10 million or so has gone toward Republican Senate candidates (in addition to Moreno). Representatives John Curtis (Utah) and Jim Banks (Indiana), and Govenor Jim Justice (West Virginia) have all received roughly $3 million apiece. These races also appear to be much less competitive than Michigan or Arizona.  CoinDesk is also closely watching the Senate races in Massachusetts, where attorney John Deaton is challenging Elizabeth Warren, perhaps the Senate's biggest crypto skeptic, and Pennsylvania, where former Bridgewater Associates CEO David McCormick is challenging Bob Casey.  Democrats currently enjoy a very slim majority through the fact that the Senate's independent members currently caucus with them. Senator Joe Manchin (West Virginia.) is retiring and his seat is almost certainly flipping to a Republican. In Montana, Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, is facing a tight race against challenger Tim Sheehy. In Nebraska, Senator Debra Fischer, a Republican, is similarly facing a tight race against challenger Dan Osborn (an independent). Republicans are favored to take the majority in the Senate, at least for the next two years.  ""This election is one election of the next three cycles … that looks most favorably toward Republicans,"" Lummis said during the panel in August. ""The Democrats are defending more seats in purple states [this year], and in the next two elections, we're going to be on defense in purple states. So the best math for Republicans is this one.""  The House is another story. Like the Senate, it's expected to flip this election cycle, albeit from a Republican majority to a Democrat one rather than the other way around. Fairshake and its affiliated PACs threw a fair amount of money around in the primaries, particularly in races with a clear partisan tilt — meaning a successful primary winner is likely to win their general election as well.  Crypto groups have donated nearly $50 million to House races, supporting both Democrats and Republicans in different races through Fairshake, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress. The latter two entities are affiliated with Fairshake, and all three (plus a fourth group called the Cedar Innovation Foundation) all share a spokesperson.  Support for House candidates include both incumbents, like Josh Gottheimer (Democrat) and William Timmons (Republican), as well as newcomers like Yassamin Ansari (Democrat) or Troy Downing (Republican).  As mentioned above, there are also numerous state and local elections taking place. As we've seen, states may be a bit more speedy when it comes to developing crypto-specific policy than the federal legislature.  Choices  Beyond crypto, there are a lot of issues on the ballot this year — ones voters may even consider to be more important than digital assets. Pollsters haven't even put crypto as a major issue when surveying voters. A narrowly tailored poll commissioned by Paradigm suggested that just 5% of likely voters considered crypto a key issue. Even that poll saw a relatively small sample size and an overall margin of error of 3.5% — though as CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton notes, that margin may grow for subsets of the overall respondents, such as a subset of likely voters who have any sort of crypto interest.  Of course, the candidates, at least for president, reflect this reality. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have spent the past few weeks working their way across swing states to continue making their respective cases. Harris appears to have been trying to build a broad coalition with policy proposals targeted at different demographic groups, while Trump has been making increasingly authoritarian threats about his potential second term.  Trump posted about the Bitcoin white paper's anniversary last week (saying ""Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA!""), and the crypto project he's tied to, World Liberty Financial, has announced it would reduce its token sales goal after sluggish initial demand. However, the bulk of his remaining campaign has focused on appealing to a broader group than just crypto investors — namely, his base. The former president has held a number of rallies in the final days of the 2024 campaign, but the biggest one was held in Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27. That rally saw backlash after opening speakers attacked different ethnic groups, Harris and others. Former Trump White House official Stephen Miller echoed a Ku Klux Klan slogan in his remarks.  ""I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans,"" Trump said when he took the stage, before later saying the ""massive, vicious, crooked radical left machine that runs today's Democrat party … [is] indeed the enemy from within.""  On Monday, Trump said he would impose tariffs on goods imported from Mexico of between 25% and 100%, adding to his campaign's economic pledges to impose tariffs on goods from different countries. The Washington Post notes that Mexico is the U.S.'s largest trading partner, though through his campaign, Trump has also pledged to impose tariffs on other trading partners, including new ones on China.  During her final major campaign address, Harris reiterated some of the policy proposals her campaign has already announced, including a ban on grocery price-gouging, capping the price of insulin and certain other prescription costs and helping people buy homes.  ""For decades as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings,"" she said on Oct. 29.  On Sunday, she tweeted that she would legalize marijuana, something she's promised before during the campaign.

(The New York Times) During Trump's Madison Square Garden event, a comedian made a denigrating joke about Puerto Rico that Trump's campaign distanced itself from. The Times compiled a list of other jokes and comments that the campaign did not distance itself from.

While this is normal price action for Bitcoin, this trend also impacts the crypto industry, particularly altcoins. Historical patterns suggest that altcoins’ performance highly depends on Bitcoin’s price action. BTC’s market dominance has hit 60%, affecting altcoin market performance and restricting its price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival A crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, expects that altcoins will face a steep decline, probably in early 2025, before recovering. In a post, Cowen argues that the market will first witness a substantial loss in value for altcoins before signs of recovery emerge. According to Cowen, the altcoin market will face “a reckoning,” and holders and traders can expect the correct to happen by December 2024 or early January 2025. It looks like the grand finale of the altcoin reckoning has finally arrived. The altcoin reckoning should be over by December 2024 (2nd week of January 2025 at the latest). It has been a long journey, and many gave up along the way, but this process was always going to play out pic.twitter.com/WRVUvIHDTt — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) November 3, 2024 Altcoin Market Revisits 2019 Price Action In a YouTube video, Cowen predicted the price action of altcoins after reviewing Bitcoin’s price and historical trends. The ITC Crypto founder explained that an altcoin market rally will not happen soon due to Bitcoin’s current performance and market conditions. Data suggests that altcoins are losing ground to the world’s top asset, and altcoins can only be appreciated if Bitcoin enjoys a parabolic run. According to Cowen, altcoins’ current market condition is similar to what happened in the bear market in 2019. Altcoins were bearish during this period before gradually recovering in 2020 and hitting new highs after one year. Cowen expects the same story for altcoins in 2025—altcoins’ prices will bottom first before they can start a price rally. Analysts Now Have Mixed Views On Altcoins’ Market Performance In another post, Cowen revisited the Bitcoin/altcoin pairing, saying that this pairing has been losing for three years. He stated that the pairing’s performance aligns with historical trends, with the last two “alt-seasons” happening after halving in 2017 and 2021. BTC Continues Its Crypto Market Dominance Bitcoin continues to lead the cryptocurrency industry, with its market share hitting 60.5%. According to Cryptographic, Bitcoin is enjoying a two-year high, stabilizing market prices within the $68k and $70k range. While Bitcoin continues to show strength, other alternative cryptos saw falling values, with some dropping by 20 to 40%. Related Reading: Six Months, $1 Billion: TON Network’s Explosive USDT Adoption Milestone Traditionally, Bitcoin’s dominance often coincides with declines in altcoin prices. However, many experts say a possible turning point can happen if BTC hits resistance at the 64 to 65.81% range. If it happens, BTC can achieve another all-time high or may move sideways. However, if BTC’s market share falls below 50%, we can expect a price rally for altcoins.

Market participants have linked the sudden uptrend to recent remarks by Elon Musk on Joe Rogan's podcast. Musk notably discussed ""DOGE,"" an acronym for the ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" prompting renewed interest in the digital currency Dogecoin. This development has increased Dogecoin's price substantially at a time when other assets are still in the red. Dogecoin uptrend For context, Musk elaborated on the concept of the Department of Government Efficiency during his conversation with Rogan. He framed the idea as a response to the growing federal bureaucracy, which he believes stifles innovation and growth.In September, Musk revealed that a dog-themed mascot would represent the department, further linking the concept to Dogecoin.Dogecoin Adds $2.5B in Market Cap An analyst observed that Dogecoin's market cap added approximately $2.5 billion during the day amid the Musk remark, pushing the total valuation up by to $25.2 billion. https://twitter.com/Tyler_Did_It/status/1853767474736476305Potential Dogecoin MovementsSeparately, an analyst highlighted how the U.S. election activities impacted trading on the broader market while Dogecoin managed to break out. According to the shared chart, Dogecoin’s price followed a descending channel from October 29 to November 3. However, on November 4, the coin surged above the upper boundary of that channel, suggesting a possible bullish trend. This breakout saw a 7% price jump, with the analyst forecasting a further 24.14% increase to $0.0379.Despite these gains, some caution is warranted. Analyst Ali Martinez flagged the TD Sequential indicator, which suggests a potential market correction on the 4-hour timeframe. With Dogecoin trading at $0.1745, the indicator pointed to a likely retracement to $0.156. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1853737569529331972Overbought Signals ObservedTechnical indicators also suggest that Dogecoin may be entering overbought territory, raising concerns about a short-term pullback.The Bollinger Bands, which measure price movements relative to volatility, showed Dogecoin touching the upper band. This signals that, while the coin is in an uptrend, it could face consolidation or a price pullback soon. DOGEUSDT 1-day Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also supports this cautious outlook. The RSI stood at 69.27, approaching the typical overbought threshold of 70.While this indicates strong momentum, it also suggests that further gains may be limited.

35737568,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100515,1730821979,Bitcoin Forms Double Top Similar to 2021: Here are Key Levels to Watch Should a Drop Occur,"Bitcoin has been showing signs of a double-top pattern, raising concerns of a possible market correction similar to what occurred during the bull market of 2021. Alan Santana, the market analyst who called attention to this potential structure, has warned of a possible bearish move, identifying important levels to watch should the correction materialize.A Familiar Pattern EmergesIn a recent analysis , Alan Santana noted similarities between the current Bitcoin price action and the double-top formation observed in 2021. During that period, Bitcoin reached a peak of $64,895 in April, followed by a higher high of $69,000 in November. This price action led to the formation of a double top, which ultimately resulted in a major downturn.Santana called attention to the pattern of rising volume ahead of the first peak and declining volume before the second. This trend indicated a reduction in market participation, a bearish feature.Interestingly, in 2024, a similar trend is emerging. Bitcoin experienced an initial peak of $73,794 in March amid rising volume. However, as it approached a new high in late October , volume has decreased sharply. Santana viewed the low volume as a strong signal which shows limited retail involvement and a market mainly driven by larger players, or whales. This drop in participation could lead to a major downturn if the double top pattern holds.Bitcoin Risks a Bull TrapFour days ago, Santana cautioned that the latest upward move might be a “fake bullish breakout” or a “bull trap.” He noted that Bitcoin initially pushed above resistance, which often leads traders to become overly optimistic. Bitcoin Potential Double Top Bitcoin Potential Double Top However, he warned that the week was still young at the time, and without a strong close above resistance, there was a risk of a sharp reversal. Market veterans such as Peter Brandt had issued similar cautionary commentaries amid recent upsurges.Santana noted that true breakouts are usually accompanied by a surge in trading volume, which wasn’t evident in this case. The lower-than-expected volume suggested a lack of conviction behind the move, making it likely that Bitcoin could close the week lower. He stressed that if Bitcoin closes below $68,035, it will confirm a bull trap, with a red candle and a long upper wick indicating a failed breakout.However, Bitcoin managed to close the week above $68,035. Despite this, the close resulted in the formation of a Gravestone doji, as recently reported by The Crypto Basic. If it witnesses another weak candle this week, it will confirm this bearish pattern.Key Bitcoin Levels to WatchIn his analysis, Santana identified $70,000 as an important threshold . A weekly close below this level would confirm the bearish scenario, while a close above $74,000 might provide more optimistic signals. However, he emphasized that Bitcoin is trading near a top, traditionally a risky area for long positions. Santana urged caution, suggesting that even if prices briefly move higher, the market could still see a reversal.In addition, the analyst pointed out that several top altcoins are not following Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, which is unusual in bullish conditions. When Bitcoin rallies, altcoins generally follow suit, but the lack of such correlation now supports the idea of a “fake” move, potentially driven by a few large holders rather than broad market support.Santana outlined important support levels to monitor in the event of a downturn. He sees $55,000 as the first major support, followed by $44,000 and $36,000. If Bitcoin fails to maintain these levels, a more severe decline could follow. Long-Term Bitcoin OutlookMeanwhile, in the long-term outlook, Santana believes the current market structure could lead to a deeper correction before the trend reverses. He believes Bitcoin might need several weeks of consecutive red candles to reach a new low. However, he also expressed optimism that once the low is established, the market could experience a sustained rally. This could potentially set the stage for a bull run leading into 2025 following the U.S. presidential election.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/bitcoin-forms-double-top-similar-to-2021-here-are-key-levels-to-watch-should-a-drop-occur/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-forms-double-top-similar-to-2021-here-are-key-levels-to-watch-should-a-drop-occur,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

According to market analytics platform Santiment, there are now 211,540 fewer active Bitcoin addresses compared to three weeks ago. However, the analysis suggests that this trend may precede a price rebound for Bitcoin.Investors Cautiously Exiting the Bitcoin MarketSantiment attributes the recent drop in non-empty Bitcoin wallets to a wave of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors, prompting some to move funds out of their wallets in anticipation of potential short-term volatility.Notably, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market flipped bearish over the weekend, with BTC dipping below $68,000. The downtrend intensified today as Bitcoin revisited $66,803 before quickly rebounding to $68,900.In addition, analytics platform IntoTheBlock highlighted that long-term Bitcoin holders are reducing their positions, although at a slower pace than in past bull cycles. This moderate sell-off signals a shift in investor behavior, with caution prevailing over aggressive exits. It suggests that investors are hedging their positions instead of abandoning Bitcoin entirely, likely indicating a new cycle dynamic amid the current market uncertainty. https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1853491255365222589Current FUD as a Potential Bullish SignalWith active Bitcoin addresses now down to 54.38 million, Santiment noted that market recoveries have historically followed declines like this. The firm posited that a renewed buying interest could trigger upward momentum once the selling pressure eases and the ""dust settles"" from the U.S. election. Uncharacteristic Behavior in Other Crypto AssetsAdditional data from Santiment shows uncharacteristic behavior in other crypto assets as well. The USDC stablecoin, for instance, experienced a drop of 11,600 wallets in a single day over the weekend. This decline in USDC wallet activity adds to the broader market caution amid ongoing election-related uncertainty.On the other hand, Dogecoin saw a spike in wallet activity, with 46,400 new wallets created in just one week. This surge indicates renewed speculative interest in meme coins, even after Dogecoin recently reached a local price peak. Santiment interprets this rise in Dogecoin activity as traders ""gambling"" on the asset, driven by FOMO (fear of missing out).Overall, the decline in Bitcoin wallets and the reduced activity in USDC could be setting the stage for a market recovery once the current uncertainty clears.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/over-211000-addresses-exit-bitcoin-amid-uncertainty-heres-what-history-tells-us/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=over-211000-addresses-exit-bitcoin-amid-uncertainty-heres-what-history-tells-us,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

A Harris administration is expected to maintain the current crypto environment. While less bullish, it shouldn't hinder Bitcoin's growth. Long-term holders should ignore election volatility, while potential buyers might wait for a less risky entry point after the election results. Bitcoin ( IBIT ) had a good run in October but stopped just short of breaking to a new all-time high above the March peak. Political uncertainty capped the rally as polls tightened ahead of election day. This article looks at how IBIT could react to a Republican or a Democrat win and possible approaches to the volatility. A Bitcoin Superpower I don't want to get too political in this piece. Bitcoin has been around for a long time and flourished under both parties. It is very likely to continue higher no matter who wins the election, but the outcome could influence the immediate response and the size of any rally. It is quite clear a Trump administration is seen as a positive for Bitcoin. This is evident in the price action - it rose to a 7-month high in October as Trump rose in the polls and took a slight lead. When the polls tightened again in late October, Bitcoin reversed from stiff resistance at the March all-time high and fell back -9%. Trump v Harris Polls (RealClearPolling) A Trump victory is viewed as a positive for a variety of reasons. His campaign has accepted cryptocurrency donations and Trump has made multiple comments in support of Bitcoin and crypto. During a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Trump vowed to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.” He also added that his government would hold on to ""100% of all the Bitcoin” in their possession. Trump's close associates are also supportive of cryptocurrency. Vice presidential candidate JD Vance, ""a major supporter of digital currencies, also owns between $250,000 to $500,000 in bitcoin, his disclosure form shows."" Then there is former presidential candidate and now close ally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In recent rallies, Trump said, “I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines.” Will he let him go wild with other policies? When Kennedy was in the running for president, he promised to create a Bitcoin reserve. I intend as president of the United States to sign an executive order on day 1, directing the Department of Justice and the US Marshalls to transfer approximately 200,000 Bitcoin held by the US government to the US Treasury to be held as a strategic asset. He then planned to sign another executive order to direct the Treasury Department to buy 550 Bitcoin daily to amass a reserve of 4 million Bitcoin. At the current price of $69k, that would be worth around $270T and take up around one-fifth of the total Bitcoin supply. It sounds improbable, but Kennedy clearly has Trump's ear on a number of topics, and creating a strategic reserve of Bitcoin is something they may pursue. Elon Musk's support of Trump and support of cryptocurrency is well known. Both Tesla ( TSLA ) and SpaceX hold sizeable Bitcoin wallets. Moreover, Elon may be involved in providing financial advice in the new administration and there has been talk he will be involved in the formation of DOGE (Department Of Government Efficiency). This name is obviously a play on the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Elon recently met with Howard Lutnick, the Wall Street CEO heading Donald Trump's transition team to discuss the formation of DOGE. Lutnick is perhaps the most avid of all crypto supporters in Trump's inner circle. This is what he said to YouTuber Anthony Pompliano. I have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to bitcoin and it will be billions...Bitcoin, which is rare and is special, will become ever more rare, ever more valuable, over time it'll be financed just like gold [and] oil. Bitcoin will be way, way, way higher—sometimes lower—you just have to have faith. To conclude, Trump himself has turned from a Bitcoin critic to a supporter and has surrounded himself with people heavily invested in cryptocurrency. There has been talk of the formation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and mining operations. Whether any of this unfolds or not, clearly a Trump administration will be very supportive of cryptocurrency and it has been reflected in the moves in Bitcoin in the last month or so. The Harris Angle Should Kamala Harris win, the cryptocurrency environment would likely stay the same as it is now. There has been talk of regulation, but these are likely targeted at scams and increasing safety should not weigh on Bitcoin prices at all. Harris has said she will “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets.” Indeed, since Democrats won the last election in 2020, Bitcoin has rallied around +385% and huge strides have been made with the launch of crypto ETFs. There is nothing to suggest Bitcoin will stop rallying under a Harris administration. That said, the initial reaction to a Harris win is likely lower as it is the less bullish option. The slight rise in Harris's polls and the drop in Bitcoin in the last week is a reflection of this. Trading the Election IBIT is a Bitcoin ETF that makes it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin in a broker account alongside stocks and other funds. The expense ratio of 0.12% means there is not such a large price to pay for this convenience. IBIT has excellent liquidity which lessens the risk of trading volatile events like the election. One approach to the election is to simply hold IBIT and ignore the volatility. Bitcoin has made a bullish formation on the chart - a cup and handle - and is in a long-term uptrend. Who wins the election isn't likely to change the trend. Bitcoin Daily Chart (Tradingview) If you are a potential buyer, there is a dilemma. Buy now and risk a drop on a Kamala win, or buy later and miss the rally on a Trump win? I can't answer that for you but I do think it is a good idea to have some cash at hand. You may have to buy 20% higher, but a good entry may set up if Bitcoin breaks to a new high and consolidates. On the other hand, you may get an opportunity to buy 20% lower near $50k. Either way, you shouldn't be looking at a large loss by the end of the week. Risks Bitcoin is volatile and the slow consolidation over most of 2024 has lulled many into a false sense of security. It dropped -77% in a year from the 2021 high, mostly in correlation to other risk assets and due to the Fed's tightening cycle. The next drop may not be related to the election at all. The main risk I see is if Bitcoin is used as a source of liquidity for other failing trades. For example, if the USDJPY carry trade were to blow up, Bitcoin could be sold to cover margin calls and re-pay debt. While Bitcoin has a long-term uptrend, short-term swings can be significant and investors shouldn't be complacent with dreams of $100k. Conclusions Bitcoin is in the political spotlight and there is optimism that Trump policies will support a large rally. On the other hand, there are recent concerns that a Harris win will lead to a drop in Bitcoin. This is not due to the threat of regulations or anti-crypto policies, but simply because it is seen as the less bullish option. A drop is likely to be recovered into 2025. There are various ways to approach the election. Long-term holders of IBIT will likely just continue to hold as politics are not likely to change the long-term trend. Those looking to buy may choose to wait until a less risky buying opportunity, even if that happens to be higher once IBIT has broken to new all-time highs.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733155-ibit-politics-in-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35733640.jpeg

42415666,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntgMo,1730820026,Memecoin Creators Hop on U.S. Election Mania With Thousands of New Tokens,"Thousands of election-themed memecoins have been created on Ethereum and Solana over the past 24 hours.  Memecoins issued in line with real-world events have historically been associated with scams and rug pulls.  The Donald Trump-themed MAGA token topped a $150 million market cap following a surge in volume.  While the U.S. election has directed investor focus to bitcoin {{BTC}} and the Polymarket betting platform, the murky memecoin market is also heating up, with thousands of election-themed tokens being created over the past 24 hours.  According to Dextools, more than 40 tokens referencing presidential candidate Donald Trump were issued on the Ethereum blockchain between 06:00 and 14:30 UTC. On Solana, over 100 tokens were created between 13:30 and 14:40. In the past 24 hours, the total on Solana has topped 1,000 tokens.  It's worth noting that memecoins are volatile by nature and the vast majority of these tokens are likely to turn out to be rug pulls or scams.  There are, however, more established election-related memecoins including MAGA and the Kamala Harris-themed KAMA. Trading volume for MAGA, which launched in August 2023, has surged by 27% in 24 hours, taking its market cap above $150 million. KAMA rose by 150% on Nov. 1. It has since tumbled by 50% to an $11 million market cap.  The spike in memecoin creation alongside a real-world event is nothing new. Memecoin hunters and issuers often ride the coattails of hype-fueled narratives in an attempt to ""win big"" by making a viral token. This often turns sour, as seen on last year's Bitcoin Pizza Day anniversary, when memecoin creators made more than $200,000 by rug pulling a series of different projects.

CoinShares said financing conditions need to remain favorable and there needs to be investor demand for the company's convertible debt.  MicroStrategy is tied to its bitcoin holdings, the asset manager said.  MicroStrategy's (MSTR) ambitious plan to buy $42 billion more worth of bitcoin {{BTC}} is not without risks, CoinShares said in a research blog Monday.  The company, founded by Michael Saylor, announced a $21 billion at-the-money offering of its own stock last week to raise capital to buy more bitcoin. This is part of a larger plan to buy another $42 billion of the world's largest crypto over the next three years.  MicroStrategy's ability to successfully execute on its bitcoin acquisition plan is dependent upon a number of factors, according to CoinShares.  The software company needs ""financing conditions to remain favourable, and necessitates demand for their convertible notes,"" analysts Alexandre Schmidt and Satish Patel wrote.  The cost of servicing its debt is also rising. CoinShares noted that in 2021, MicroStrategy was able to raise debt at zero-coupon convertibles, but these coupon rates have since been rising with new issues.  The report said MicroStrategy is also ""tied to its bitcoin holdings,"" adding that there is a risk that if the company chooses to sell some of its bitcoin pile, its valuation premium could disappear. However, Michael Saylor said previously that he is not interested in selling his company's bitcoin holding, saying, ""Bitcoin is the exit strategy.""

The company's ""bitcoin business may have outgrown its software business,"" CoinShares said, adding that cash flows from the legacy operations may not be enough to cover future coupon payments.  The firm's stock has been praised by the investors even after announcing the large financing that will dilute the shareholders. Last week, Wall Street broker Canaccord said that MicroStrategy is one of the best ways for equity investors to gain bitcoin exposure.

Corporate Advisor reported recently that the unnamed fund made the Bitcoin investment in October, following advice from British pension specialist Cartwright. Direct Bitcoin Investment, Not by Proxy Interestingly, the fund invested in the firstborn cryptocurrency directly, instead of through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like most institutions do. For instance, in March, the State of Wisconsin pension took the ETF route while investing in Bitcoin. At the time, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board used 0.1% of its assets worth $164 million to purchase shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). However, the unnamed UK fund took a different approach by directly investing in BTC itself. Corporate Advisor reported that the pension fund initiated the investment after considering several factors such as investment viability, security, and ESG (Environmental, Social, & Governance). To provide adequate security for the investment, the Corporate Advisor noted that the unnamed pension fund would split and manage the private keys to the Bitcoin portfolio across five institutions. The 3% allocation aligns with the pension fund’s long-term investment strategy. Cartwright Encourages Institutions to Invest in Bitcoin As stated earlier, Cartwright played a major role in convincing the unnamed fund to allocate a portion of its AUM to Bitcoin. It is worth mentioning that Cartwright is an advisor to the pension fund. Besides the unnamed scheme, Cartwright also advised other institutional investors to convert a portion of their AUMs to Bitcoin, similar to the approach adopted across various parts of the world. Steve Robinson, Cartwright’s head of Investment Implementation, said the operational procedure around the Bitcoin investment strategy guarantees maximum security and faster profit-taking.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/uk-pension-fund-invests-3-of-its-assets-in-bitcoin-details/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=uk-pension-fund-invests-3-of-its-assets-in-bitcoin-details,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With anywhere between 7% and 21% of Americans holding digital assets —an estimated 18 to 50 million people—crypto investors are emerging as a powerful voting group. A study shows that 73% of these voters say candidates' stances on crypto will affect their decisions at the polls. Crypto voters' potential impact is particularly strong in battleground states. For example, Arizona and Georgia have three times as many crypto advocates as the number of votes that separated the candidates in 2020. Groups like Stand with Crypto, a pro-crypto Political Action Committee (PAC), are rallying voters in these key areas. As Patrick Gerhart of Telcoin notes, digital assets are ""here and not going away,"" and political leaders need to understand this community’s concerns. To back pro-crypto candidates, industry-supported PACs like FairShake, which has received over $200 million in contributions from digital asset players like Coinbase and Ripple ( XRP ) , are actively campaigning. With the upcoming administration likely to have a decisive role in shaping regulations, the industry is investing heavily to ensure a friendly regulatory environment. In response, presidential candidates are taking note. Donald Trump, previously a critic of crypto, now positions himself as a pro-crypto candidate, even proposing a bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve and regulatory easing. Trump recently headlined a major bitcoin conference, though some crypto advocates question if he will follow through on these promises. Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration has generally taken a stricter stance, with regulatory actions and vetoed bipartisan crypto legislation creating an uncertain environment. Advocates argue this has stifled innovation and driven some crypto companies to relocate outside the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has engaged with crypto industry leaders but has not yet announced specific policies. This has left some in the crypto community unsure of what her administration would mean for the sector if she were to take the helm. Currently, polls indicate a 61.6% lead f or Donald Trump over Kamala Harris at 38.4% , reflecting Trump's appeal among crypto supporters who see him as a potentially more favorable candidate for the industry.

35731633,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100485,1730817070,Analyst Speculates Solana Will Retest $180 if This Major Support Holds,"Market analyst Trader-Saylor has suggested that Solana will retest its late October highs if it holds the support zone from its long-term uptrend line. Solana surged to a three-month high of $182 on October 29 as the market gained bullish momentum. However, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency faced a rejection at the resistance level, falling over 9% to trade at its current price.Analyst Trader-Saylor noted that he expected the correction as the general outlook among investors had turned skeptical. The analyst cited global economic unrest, surging inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s unwillingness to slash interest rates as factors sponsoring the downtrend.However, he noted that Solana could still retest the levels above $180, where it was rejected late in October. In a TradingView analysis on November 4, the market speculator gave a crucial level Solana needs to hold before making this bullish push.Analyst Gives Major Support to WatchTrader-Saylor asserted that Bitcoin needs to hold the support zone from its long-term uptrend line before a course reversal. The 1D chart accompanying the analyst’s commentary shows that this support lies around $151.7 Solana TradingView Analysis Notably, SOL would have to correct 7.9% from the current market price to reach the supply zone. According to the analyst, a bounce from support and amid growing investor traction will ensure the coin retests the $180 level.Market Speculator Gives Conflicting Market OutlookWhile Trader-Saylor expects further correction to $151.7 for Solana, analyst Jappier 24 speculates that the ""Ethereum killer"" would trend higher from the current market price. In a TradingView analysis today , Jappier argued that a Solana upside is likely.He noted that the recent Solana consolidation was to “catch traders on the wrong side of the market.” However, the analyst insisted that the higher timeframe structure still looks bullish and expects further uptrends.Jappier’s chart shows an imminent breakout from a bullish expanding triangle on the SOL/USDT 4-hour timeframe. The analyst asserted that the breakout would push Solana to $174.12 before its next stop at $194.53. Meanwhile, he sees the altcoin trading at $200 within this month.In the meantime, Solana exchanges hands at $163.15, with a meager downside in the last 24 hours.

35730980,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651674,1730817027,Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst,"Solana is trading above a critical demand level of around $157, showing signs of a potential bounce after a recent pullback. This critical level has held firm despite market volatility, and now all eyes are on Solana as it attempts to regain bullish momentum. With the U.S. election unfolding and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision just around the corner, this week promises to bring heightened volatility across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Dropped Significantly – Investors Cautions Amid US Election Week? Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared a technical analysis indicating that Solana must break above a key resistance level in the coming days to regain a strong uptrend. Runefelt notes that this resistance has kept the price in check, and a breakout likely leads to renewed optimism for SOL investors. However, the risk of further downside remains if Solana fails to secure a position above this critical resistance. As these significant macro events unfold, Solana’s next moves will be closely watched, as breaking resistance could signal a larger rally in the near term. Solana Trading Within Bullish Pattern Solana has been a standout performer in this cycle, showing resilience as it holds above a crucial support level that previously acted as resistance. This pivotal moment could determine Solana’s near-term trajectory as it battles to reclaim bullish momentum. According to top analyst Carl Runefelt, who shared insights on X, Solana faces a critical test at a descending resistance level that has consistently capped its gains. Runefelt’s technical analysis, focused on the 2-hour SOL chart, highlights this resistance around the $164 mark. He suggests a confirmed breakout above this level would likely propel Solana higher, signaling a return to bullish price action. However, there’s potential for sharp price swings this week, with the U.S. election and Federal Reserve interest rate decision creating an environment ripe for uncertainty and market manipulation. These macro events have the potential to significantly impact Solana’s movement, making the resistance break even more critical. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target If Solana breaches this resistance and establishes support above $164, it could attract bullish sentiment, pushing the altcoin toward new local highs. However, failure to do so could lead to increased selling pressure and a risk of a retracement, especially if broader market volatility intensifies. As such, the upcoming days will be crucial for Solana’s path forward, with traders and investors closely monitoring this key level. SOL Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is trading at $161 after a recent bounce from local lows at $155. This move has established a strong support base of around $155, which has proven crucial in holding off further downside. For bullish momentum to take hold, SOL now needs to clear the $165 resistance level, which would confirm the potential for upward price action. A sustained push above $165 could signal strength and encourage buyers, paving the way for further gains. However, a retracement is likely if SOL fails to break above this critical level. In this scenario, the price could fall back to the subsequent demand zone around $150, which aligns closely with the 200-day moving average (MA). The 200-day MA is a widely observed indicator and often acts as a strong support level in technical analysis, reinforcing the $150 zone as a potential floor. Related Reading: Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect This consolidation phase places SOL in a pivotal position, with price direction largely dependent on its ability to overcome $165. As traders watch closely, this technical setup suggests that SOL’s next move will likely define its short-term trend, with $150 as a key fallback level if the bullish case doesn’t materialize.

In an interview with CoinDesk, MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen didn't express a strong opinion on the branding but rather said the community should make a firm decision and then go back to building.  While Americans head to the polls today to pick a new president, MakerDAO token holders have their say on the protocol's brand.  Voting is open for MKR token holders to gauge their opinion on whether MakerDAO should ""re-center"" the Maker brand and drop the new ""Sky"" moniker, which it adopted in August.  The poll – which is not binding – currently shows that token holders support keeping the Sky brand, although participation is so far quite limited.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, remained neutral on the branding question but instead asked the community to resolve the branding debate and refocus on growth.  “The most important thing is just to make a decision, and focus on what matters, which is the product,"" he said.  Christensen emphasized that changing the name to Sky was not merely cosmetic ""and a lot more than a rebrand,"" saying it was part of Maker's 'Endgame' strategy that introduced new products, like the USDS stablecoin.  One way to track the success of this stablecoin, Christensen said, is through the portion of USDS held idle without earning rewards. Of the over $1 billion in circulation, a small but notable amount are not earning rewards – which shows that it's being held by real humans and not bots as this idle behavior signals organic use, as real users treat USDS like cash, holding it temporarily without maximizing returns.  ""Bots are never going to leave money on the table,"" he said.  However, while the move was still considered to be successful, and the launch of the USDS stablecoin has exceeded expectations, Christensen also acknowledged that the re-branding of Sky was met with challenges that impacted community perception and market confidence.  He noted that the {{MKR}} token's value dropped significantly after the launch of Sky – CoinDesk Indices data shows it's down nearly 40% in the last three months while the CD20 index is up 14% – overshadowing the positive aspects of the rebrand.  ""The price action ended up totally dominating people’s impression of the launch,” he said, pointing fingers at the dual-token structure, which led to confusion.  “It was a half migration. It wasn’t a full rebrand of the token to Sky, so most people still hold MKR,"" he said. ""There are two tokens, and what does that mean? It gets very confusing very fast. The classic case of uncertainty, which is the worst thing you can have in an economy or financial system.”  The poll continues until November 7.

Shiba Inu is swiftly rebounding from the intensified bearish momentum that impacted the cryptocurrency earlier today. While the price of SHIB dipped to $0.00001642 in the early hours, the coin is now trading at $0.00001784, marking an 8.64% rebound.This recovery has sparked excitement in the Shiba Inu community. Bulls now anticipate that the ongoing rebound will continue the bullish trend from last week, which brought SHIB close to the $0.00002 price level.In a recent update, an analyst known as ""World Of Charts"" shared an optimistic outlook for Shiba Inu, predicting the potential for a two-fold price increase. The analysis highlighted a major reversal for the asset, noting that Shiba Inu has recently broken above a key resistance trendline, briefly retested it, and is now poised to break through again.Shiba Inu Seeing Fresh Breakout to $0.000043According to World Of Charts, Shiba Inu has already gained around 50% in profit since the initial breakout from its larger prolonged downtrend. This breakout occurred in late September when SHIB moved from $0.000014 to $0.00002156 in just three days. However, the explosive move preceded a retest in October.The analyst pointed out that Shiba Inu is now approaching a descending broadening wedge formation and expects a potential 2x price increase (200% surge) if the breakout proves successful. Shiba Inu chart by World Of Charts Notably, the Shiba Inu breakout in late September lost momentum after SHIB hit $0.00002156 and subsequently dipped to $0.00001553. However, the analyst believes Shiba Inu will break beyond the $0.000021 resistance this time, potentially rallying to the $0.000043 range before losing momentum again.Other Analysts Weigh InShiba Inu attained the $0.000043 level in March before crashing by about 70% a few months later. However, popular sentiment within the Shiba Inu community suggests that the coin may not lose momentum at the $0.000043 level this time. Instead, many believe it could surpass its previous all-time highs and reach new price levels.In a recent analysis , analyst Javon Marks emphasized that Shiba Inu is still heading to the $0.00008 threshold. He noted that the daily chart continues to show a solid bullish pattern supported by the RSI. Marks maintained that the overall target for Shiba Inu remains $0.000081 , with the uptrend to this level occurring earlier than many expected.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/top-analyst-targets-2x-profit-from-shiba-inu-sees-explosive-surge-to-0-000043/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-targets-2x-profit-from-shiba-inu-sees-explosive-surge-to-0-000043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35728695,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24409,1730812381,Bitfinex Alpha | Bình Yên Trước Cơn Bão?,"tải Full Alpha Sau khi “lắc lư” trong phạm vi 8 tháng, tuần trước Bitcoin đã suýt phá vỡ mức cao nhất mọi thời đại trước khi chịu một cú điều chỉnh “sốc óc”. Chúng tôi tin rằng đợt tăng giá này ban đầu là do câu chuyện “ Trump Trade “, sau đó nhường chỗ cho sự không chắc chắn tiếp diễn về kết quả của cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ vào ngày mai. Sự thiếu tự tin này cũng đang được phản ánh trên thị trường quyền chọn Bitcoin. Vào đêm trước ngày bầu cử, thị trường coi chiến thắng của Đảng Cộng hòa là thuận lợi cho BTC, trong khi chiến thắng của Đảng Dân chủ khiến triển vọng trở nên mơ hồ hơn. Tỷ lệ cược trung bình cho chiến thắng của Trump đã giảm từ 64,9% xuống 56%. Trên thị trường quyền chọn, biến động ngầm đầu kỳ hạn cho các hợp đồng có thời hạn đáo hạn sớm nhất lại yên ắng một cách bất thường cho đến ngày bầu cử (ngày 5/11). Sự biến động câm lặng này cho thấy các nhà đầu tư đang nín thở chờ đợi kết quả. Tuy nhiên, biến động dự kiến ​​sẽ bùng nổ vào khoảng ngày 5 đến ngày 8 tháng 11, điều này có thể thúc đẩy các biến động lớn hoặc, nếu không thành hiện thực, báo hiệu sự thận trọng sâu sắc hơn của thị trường. Thị trường altcoin cũng đang ngủ đông, với sự thống trị của Bitcoin đạt trên 60% — mức cao mới của chu kỳ . Altcoin hiện đang chứng kiến ​​những đợt sụt giảm nghiêm trọng mỗi khi BTC điều chỉnh. Ethereum và Solana đều đã giảm khoảng 12% so với mức cao gần đây và ETH hiện đã giảm 40% so với đợt tăng giá ETF ban đầu. Sự quan tâm đầu cơ từng hỗ trợ altcoin dường như đã biến mất , được phản ánh qua lãi suất tài trợ ổn định và tâm lý thị trường ảm đạm. Với việc BTC hấp thụ hầu hết dòng vốn chảy vào tài sản tiền điện tử, altcoin đang chật vật để theo kịp và nếu không có chất xúc tác mới, triển vọng phục hồi trong ngắn hạn của chúng dường như mong manh. Ngay cả với cú điều chỉnh vào tuần trước, khả năng phục hồi tổng thể của Bitcoin kể từ mức thấp nhất vào tháng 9 là điều đáng chú ý. Tóm lại, động lực thị trường hiện tại cho thấy một tuần điện giật phía trước. Cho dù bạn là nhà giao dịch, nhà đầu tư hay người quan sát bình thường, con đường đến ngày bầu cử hứa hẹn sẽ náo nhiệt đối với thị trường tiền điện tử Cuộc bầu cử cũng diễn ra khi nền kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục chứng tỏ khả năng phục hồi kiên cường bất chấp những gián đoạn gần đây do hai cơn bão và các cuộc đình công công nghiệp đang diễn ra. Mặc dù đã có những tổn thất việc làm khiêm tốn và điều chỉnh giảm đối với dữ liệu thị trường việc làm, nhưng sức mạnh cơ bản của thị trường lao động dường như vững chắc với tỷ lệ thất nghiệp ổn định ở mức 4,1% và tăng trưởng tiền lương ở mức 4% so với cùng kỳ năm ngoái. Chi tiêu của người tiêu dùng và thu nhập cá nhân cũng tiếp tục tăng , với chi tiêu thực tế tăng lên và áp lực lạm phát chủ yếu nằm trong lĩnh vực dịch vụ, cho thấy nhu cầu ổn định khi mùa lễ đến gần. Cơ hội việc làm đã giảm, phản ánh nhu cầu lao động giảm, nhưng niềm tin của người tiêu dùng đã tăng vọt, cho thấy sự lạc quan về sự ổn định việc làm. Tăng trưởng GDP trong quý 3 mạnh mẽ ở mức 2,8%, nhờ chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng trưởng mạnh, mặc dù lãi suất cao đã hạn chế đầu tư vào nhà ở. Khi lạm phát vẫn được kiểm soát, Cục Dự trữ Liên bang dự kiến ​​sẽ thận trọng với việc cắt giảm lãi suất, tập trung vào việc duy trì tăng trưởng. Với thị trường lao động, tăng trưởng tiền lương và chi tiêu tiêu dùng vững chắc, nền kinh tế cho thấy khả năng phục hồi khi bước vào mùa bầu cử quan trọng, cân bằng giữa sự mở rộng ổn định với kỳ vọng vừa phải. Những phát triển gần đây trong ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử cho thấy cả những thách thức về quy định và sự tăng trưởng đáng chú ý. Immutable, một nền tảng trò chơi blockchain, đã thông báo về hành động pháp lý tiềm năng từ SEC liên quan đến token IMX của mình, khi cơ quan này tăng cường giám sát các tài sản tiền điện tử. Immutable khẳng định rằng IMX không phải là chứng khoán và dự định bảo vệ lập trường của mình. Trong khi đó, Tether đã báo cáo lợi nhuận kỷ lục trong quý 3 là 2,5 tỷ USD, với hơn 120 tỷ USDt đang lưu hành và 102,5 tỷ USD trong Kho bạc Hoa Kỳ, làm nổi bật sự ổn định tài chính và dự trữ khổng lồ của mình. Giám đốc điều hành Paolo Ardoino đã nhấn mạnh các khoản đầu tư chiến lược và cam kết về thanh khoản của Tether. Tại Florida, CFO của quỹ hưu trí tiểu bang, Jimmy Patronis cho biết ông ủng hộ việc mở rộng danh mục đầu tư tiền điện tử trị giá 800 triệu USD của tiểu bang như một biện pháp phòng ngừa sự kiểm soát của liên bang, cho thấy điều này có thể tăng lên nếu cựu Tổng thống Trump tái đắc cử. Đây là bằng chứng nữa cho thấy vai trò đang phát triển của tiền điện tử trong hệ thống tài chính và các cuộc tranh luận về chính sách, nhấn mạnh ảnh hưởng ngày càng tăng của nó đối với sự ổn định kinh tế.

35727154,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733096-bito-buying-breakout-shakeout?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1730811959,BITO: Buying The 'Breakout Shakeout',"Summary Bitcoin is expected to rise regardless of the US election outcome due to its perception as ""digital gold"" and anti-fiat currency. On-chain data shows declining transaction fees and active addresses but increasing demand from ETFs supporting higher BTC prices. BITO offers Bitcoin exposure without centralized custody risks, but it underperforms spot ETFs due to its expense ratio and option rolling strategy. Bitcoin's strong narrative and historical performance in November suggest the potential for significant price appreciation, despite inherent risks in the mining model. Back in July, I wrote about the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) for Seeking Alpha, with the primary angle being the role of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the 2024 general election in the United States. At that time, I pointed out how the Biden Administration's regulatory agencies had seemingly pivoted on what had previously been staunch anti-crypto actions. I also wrote that there was even a chance Democratic candidate for president and current VP Kamala Harris would speak at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee. The latter of which did not happen despite former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump speaking at the event. More than three months later, election day in the United States has come. Regardless of who is ultimately inaugurated in January, Bitcoin's trajectory will likely continue higher due to the belief that it is ""digital gold"" or anti-fiat currency. Neither Harris nor Trump are likely to address concerns about the US budget deficit. Thus, It is widely expected by many in the digital asset industry that Bitcoin will rise with or without a friendly US government. In this update, we'll look at some of the recent signals from on-chain data as well as lay out whether or not BITO is the right way to play a potential Bitcoin ride to a six-figure coin price in this cycle. On-Chain Data Over the last three months, Bitcoin's $59.4 million in transaction fees was the weakest quarter for network fees since Q1-22. In the chart below, fee revenue is orange and revenue from new supply is white: Bitcoin Quarterly Miner Revenue (Token Terminal) As I've covered in the past, this is not necessarily a good thing for the mining sector long term because coin issuance is hard capped at 21 million. At some point, miners are going to need fees to become a larger share of their revenue if they're going to be sustainable businesses. For fees to become a larger share of miner revenue, the network has to actually be used for transaction validation: Bitcoin Monthly Active Addresses (Token Terminal) If we look at the quarterly average for monthly active addresses on the network, we see 10.1 million MAAs in Q3. This means not only have average monthly active addresses declined for four consecutive quarters, but Q3 average MAAs hit the lowest level since the second quarter of 2018 . It's not all doom and gloom, though: Bitcoin total holders (Token Terminal) BTC holders hit 69.1 million in Q3-24. This is more than double the 26.9 million holders during that same Q2-18 referenced above. Bitcoin's on-chain holder adoption does appear to be slowing, however. Compared with the 64.8 million token holders in Q4-23, Bitcoin holders are up just 7% in 2024 despite making a new all-time high earlier this year and sniffing another one in October. Raw holder balance may not necessarily be the best way to get a read on medium-term price signals. For that, we can look to the ""HODLers,"" or addresses that have dormant BTC. Bitcoin HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) HODLer balance as measured by IntoTheBlock is 12.7 million BTC. This would be down from the 13.8 million BTC at the end of January but well ahead of the lows from the last price cycle peak. HODLers generally sell into BTC price strength and re-acquire supply when the price has already peaked. Thus, I actually think it's a good sign that supply is leaving HODLers if it can lead to an increase in fees paid to miners. But all of this is essentially setting up for higher BTC prices regardless of whether or not coins are moving on the chain and generating fees for miners. And the reason for that is simply one of supply. Bitcoin Annual Inflation (IntoTheBlock) Bitcoin's annual inflation rate is down to 1.3%. Since the launch of the network, the rate of inflation has always declined due to the hard supply cap of the currency. Thus, lower supply coupled with increased demand for that supply from products like ETFs helps to mitigate the lack of network transaction fees for miners through revenue from coin price appreciation. And we're certainly seeing that ETF demand story manifest: BTC Supply (BitcoinTreasuries) As of article submission, ETFs and other centrally managed investment products have control over nearly 6% of BTC supply. And if we include MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) in that category, it's almost 7% of supply. If we add holdings from governments and private companies, the share of supply held by centralized entities is 12.5%. Technicals and Seasonality Purely from a technical perspective, Bitcoin has broken out of a 7-month-long consolidation that has seen the coin generally trading in a range where low-to-mid $50k prices are buys and mid-to-high $60k prices are sells. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) At the end of October, BTC broke out of this range and is now in the process of back-testing the breakout. In the weekly chart above, I'm showing the range with 8-week and 20-week moving averages. These are the Bitcoin MAs that I've generally liked looking at for several years. Currently, we see the 8-week ahead of the 20-week and the coin price is ahead of both of them for an eighth consecutive week. Notably, the 8-week is headed higher. In my view, any short-term pullback down to this MA is likely a market weak-hand shakeout and a buy. The seasonality for BTC is still terrific: Bitcoin Monthly Seasonality (TrendSpider) In the last 11 years, November has been one of the better months of the year for BTC price appreciation with a 6.2% mean change and a positive return coming 55% of the time even when counting the early negative returns of November 2024. However, during the years when Bitcoin is in a sustained uptrend, November has historically been an explosive month. November produced a 53% return in 2017 and a 43% return in 2020. Bitcoin Strategy ETF Data by YCharts If we're judging Bitcoin investment products purely on total return, BITO is not necessarily the best option compared to the spot ETF products that were approved earlier this year. Even when including the dividend payments from the fund, BITO's total return since the approval of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) has been 600 bps behind both IBIT and the coin itself. For traders who pop in and out of BITO, this is probably not a big deal as the underperformance may not be felt over a shorter period of time. However, for longer-term holders, the fund's 0.95% expense ratio and option rolling strategy will eat into long-term returns. That said, there is a compelling case to long BITO if one is a strong enough proponent of self-custody principles but still wants Bitcoin exposure in a traditional IRA account. For instance, an investor could buy BITO for the Bitcoin price appreciation exposure without pushing BTC supply into the hands of centralized custodians like Coinbase ( COIN ). This is likely not a big enough reason for most Bitcoiners to avoid the spot ETFs, but there are perhaps some who would view BITO as a better alternative to the spot funds because of the centralized supply risk. Thesis Risks Relying purely on technical analysis and/or historical performance is not a viable way to invest. TA and historical data can certainly be useful when making an assessment about market sentiment, but they're not the sole reason one should buy shares of any equity, ETF, or digital asset. Just because the price of BTC has performed very well in past Novembers, it does not mean the same will happen again. From a fundamental standpoint, I've been of the view that Bitcoin has flaws. Unlike other anti-fiat assets like precious metals, Bitcoin requires a network of machines to continue transaction validation for the ledger to continue. For instance, Gold that has been mined already doesn't need mining to continue for the above-ground metal to be useful. For Bitcoin, the sustainability of the mining model is very much unproven and that's a risk to both coin price and the network itself. That being said, Bitcoin has a strong following and a strong narrative powering it forward. Summary As global liquidity goes higher, so too do financial products and inflation hedge assets. There's certainly a dollar story at play here as well. But I think the more compelling angle for Bitcoiners and cryptocurrency advocates generally speaking is the fact that these digital assets are designed to live outside the rails of the traditional financial system. Yet, it is the capital in that very system that has been a large driver of digital asset prices. We could absolutely debate whether this is a good thing for Bitcoin longer term but arguing philosophy isn't necessarily going to result in capital gains. For those who wish to get Bitcoin-like price returns in a tax-advantaged account without pulling BTC supply into centrally managed institutions, BITO offers a compelling opportunity. That said, BITO isn't the same thing as buying BTC directly and holding it in self-custody. The latter of which is still the best way to buy BTC if one values the utility of the asset. Ultimately, in an environment where fiat currency debasement is standard operating procedure, savers either need interest on deposits that beat inflation or alternative instruments. I don't expect everyone to look to Bitcoin over more proven inflation-hedge assets, but there is little doubt in my mind that many already have and will continue to do so. I'm not fading the 'breakout shakeout' currently happening in BTC. BITO is a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733096-bito-buying-breakout-shakeout?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35727154.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,997.20 -0.53%  Bitcoin (BTC): $68,771.50 +0.04%  Ether (ETH): $2,437.68 -1.34%  S&P 500: 5,712.69 -0.28%  Gold: $2,741.94 +0.16%  Nikkei 225: 38,474.90 +1.11%  Top Stories  Bitcoin is little changed, having recovered from a dip below $68,000. Aside from today's U.S. presidential election, which has traders seeking clues for the next market move, BTC has also been threatened by activity by Mt. Gox. The defunct crypto exchange transferred over 32,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to unmarked wallet addresses, often a sign of an impending transfer to exchanges, thereby applying selling pressure to BTC. Bitcoin traded at just under $68,800 late in the European morning, little changed in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has fallen just over 0.5%.  DOGE is the only major token in the green, having gained nearly 10% in the last 24 hours. The memecoin has risen over 40% in the past month thanks to the renewed endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk as part of the Republican campaign. Musk has been proposing a Department of Government Efficiency — which is abbreviated as D.O.G.E, a clear nod to the token — as an agency that will make government spending and monetary planning more effective. Observers will expect further gains should Donald Trump emerge victorious, but many analysts are predicting a marketwide surge following the election regardless of who wins.  BTC traders are hedging against potential downside in the aftermath of the election, scooping up put options expiring within the week. A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put option gives the right to sell. Through a 0.25 delta risk reversal we can see that contracts expiring within a week are slightly negative — meaning puts are more expensive than calls — compared to longer-dated maturities of either 2 weeks or 30 days, where the skew reverts to being positive again, researchers at CF Benchmarks told CoinDesk. The pricing for longer-duration options was positively skewed in favor of calls, indicating a broader constructive outlook.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily dollar value of the net flow of stablecoins issued and transferred on the Solana blockchain and Ethereum layer-2 network Base.  The stablecoin transfer volume on Base continues to grow fast, outpacing the activity on Solana, the world's second-largest programmable blockchain.  Base registered a stablecoin transaction volume of $18.1 billion on Oct. 26, accounting for 30% of the global onchain stablecoin activity.

Reports have cited the influence of whales and the upcoming results of the US Presidential elections as catalysts to this price decline. Bitcoin Price Crashes As Market Braces For US Election Results The Bitcoin price seems to have experienced a pre-election crash. It is now trading below the $70,000 mark after declining by over 3.64% in just a few days. Many are labeling this sharp decline to the $68,000 level as the “biggest Bitcoin crash,” signaling that the most significant downturn in Bitcoin’s history has just started. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Market intelligence platform Santiment has noted the recent Bitcoin crash, highlighting the decreasing number of non-empty wallets by investors. According to the analytical platform, there have been 211,540 fewer addresses than three weeks ago. This massive reduction is seen as a sign of intense Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) typically associated with future bullish performance and a strained market. Currently, the crypto market is in suspense mode as investors, both retail and institutional, await the results of the US Presidential elections. Even large-scale Bitcoin investors, often called ”Whales,” have been relatively mute, adopting a “Wait-And-See” attitude as they closely watch how the results of the US election impact the dynamics of the market. Santiment also notes that Bitcoin whales have been reducing their transaction activity, signaling a change in market sentiment. The market intelligence stated that “Bitcoin whales are patiently awaiting the US Presidential election results as their activity settles from last week’s spike near crypto’s top. The outcome of the US elections are expected to start pouring in today, and many crypto traders and investors are already preparing for major market volatility and unpredictability. On X (formerly Twitter), there has also been a spike in mentions related to Presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has gained significant support from various crypto community members. How The US Presidential Elections Could Impact The BTC Price Many crypto analysts hold varying opinions and predictions regarding the future of the crypto market after the US presidential elections. With major candidates, Kamala Harris or Trump vying for Presidency, investors and crypto experts are closely watching the market for changes.

Moreover, Santiment has revealed that in the previous election in November 2016, Bitcoin crashed by 5.5% after Trump was announced as President. In contrast, in November 2020, the Bitcoin price surged by 22.6% after Joe Biden was announced as President. Based on social sentiment on X, it appears many members of the crypto community are supporting Trump as the next US President. However, Adam Khoo, a crypto analyst, has noted that over 50 million US citizens have already voted in the US elections, with exit polls showing a significant landslide victory for Harris.

35728469,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100475,1730806621,Bitcoin Pre-election Dip Reflects Past Patterns: Will the Historic Post-election Rally Follow?,"The recent pre-election dip in Bitcoin aligns with past trends, suggesting a potential post-election rally similar to the ones seen in 2016 and 2020. Today, Bitcoin declined to around $66,600, continuing the correction that gained momentum on Sunday, when the cryptocurrency briefly dropped to $68,000 after reaching $73,000 just days earlier. Following the latest dip, Bitcoin stabilized around $68,600. This still shows a 3.30% decline over the past seven days.However, a glimmer of hope has emerged. Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin tends to experience volatility leading up to U.S. elections, often followed by a post-election rally. Scottie Pippen, a known Bitcoin bull and former NBA champion, observed that Bitcoin tends to decline before elections but typically rallies afterward. He shared an analysis of past election cycles that supports this. It highlighted how Bitcoin experienced significant recoveries in 2016 and 2020 after initial drops during election periods.Bitcoin Pre- and Post-Election TrendsIn 2016, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 10.2% before the election but rebounded sharply afterward, rising from $660 to over $1,110 in the following months.Similarly, in 2020, a pre-election decline of 6.1% was followed by a post-election surge. Bitcoin's price climbed from $13,000 to nearly $40,000 in the months after the election.These past trends have fueled expectations for a potential post-election rally in 2024, especially as Bitcoin has already experienced a 6.3% dip in the lead-up to this year’s election. Political Influence on MarketsAn analysis by Santiment, a market intelligence platform, emphasized that cryptocurrency markets are highly sensitive to political developments. The platform noted traders frequently respond to policy signals, regulatory expectations, and candidate rhetoric, making elections a significant factor in short-term market movements. Meanwhile, Santiment also pointed out that while past cycles have seen short-term bullish trends post-election, the assumption that elections inherently lead to positive outcomes for Bitcoin may be overstated. The market's response will likely depend on the broader political and economic context.Hence, the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to influence market sentiment. Per the intelligence platform, whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins, the focus will shift to how the next administration handles crypto regulations. Santiment highlighted that the sector's future could hinge on balancing innovative growth with regulatory oversight, setting the stage for how policies might shape the global digital asset landscape over the next four years.Long-Term Forecasts Remain OptimisticDespite immediate pre-election fluctuations, longer-term projections for Bitcoin remain optimistic. Bernstein analysts forecast that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. Gautam Chhugani, Bernstein’s Senior Crypto Analyst, reassured investors that the election’s outcome would not alter Bitcoin’s upward path. Chhugani pointed to critical factors like rising U.S. debt, ongoing monetary challenges, and increased interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as key drivers behind the predicted surge. He stressed that Bitcoin's growth momentum is unlikely to reverse, indicating a broader shift that surpasses election outcomes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/bitcoin-pre-election-dip-reflects-past-patterns-will-the-historic-post-election-rally-follow/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-pre-election-dip-reflects-past-patterns-will-the-historic-post-election-rally-follow,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35722870,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651644,1730806257,Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge,"While the broader crypto market experiences a slight downturn ahead of today’s US presidential election, Dogecoin (DOGE) has defied the trend by surging 10% in the last 24 hours. Over the past three days, DOGE has rallied more than 20% from its local low of $0.14219 on Sunday. Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to speculation surrounding the election and its potential impact on Dogecoin. Why Is Dogecoin Price Going Up Today? Several crypto analysts have identified Dogecoin as the leading “Trump trade” within the crypto market—a proxy for betting on a Donald Trump victory in the presidential election. This association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal about leading a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce government spending. Russian Market (@runews) suggested that if Trump wins, “Elon Musk will land a role at the White House, potentially making Dogecoin one of the ‘official’ cryptocurrencies.” This speculation is considered one reason why Dogecoin is rallying even as Bitcoin faces a decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details Mammon (@D_DTRADING) also highlighted Dogecoin’s strong performance, arguing that Dogecoin might have become a leveraged bet for a Trump win. “Dogecoin showing great relative strength and imo this has to do with Elon’s involvement in supporting Trump. In which Dogecoin might have become the leveraged bet for a Trump win. Trump win > Doge to the moon??” he remarked. Miles Deutscher emphasized Dogecoin’s role as a catalyst in the crypto market: “DOGE pumps (D.O.G.E initiative will propel DOGE + it’s already showing strength as a proxy). DOGE as the meme leader will also drive attention + liquidity rotation to the broader meme narrative. Think of it as the spark that lights the fire.” Former investment bank trader Pablo Heman (@RealPabloHeman) observed that “DOGE is the only green in a sea of red cryptos,” implying a correlation between Dogecoin’s performance and the political developments. He pointed out: “The polls are confusing and contradicting, and actually they are FAKE! But the market does not lie! There is a clear, late surge in DJT the Trump stock, which is now making a Bullish Engulfing Pattern over yesterday’s red bar. And also DOGE is the only green in a sea of red cryptos. So just keep in mind Trump = DJT and Elon Musk = DOGE.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means Andrea Capellini, founder of Freedom Trading Academy, expressed bullish sentiments on Dogecoin’s potential, suggesting that a Trump and Elon win could send DOGE to $0.47. Capellini’s technical analysis highlights key Fibonacci retracement levels applied from the low at $0.05237 to the recent peak at $0.59546. Notably, Dogecoin’s price is currently testing the resistance zone just beneath the 23.6% level at $0.21544. Breaking through this resistance could pave the way toward Capellini’s target of $0.47. The Relative Strength Index, a momentum oscillator, stands at 62.72, placing it in the upper neutral zone. This reading indicates growing bullish momentum without yet entering overbought territory (above 70). The current RSI level supports a cautiously optimistic outlook for the continuation of the upward trend. Moreover, the weekly chart for Dogecoin exhibits a bullish pattern characterized by a series of higher lows and higher highs—a classic sign of a sustained uptrend. However, DOGE is currently facing a downtrend line that has previously acted as resistance. A decisive breakout above this line is crucial to reach higher price targets, including Capellini’s projection of $0.47. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.16816.

The seven-day moving average hashrate reached a peak of 755 EH/s.  The higher difficulty puts more pressure on small miners than larger ones.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} mining difficulty hit an all-time high of 101.65 trillion (T) Monday, adding to pressure on smaller miners, who may not have as much cash available as their publicly traded rivals to keep their rigs going.  Mining difficulty measures how hard it is to discover new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. The network automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. This year, difficulty has adjusted 23 times, almost 60% of the time has seen a positive adjustment which makes the process harder. The higher the difficulty, the more strain on the mining industry to produce a block.  As mining is an extremely competitive and capital-intensive industry, smaller or private companies, whose access to cash may be more constrained than their publicly traded rivals, might need to sell their bitcoin production to fund operations.  Hashrate hits all-time high  Bitcoin’s hashrate hit a record high on a seven-day moving average of 755 EH/s last week. Hashrate is the computational power required to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. At the end of October, hashrate surged almost 12% in one day, one of the biggest rises year-to-date, according to Glassnode data.  Miners are, on average, spending 100% of the total mined supply. In October, there was a brief period of miners retaining a portion of their bitcoin, adding to treasury reserves after a massive depletion in August and September.  In this current epoch, miners are mining, on average, 450 bitcoin a day. If the whole lot is sold, that amounts to roughly $31.5 million of sell-side pressure.  Overall, this shows that miners are currently in a relatively healthy spot.

He responded to a Reddit thread calling for the public disclosure of the software development firm's financial balance sheet, claiming it is a public company.The Cardano founder noted that IOHK was a privately owned software company.

If Harris wins, the likelihood of these ETFs getting approved may decrease, potentially leading to a 15% drop in Solana, the firm added.  As the U.S. presidential election approaches, markets are betting on wild price swings that could challenge directional traders. In light of this, 10x Research suggests a savvy pair trade involving market leader bitcoin {{BTC}} and programmable blockchain Solana's {{SOL}} token as a tactical bet to navigate the expected election-led turbulence.  ""A tactical trade heading into the election could involve going long bitcoin and short solana,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients on Monday.  Thielen explained that the election's outcome would have far-reaching implications for digital assets, including potential approval of a U.S.-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to alternative cryptocurrencies, such as SOL.  ""If Harris wins, the likelihood of these ETFs getting approved may decrease, potentially leading to a 15% drop in solana, while bitcoin might experience a more limited decline of around 9%,"" Thielen said, adding that a Trump victory could see SOL, BTC and ether rise by around 5%.  BTC and ETH might see bigger gains than SOL on potential Trump victory, as spot ETFs tied to bitcoin and ether are already trading in the U.S. and have amassed billions of dollars in investor money this year. The availability of an alternative investment vehicle might translate into bigger gains in anticipation of favorable regulatory policy under Trump's presidency.  SOL has yet to get its first spot in ETF. As of today, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital have filed for SOL ETFs with the U.S. SEC.  The U.S. will head to vote to elect its new president in a few hours. Per the latest reports, the presidential race is tight, with Democrat Kamala Harris and the supposedly crypto-friendly Donald Trump running neck and neck in several swing states.  According to Thielen, another reason to be short SOL is that daily transaction fees on the Solana network have cooled to $2.5 million, hitting a record high of $5 million on Oct. 24, according to data source Artemis and TokenTerminal. Similar drop-offs in fees have historically weighed over the token prices.

A remarkable feat that saw a massive increase in the USDT on TON hitting over $1 billion in only six months, an indicator of the capability of the emerging dynamic duo. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival Exponential Growth Analysts said that TON keeps on moving upward as many investors start to adopt Tether’s stablecoin. In a report, CryptoQuant said that in the last six months, USDT on TON rose by a whopping 670%. CryptoQuant added that TON only had $130 million worth of USDT in May 2024, but after half a year, the stablecoin ballooned to $1.02 billion. Analysts attributed the massive hike to the increasing investors’ preference to use TON, making the network a significant player in the stablecoin sector. They also believed that the stablecoin market will continue to thrive and flourish rapidly which will open opportunities for emerging blockchain networks. Currently, stablecoins have gained popularity worldwide. These digital monies are used to facilitate various activities such as cross-border transactions and personal payments. Data showed that for instance, USDT is being utilized by 10% of all commercial transactions conducted in South Korea. Low Transaction Fee CryptoQuant said that the TON blockchain is an excellent substitute for stablecoins because of its low transaction costs, saying that its “competitive transaction fees” fuel the increasing number of USDT transactions on TON. Analysts considered its remarkably low fees as one of its most significant advantages because it makes TON more attractive to users who conduct regular transactions. TON allows these users to save money while partaking in the cryptocurrency market. Statistics showed that transaction fees have decreased significantly in the past few months. The median transaction fee in June 2024 stood at $0.061, but it went down to $0.035 by October 2024. A significant reduction greatly contributed to the TON’s rapid adoption because users are seeing the network as an option for their transactions. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 USDT Expected To Expand USDT stablecoin has emerged as a key player in the market today, reaching a USDT supply of about $120 billion.

In an X post yesterday, DaVinci, a pseudonymous Shibarium Discord admin, warned that scammers could use the name ‘SHIB’ to perpetrate malicious activities. He clarified that just because a token has SHIB in its name does not mean the project is safe. Using SHIB to Promote Random Sh*tcoin Is a Red Flag DaVinci suggested that it is a big red flag when a team uses SHIB to promote and sell random and unknown sh*tcoins. Furthermore, the Shibarium Discord admin revealed that a group of scammers has been leveraging this tactic to sell new sh*tcoins monthly. He stated that these coins are almost worthless, eventually losing 80-90% of their value. Nonetheless, DaVinci said the scammers are not relenting as they prepare to introduce the next sh*tcoin, leading to recurring losses for unsuspecting investors. Notably, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team member advised the Shiba Inu community members to avoid waiting until the fourth ‘rug pull’ before figuring out the pattern. Shiba Inu Team Continuous Warning DaVinci’s message marks the latest warning the Shiba Inu ecosystem team has issued to the community over the past week. Last week, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, and the project’s marketing lead, Lucie, issued a new warning about TREAT. They warned that the token has not been launched, indicating that any token mimicking it is fake. Also, Kusama revealed how scammers have been using his engagement with the community to promote and sell illicit tokens. Specifically, these malicious actors purchase X accounts Kusama follows and then use them to promote fake tokens. Furthermore, Shiba Inu’s community-driven channel Susbarium issued an important warning after the team behind a new cat-themed memecoin, Shiro Neko (SHIRO), burned $100,000 worth of SHIB. The move is part of Shiro Neko’s marketing strategy to get the attention of SHIBArmy. Unmoved by the hefty SHIB burn, Susbarium cautioned the community to first conduct due diligence on the project before investing. Furthermore, the channel shared some safety tips, like understanding SHIRO’s tokenomics and promotional strategy, to help investors evaluate and decide whether the token is safe. As scammers continue to target the Shiba Inu community, it is imperative to always conduct due diligence on any new project and stick to official channels to get relevant information regarding new developments within the ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/shiba-inu-cautions-community-on-when-shib-can-be-a-red-flag/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-cautions-community-on-when-shib-can-be-a-red-flag,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Will buyers manage a bullish turnaround, or is a further decline imminent? With the crypto market chaos resulting in massive ups and downs in altcoins, Tron is currently moving downwards. Failing to cross the $0.1686 barrier, the TRX price fall warns of a crash under $0.160. Additionally, the high-risk breakdown of a rising wedge pattern on the daily chart could lead to a nearly 10% decline in Tron. The key question is: will the bulls step in and reverse the trend at the $0.1597 support level?Tron Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, Tron's price action shows a failed attempt to break above the $0.1686 resistance. This failure has resulted in an evening star pattern and six consecutive bearish candles. Tron price chart The bearish price movement has caused a 4.29% drop from the $0.1693 level to the current market price of $0.1620. The downward trend is approaching a short-term support trendline near the 23.60% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.1597.On a larger scale, the prevailing uptrend in TRX’s price action reveals a rising wedge pattern. Within this wedge, the recent reversal has formed a double top and established a neckline at the $0.1463 level.The increasing bearish pressure has caused a negative crossover between the MACD and its signal line on the 4-hour chart. Additionally, the MACD histograms are showing a surge of negative momentum, and the RSI has fallen below the 50% mark. These technical indicators suggest a growing influx of selling pressure.Will Tron Sustain Above $0.1597?Using the trend-based Fibonacci retracement, a potential reversal from the 23.60% level ($0.1597) must surpass the 38.20% Fibonacci level of $0.1686 for an uptrend continuation. While the upside chances are low, the broader market recovery could propel the Tron prices higher. In such a case, the next resistance levels for TRX are present at the 50% and 78.60% Fibonacci levels priced at $0.1762 and $0.1959, respectively. A breakdown below the local support trendline will likely complete a double-top pattern, which could result in a massive fallout for Tron.

This bullish hope comes amid heightened market volatility tied to the U.S. presidential election and the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,649, recovering from last night's massive drop to $66K. Bitcoin and altcoin dip over the past day Bullish Sentiment: Bitcoin’s Path After the ElectionMarket commentators are split on Bitcoin's trajectory post-election, but overall sentiment remains largely bullish. Analysts are hopeful that the current volatility could mark the beginning of a sustained upward trend for Bitcoin.In a post on X, analytics resource Spot On Chain noted that this week’s market conditions are some of the most volatile of the year, driven by the election and the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.Despite this uncertainty, Spot On Chain suggested that Bitcoin's long-term bull rally could be just beginning. It highlighted that historically, major bull runs tend to gain momentum after the U.S. elections. The firm believes that Bitcoin will likely maintain its upward trajectory regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins the presidency. Remarkably, Spot On Chain predicted that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of the year.Another well-known analyst, Daan Crypto, also anticipates significant price movement for Bitcoin. He forecasted at least a 10% swing in either direction, depending on the election outcome. While Daan noted that this week’s Bitcoin chart does not display an ideal weekly candle, he believes the election will be a key catalyst for price action.Bearish Concerns: A Potential Post-Election Sell-Off?However, not all traders expect a smooth path for Bitcoin in the short term. QCP Capital, a trading firm, warned its Telegram subscribers of a potential sell-off after the election. The firm compared the likely outcome to the ""sell-the-news"" response that followed the Nashville Bitcoin Conference. QCP noted that market betting odds have shifted, with Trump currently favored to win the presidency, although his chances have decreased slightly over the weekend. Notably, the odds are 57% for Trump versus 43% for Harris. Nonetheless, the firm believes that no matter the election outcome, a ""sell-the-news"" reaction could trigger a price pullback in Bitcoin.The Federal Reserve’s Rate DecisionAdding to this week’s volatility, the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision on November 7 has attracted significant attention.The Fed faces a challenging environment, balancing inflation concerns with recently weaker job data.

After veteran analyst Cowen’s Cardano assertion came to fruition, he has faced severe criticisms from ADA bulls. For context, the ITC Crypto founder forecasted in August 2023 that ADA would capitulate against Bitcoin, targeting the 400 SATS price mark.Notably, his predictions came to fruition in October as ADA/BTC traded at $0.0000049, an equivalent of 490 SATS. Meanwhile, the trading pair has fallen further since then, exchanging hands at 481 SATS at the time of writing.Analyst Face CriticismsFollowing the realization of his predictions, Cowen and Altcoin Daily took to X to notify their audience that his speculation had come to fruition. Notably, Cowen taunted skeptics who critiqued his forecast, asking if they still needed a comment.Since then, Cardano bulls have bashed Cowen for his ""involvement"" in ADA’s fall. The analyst noted that a particular X user, “cardano whale,” has blamed him for causing the capitulation of the 11th cryptocurrency by market cap.According to a picture Cowen shared, the user implied that he repeatedly shilled a Cardano capitulation to his nearly 1 million X followers and on YouTube, influencing sentiments around the asset. The user blamed Cowen for the downtrend, stating he was “part of the machine.”Meanwhile, the market veteran has defended himself, noting that his large audience didn’t mean he caused Cardano’s fall against Bitcoin. He further insisted that being wrong on one’s speculation was part of the game, and instead of blaming others, the analyst should take responsibility.Community ReactsCowen’s Monday post sparked further reaction from the crypto community, particularly ADA proponents. A user argued that having over 800,000 followers and a good reputation could influence investor rationale on an asset. He noted that people often listen to notable analysts and make investment decisions. However, Cowen replied that despite his large audience, he still gets speculations wrong, so the concept that he influenced ADA’s price was untrue.Meanwhile, another user shared a similar encounter with the Cardano bull dragging Cowen for his Cardano analysis. He noted that the same influencer called him out on his analysis, touted him, and blocked him.Notably, ADA followed a broader market correction yesterday, trading at $0.3311 at the time of writing.

Amid a refreshing recovery run in the crypto market after multiple correction days, Cardano also marks a reversal. The intraday recovery increases the chances of reversal for Cardano with a double-bottom reversal. Will this bullish trend in Cardano bounce back from the crucial support zone near $0.324? Let’s find out. Cardano’s Double Bottom ReversalIn the 4-hour chart, the Cardano price action shows a sideways trend. Furthermore, the bearish influence over the consolidation range is gradually increasing, warning of a bearish breakdown. Cardano price chart Recently, Cardano broke below the $0.331 support zone for the second time in the past 10 days. This bearish outcome follows a double-top reversal at the $0.36 resistance level, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement.The downturn led to three consecutive days of bearish closes, resulting in an 8.94% drop from $0.358 to $0.326. As of now, Cardano has shown a modest intraday recovery of 1.23%, taking support near the $0.324 zone.This recovery has completed a morning star pattern, and the price is testing the previously broken $0.331 support level. More importantly, this setup hints at a potential double-bottom reversal, with $0.324 acting as the baseline.Additionally, the MACD and signal lines are close to crossing bullish, supporting the upside potential. The RSI has also started to recover from the oversold zone and is crossing above its 14-day simple moving average (SMA), signaling increasing bullish momentum.Will Cardano Price Surge to $0.40?As the likelihood of a positive cycle within the current consolidation range grows, the price action traders should watch for is a breakout above $0.332. A move above this level could trigger further gains.According to the Fibonacci retracement levels, an upward continuation could first challenge the 23.6% level at $0.343, followed by the 50% level at $0.364.A complete positive cycle within the consolidation range could lead to an approximate 11% surge from the current price to $0.364. Optimistically, a bullish breakout could target higher resistance levels at $0.39 and $0.41, which correspond to the 78.6% and 100% Fibonacci levels, respectively.Conversely, if Cardano falls below the $0.324 support zone, the price could retest the previous low around $0.315 or even the psychological level of $0.30.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/is-cardano-poised-for-a-double-bottom-reversal-to-0-41/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-cardano-poised-for-a-double-bottom-reversal-to-0-41,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Since March, Ethereum has shown a downward trend, prompting speculation about its ability to recover and achieve substantial gains in the next bull market. An analyst has argued for Ethereum’s potential for growth, especially when drawing comparisons to the S&P 500's market trends.Ethereum's Correlation with the S&P 500Market analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted Ethereum’s relationship with the S&P 500 (SPX) as a point of interest. Martinez shared comparative charts showing Ethereum (ETH/USD) alongside the S&P 500 Index. Both assets found a bottom in late 2022 and exhibited an upward trajectory throughout 2023. The trend illustrated an ascending triangle pattern, which is often considered a bullish signal. The S&P 500 notably broke out of this pattern, peaking close to $5,900 before a minor retracement to approximately $5,728 at the time of Martinez’s snapshot. This similarity in trend between Ethereum and the S&P 500 has fueled discussions on whether Ethereum might follow a similar path.Martinez suggested that Ethereum’s current downtrend could be the final dip before a potential rally to $10,000. Notably, Ethereum would need to climb approximately 312.36% from its current price of $2,425 to reach $10,000. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1853572432646299649On-Chain Metrics Reflect IndecisionOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock has provided deeper insight into Ethereum’s market state. As of the latest Year-to-Date (YTD) figures, 96,660 addresses—representing 22.93% of active wallets—are currently profitable or “in the money.”This suggests that a significant portion of holders are seeing gains, which indicates underlying support for the asset. However, 248,920 addresses, or 60.83% of total active addresses, are classified as “at the money,” holding ETH at approximately break-even levels.This group reflects market indecision, with the potential for further investment or selling pressure, depending on price movement.Meanwhile, 64,410 addresses (16.24%) are “out of the money,” holding ETH at a loss. This segment could add selling pressure if the price continues to weaken.Contrasting Views on Ethereum’s OutlookVeteran trader Peter Brandt has taken a different stance on Ethereum’s price movement. On November 1, Brandt reiterated his bearish outlook, stating that Ethereum’s charts showed no signs of a momentum shift. Brandt’s analysis pointed to a bearish flag pattern that had been forming since August. He emphasized that a breakdown in this pattern could lead Ethereum to a lower target.Brandt stressed the likelihood of Ethereum crashing as low as $1,551.

With a recent boost from Robinhood’s European arm providing additional support to PEPE , the meme coin is back in action. A boost in buying pressure in the last 24 hours propels the 24th largest cryptocurrency by 3.16% today. With this recovery run, will PEPE reclaim the lost levels during the 5-day bear market? Let’s find out. PEPE Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, PEPE’s price action shows a larger falling channel pattern. Before the recent recovery, the price had suffered a significant drop of 18.17%, resulting in five consecutive bearish candles, including a reversal signal in the form of an evening star pattern. PEPE price chart Furthermore, the declining trend broke below the 23.60% Fibonacci level, priced at $0.000008251489. Along with the Fibonacci level, the PEPE price also broke below the support zone at around $0.0000082. Hence, the intraday recovery comes as a potential retest of the bearish breakdown. As the bearish momentum persists, the 50-day and 100-day EMAs have formed a bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the MACD and its signal line continue to align bearishly, with negative histograms intensifying, suggesting continued downward pressure.PEPE Transfer Now Live on Robinhood Robinhood Europe now supports live transfers for PEPE, along with a 1% deposit bonus to encourage user participation. This added support has provided a short-term boost to PEPE’s price. In the last 24 hours, this new feature has sparked a resurgence in bullish momentum, giving the meme coin a potential chance for a comeback.However, PEPE faces challenges in gaining a listing on major U.S. exchanges like Coinbase or even Robinhood’s U.S. platform. However, this proactive move in Europe provides increased exposure and the opportunity for European users to explore the meme coin.Will PEPE Price Reach $0.000010?If the bullish resurgence fails to reclaim the lost levels, an extended downfall will likely test the $0.000006595. Hence, the downside risk for the PEPE memecoin is almost 20%. On the flip side, if the recovery continues and PEPE manages to surpass the 23.60% Fibonacci level, it could target the overhead trendline near the $0.000010 psychological resistance. This would imply an upside of approximately 23%.If PEPE breaks through this overhead resistance level and the broader market continues its recovery, the next potential target for the coin could be $0.00001370, which corresponds to the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement level.",POSITIVE,PEPE,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/05/pepe-transfers-now-live-on-robinhood-europe-will-this-trigger-a-massive-23-rally-for-pepe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pepe-transfers-now-live-on-robinhood-europe-will-this-trigger-a-massive-23-rally-for-pepe,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

A prominent Polymarket whale known as ""larpas"" recently sold off more than $3 million in bets favoring Donald Trump’s victory, an action that reportedly influenced the platform’s odds. This sell-off came shortly after well-known crypto trader Giant-Cassocked Rebirth (GCR) hinted at flaws in the prediction markets’ accuracy, suggesting that the odds may overestimate the chances of right-wing candidates. New data from blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence reveals that larpas, a key player on Polymarket, liquidated millions in pro-Trump election bets, affecting Polymarket’s odds just as election day approaches. This sell-off began following GCR’s statements, where he claimed to have manipulated Polymarket’s odds by identifying a bias in the market’s assessment of right-wing candidates. GCR’s move aligns with previous speculation about his involvement in pro-Trump meme coin trading. GCR, known for his strategic insights, stated in 2021 that he believed prediction markets were skewed toward right-wing outcomes. He anticipated that the implied odds of a Republican nominee would eventually rise, making Trump a valuable bet when odds were low. By exploiting this perceived bias, he profited from the shift in Trump’s odds, stating that he captured “the meat of the move” before taking his profit. He advised followers to avoid leverage and risky bets. The ongoing 2024 election has drawn massive volumes on Polymarket , which has become a key platform for political betting. Robinhood has even added election betting as the race enters its final days, showing just how significant the betting interest is. As the US electorate becomes more engaged in crypto, the presence of digital assets in election betting is more prominent than ever. However, the excitement around prediction markets hasn’t led to reliable odds. Recent research suggests Trump’s odds on Polymarket are inflated , with as much as 30% of pro-Trump trades deemed to be false. Whale accounts, like that of larpas, may be pushing these odds higher. With the election imminent, more traders could potentially profit from exploiting prediction market biases, following in GCR’s footsteps.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | OTHER | RESEARCH | ARKM,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/polymarket-under-fire-as-whale-dumps-millions-in-trump-bets,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35715607.jpeg

These bullish metrics have prevailed despite the ongoing market uncertainty that has plagued the broader market. Amid this uncertainty, XRP previously tumbled from the $0.53 high on Oct. 29 to retest the psychological support at $0.50. A mild recovery has seen it rebound above $0.51 at press time.Despite this push, XRP continues to underperform in longer timeframes. Notably, the altcoin is down 16% this year, while assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) are witnessing impressive gains. However, on-chain data shows this bearish turn of events has not dampened investor optimism.Active XRP Accounts Hit 7-Month PeakInterestingly, activity within the XRP ecosystem has seen a notable rise in recent times. According to data from on-chain resource CryptoQuant, active accounts on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) tumbled to lows below 10,000 at the start of October but have since continued to increase.For instance, these accounts surged above 14,500 on Oct. 12 before retracing sharply in the following day. Since then, they have been on an upsurge, peaking at 24,411, a high the network last witnessed seven months ago. XRP Ledger Active Addresses XRP Active Addresses | CryptoQuant The last time the XRPL saw this level of activity was on March 11, when about 25,000 accounts interacted with the blockchain. On this day, XRP saw a massive price spike, rising from $0.6084 to its yearly peak of $0.7449 before retracing.A spike in active accounts can be bullish for XRP price action. However, this depends on the behavior of network participants, as the altcoin could benefit from a surge in addresses purchasing more tokens but feel a negative impact from a rise in addresses involved in selloffs.For instance, during the March 11 price increase , receiving accounts on the XRPL spiked to a high of 43,343. This figure collapsed in the days that followed but has continued to fluctuate between highs and lows since then.Whales Amass 390M XRPInterestingly, receiving accounts are now seeing another spike, recently peaking at 48,628, as active accounts recover above 23,000. This represents a strong signal of an impending price run similar to the trend observed earlier this year. XRP Ledger Active Receiving Addresses XRP Receiving Addresses | CryptoQuant In addition, XRP is also seeing a rapid spike in whale accumulation .

XRP Whale Accumulation Santiment XRP Whale Accumulation | Santiment This massive increase confirms that these addresses have procured 390 million XRP tokens worth $198.9 million over the past two weeks. As XRP looks to recover from the latest slump to $0.50, the increased activity and accumulation trend could provide strength to the bulls.Notably, XRP currently changes hands at $0.5170, up 2.79% this morning.

35714638,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651522,1730795411,Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought,"Dogecoin has achieved another historic milestone, as Dogecoin whales recorded their largest accumulation week since January 2024. Over 2.1 billion DOGE tokens were purchased during this period, underscoring the resurgence of interest and renewed confidence in the doggy-themed meme coin among prominent large-scale investors. Dogecoin Whales Set New Accumulation Record Over the past week, Dogecoin whales have been on a significant accumulation trend, buying more DOGE tokens than ever since the beginning of this year, when the positive sentiment surrounding meme coins was high. Data from IntoTheBlock has revealed that many Dogecoin addresses holding large quantities of tokens accumulated over 2.1 billion just last week. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Analyst Reveals Bear Case That Could Send Price To $28,000 Additionally, Dogecoin whale activity has increased sporadically in the last few weeks. The platform reports that large-scale investors moved approximately 16.24 billion DOGE tokens, valued at $2.76 billion, over the past seven days. In the last 24 hours, these whales transferred another staggering 8.53 billion tokens, worth about $1.29 billion. This recent Dogecoin whale accumulation trend represents one of the most substantial purchases in the past few months. The spike in whale activity also comes as the Dogecoin price is seeing renewed momentum, experiencing price increases despite the broader market volatility. More often than not, whale activity is considered a strong indicator of market sentiment, suggesting that investors are possibly bullish on a particular cryptocurrency. Given the immense influence these so-called whales can have on a cryptocurrency, market experts carefully monitor their trades and movements to gauge the potential impacts on price trends and overall market dynamics. In the case of Dogecoin, data from CoinMarketCap reveals that the price of the meme coin has increased by 6.01% over the past week. This price surge aligns with the recent spike in whale activity. Moreover, with Dogecoin closing October in the green, the potential for continued price increases is still in play. Including its increase in whale activity, DOGE has also experienced a surge in its market capitalization and trading volume. The meme coins trading volume is up by 30.95% while its market cap has climbed to $22.12 billion, securing its position as the 8th largest cryptocurrency. DOGE TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal While Dogecoin whales are on a significant accumulation spree, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has unveiled a new technical indicator signaling a change in market sentiment. The TD Sequential, a popular tool for identifying trend reversals, is now flashing a strong buy signal for Dogecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Completes Retest Phase: Only One Thing Left For A $110,000 Price By December According to Martinez, the buy signal was seen on the Dogecoin 4-hour chart, suggesting that the meme coin may be poised for further upward movement. In light of this trend, the analyst predicts that if Dogecoin maintains a price above the $0.141 support, the meme coin could rebound to $0.162. It’s important to note that the Dogecoin price is currently trading at $0.15, according to CoinMarketCap.

U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows, with significant withdrawals from major funds like Fidelity's FBTC and Ark Invest's ARKB, except for BlackRock’s IBIT which saw inflows.  The crypto market's reaction appears influenced by the narrowing lead of Donald Trump in election polls, traditionally seen as more favorable towards cryptocurrencies, some traders said.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} was the only major token in green ahead of the widely-watched U.S. elections, with some expecting a marketwide surge in the coming weeks regardless of whichever candidate wins.  The memecoin has jumped over 10% in the past 24 hours even as bitcoin {{BTC}} lost nearly 3%, and all major tokens registered losses between 1%-5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 3%.  DOGE has risen 50% in the past 30 days on a renewed endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk as part of the Republican campaign. Musk has been proposing a Department of Government Efficiency — which is abbreviated as D.O.G.E; a clear nod to the token — as an agency that will make government spending and monetary planning more effective.  Read More: Here's Why Today's U.S. Election Matters for Crypto  Bitcoin fell as defunct exchange Mt.Gox sent $2.2 billion worth of tokens from its storage to new wallets. Such moves have historically preceded creditor repayments and caused prices to dip lower, and traders expect short-term selling pressure when the assets are further moved to exchanges.  Elsewhere, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $541 million in net outflows on Monday - the highest since May - dashing hopes for increased institutional interest in the asset after a week that saw consecutive days of net inflows above $800 million.  BlackRock’s IBIT was the only product showing net inflows at $38 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led outflows at $169 million, its highest since going live, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $138 million and Grayscale’s mini bitcoin trust (BTC) at $90 million.  Meanwhile, traders say the correction comes amid shifting election polls that have neared coin-toss odds on some marketplaces.  “Markets are falling because traders are no longer confident that Trump will have an ""easy"" victory on Tuesday, and that doesn't bode well for crypto as he's been perceived as the more pro-crypto candidate,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “On betting platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi, and polls across the country, his lead over Harris has deteriorated over the weekend and people think it's going to come down to a very close decision,” Mei said, adding that “the real kicker” could be a Fed rate cut decision on Thursday where the agency is expected to continue to cut rates in a move that could “boost markets in the short run.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/05/dogecoin-rallies-bitcoin-etfs-bleed-ahead-of-us-elections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cc98be6e8089e0777bd5438a8eeb754b00ede88-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It claimed the SEC is refusing to “articulate any standard” when it comes to determining which crypto asset transactions qualify as investment contracts.  Lawyers representing Binance and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao have made a fresh attempt to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against them.  On Monday, they filed a motion to dismiss an amended complaint submitted by the SEC last month.  Their filing argues that the amended complaint pays “lip service” to an earlier court ruling that crypto assets are not in and of themselves securities but “refuses to accept the logical conclusion of that ruling—that secondary market resales of the assets long after they were first distributed by their developers are not ‘securities’ transactions.”  “Instead, the SEC’s Amended Complaint continues to insist that virtually all transactions involving crypto assets—including blind secondary market resales of tokens—are securities transactions because some buyers might hope the assets will increase in value,” it said.  It also slammed the SEC for a lack of clarity on regulation when it comes to virtual assets. “The SEC still refuses to articulate any standard for courts, litigants, or market participants to know which crypto-asset transactions qualify as investment contracts, and which do not,” it stated.  “And the SEC continues to choose winners and losers arbitrarily, recently abandoning with no explanation its claim that transactions involving Ether—the second most common crypto asset, after Bitcoin—are investment contracts.”  The SEC initiated the lawsuit against Zhao and three companies, BAM Management U.S. Holdings, BAM Trading Services and Binance Holdings in June 2023. The case is separate to the criminal charges brought against Zhao and Binance Holdings by the Department of Justice.  In November 2023, Binance admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations. Binance was fined $4.3 billion and Zhao spent four months in prison in the U.S. He has since been released.

BTC Faces Key Support Levels Bitcoin has struggled to surpass its all-time high of $73,700, a level achieved in March following the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the cryptocurrency. Despite several attempts to breach this mark, Bitcoin has faced resistance, leading to a current price correction. Should it fail to maintain its position above $68,000, it may revisit the $66,600 support level, with a further drop potentially taking it down to $63,000—an important threshold in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: What To Expect In The Final 24 Hours Before US Election Despite the current price challenges, many analysts maintain a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes that the days following past US presidential elections have historically shown volatility for Bitcoin; however, the overall trend has remained upward. This analysis suggests that if this pattern holds true in the current election cycle, Bitcoin might retest its previous highs with potential for price discovery above the milestone reached 8 months ago. In addition, Martinez highlights a recent buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the 12-hour chart, suggesting that a rebound could be imminent, potentially allowing Bitcoin to challenge the $73,000 resistance level again. Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 Regardless Of Election Outcome Analyst Miles Deutscher on the other hand, asserts that Bitcoin is on a trajectory toward $100,000, regardless of the November 5 election outcome. However, he anticipates that a Trump victory could further elevate Bitcoin’s price ceiling, with speculative targets ranging from $200,000 to $300,000. Deutscher further believes that this bullish sentiment extends to altcoins like Ethereum, which may also benefit from a BTC rally in the last part of the year. The analysis comes as Trump has expressed strong support for the crypto industry, even suggesting the potential use of Bitcoin as a strategic national reserve asset to address the country’s substantial national debt, currently estimated at $35 trillion. Many believe that a Trump administration could bode well for bitcoin’s future growth, with increased adoption and exposure from pension funds and institutions looking to diversify their portfolios, as seen in the current resurgence of Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target In contrast, Kamala Harris’s position on cryptocurrency has been less clear. While she has not articulated a robust plan for the digital asset sector, experts predict a shift from the current Biden administration’s regulatory scrutiny led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Pricing for longer-duration options on both CME and Deribit signals a constructive outlook.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traders are seeking protection against price weakness amid projections of a U.S. election-induced volatility boom.  That's according to CME's bitcoin options market, where put options, offering protection against price drops and expiring within a week, were pricier relative to calls on Monday, according to data source CF Benchmarks and QuickStrike.  The so-called 25-delta risk reversal for contracts expiring Friday (P2XE24) was -1.3% on Monday, showing a bias for puts. The metric measures the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money higher strike calls and lower strike OTM puts, providing an easy to read picture of the market sentiment.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put options gives the right to sell.  ""It looks like bitcoin options traders appear to be hedging their bets to the downside ahead of the U.S. election this week. Through a .25 delta risk reversal we can see that contracts expiring within a week are slightly negative – meaning puts more expensive than calls – compared to longer-dated maturities of either 2 weeks or 30 days, where the skew reverts to being positive again,"" researchers at CF Benchmarks told CoinDesk in an email.  Bitcoin's price has pulled back to $68,000 from near record highs above $73,500 in one week, alongside a drop in the more pro-crypto Donald Trump's chances of election victory.  The pricing for longer-duration options was positively skewed in favor of calls, indicating a broader constructive outlook, consistent with the consensus analysts' expectations for a year-end rally to $80,000 and higher.  The latest polls show that Democrat Kamala Harris and her rival Republican candidate Donald Trump, perceived as crypto-friendly, are running neck and neck in most swing states, including Pennsylvania and nationally.  Per some observers, the 50-50 odds mean the eventual outcome, expected Friday, could lead to a BTC price swing of $6,000-$8,000.  Options trading on the leading exchange Deribit also show a broader bullish outlook with a largely neutral bias for this week, according to data source Amberdata.  The 25-delta risk reversals show barely a difference between pricing for calls and puts expiring this week.

Cartwright’s New Allocation Strategy In its announcement, Cartwright, specializing in defined benefit and hybrid pension schemes, emphasized the significance of incorporating Bitcoin into retirement plans. The firm recently advised its first scheme on a 3% Bitcoin allocation, which aligns with its long-term investment strategy while prioritizing “robust risk management” at both the asset and scheme levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target Sam Roberts, Cartwright’s director of investment consulting, highlighted the growing trend among trustees to seek new solutions that can future-proof their pension schemes amid economic uncertainties: This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile… Integrating Bitcoin into a pension scheme’s investment strategy is a bold step that reflects the forward-thinking nature of the trustees involved. Roberts underscored that while Bitcoin presents significant potential upside, it also requires careful management of associated risks. “Our approach ensures that schemes can benefit from the significant potential upside while limiting the potential downside,” he explained. Bitcoin In Pension Plans Steve Robinson, Cartwright’s head of investment implementation, elaborated on the operational procedures for Bitcoin investments. He noted that these procedures have been tailored to maximize the security of the asset while enabling swift profit-taking: Our commitment to engaging with emerging innovative technologies ensures that trustees remain at the cutting edge of investment solutions. By combining a secure custodial solution with mechanisms to capitalize on profits quickly, Cartwright aims to make Bitcoin accessible to risk-averse pension schemes. The low minimum investment threshold will reportedly allow a wider range of pension schemes to participate, contrasting with traditional investment ideas that often require substantial capital. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Daily Transactions Surge To 4.68 Million, Will This Push SHIB’s Price Toward $0.00008? The firm said it is also optimistic that this strategic move will inspire other institutional investors in the UK to follow suit and explore the benefits of BTC. Robinson concluded that this approach will provide long-term value to scheme members while reducing the reliance on employer contributions, ultimately enhancing the sustainability of pension funds in an evolving economic landscape. Despite these moves by pension funds worldwide to invest in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $67,760 at the time of writing, reflecting the volatility experienced in recent days ahead of the anticipated US presidential election on November 5.

The price is now trading below $170 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward movement if it stays above the $155 and $150 support levels. Solana Price Extends Losses Solana price struggled to clear the $180 resistance and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $175 and $172 support levels.

A low was formed at $155 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $173 swing high to the $155 low. Solana is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The main resistance could be $165 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $173 swing high to the $155 low. A successful close above the $165 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $172. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $165 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 level. The first major support is near the $150 level. A break below the $150 level might send the price toward the $135 zone.

While the reason behind the long-term holders offloading Bitcoin is not certain, the move appears to have impacted BTC, resulting in the recent correction in its price dropping below the $70,000 price mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holders Begins To Cash Out According to an analysis shared by Crypto analyst Maartunn, long-term holders sold approximately 177,617 BTC within the last seven days. Based on data from IntoTheBlock, this trend shows a pattern in which Bitcoin’s long-term investors tend to reduce their holdings during price increases, a behavior often perceived as a “contrarian indicator” in the crypto market, Maartunn reveals. Typically, these LTHs, who hold Bitcoin with a longer investment horizon, tend to buy during downturns and sell during price upticks. Maartunn pointed out that similar patterns were visible during previous bull markets in 2018, 2021, and 2024, indicating a possible strategic response to Bitcoin’s recent price movement.

Technical Analysis Indicates Key Levels to Watch for Bitcoin As Bitcoin continues to trade around crucial levels, another prominent analyst, known as CryptoBullet, has shared his outlook on the asset’s recent performance and potential upcoming movements. Despite Bitcoin’s brief dip below the $70,000 mark, CryptoBullet expressed limited concern, noting that the asset has maintained three weekly closes above a major resistance line, which indicates resilience. #Bitcoin $BTC Third weekly close above the Resistance line 👌 Do I care about that wick? Not really. We didn’t sweep the March high so it’s not that dangerous imo. New ATH is coming anyway 🚀 https://t.co/mVsvJOZMpI pic.twitter.com/sjm4ek9Jsg — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) November 4, 2024 According to his analysis, although Bitcoin has not swept past the previous high set in March, the current consolidation phase is not necessarily a cause for concern. CryptoBullet further highlighted a few significant price zones, particularly between $65,000 and $66,000, which he considers pivotal for determining Bitcoin’s near-term trend. Should Bitcoin fail to hold at these levels, a drop to the $60,000 to $61,000 range could be expected. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over?

Gox moved of over 32,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to new wallet addresses in preparation for future sales.  The ongoing repayment plan, now extended to October 31, 2025, involves significant bitcoin transfers which affect market volatility.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped early Tuesday as defunct crypto exchange Mt.Gox processed its largest transfer in months in preparation for a sale sometime in the future.  BTC slid under $68,000, losing 2% in the past 24 hours to influence a broader market slide ahead of the U.S. elections scheduled later in the day in U.S. morning hours. Traders expect a surge in market volatility this week with price swings of as much as $8,000.  Mt. Gox transferred over 32,000 BTC, worth $2.2 billion at current prices, to unmarked wallet addresses data from Arkham shows. A majority of that stash, or nearly 30,400 BTC, was sent to “1FG2C…Rveoy” and 2,000 BTC was moved to “15gNR…a8Aok” after first being sent to a Mt. Gox cold wallet.  Such wallet transfers are usually a consolidation of holdings to new addresses before they are sent to crypto exchanges, where the bitcoin is sold on the open market.  Mt. Gox’s repayments are largely considered to add selling pressure to bitcoin (BTC) markets as early investors will receive assets at a much higher value than their entries before 2013, making them inclined to sell at least a part of holding, traders said.  Mt. Gox was once the world’s top crypto exchange, handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions in its early years. In early 2014, hackers attacked the exchange, resulting in the loss of an estimated 740,000 bitcoin (more than $15 billion at current prices). The hack was the biggest of the many attacks on the exchange in the years 2010-13.  Trustees have put together a repayment plan that has been in the works for several years, and received a deadline of October 2024 from a Tokyo court last year. However, in October, the repayment deadline was extended by another year to October 31, 2025.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/05/btc-drops-under-68k-as-mtgox-sends-22b-bitcoin-to-two-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/156302e1eeb0181cd9143e8a0675f72146c49d43-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin ETFs Surpass One Million BTC Milestone According to a chart shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, the cumulative BTC holdings in Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded one million BTC within this short period. To recall, after a lot of deliberation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year in January. To say that Bitcoin ETFs have proven to be a resounding success won’t be an overstatement. Related Reading: Record-Breaking Day: Spot Bitcoin ETF Trading Exceeds $3 Billion As BTC Eyes Record Peak Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a cumulative total net inflow of $24.15 billion to date. Martinez added that the total value of BTC held by these ETFs currently stands at approximately $70 billion. From a price perspective, BTC has jumped from about $41,900 on January 8 to its current price of $68,941, marking an increase of almost 65%. During this period, BTC reached an all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March. With over a million BTC now held in Bitcoin ETFs, roughly 5% of the total 21 million BTC supply is tied up in these financial products, reinforcing Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. Notably, asset manager BlackRock’s IBIT spot BTC ETF leads the market, holding approximately $30 billion net assets. Grayscale’s GBTC follows with $15.22 billion, and Fidelity’s FBTC ranks third with $10.47 billion in net assets. The growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs is also highlighted in a recent CoinShares report, which found that digital asset investment products attracted inflows of over $2.2 billion last week. CoinShares attributed the recent surge in crypto product inflows to the possibility of a Republican victory in the upcoming US presidential election on November 5. Interestingly, higher inflows were seen at the beginning of the week, while outflows emerged toward the end as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris’s odds of winning improved. At the time of writing, decentralized prediction markets platform Polymarket shows Harris a 41.6% chance of winning the presidency, while Republican candidate Donald Trump remains the favorite with a 58.5% chance. Trump Win To Benefit Crypto, Experts Opine While voter opinion on other policies might be split more evenly, the overall consensus as far as crypto is concerned seems to be that a Trump victory may benefit BTC and other digital assets. Related Reading: Trump’s Vision: America To Reign As Crypto And Bitcoin Epicenter, Latest Statement Reveals Earlier this month, JPMorgan stated that retail investors increasingly view BTC as a ‘debasement trade’ to protect their assets’ purchasing power amid inflation and that a Trump win could provide ‘additional upside’ to BTC. That said, Kamala Harris, Biden’s current vice president, is reportedly taking a fresh approach to digital assets, in contrast to the current administration’s perceived cautious stance. Whether this will boost her popularity among crypto-focused voters remains to be seen. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $68,941, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin dominance stands at 56.7%.

42415661,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntgEm,1730773638,Crypto's Big Trump Gamble,"This year, crypto finally got its pol and his name is Donald J. Trump.  For years, this industry has struggled to find a voice in politics, someone who can channel its liberation ideology and bring its ideas to a wide audience. Now that guy is Trump.  He stands on a stage at the Bitcoin Conference, in Nashville, and says how much he likes crypto people. He announces a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. He promises to free Ross Ulbricht. He hands out burgers at PubKey, in NYC. He even forms his own DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, complete with an insider-y governance model (what better way to signal one’s fidelity to crypto than that?)  Trump says and does all the things crypto wants to hear and he attracts millions in donations as a result. The loudmouths go to bat for him, culture warriors in performative hatred. He occupies political space that the Biden Administration and the Harris campaign could have occupied if they weren’t so craven to the Warren Wing. He says all the right things, because Trump is the master of saying what people want him to say. He fits perfectly with crypto’s goals, because his politics are adaptable to any situation and crypto was desperate for a friend.  I’ll confess that all this makes me personally uncomfortable, not because I have any great love for Kamala Harris, but because Trump has a long track record of being a fair-weather friend. He could just as easily take an entirely opposite view of crypto, if it suits him, and he has. I’m worried about crypto’s embrace of Trump because I find it hard to believe that Trump shares principles that attracted me to crypto.  Here, then, are three reasons why we, as an industry, should be wary, IMO.  1) Trump may not follow through on his promises  A host of White House officials from the first Trump presidency have spoken of his unprincipled nature. John Kelly, his former Chief of Staff, says he fits the definition of a fascist: someone willing to overturn Constitutional norms to meet his goals.  Here’s what a former Trump White House official said this morning:  Seriously: Isn’t that something we should worry about? Isn’t it pretty strange to ally crypto’s cause of crypto with a person who, to put it mildly, is so unreliable? Isn’t it weird to join a personality cult when crypto is supposed to abhor single-points-of-failure.  Trump has to own the crypto issue in order to be crypto’s pol. Kamala Harris and team at times reached out to crypto in the last few months, showing they might play ball on the issue. The players in the Trump-Crypto dance this summer made it known that there was to be no dealing with Democrats. Why?  Because Trump has to be the guy: he wasn’t going to share the issue with Democrats. It was like that in Nashville. Elon Musk was expected to speak with Trump at the Bitcoin Conference. But, according to one insider and CoinDesk’s tracking of Musk’s jet, he turned around when Trump wouldn’t share the stage. Trump needs to be the guy.  To be sure, Dems gave up crypto all on their own. It started with mining, when, after the industry returned to the U.S., all the new plants went to red states. Democrats began outlawing bitcoin mining as environmentally hazardous while Texas and others embraced it as a part of their grid flexibility programs. Personally, I’m all in favor of mining being part of the electrical grid, and Democrats were stupid to outlaw mining and lose the industry.  But the interesting question is how Trump might react if the Democrats did start supporting crypto in earnest.  2) Alienating people outside the party  In its search for power and relevance, crypto has allied itself with the Republican party. It often hasn’t said so publicly, but it has. The people running its campaign groups are Republicans. Its favored down-ballot candidates are largely Republicans. When groups like Stand With Crypto implore people to vote, you know they’re not talking about voting for Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  These campaign groups aren’t always explicit in their preferences. But their allies are and the effect is often exclusionary. Here, for instance, is Ryan Selkis, once of Messari, discussing his feelings about liberal white women today.  It’s a free country and Selkis can say what he wants. He might even believe he’s being brave making such statements. But, seriously, is this good for crypto? How does language like this accord with the goal of wider crypto adoption? Aren’t liberal white women, and the other groups Ryan has slandered 24/7 for the last six months going to be turned off? Might they think crypto is made up of big bad bros like Mr. Selkis? If you’re trying to build a wide crypto movement, surely you don’t want to antagonize women.  3) Crypto will be associated with policies nothing to do with crypto  When I first heard the term “single-issue voter” in reference to crypto earlier this year, I immediately thought BS. How can you support a candidate or party on a single issue? Electoral politics doesn’t work like that. When you support someone like Trump, by default you support a wide range of policies.  So, when crypto gives Trump $10 million to reinterpret the Howey Test, it’s also supporting (in no particular order and to pick just a few Trump policies) a “peace deal” (a.k.a. capitulation) on Ukraine, mass deportations, and antipathy to abortion and transgender rights. Is that where crypto wants to be culturally-socially speaking?  All of which is to say: Be careful what you wish for. The opposition of the Biden Administration and SEC to crypto the last three years was bad for the industry and it had to respond. But aligning this election with a man named Trump could be bad in a whole new set of different, and, as for now, unforeseen ways.

35694690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651555,1730770237,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run: MVRV Metric Hints At $95K To $120K Target,"The Bitcoin price action has sparked renewed interest among analysts and investors as the cryptocurrency approaches a major event (the US election) later in November. A CryptoQuant analyst known as CoinLupin recently provided an analysis on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, focusing on Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric often used to gauge Bitcoin’s value compared to its on-chain fundamentals. With macroeconomic factors creating uncertainty in the crypto markets, CoinLupin shared insights on the significance of MVRV for evaluating Bitcoin’s current market position. Related Reading: Mt. Gox Stirs Market with 500 Bitcoin Transfer to Unknown Wallets—What’s Next for BTC? MVRV And Historical Cycle Peaks The MVRV ratio, currently around 2, indicates that Bitcoin’s market value is approximately double its on-chain realized value, reflecting the average price paid by all asset holders. CoinLupin explained that the key lies in observing trend changes within the MVRV ratio over time rather than fixating on this absolute value. Using the 365-day Bollinger Band for MVRV along with the 4-year average—a common reflection of Bitcoin’s cyclical trends—the analyst noted that the MVRV ratio is currently above the long-term average and recently exceeded its 365-day moving average. According to CoinLupin, this suggests that Bitcoin’s upward trend remains intact. CoinLupin elaborated on the potential significance of Bitcoin’s MVRV levels, particularly regarding historical cycle peaks. In previous cycles, Bitcoin has typically peaked when the MVRV ratio is between 3 and 3.6. While Bitcoin’s current MVRV of 2 does not yet approach this peak range, the upward trend in the MVRV indicates that the market may still have room for growth if historical patterns hold. Should the Realized Value (RV) remain constant, CoinLupin’s analysis projects that Bitcoin would need a price increase of around 43% to 77% to reach an MVRV level between 3 and 3.6. This translates to a potential price target range of $95,000 to $120,000, provided market conditions support upward momentum. However, the analyst also noted that the Realized Value could increase as new buying interest emerges, potentially pushing peak valuations beyond these estimated levels. Bitcoin Market Performance After several weeks and days of building momentum to surge past the $70,000 resistance, Bitcoin has again fallen below this price mark, indicating that there might not be enough momentum yet to move further to the upside. So far, the asset has declined by nearly 1% in the past week. However, BTC currently trades for $68,306, recording a slight increase in price by 1% as its 24-hour high remains at $69,317. Interestingly, despite the slight dip in price in the past weeks, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has registered an increase over this period.

35690496,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651511,1730764855,Bitcoin Open Interest Dropped Significantly – Investors Cautions Amid US Election Week?,"Bitcoin has faced significant volatility and uncertainty as it approaches a pivotal week, with tomorrow’s U.S. election expected to play a key role in determining its price action. BTC is holding steady above the $68,000 mark, a critical level that has shifted from resistance to a solid demand zone. Analysts see this level as essential for maintaining bullish momentum, especially with high-stakes events on the horizon. Key data from Coinglass reveals a notable drop in Bitcoin’s open interest, suggesting that many investors are closing their positions amid the uncertainty surrounding the election and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. This decline in open interest reflects a cautious market stance as traders anticipate the election outcome and its potential influence on broader financial markets and Bitcoin’s trajectory. Related Reading: Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect With BTC managing to hold above this demand zone, the coming days will be crucial for confirming its direction. A sustained hold could strengthen BTC’s outlook, setting it up for a potential breakout. Conversely, increased selling pressure tied to market reactions could put this level to the test. The week ahead could be a defining moment for Bitcoin’s price action as macro events unfold. Bitcoin Investors Preparing For This Week Bitcoin is gearing up for what could be the most defining week of this market cycle. Approaching all-time highs, BTC is facing heightened volatility as two critical events unfold: the U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. These events are poised to impact Bitcoin and global financial markets, potentially shaping global trade policies and economic stability. Recent data from Coinglass highlights that investors are bracing for a turbulent week as open interest in Bitcoin dropped significantly, with many traders opting to close their long and short positions before the election. This retreat in open interest signals caution, as the crypto market anticipates significant volatility stemming from the election results and the Fed’s rate decision. Coinglass shared an analysis on X, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s price could experience extreme swings regardless of who wins the election, likening it to a “wild rollercoaster.” This week is crucial for Bitcoin and the broader global economy, with analysts suggesting that the election could set the tone for international economic policies and trade relations in the years to come. The Fed’s rate decision, scheduled just days after the election, adds additional uncertainty, as it could dictate monetary policy direction and market liquidity.

Whether Bitcoin breaks to new heights or experiences a pullback largely depends on the unfolding economic landscape. For now, Bitcoin remains on edge, with investors poised for a week that could define its trajectory for the months ahead. BTC Testing Crucial Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $68,800 after falling short of breaking its all-time highs last week. This week promises heightened unpredictability for BTC’s price action, driven by major events in the global economy. Key levels will be essential to watch: if Bitcoin can maintain support above $68,000, it will likely set the stage for another attempt to surge past its record high. However, volatility may test this support, potentially shaking out “weak hands” before any significant upward momentum. Should BTC dip below $68,000, further pullbacks could follow, allowing institutional buyers to accumulate before a renewed push. If Bitcoin successfully breaks above its $73,794 all-time high, it will enter a price discovery phase, where the lack of resistance can trigger a rally fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors. This upward momentum in a price discovery zone often leads to rapid price increases as more buyers enter the market.
