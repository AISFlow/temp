42433479,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQz9h,1609106430,Crypto Long & Short: The Christmas Poem Edition,"In a departure from our usual Crypto Long & Short format, in honor of the holiday season I’ve written a poem that reviews the year and reflects some of the progress made in our industry. It’s not rigorous analysis, but I hope the change in rhythm lightens the festive period.      Go ahead and laugh, but may I say in my defense that “good at rhymes” was not in my original job description.      <clears throat>    A cryptomas rhyme    ‘Twas the day after Christmas. Instead of some rest      I decided to review how we had progressed.            In January, headlines screamed military tension.      Bitcoin as “safe haven” attracted attention.            The ructions in March did much to dispel      The “safe haven” myth as all prices fell.            “Black Thursday” also highlighted the danger      Of too much leverage. But things would get stranger.            We all soon grew aware of the threat of a new      Type of virus that spread. It was not “just the flu.”            As April drew round, we saw a new correlation      Between bitcoin and stocks, and a dip in inflation            As spending dried up. But the biggest shock      Was a negative oil price from way too much stock            And not enough storage. Uncertainty spread      As markets digested the changes ahead.            The official response to the looming crash      In incomes and output was to print more “cash.”            The ballooning supply of fiat to spend      Was in sharp contrast to a cap that won’t bend.            And with perfect timing did the network remind      Us that every four years the new issue declined.            The halving in May during our big event      Highlighted supply rules we can’t circumvent.            In June prices held. Volatility dropped.      The spread of the virus could not be stopped.            Nor could the rise of the prices of stocks      That used tech to help people weather the shocks            Of a new way of working and seeing their friends,      In spite of the cuts in yields and dividends.            The summer saw two new trends gather speed:      Services to satisfy institutional need            For custody, platforms and products galore.      And decentralized finance had surprises in store:            A surge in the volume of trading on some      Of the platforms that had names that would become            Memes of their own. Sushi, pizza and YAMs -      While many delivered, it seems some were scams.            With part of the U.S. fighting fire after fire      As August dragged on, stock markets climbed higher.            In October, the bitcoin price started to rise      And a looming election pushed stress to new highs.            PayPal’s support for transacting in some      Crypto assets meant mainstream adoption could come.            More well-known investors came out in defense      Of a bitcoin stake held as a hedge – it made sense            In the face of the risk of growing inflation      And currency woes that could lead to stagnation.            In December, bitcoin’s correlation to gold      Has fallen almost to zero, as new narratives unfold            And the bitcoin price enters a new paradigm.      As I write this verse, it continues to climb            Toward new all-time highs. Now, I do not know      Where it goes from here, but the inflows do show            That institutional interest seems here to stay.      With so much going on, there is more I could say,            But this poem is already way too long, yet      I can’t leave without urging us not to forget            That the year has been hard for so many out there.      And although there is hope, we should still be aware            Of the need to be kind, and to take care      Of our health, and our loved ones. For always somewhere            There is someone whose day could be brightened with sharing      A bit of compassion, affection and caring.            With that, dear readers, I bid you good cheer!      Happy holidays, and have a hopeful New Year.    Chain links    Crypto fund manager Bitwise has liquidated the XRP position it held in its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was suing the company Ripple, which maintains 55 billion XRP in escrow and releases 1 billion every month, for what it deems a years-long unregistered offering of securities. TAKEAWAY: It is not clear that the suit will prevail, as Ripple is claiming that XRP falls outside of federal securities laws. Nevertheless, it is a big deal even for investors that have no interest in XRP, since the ripple effect (sorry) of the regulatory action will touch exchanges that list the token as well as funds that hold it, such as the Bitwise product. It will also further the conversation over what is and isn’t a security, clarity which will be welcomed by the industry as a whole. At time of writing, the XRP price is 40% lower than its price a week ago.      Anthony Scaramucci’s hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, which manages approximately $9.2 billion worth of assets, filed a Form D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for what appears to be its first bitcoin-only fund. SkyBridge has already invested $25 million in this fund, which will open to new investors in early January. According to Scaramucci, MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor was the inspiration for the fund. Scaramucci also said that SkyBridge is running a full bitcoin node. TAKEAWAY: The Saylor connection is interesting in that it shows the contagion power of high-profile conviction. And you don’t often hear of institutional investors getting as deeply involved as to run a node.      Here's a good article by JP Koning on how we applaud the entrance of institutional investors into the market, but we tend to oversimplify why they’re investing.      Mogo, a Canadian fintech listed on the Nasdaq and Toronto stock exchanges, has announced it will make a corporate investment of up to CA$1.5 million (US$1.16 million) in bitcoin, and will consider additional purchases over 2021. TAKEAWAY: I really hope we aren’t witnessing the beginning of a trend in which companies announce bitcoin interest so their share price will go up. I just fail to see the sense in announcing a massive buy before you do it – isn’t part of a company’s obligation to its shareholders to ensure it gets the best price for its acquisitions?      The original bitcoin-buying corporation, MicroStrategy, has invested all of the proceeds of its $650 million debt issuance into 29,646 more bitcoin, at an average unit price of $21,925. The business intelligence firm now has 70,470 BTC worth over $1.596 billion in its treasury reserve. TAKEAWAY: Now this makes sense, announcing after the buy has been completed. Many companies will no doubt have noticed the MicroStrategy share price performance since it dove headfirst into cryptocurrency - this could well encourage others to dive in, and not necessarily for ideological or even investment thesis reasons.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/27/crypto-long-short-the-christmas-poem-edition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d96539d5e47bd7327262ede3b8eff3a81be0f1a-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQyxh,1609084800,DLT Regulation in 2020: Backwards or Sideways?,"This has been an unprecedented year in far more ways than one. Above all else, while 2020 has taught us the importance of speedy and reactive policymaking, it has also highlighted how proactive legislative activity can better prepare our societies for the future, be it for pandemic preparedness, technological innovation or future financial stability. With regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, this is undoubtedly true. However, the same can be said in the blockchain industry.      The writing is on the wall, so to speak. We are closing out this tumultuous year with far more attention currently being paid to distributed ledger technology (DLT) and crypto assets than this time last year – and for good reason. Largely, regulators have begun proactively preparing for the future of this burgeoning technology, as they are realizing its incredible potential and its inevitable future, which includes the mass adoption of blockchain technology.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Albert Isola, MP, is Gibraltar’s Minister for Digital and Financial Services.    But this year, have regulators done enough?      For the first time, this year saw major regulatory proposals from international institutions such as the European Commission with the publication of its regulatory proposals on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA). The importance of this cannot be overstated. The willingness of this 27-member state legislative coalition to publish these extensive legislative proposals highlights the degree to which it is now taking blockchain and crypto assets seriously.      Gone are the days of paying lip service to DLT regulation and sitting on the sidelines – regulators have finally realized that the game has already begun. If they want to keep up, they had best start playing.      The MiCA proposals ensure the European Union’s financial sector maintains a high level of competitiveness, allowing access to and encouraging innovation in the blockchain and crypto-asset industries.      Signaling an embrace of DLT will undoubtedly have a positive impact on institutional adoption. Especially as the lack of regulation in the field to date has hampered the appetite of institutions to become involved in the industry. The indication of a desire to regulate can only be taken as a massive positive among those already involved.      In Gibraltar this year we had the pleasure of joining with the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), a group of international blockchain industry players; became an observing member of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), the leading industry association for the blockchain technology industry; and, more recently, we joined the British Chamber of Commerce for the EU and Belgium.    Gone are the days of paying lip service to DLT regulation and sitting on the sidelines.    All of these efforts, in addition to the updating of our Distributed Ledger Guidance notes to move towards alignment with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) VASP rules, are in furtherance of our open stance to distributed ledger technology, and our efforts to ensure the space is regulated while innovation is encouraged and that the consumer is protected.      Outside of the EU, positive regulatory inroads have been made in a number of different regions. In September, Switzerland unveiled its financial and corporate law amendments, which duly recognize and facilitate regulation of the blockchain and crypto industries. The so-called “Blockchain Act” will welcome the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries into the mainstream, opening the doors of this innovative technology to the Swiss economy.      In the U.S., the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, which is composed of regulators from all 50 states, launched a unified regulatory framework for payment and cryptocurrency companies in September. This framework will be a great help to companies that want to operate in the U.S. or those already operating there to expand across all 50 while significantly lowering the cost of compliance for regulators, which already eats up a staggering amount of expenditure.      The regulatory efforts of the European Commission, Switzerland and the U.S. are major advances that should be lauded by the industry as a whole, although they are not alone. There are dozens of regulatory bodies actively working towards comprehensive DLT regulations from Austria to Japan.      See also: Gibraltar Updates Distributed Ledger Guidance to Match FATF Crypto Rules      After a number of stagnant years in DLT regulation, regulatory efforts in the space are now becoming almost as popular as cryptocurrencies themselves. The focus with which regulatory bodies are now placing upon the industry is a significant positive development, though these bodies should be encouraged to work with the industry, not against it.      Has 2020 been a step backwards or sideways in terms of DLT regulation? Neither. It has been a major leap forward. However, there is still a long way to go. These regulatory efforts need to be seen through to completion with all stakeholders having a seat at the table, not only to create the regulatory framework that is necessary, but to ensure that the innovation that the space is known for is not hampered but encouraged.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Albert Isola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/27/dlt-regulation-in-2020-backwards-or-sideways,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9239a080d8b06a48136785cdc734cbb7fafe5e4-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQz3h,1609081200,Proof-of-Stake Was Bigger Than Eth 2.0 in 2020,"In just a single year, staking has gone from an academic exercise to a dominant force in crypto.      The biggest staking story of 2020 is, of course, the launch of Ethereum 2.0. But beyond that, the past year has seen a tremendous flowering of proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. Four of the top nine crypto assets by market cap are on a path to proof-of-stake. In January, the number was zero – and more are poised to follow.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Tim Ogilvie is the CEO of Staked, which runs staking infrastructure for institutional investors, exchanges, custodians, and wallets.    Proof-of-stake now represents roughly 15% of the total crypto market cap. Much of the acceleration in crypto development we’ve seen this year is attributable to proof-of-stake blockchains, including Ethereum as well as Polkadot, Cardano, NEAR, Solana and others.      As proof-of-stake’s dominance in developer engagement continues to grow through the coming year, we’ll see an explosion of user-facing projects and apps.    Theory into practice    One enduring criticism of proof-of-stake is that it is only theoretical. Many assumed a PoS blockchain would fall down in practice, like an academic building a bridge out of books. Previously successful launches of PoS blockchains like Tezos and Cosmos did little to silence the critics.      Ethereum 2.0’s frequent delays and apparent setbacks no doubt added to this skepticism, with the project becoming something of a punchline in the crypto world until its successful launch last month. And with that, proof-of-stake moved to the main stage.    The decentralized economy will continue to migrate to proof-of-stake.    See also: Proof-of-Stake Could Lead to Crypto Banking. Let’s Avoid That      Ethereum is second only to Bitcoin in terms of total market cap, and boasts the largest developer community of any blockchain. The fact that it is finally moving to proof-of-stake sends a clear signal that the concept is here to stay. Ethereum 2.0 is now set to become the top staking chain – though exactly when is anyone’s guess.      While Ethereum 2.0 represents a coming-out party for proof-of-stake, to focus only on Ethereum’s successful upgrade is to miss a much bigger picture. Many PoS networks are finding success and adoption this year.      Polkadot, currently the largest PoS chain, now has over $3 billion staked. Chainlink, the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap, has announced that it, too, plans to shift to PoS. More will follow. By the end of 2021, most of the top chains will have moved to various degrees of staking systems.      To be sure, bitcoin will keep its crown as the single biggest crypto asset. It was the first, it’s the most well-known and it has a clear and easily understandable use case. But this is less a counter-argument than the exception that proves an emerging rule. Bitcoin is an excellent foundation as a store of value, but those looking to build applications and institutions for a decentralized economy will continue to migrate to proof-of-stake.      See also: The ‘Hot Swap’ Plan to Switch Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake Explained      Adoption will continue to surge as a result of the traction and developer activity we see across proof-of-stake blockchains, which sets them apart from Bitcoin, stablecoins and “meme coins.” The multiple Bitcoin bridges currently coming to market reflect this: The vast wealth held in bitcoin is hungry for new ways to make returns ... on PoS blockchains.      Proof-of-stake has always been the destination for Ethereum and for many other projects in crypto. Some cynicism was inevitable along the way – and certainly, the progress of PoS networks has not been without setbacks. But in 2020 the theory became reality.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET,Tim Ogilvie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/27/proof-of-stake-was-bigger-than-eth-20-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/185e31b48737f04a598bda44bb2fcdf06613a20f-1501x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC's market value now exceeds $500 billion.    Recently, BTC has been leaving a string of broken records in its wake after passing the psychologically key $20,000 mark for the first time on Dec. 16.  In the last several days BTC seems to found yet another gear, breaking through $25,000 Friday night for the first time and going through $26,000 Saturday afternoon like a hot poker through one-ply tissue.  Roughly half a day later, BTC surged past $27,000 early Sunday morning, before racing past $28,000 just before dawn, before settling down to $27,604.67 at this writing, up 9.63% in the last 24 hours.  Year to date, BTC is up more than 275%. In the last 48 hours, it's risen 14%.  With a market value of $512.34 billion, BTC is now more valuable than all but seven publicly traded companies, sitting between Alibaba at $545.4 billion and Tencent Holdings at $509.7 billion, according to Statista data.  Institutional investors are perceived to be driving this record-setting run. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($25 million in December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  With the end of the year looming, some fund managers may also be buying BTC so they can brag next year about being smart enough to get in in 2020 while neglecting to say at which price they had done so.  In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon, trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic as U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to pass an even bigger relief package to allow for larger stimulus checks. These actions are viewed by many as potential catalysts for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could be positive for BTC.  While the tremendous rise in BTC might make it easy to think we're going to see $30,000 before the end of the year, it's good to keep in mind this surge is taking place over a holiday weekend on thin volume.

42433473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQyth,1609074040,Crypto’s Choice: Join the Financial System or Fight It,"This has been an extraordinary year. Not for a century has there been a pandemic on this scale. And although far fewer people have so far died from COVID-19 than perished in the 1918-19 “Spanish flu,” the economic damage is probably far worse. Governments shut down large parts of their economies to try to prevent the virus from spreading, and borrowed heavily to support businesses that could not trade and people who couldn’t work. Central banks cut interest rates to the bone and poured money into financial markets to ward off a deflationary collapse. Now, as 2020 draws to a close, returns on investment are nowhere to be found, and there are rising fears of inflation. It’s no surprise, therefore, that 2020 is ending with a cryptocurrency boom.      During 2020, the fortunes of cryptocurrencies have been determined mainly by central banks. When financial markets crashed in March, cryptocurrencies suffered an even worse fall than traditional asset classes. Bitcoiners would like us to believe that the halvening in May helped bitcoin’s price to recover, but the fact is cryptocurrencies recovered as central banks poured money into financial markets. Continued infusions of fiat money caused the prices of all assets to rise, and cryptocurrencies proved to be no exception.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    Fiat money injections by central banks have particularly fuelled the rise and rise of stablecoins, the ties that bind the crypto ecosystem ever more tightly to the existing financial system. All that fiat money has had to go somewhere, and thanks to central banks’ zero and negative interest rate policies, yield on conventional assets is all but non-existent. So why not have a flutter on the crypto markets, while holding an option to exit back into fiat quickly if it all goes wrong? Stablecoins may be more smoke and mirrors than a real safety net, but they seem to be giving growing numbers of people the confidence to trade cryptocurrencies.      The March crash also revealed that, contrary to what bitcoiners had hoped, institutional investors don’t regard bitcoin as a “safe asset.” They dumped bitcoin and poured their money into traditional safe havens – dollar, yen and Swiss franc. And bitcoin’s recovery since then has pretty much tracked the rise of stocks and corporate bonds, though with somewhat greater volatility. So it seems that despite all that central bank money printing, investors don’t see inflation as their principal risk, or if they do, they don’t regard bitcoin as a good inflation hedge. They buy bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies as high-risk assets to spice up their yield-starved portfolios.      But in the crypto world, bitcoin is now firmly established as the principal “safe asset” for DeFi collateralized lending, along with ether and certain stablecoins. So depending on your point of view, bitcoin and ether are either high-risk, high-yield assets in their own right, or safe collateral for high-risk, high-yield borrowing and lending.    If the cryptocurrency community chooses to conform, cryptocurrency may achieve widespread adoption – but at the price of eventually being absorbed into the financial system it set out to replace.    This bifurcation reflects the chasm between those for whom the crypto world is “home” and those for whom it is an unfamiliar sea full of bloodthirsty monsters. Even seasoned crypto investors can find crypto markets terrifying: it’s hardly surprising that traditional investors are as yet reluctant to do more than dip in their toes.      But that doesn’t mean traditional finance isn’t interested in cryptocurrencies. On the contrary, cryptocurrencies are becoming high-yield assets of choice for many institutional investors. And as cryptocurrencies become increasingly easy to acquire, hold and trade, more and more ordinary people are investing in them, too.      In fact, the ease with which retail investors can buy cryptocurrency with credit cards is a matter of some concern: credit cards are debt, and cryptocurrency trading is by any standards a high-risk activity. In the past, every time there has been a debt-fuelled cryptocurrency bubble, people have been broken. And as I write, cryptocurrency is bubbling again.      When crypto bubbles, regulators wake up. This extraordinary year draws to a close with the news that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) wants to end anonymity for transfers from crypto exchanges to private wallets. The idea seems to be to bring crypto in line with traditional banking.      See also: Frances Coppola: Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul      It’s arguably unfair that traditional banks should have to comply with onerous know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) requirements that crypto exchanges don’t. Crypto enthusiasts would no doubt retort that the solution is to end KYC/AML requirements, not to impose them on people transferring coins to their own private crypto wallets. But introducing this new rule might make cryptocurrencies more attractive to big institutional investors.      And therein lies the dilemma for cryptocurrency. We might say that it is at a fork in the road. Will the community decide to conform to the rules of the existing financial system? Or will it reject those rules, break the ties that bind it to the existing system, and become a parallel financial system, setting its own rules and operating largely outside the existing law?      If the cryptocurrency community chooses to conform, cryptocurrency may achieve widespread adoption – but at the price of eventually being absorbed into the financial system it set out to replace.      But if the cryptocurrency community chooses separation, then the road will eventually lead to head-on conflict with those whose job it is to enforce the existing laws.

Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($25 million in December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  With the end of the year looming, some fund managers may also be buying BTC so they can brag next year about being smart enough to get in in 2020 while neglecting to say at which price they had done so.  In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic while U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to pass an even bigger relief package to allow for larger stimulus checks.  These actions are viewed by many as potential catalysts for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could be positive for BTC.  While the tremendous rise in BTC might make it easy to think we're going to see $28,000 on Dec. 28, $29,000 on Dec. 29 and so on, it's good to keep in mind that this surge is taking place over a holiday weekend on thin volume. Monday could well bring a different narrative.  Still, there are those who think BTC is just getting started. Scaramucci has said he believes BTC is in the ""early innings"" and Saturday afternoon, crypto venture capitalist/bitcoin evangelist Tim Draper tweeted that the price of the leading cryptocurrency could rise ten-fold by the end of 2022.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Kevin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/27/bitcoin-soars-past-27k-for-1st-time-up-2k-in-a-day-market-cap-now-tops-500b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bafc4f04d2d4416827f7de91c2505e836ecd2897-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Because Powell's Fed effectively printed more than $3 trillion in new money, almost doubling the central bank's balance sheet in the process, it helped create an atmosphere that converted many long-time crypto skeptics into believers, Forbes noted. Forbes quoted venture firm Pantera Capital as saying the Fed's actions created ""two centuries of debt in one month.""  That spending spree and concomitant debt explosion led one of the judges, Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital, to credit Powell with basically creating a ""$3 trillion marketing campaign for bitcoin.""
