42433579,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzOLh,1612909123,China Was Questioning Tesla About Quality Problems. Then Bitcoin Happened,"Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin investment couldn’t have come at a better time for the electric car manufacturer. As it happened, about the time the company revealed its massive stake in the cryptocurrency on Feb. 8, Chinese officials had announced that five agencies were questioning Tesla about quality and safety issues.      Specifically, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation issued this short statement on Feb. 8 at 8:00 p.m. China Standard Time (12:00 UTC):      “Recently, the General Administration of Market Supervision and the Central Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Transport and the Fire Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management have jointly held talks on the consumer-reported abnormal accelerations, battery fires, and over-the-air (OTA) upgrades. Tesla Motors (Beijing) Co., Ltd. and Tesla (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. are required to strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations, strengthen internal management, implement the main responsibility of corporate quality and safety, effectively maintain social public safety and effectively protect consumers legal rights and interests.”      Two things make that announcement particularly notable.      First, Tesla is known for its good relationship with the Chinese government and is the first foreign automaker to operate a wholly owned plant in China. Second, it came minutes before Tesla filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its annual 10-K report (at approximately 7:30 a.m. ET) saying it purchased about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) in January.      Tesla shares closed Monday up 1.3%, in no small part because of the bitcoin purchase. The cryptocurrency itself broke new record highs that same day, gaining $4,254.48 alone during the hour Tesla's bitcoin position was reported. While publications like Bloomberg quickly noted the Chinese government's announcement, it was eclipsed by the big moves up in Tesla stock and bitcoin's price.      Tesla may indeed have caught a lucky break when it came to timing. However, some saw a connection between the bitcoin buy and the Chinese government's announcement. As Business Insider reported, investor Michael Burry – whose story was dramatized in “The Big Short” – said in a now deleted tweet that Tesla bought the bitcoin to distract investors from the news out of China. However, such a plot would have required impeccable timing given all that occurred in the previous weeks.      CoinDesk reached out to Tesla for comments but as of press time the company had not responded.    Timeline of events    The seed that blossomed into Tesla’s bitcoin purchase was planted weeks in advance. Here’s what we know so far:    Dec. 20, 2020 (08:21 UTC): Tesla’s Elon Musk started a series of tweets about bitcoin, which he described as “almost as BS as fiat money.” One of the responses, written by MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor, suggested Musk convert the Tesla balance sheet from U.S. dollars to bitcoin. “Are such large transactions even possible?” Musk asked in response to Saylor’s tweet.  Jan. 29, 2021 (08:22 UTC): Tesla’s Elon Musk tweeted that “in retrospect, it was inevitable,” after he added “#Bitcoin” to his Twitter bio, which resulted in a double-digit gain to the price of the oldest cryptocurrency.  Feb. 8, 2021 (12:00 UTC): The State Administration for Market Regulation in China announced in an official statement that Tesla officials had been summoned by several Chinese regulators “in recent days,” citing consumer complaints about Tesla’s quality issues.  Feb. 8, 2021 (12:27 UTC): Tesla’s annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was released. It included the news the company has put an aggregate of $1.5 billion into bitcoin under a new investment policy, and that the company may “acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long term.”  Earlier than usual SEC filing    The 10-K form filed by Tesla came earlier this year compared with previous years, according to data from SEC file-tracking website BamSEC. Between 2015 and 2020, Tesla’s 10-K form typically was filed at the end of February. In the U.S., companies have between 60-90 days to file their 10-K forms.      Despite what could have been negative news coming out of China, Tesla’s stock ($TSLA) soared after the market opened in the U.S. on Monday.      It should be noted that some on Chinese social media platforms, such as Weibo, crypto enthusiasts doubted whether Musk had previously “manipulated” bitcoin’s price.      Nonetheless, right after bitcoin’s price fell below $33,000 earlier on Jan. 29 – the price level Tesla was rumored to have bought at in early January – Musk tweeted his now-famous bitcoin line and added “#bitcoin” in his Twitter bio.      “This may indicate that the [world's] richest guy was allegedly pumping bitcoin and attempted to manipulate the market,” one Weibo user wrote in a post. “If it were true, his behavior was quite ‘low.’” “Low” in Chinese meme language means “disgrace.”      At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price was trading at $46,804.49, up 8.94% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk BPI.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/09/china-was-questioning-tesla-about-quality-problems-then-bitcoin-happened,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc6ff977432f444f342aa87dd3b0ed8b1b8a0056-1500x1217.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In ether's case, CME’s futures launch has given the asset more credibility than ever before.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $47,174 as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $43,948-$48,226 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC well above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin's price is in mega-bull mode again Tuesday. For the second day in a row, the price per 1 BTC hit a new all-time high, $48,226, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""Bitcoin’s rush from $38,000 to a high of $48,000 marks a new all-time high, blasting through the previous all-time high set a month ago, and reignites the recent bull run,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      “Elon [Musk] and Tesla's [bitcoin] purchase of $1.5 billion and accepting bitcoin as payment is now the largest confirmation of a trend months in the making – corporations are worried about their cash reserves losing value and are taking concrete actions to diversify into bitcoin,"" added Lau.      Read More: Bitcoin Could Rally Further as Tesla Leads Corporates on Treasury      “Tesla's $1.5B boost provides us a great example of leadership that will eventually push other S&P 500 companies to allocate part of their treasury reserve into bitcoin,” predicted Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial.      Kogan made an extremely optimistic forecast to CoinDesk. “If all S&P 500 companies allocate at least 1% of their treasury, the price of bitcoin would increase by about $40,000.”      Interestingly enough, with all this bullish bitcoin activity, the ETH/BTC pair has gone bearish. It’s a sign traders are selling ether for bitcoin, with a particularly large red selling candle at 12:00 UTC Monday when BTC jumped on the Tesla news.      “Bitcoin having just hit all-time highs again, we might have a bit of a pullback for all tokens,” noted Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. ”In general though, the market looks bullish. It seems like bitcoin dominance is due to make another brief run upwards again as it's hard to see alts (especially DeFi) continue to perform like they have recently without a break.”      On Tuesday, bitcoin’s dominance, its percentage of the larger crypto market share, has jumped. At one point it was up 2% for February and as of press time it is sitting at 0.94%.      Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, partner at ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk not to dismiss ether (ETH), the native asset of decentralized finance (DeFi) network Ethereum, during this run because it is also making gains Tuesday. “DeFi definitely fuels up the use of the Ethereum network and its leadership as one of the pillars of the future of finance.”    Ether futures volume $33 million first day on CME    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $1,769 and climbing 3.1% in 24 hours as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET). The digital asset hit a fresh all-time high Tuesday of $1,824, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “We expect some exhaustion on ether coming from the price itself, above $2,200, but also from the fees to use the network itself while solutions are being built to tackle this issue,"" said Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      Read More: Ether Hits $1,800 for First Time as Market Cap Passes $200B      Monday was the first day for ether futures contracts on the commodity bellwether Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In total, there were 388 ether contracts traded by volume on the day. Each contract is 50 ETH each. At CME's closing reference rate Monday of $1,732, there was $33.6 million in volume the first day, with $19.7 million in open interest at the close.      Investors will be keeping an eye on this market. Outside of CME, ether futures are already an almost-$6 billion market, with Binance leading the way with $1.3 billion in open interest Monday.      “This is a big milestone for Ethereum and ether from several different angles,” noted Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of Ether Capital, of the CME launch. “First, it provides clarity on ether as a commodity like bitcoin; second, it gives institutions a well-known and accessible way to access ether exposure; third, it provides another tool for price discovery that helps investors and regulators better assess market dynamics.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday.

42433568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzNzh,1612899291,Bitcoin 'Can't Be Stopped': Nigerians Look to P2P Exchanges After Crypto Ban,"""There’s no stopping crypto, [it's] the future and we won’t let some old fools take our future from us,"" one Nigerian bitcoin user who wished to remain anonymous told CoinDesk. ""We’re Nigerians. Using the crypto is a way out of poverty for the youth.""      Last week, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered banks to close down accounts associated with cryptocurrencies. But this will not be enough to shut down Nigeria's cryptocurrency market.      CBN clarified on Sunday that this is not a new order, but a reminder of a directive published in 2017. However, whether old or new, it's having an impact. In response, banks quickly cut ties with cryptocurrency companies, such as the Binance exchange and social payments app Bundle, which in turn stopped accepting deposits.      Nigeria has become a hot spot for cryptocurrency as an alternative to the naira, a national currency prone to depreciation. Nigerians have found various use cases for decentralized digital currencies, from trading bitcoin to make a living to using it to dodge trade restrictions with China. During protests against police corruption in the country last October the Feminist Coalition was one activist non-profit accepting donations going toward the protests. When the group’s bank accounts were frozen and it couldn't accept funds, it switched to bitcoin donations because the payment method could not be frozen.      Some Nigerian cryptocurrency users aren't happy about the directive and have said they plan to continue using cryptocurrencies by using methods that are harder to detect and stop.    Moving to 'peer-to-peer'    Some users think they can get around them by not using centralized exchanges.      ""Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, meaning that it can be transacted without intermediaries. Your bank may be able to shut down your account but no one can shut down your bitcoin wallet. This development, while concerning, will not be the end of bitcoin in Nigeria,"" said Nigerian Bitcoin Core contributor Tim Akinbo on Twitter.      Exchanges such as Binance have been affected because payment partners that store the naira are no longer willing to deal with them due to the directive, putting an indefinite pause on naira deposits to exchanges.      But there's an alternative: peer-to-peer transactions, where two users connect directly to each other to trade cryptocurrency. In return for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, a user might make a bank transfer directly to the other user, or pay that person with cash. Platforms such as Paxful and a Binance’s peer-to-peer platform help connect users to other users so they can coordinate these transactions.      ""As we all know, [peer-to-peer] can’t be stopped,"" one trader in Nigeria, Lucky, told CoinDesk.      Despite CBN's directive, several sources in Nigeria told CoinDesk they plan to continue trading bitcoin via peer-to-peer exchanges, and more aired similar conclusions on social media.      ""Most people will return to [peer-to-peer] transactions, some will leverage several alternatives that connect crypto to legacy financial systems, like reloadable Visa or Mastercard. Most will simply use crypto as a choice reserve asset. [...] A lot of activities will also go clandestine, or underground,"" said developer and cryptocurrency educator Chimezie Chuta.      He added he plans to use ""alternative channels"" to remain a part of the cryptocurrency community.      Crypto exchange Bundle made a similar comment in a statement to its customers about moving to ""alternative channels"" to ensure they can still buy and sell cryptocurrency. The email stated the exchange will provide more information about how this will work in the coming days.      CBN did not respond to an inquiry from CoinDesk by press time about whether these alternatives are lawful.    A mistake?    The CBN order for banks to close accounts associated with cryptocurrency is supposed to curb criminal activity and risky investments. In its clarification, it also listed several reasons why it considers cryptocurrencies dangerous and noted that other central banks and international financial institutions have warned against their use.      ""They have all made similar pronouncements based of the significant risks that transacting in cryptocurrencies portend – risk of loss of investments, money laundering, terrorism financing, illicit fund flows and criminal activities,"" the letter reads.      Sources in Nigeria disagree, arguing the regulations are a mistake.      ""The fact that the CBN sent out this controversial memo to banks and other financial institutions without giving the industry participants and stakeholders an opportunity of dialogue shows how little they know about the Nigeria blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" Chuta said.      He argued that Nigerians should have a choice over what assets they invest in, especially because the value of the naira depreciates over time and users might want to use bitcoin as a hedge against this continuous inflation. He said many Nigerians are using crypto trading to put themselves through school, thousands of new businesses and jobs are being created by crypto innovation.      ""The fact is that this directive was ill-advised, archaic, retrogressive, insensitive, and [smacks] of primitive superstition,"" he added.      Some users are waiting to see if CBN issues any more rules or clarifications.      ""Decentralized systems are hard to ban. But as for me, I’m waiting for more directives and then I can pick my positions,"" crypto enthusiast Bayo Adebayo told CoinDesk, adding: ""But putting a ban in the first place is very bad. I don’t like Nigeria. If it is to be banned totally, I will find a way to leave this Nigeria.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/09/bitcoin-cant-be-stopped-nigerians-look-to-p2p-exchanges-after-crypto-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92c7637a120c41561d861f67b6a5da417f4c58d2-1500x902.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433570,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzO3h,1612895990,The Intangible Reasons Ethereum and Bitcoin Lead,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is exploding. The amount of capital locked in DeFi, an imperfect yet useful measure of traction, recently hit an all-time high of $35 billion.      Today, Ethereum is the dominant network for DeFi in all important metrics, including capital flows, locked capital, number of projects and developers.    Alex is a co-founder at Zabo, a platform enabling fintechs and financial services companies to easily connect cryptocurrency accounts to their applications.    The exploding growth in DeFi has stoked an already fierce battle among smart contract platforms, aka “Ethereum-killers,” to win share of the emerging category.      Tushar Jain, partner at the crypto venture firm Multicoin Capital, recently made comments on Twitter calling into question Ethereum’s DeFi dominance:      Jain’s view is held by many smart investors and can be summarized as: eventually higher performance, better designed, less expensive networks will start to eat into Ethereum’s DeFi market share.      Indeed, investors have poured billions into competing smart contract platforms in support of this exact thesis.      Yet, despite many competing platforms launching and deploying vast amounts of capital in their efforts, Ethereum’s network effects and moat are inexplicably as strong as ever. How is this possible?      It’s possible because Ethereum has powerful intangible assets that are incredibly difficult to reproduce and compete against.      This isn’t a new dynamic – intangible dominance has long been observed and impacted traditional markets and companies, too.    Coca-Cola, Google and ... Ethereum?    You can generally split assets into two categories: tangible and intangible.      Tangible assets are physical in nature – things like money, equipment and servers. For computer networks, a tangible asset might include how much computational power can be delivered or how fast a query can be run – things based on underlying physical properties of the network. Given tangible assets’ physical nature, they are quite easy to quantify and measure.      By contrast, intangible assets do not exist in physical form – such as intellectual property, brand recognition and trust. Intangible assets can be very difficult to quantify, making it harder to spot their influence on final outputs like earnings or number of connections in a network. Intangible assets can also be incredibly difficult to replicate, because their creation often relies on something far more complex, like the thoughts of a human brain.      Investors have long known that successful companies have strong intangible qualities giving them the ability to accrue outsized value and stay highly competitive for long periods.      Consider a company like Coca-Cola. Imagine you created a cola that tasted even better than Coke (“higher performance”) and supplied enough capital to build a better world-wide distribution network to rival Coca-Cola’s (“more scalable” and “less expensive”).    Investors have long known that successful companies have strong intangible qualities giving them the ability to accrue outsized value.    Would that enable you to convince most existing and new cola drinkers to make the switch off Coke?      Probably not.      Coca-Cola’s tangible assets – the raw ingredients that make up Coke’s taste, packaging and distribution – are not what secure the company’s dominant market position alone. Coke is dominant today because of intangible assets: its universal brand awareness, customer loyalty and the way it makes people feel. Those are incredibly hard to reproduce.      Yet, Coke is a consumer brand. What about technology? We find the same trend there, too.      Google is a clear example of intangible dominance in a technology market. While Google is widely viewed as having the best technology (part of its brand and thus intangible), like Coke its brand is so strong that it became a generic term (“google it”).      Today, more than 20 years after Google was founded, competing search engines still languish behind Google’s 85%+ market share. Why? Unassailable intangible assets, including brand, trust and existing search volume, which together form part of the moat that enables Google to continually maintain superior tangible assets over long periods.    Ethereum the intangible    What about open-source networks? Do the same rules apply?      In open-source networks, there are far fewer intangible assets to work with. There are no patents or intellectual property that make one network better than the other. All networks compete on a vast, completely open plane, viewable and copyable by all.      Initially it may seem that this makes tangible assets such as network speed, computational power or capital availability more valuable.      But it’s quite the opposite. Tangible assets are more easily reproduced in open-source software than just about anywhere else. Just as in traditional businesses, intangibles are king in open source.      Competing networks are quick to point out tangible weaknesses in Ethereum’s network: high transaction fees (not cheap), lack of scalability (not fast) and even easily fudgable smart contracts (not secure).      But they fail to fully appreciate that Ethereum’s immense intangible assets are the real moat behind its dominance:    A vast, rapidly expanding interconnectedness, of developer energy (proof of work), capital, assets and projects (akin to Google’s existing search volume moat)  A cryptocurrency brand second only to Bitcoin (the category leader) and the dominant brand in DeFi where Ethereum is far and away the category leader  A fanatically loyal community that includes the most dominant network of developers and projects in the entire crypto industry.    Attacking primarily on a tangible basis – “better technology” and more resources – will not knock Ethereum from its dominant position anymore than “better cola” or “better search results” will unseat Coke or Google. The intangible moat at this stage is simply too wide, giving Ethereum free range to continue building compounding tangible infrastructure.      Many well-capitalized, super-talented and well-meaning teams have built and launched networks that have struggled (so far) to put a dent in Ethereum’s DeFi dominance. What most of these attempts have in common is they assume that producing superior tangible outcomes in the same categories Ethereum owns will be the strategy to win.    What about new users?    Jain’s comment importantly makes the distinction of “new DeFi users,” implying that Ethereum’s dominance won’t last as DeFi grows and there are many new participants.      Yet, we don’t have to look farther than Bitcoin to see the opposite precedent.      Similar to Ethereum, and for twice as long, Bitcoin has confronted and ultimately out-competed every contender to the throne of the dominant, decentralized, store-of-value network. Similar to Ethereum, Bitcoin has constantly been attacked over the perceived limitations of its network, including that it’s too slow and not scalable.    The intangible moat at this stage is simply too wide, giving Ethereum free range to continue building compounding tangible infrastructure.    Yet, despite a seemingly infinite number of tangible iterations, every Bitcoin competitor has failed to generate an intangible moat of significance in brand, awareness, trust or adoption. Instead of faltering, Bitcoin has dominated the market with a more than 60% share by market cap. Bitcoin’s brand of “digital gold” has become so powerful that not even gold itself can escape Bitcoin’s intangible gravity.      Twelve years and thousands of competitors later, Bitcoin continues to convert an outsized portion of the incremental crypto user.      See also: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin and Ethereum Are a DeFi Double Act      The only network with a brand-loyal following and network effects similar to Bitcoin is Ethereum. It obtained them by creating completely new categories – smart contracts and DeFi – that did not compete with Bitcoin directly. If Bitcoin and internet businesses with powerful, intangible network effects are any indication, we’re headed towards more dominance for Ethereum, not less, driven by an ever expanding intangible moat.      So what’s a competing technologist to do? Stop building? Stop investing?      None of the above.      Technologists should keep building and investing in new categories where the authenticity of their product and vision will attract not just users, but loyal followers.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alex Treece,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/09/the-intangible-reasons-ethereum-and-bitcoin-lead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe18caaa6619264575711e75f0c8566af10754cb-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an open letter, first published by The Verge on Tuesday, Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) asked Sun and Wayn to detail how DLive is combating ""domestic extremism and white supremacy on the platform,"" how it is protecting younger users from extremist content and whether the company has any way to identify individuals financing extremist content.      DLive is a subsidiary of BitTorrent, which was acquired by the Tron Foundation in 2018. Users can stream videos and be paid by their viewers in crypto, though after the insurrection Wayn announced that only gaming content would be able to receive payments.      The letter ties to last month's insurrection on Capitol Hill. Several far-right extremists streamed on DLive during the breach of the U.S. Capitol Building; some of them were later arrested.      ""Several of these individuals earned thousands of dollars in DLive’s digital currency that day, and a number received large donations through the platform ahead of the event.

42433564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzIjh,1612893073,Blockchain Bites: Will Bitcoin See 'Reflexive' Buys After Tesla?,"Sound bites    Nic Carter argued that comparing bitcoin's energy consumption to Visa's is missing the forest for the trees. Bitcoin isn't just a payments network, but a self-contained monetary system that proposes its own unit of account, he argued live on CoinDesk TV.      ""First Mover"" is a rundown of the top global market, business and regulatory news stories impacting digital assets. Catch it every weekday at 9 a.m. ET.    Three trends    1. Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin gambit could have a long tail. Bitcoin saw record single-day dollar growth after news broke Tesla replaced a fraction of its U.S. dollar treasury with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose more than $8,000, setting a new ceiling above $48,000 early today. The rally has made bitcoin, with an estimated $834.2 billion market cap, more valuable than all but seven of the world's publicly traded companies.    An affirmation of bitcoin’s prospect as an inflation hedge from a Fortune 500 company could drive “reflexive” investments from other large corporations. “‘Reflexivity’ is a theory that a positive feedback loop between expectations and economic fundamentals can yield a substantial price rally,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.  GSR trader John Kramer said the market is now pricing in the likelihood that other heavyweights will allocate to bitcoin. Indeed, calls on bitcoin’s future price have seen increased volume in the $56,000 to $72,000 range, Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said.    But it’s not just bitcoin. Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, also set a record high of $1,824.59 in early Tuesday trading, pushing its market capitalization above $200 billion.    Yesterday, Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) much anticipated ETH futures went live. Nearly 400 contracts were traded. CME is often equated with institutional involvement.  Godbole notes ether’s pump could also be driven by supply issues on exchanges. Liquidity has dried up as investors continue to take direct custody of their coins or move them to high-yield DeFi tools. The trend picked up pace in recent months, with the amount of ETH held on exchanges declining 8% in the past 4.5 weeks alone.  A rise in ether’s price is typically adjoined by increased “gas” fees, the price paid to applications on the decentralized network. CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports that alternative application-focused blockchains Cardano and Polkadot are benefiting from Ethereum's rising costs – with their native assets ADA and DOT, respectively, becoming the fourth- and fifth-most valued crypto assets.    2. Legacy banks are taking note of the cryptocurrency industry. An investment analyst added New York-based Signature Bank to JPMorgan’s “focus list,” a list of recommended investable products, saying the blockchain-friendly bank is “positioned to ride the crypto wave.”    Meanwhile, SCB 10X, Siam Commercial Bank’s venture capital arm, said it has launched a new $50 million fund to invest in blockchain startups with an eye for DeFi. SCB 10X previously invested in Ripple and BlockFi. Separately, Singapore-based Spartan Group also announced a $50 million venture fund directed at DeFi.  On the crypto-native front, the market maker Apifiny announced plans to go public by the end of 2021.  Elsewhere, Binance-backed, not-yet-launched DeFi platform Xend Finance is gaining buzz due to its ambitious goal of bringing high-interest savings opportunities to Africa. The platform will allow credit unions and cooperatives to earn interest on deposits by converting them to stablecoins.    3. Open systems are politically neutral, a point that could raise eyebrows. According to a United Nations reckoning, North Korea funded its wartime footing – including its nuclear and ballistic missile programs – through cryptocurrency hacks.    A report sent to U.N. Security Council members on Monday said North Korea-linked criminals took in $316.4 million worth of cryptocurrencies by attacking financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges between November 2019 and the same month a year later. The nation is said to be laundering these stolen funds through over-the-counter brokers in China to acquire fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has drafted rules that could prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, most notably the so-called “Travel Rule,” which bumps up reporting requirements for exchange and wallet providers. BitMEX, the crypto derivatives exchange, recently published a framework of best practices on storing this information.  At stake    What to do with all this cash? Tesla investing in bitcoin is a sea-change moment for the cryptocurrency industry. After the much-hyped auto company disclosed its $1.5 billion bitcoin buy, the obvious (and unknowable) question became “who’s next?”      Indeed, U.S. corporations are sitting on a vast trove of cash. According to Moody’s Investors Service, nonfinancial firms had a stockpile of $2.1 trillion in U.S. dollars last June. While companies could pay down debt, invest in U.S. Treasury bonds or even go on an M&A spree, there’s a certain logic to keeping a war chest:      “Obviously, cash provides excellent insurance in times of escalating uncertainty. It insulates firms from risk in the financial markets, ensuring the ability to fund critical projects and compete strategically in their product market,” Kristine W. Hankins and Mitchell Petersen, finance professors at the University of Kentucky and Kellogg School of Management, respectively, wrote in the Harvard Business Review.      Crypto-heads, including former acting chief of the OCC Brian Brooks, would deny some of these claims, especially amid a period of intense monetary expansion Just yesterday, Brooks said bitcoin could be a more stable source of value. He noted the U.S. money supply increased 25% in 2020.      Even if you’re not an inflation-doomer, this pace of money creation certainly raises questions about what to do with all this corporate cash. It was a question the Royal Bank of Canada implicitly raised yesterday, when weighing in on the Tesla phenomenon.      According to analysts at Canada’s largest bank’s brokerage division, Apple should consider the crypto. With a $2.3 trillion market capitalization, Apple is among the world’s most valuable firms. It is also sitting on close to $200 billion in cash.      RBC analysts said a natural move would be for the company to spin up its own crypto exchange. The firm already provides payment and digital wallet services, has a trusted reputation and a research department that could crack long-standing know-your-customer (KYC) challenges.      Plus, the analysts estimate, a crypto exchange could bring in $40 billion a year. (That’s estimated from extrapolating from Square’s bitcoin revenues, and an assumption about 15% of Apple’s existing 1.5 billion install base would play around with the new feature.)      “If Apple went down this path the U.S.A. would likely acquire the most crypto assets from a global perspective,” the analysts wrote.      Indeed, increased competition among crypto exchanges might be welcome. Yesterday, a surge in users following the Tesla news caused interruptions among some of the most prominent exchanges.      While the crypto infrastructure has improved notably since the last bull market – with large entities able to be counterparties to billion-dollar bitcoin trades without any significant market disruption, as Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter noted on CoinDesk TV this morning – there’s still work to be done.      Commenting on the exchange outages yesterday, eToro Managing Director Guy Hirsch said fiat to crypto trades introduce liquidity and settlement risks between banks and exchanges.      The risks are less severe for “pure” crypto to crypto exchanges, Hirsch noted.      Maybe there’s a lesson there for companies sitting on dollar stockpiles?

With a 1.75% management fee, the fund started taking subscriptions last Friday and the fund has nearly $30 million in assets under management, according to its website. Roughly six to 12 months from now, the trust should be available on over-the-counter markets making it tradable through brokerage accounts, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince told CoinDesk.      The company joins Bitwise and Osprey Funds in competing with Grayscale’s dominance in the bitcoin trust market. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)      BlockFi will also be competing against Grayscale on partnerships with institutionally trusted brands.      The fund’s assets are custodied by Fidelity Digital Asset Services; Davis Polk & Wardwell will act as BlockFi’s legal counsel in connection with the trust; Coin Metrics will provide index and pricing data; and Grant Thornton will serve as the fund’s auditor. BlockFi will be announcing a partnership with a broker-dealer before the shares are publicly traded.      Prince couldn’t say whether the shares would trade at a premium to the spot price of bitcoin as Grayscale’s trust does, but James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said there is little reason to think it wouldn’t, because typically there are not enough shares in funds to meet the demand. BlockFi could pull in a significant number of retail users that are already using the firm’s other bank-like products, Seyffart added.      “If you’re on BlockFi they can pull in some of their clients that are using them for the high-interest rate accounts, whether it’s on crypto or USDC,” Seyffart told CoinDesk.      If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ends up approving a bitcoin ETF, the value proposition for BlockFi’s fund and funds like it could be diminished, Seyffart said.      The analyst added: “I don’t think it’s out of the question that we could get an approval or at least the conversation of looking at an approval for a bitcoin ETF in 2021 and maybe 2022.”    Read more: Bitwise Files for Verification to Publicly Trade Its Bitcoin Fund    Prince said he would welcome a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).      “The firms that build the relationships, the distribution and asset management structures to have significant assets under management before an ETF is approved will be on the shortlist of firms that are really well-positioned to create or transition to an ETF when the regulators are ready for that,” Prince said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/09/blockfis-bitcoin-trust-takes-aim-at-gbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62456251a2ded787eb07573beb40201cf6a69876-2476x1670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Money market Equilibrium is building a cross-chain implementation of Curve Finance on its Polkadot parachain. Once finished, the automated market maker (AMM) will exist on both Ethereum and Polkadot.      Curve Finance is one of the largest automated market makers (AMM) on Ethereum. The protocol enables low-slippage swaps of stablecoins such as tether, dai and USDC. For example, Curve processed $400 million in volume in one day last month, according to CoinGecko.      “We’re excited to see the demand for stablecoin liquidity driving the technology to other chains,” Curve Finance CEO Michael Egorov said in a statement. “Deep liquidity is vital for adoption of new applications like Equilibrium, as well as for the adoption of new blockchains themselves.”    Fees, fees, fees    The cross-chain project comes as transaction fees continue to soar on Ethereum, the preeminent blockchain for DeFi. As CoinDesk reported, the average transaction fee broke north of $20 last week.      DeFi projects are now scrambling to address heightened fees, a factor that pushes out small investors from the young market. One such answer is rollups, a throughput solution that bundles transactions off-chain and then settles them on-chain in one lump. Curve Finance has been working on a rollup solution using zero-knowledge proofs and even has a live version.      Yet, many DeFi apps are placing bets on many horses – including other blockchains. For example, DeFi lending market Compound announced its new Compound Chain currently under development across a few networks.      “With Curve Finance running on our Polkadot parachain, we have a powerful tool for exchanging homogenous assets on Polkadot, whether they are DOT-based or not,” Equilibrium CEO Alex Melikhov said in a statement. “We stand to unlock some true cross-chain functionality.”      Correction (Feb. 9, 23:55 UTC): A previous version of this article implied Curve Finance would be building the AMM on Polkadot in conjunction with Equilibrium. However, Equilibrium will be building the product alone.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/09/defis-curve-finance-is-branching-out-to-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5204e729dde4d6166df05a410cca27e0e2182ba-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433556,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzIbh,1612882455,State of Crypto: India and Nigeria's Crypto Crackdowns Continue Old Trends,"Welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De.      Are governments worrying more about the growth of crypto? Two countries already announced crypto-related bans, though this could be an extension of previous efforts at controlling the space – and their own economies – rather than new initiatives      Click here to sign up for State of Crypto.    The crackdown begins (again)  The narrative    In recent weeks, both India and Nigeria have made noises about banning crypto industry participants’ access to the traditional banking sector. This could be a sign of renewed government crackdowns on the space.    Why it matters    Bitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies were designed to be censorship-resistant, stateless and a tool of economic freedom. Citizens in Belarus and Nigeria used bitcoin to raise funds for those who lost their jobs or otherwise faced repercussions for protesting against authoritarian regimes. People in other countries use cryptocurrencies as a way of cheaply transferring value across borders.      But the crypto space might not yet be mature enough to actually fulfill those goals – at least, not entirely. Ray Dalio, head of major hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said government prohibition could have a significant negative impact on cryptocurrency adoption, and we’re indeed seeing governments try to enact or enforce stringent regulation.    Breaking it down    The Indian government began considering a bill that would ban private cryptocurrencies late last month, defining “private” as any cryptocurrency that’s not state-backed. The bill, which was introduced to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, also suggested that India could launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation’s central bank.      There are two details here that stick out to me, The first is that the RBI tried to restrict cryptocurrencies once before, when it told banks they could not provide services to crypto companies in 2018. That ban was later struck down by the nation’s Supreme Court, though RBI vowed to fight the ruling. This new bill, which was also introduced in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), could be a natural evolution of that policy goal, one that would have the force of law behind it.      The second detail is the Indian government has also tried to control its financial system before. In 2016, the government demonetized the ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, some 86% of the circulating currency, nominally in an effort to stamp out “black money,” or cash held from illicit means. In 2018, India’s Aadhaar system decided every resident effectively needed access to the biometric identification platform in order to buy a cell phone or access banking services.      A continent away, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) published a document saying banks cannot provide crypto exchanges with services. Binance and Bundle Africa immediately announced they would suspend deposits.      Here, too, the CBN says its ban isn’t new, but rather that its statement last week is merely reiterating a position it has held since 2017. Still, the timing of the move is interesting, coming just months after residents began using bitcoin to raise funds as part of the #ENDSARs movement.      Basically, this looks like a trend. Crypto is getting to a place where governments have to pay attention to it. Some industry insiders seem less alarmed about Nigeria’s ban than their Indian counterparts are about the subcontinent’s ban.    U.S. Congress    Meanwhile, Congress is gearing up to face a number of issues this year, beginning with an impeachment trial that starts this week and coronavirus pandemic relief. However, a number of cryptocurrency issues will likely work their way through Capitol Hill. Here are a few of the major players to watch:    House of Representatives  Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) – Rep. Waters chairs the House Financial Services Committee, the main committee that oversees cryptocurrency and fintech issues in the House of Representatives. She has called a hearing next week on Robinhood and the GameStop pump.  Representative Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) – Rep. McHenry is the ranking member on House Financial Services. McHenry has said publicly that he’s a proponent of cryptocurrencies and fintech innovation.  Representative Jim Himes (D-Conn.) – Rep. Himes is the chair of the HFSC Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy, which is holding a hearing on domestic terrorism funding in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection later this month. Expect bitcoin to come up.  Representative French Hill (R-Ark.) – Rep. Hill is the ranking member on the National Security subcommittee.  Senate  Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) – Sen. Brown is the new chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Development. In public statements he has said his focus will be on evaluating a real-time payments system, as well as paying more attention to housing and urban development issues than the committee has in years past.  Senator Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) – Sen. Toomey is the ranking member of the Senate Banking committee.  Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – Sen. Warren, who drove the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is on the Senate Banking and Finance committees. She hasn’t explicitly said anything about cryptocurrencies recently but has been outspoken on consumer protection issues that could intersect with the crypto industry.  Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) – Sen. Lummis, who won her seat in last year’s election, is joining the Senate Banking committee as its first member who’s an active bitcoin advocate. She has already announced her intention to launch a fintech caucus in the Senate and said she hopes to “work with federal regulators to ensure that regulation of digital assets are structured to encourage innovation, instead of stifling it.”  Biden's rule    Last week, President Joe Biden formally withdrew the nominations of Robert Benedict Bowes and Brian Brooks. Bowes was former President Donald Trump’s nominee to be a Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioner to succeed current Commissioner Brian Quintenz. Brooks, the former Acting Comptroller of the Currency, was nominated to a full five-year term. Biden is expected to name Chris Brummer and Michael Barr to fill the CFTC and OCC roles.    Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  US Senate Bill Re-Introduces Suspicious Activity Reports for Social Media: There’s a new bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. Senate that would basically create a sort-of FinCEN for social media platforms. Anyone can file a “Suspicious Transmission Activity Report,” or STAR, to report allegedly illegal activity on different technology platforms to this new agency. What could possibly go wrong?  Ethereum Futures Are Now Trading on CME: Cash-settled ether futures are live on the CME, one of the first U.S. exchanges to launch bitcoin futures back in 2017. Tim McCourt, CME’s global head of equity products, told my colleagues on CoinDesk TV that, “we’ve had record adoption of institutional players” since those first bitcoin futures contracts began trading.  Protego Becomes Second Crypto Firm to Win Bank Charter From OCC: A Seattle-based digital asset firm Protego Trust has won a conditional bank charter, joining Anchorage in being one of the first crypto firms approved to operate as a national bank. This is an interesting move to me because former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks is no longer at the regulatory agency, meaning critics of the OCC’s moves on crypto can’t say he influenced this particular decision. It’s a promising sign. Also, Metal Pay has filed for a charter with law firm Anderson Kill’s assistance.  Ron Hammond, a former legislative staffer for Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) who wrote the Token Taxonomy Act before joining Ripple as a government liaison, has joined the Blockchain Association as Director of Government Relations.  Outside crypto:  Getting vaccinated is hard. It’s even harder without the internet.: This MIT Technology Review article looks at the difficulties Americans living in San Francisco – the heart of the nation’s tech scene – face trying to get internet access. It’s not just a matter of physical infrastructure either. Reporter Eileen Guo notes that even where the internet is easily accessible, people might not be able to afford telecom provider costs.

42433560,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzIlh,1612881870,First Mover: Elon Musk's #bitcoin Bet Pays Off With $270M Gain on First Day,"Price Point    In a run reminiscent of its stunning ascent in early January, bitcoin's price blew past $45,000, $46,000 and $47,000 in less than an hour late Monday, eventually topping $48,000. By early Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency had settled down to about $45,200.      The powerful rally came after Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), announced it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) now has a market capitalization of nearly $890 billion, which would rank it ahead of all but six of the world's largest publicly trading companies, including No. 7 Tesla at $829 billion.      For those keeping track of Tesla's bet, it appears to be paying off so far. Based on the 18% gain in the cryptocurrency's price over the past 24 hours, the investment has already generated a paper gain of about $270 million.      Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, climbed early Tuesday to a new all-time high of $1,825, based on CoinDesk 20 data. The increase pushed the second-largest cryptocurrency's market value past $200 billion for the first time. Traders cited expectations the CME's new ether futures might prompt more institutional investors to bet on the cryptocurrency's price. At the same time, data showed the balance of ether on exchanges falling to a 16-month low – taken as a sign few investors are queuing up to take profits, even at these unprecedented price levels.      In traditional markets, investors in bond markets were focused on the ""great reflation trade,"" amid signs President Joe Biden is pushing forward with his $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal despite opposition from lawmakers in the minority Republican Party as well as from some fellow Democrats. Stocks were lower, while gold strengthened 0.6% to $1,842 an ounce.    Market Moves    Corporate treasurers might follow Tesla into bitcoin      Tesla's purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin has opened a spigot of speculation on how many corporate executives might soon follow CEO Elon Musk's lead and steer their firms into cryptocurrencies.      ""It will now become increasingly common for company treasuries to have an allocation to bitcoin,"" says Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital. He predicts the trend could help send bitcoin prices to $80,000 by year's end.      Musk commands an audience partly because he's reportedly one of the world's richest men – just as investors once hung on Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett's every word when he was the world's richest man; he had the hot hand.      “If any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in bitcoin, I don’t think it would have been taken seriously,” Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York, told Reuters.      And yet it is being taken seriously. Not only are big investors with almost-unassailable reputations like Bill Miller going into bitcoin, at least partly because of its perceived use as a hedge against central bank money printing, but retail traders are flocking to the fold. In January, some $3.5 billion poured into exchange-traded funds that track inflation-protected bonds, the strongest monthly inflow on record, Bloomberg News reported last week.      Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO who has become the biggest proselytizer for corporations putting treasury money into bitcoin, congratulated Musk on Monday in a tweet. ""The entire world will benefit from this leadership,"" Saylor wrote.      Mitch Steves, an analyst with the brokerage firm RBC Capital Markets, wrote Monday in a report that he thinks Apple (AAPL), the iPhone maker that is also the world's largest company, should start its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to CoinDesk's Nathan DiCamillo, Steves wrote that ""the potential revenue opportunity would be in excess of $40 billion a year."" That's enough to move the needle, even for Apple.      ""There's no doubt in my mind that in the coming weeks and months, we'll see many more Fortune 500 companies making similar announcements as they look to diversify their tremendous cash balances out of the flailing U.S. dollar,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics.      Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, says the corporate herd may still move slowly. Indeed, few CEOs possess the well-documented moxie of Musk, who not only started his own private spaceflight company as a moonlighting gig but also once sent a single tweet that resulted in a $40 million fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Some other companies may be tempted to follow but the vast majority will be far too cautious to expose themselves to the volatile world of cryptos,"" Erlam wrote in an email.      David Grider, an analyst for the independent investment-research firm FundStrat, estimated Monday in a report that some $215 billion of additional demand for cryptocurrencies could materialize if all the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index followed Tesla's lead.      ""We don’t think this happens overnight, but we do think there’s much more room for corporate treasury penetration and expect the trend to continue,"" Grider wrote.      As always with fast-moving market trends, fear of missing out, often known by the acronym FOMO, can be a powerful force. The more big corporate moves into bitcoin, and the higher bitcoin goes as a result of those moves, the more treasurers might feel pressure to join the crowd. Grider suggests that some companies might buy bitcoin as a hedge against the possibility their companies might someday get disrupted against blockchain technology; if they lose out to the competition, the reasoning goes, at least they'll have the bitcoin.      Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant, put it this way to Reuters: ""The downside of staying on the sidelines will only become costlier over time.""    Bitcoin Watch    'It's a call-buying frenzy'      Investor interest in call options (bullish bets) has increased, a sign that some investors are positioning for a continued price rally, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes.    “We are seeing high volume across the board in call options ranging from $56,000 to $72,000,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. “If the options market is any indication of the enthusiasm across investors, we will be going a lot higher.""  Multiple 100-plus call option contracts have been bought at strikes of $44,000, $48,000, and $52,000, according to Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas.  ""It's a call-buying frenzy,"" Laevitas tweeted late Monday.  The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of bearish puts relative to calls, are firmly entrenched in negative territory, per data provider Skew. That's an indication call options are drawing higher demand than puts.    According to Godbole, the broader bias in the bitcoin market should remain bullish as long as the trendline rising from $10,000 is held intact. (See chart above.)      The “Elon rally” has established $42,500 as the new support, and prices could rise to $50,000 in coming weeks, according to Dibb.    Token Watch    Ether: On the first day of trading in the CME's new ether futures, some 388 contracts changed hands, equivalent to about 19,400 ETH, or $33 million, Tim McCourt, global head of equity products for the Chicago-based exchange, told The Block. ""The response to ether has been overwhelming,"" McCourt said. For comparison, when the CME debuted bitcoin futures in late 2017, nearly 1,000 contracts changed hands on day one, according to McCourt.      Cardano (ADA), polkadot (DOT): Ether? Bah. A growing number of cryptocurrency traders are betting on ""Ethereum killers,"" or tokens associated with blockchains that could someday rival Ethereum's domination of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen writes. Cardano has vaulted into the top ranks of digital assets, with a market value of about $22 billion, while polkadot is just behind, at about $20 billion. Both have now surpassed XRP's $16 billion though still represent a fraction of ether's $201 billion.      Dogecoin (DOGE): Prices for the doggie-faced meme token, started in 2013 as little more than a joke, were higher for a fourth straight day, topping 8 cents. The token now has a market capitalization of more than $10.3 billion. That's more than Dropbox, the cloud data-storage company; Pandora, the music-streaming service; Invesco, the mutual-fund company; and Fresnillo, the world's largest silver-mining company, according to the website CompaniesMarketCap.com.    First Person    Opinions, observations and other perspectives      Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at EQUOS, had a lot of fun imagining Tesla's new price list, below, which appeared in his daily newsletter on Monday.      Even so, Antony Welfare, executive director for enterprise at NEM Software couldn't help but dwell on the future price of a Tesla Roadster, currently priced at $250,000, or a little over 5 BTC: ""By the end of this bull market it will be more like 2 BTC,"" he noted in a comment emailed to First Mover by a PR representative.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/09/first-mover-elon-musks-bitcoin-bet-pays-off-with-270m-gain-on-first-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6aa2d23670fd90af2c18da8faf482d8870f849ad-1000x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzIRh,1612881678,Matic Network Now 'Polygon' as Platform Targets Ethereum's L2 Woes,"Ethereum startup Matic Network is rebranding to Polygon as it goes all-in on further Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions.      The India-based firm is pivoting toward addressing Ethereum’s throughput problem with a forthcoming layer 2 aggregation SDK that can host multiple technologies at once, according to a blog post shared with CoinDesk.      The startup currently administers a proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum sidechain using the Plasma framework – a now out-of-favor layer 2 solution that will continue to be hosted. Version 1 of the software development kit (SDK) for layer 2 aggregation will be ready in March, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said in a Telegram message.      “Polygon will support multiple layer 2 solutions such as Optimistic Rollups (OR), zkRollups (ZKR), and Validium, effectively making it an L2 aggregator,” the blog reads. “This approach, implemented via Polygon’s modular SDK, will enable projects to select the scaling solution that best suits their needs rather than being bound by any one option.”    Ethereum fees pushing layer 2 solutions    Polygon’s rebrand and new roadmap comes at a time of increased stress on the Ethereum main network, which has been suffering historic fee rates. For example, the average Ethereum transaction fee broke above $20 per transfer for the first time ever last week. Many Ethereum-based dapps are scrambling to find layer 2 solutions and have often turned to various forms of rollups like ZKR or OR.      Rollups are a throughput technology for verifying transactions off-chain that are then re-published on-chain. They have been the preferred solution to Ethereum’s scaling woes, as Vitalik Buterin expressed in this autumn blog post.    Read more: Ethereum’s Top Dapps Are Increasingly Turning to ‘Rollups’: Here’s Why    Polygon will also be able to launch whole blockchains, similar to Parity Technologies’ Substrate. Blockchains launched on Polygon inherit the security assumptions of the underlying Ethereum blockchain, just as Substrate-based chains can plug into Polkadot’s ecosystem to gain security, Polygon core developer Mihailo Bjelic said in a phone interview.      “The Polygon SDK is built to accommodate [and] aggregate all such kinds of solutions, rollups being one of them.

Xend has also secured new investors led by NGC Ventures and HashKey, bringing total investment in the company to date to $2 million.

Credit unions both at the institutional and community levels will have access to the platform and, by saving credit union funds in stablecoins, these groups can earn higher interest, he said.

42411938,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEEL,1612875155,What Is the ERC-20 Ethereum Token Standard?,"The ERC-20 Ethereum token standard is a blueprint for creating fungible tokens that are compatible with the broader Ethereum network. Ethereum, or ether, is a cryptocurrency that allows for the creation of a variety of applications, including tokens, that don’t require intermediary services to operate, unlike most traditional applications.  The ERC-20 standard has seeped into almost every corner of the crypto ecosystem. A large number of popular tokens, such as the stablecoin tether and leading oracle service Chainlink, are actually ERC-20 tokens under the hood.  ERC-20 tokens are digital assets that can be created by anyone but are mostly made by organizations and tech-focused companies. Each token has its own specific utility, such as granting users the right to vote on decisions impacting the future of a project, or rewarding customers for performing certain tasks. ERC-20 tokens are typically sold via a variety of different offerings as a way to raise early-stage capital for the underlying project. In the past, however, critics have argued that crypto tokens have drawn too much hype, becoming a vehicle for sour investments or straight-up scams. Many of the projects that raised money in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 reportedly failed to provide any returns for their investors.  ERC-20 standardizes the core functionality of each token, meaning that all tokens created using this framework are interoperable with each other as well as all ERC-20 compatible services like MyEtherWallet and MetaMask.  To understand how this is useful, here are some of the problems token creators encounter when they build projects from scratch:  Smart contract creation: Smart contracts play a vital role in determining what the token’s total supply will be, how that supply is circulated, what the issuance schedule is, etc. They also handle key functions like querying holder balances and facilitating the transfer of tokens. Writing these smart contracts is a complicated and time-consuming process, and usually requires a team of expert developers. This can be very expensive and have devastating effects if the smart contracts are not coded correctly.  Support from wallets and exchanges: Creating tokens without using a well-integrated standard like the ERC-20 framework means extra work is needed in order to make them compatible with third-party services such as wallets and exchange platforms.  ERC-20 FAQs  What are the characteristics of ERC-20?  At a high level:  Ethereum: Each ERC-20 token is deployed on the Ethereum network.  Smart contracts: Every token function is governed by a set of smart contracts, ensuring that no person or entity needs to be trusted for the crypto token to operate. The code executes automatically when rules or conditions are met. For example, when transferring a token to someone else, the user doesn't have to trust anyone to pass it along to the recipient.  Every ERC-20 has several required features for developers to implement. The main elements include:  totalSupply: a function that outlines the total supply of a token.  balanceOf: shows how many tokens a particular address has.  transfer: transfers ownership of a token to another user.  More granular details can be found at Ethhub.  What can a user do with tokens?  Crowdfunding: Sometimes Ethereum app builders decide to raise money for their projects via crowdfunding. In return, investors receive newly minted tokens prior to the official launch at wholesale prices.  Voting rights: Tokens can be used for voting on project decisions. In this instance, the more tokens users have the more influence they have over each election.  Represent physical objects: A token can represent ownership of assets, such as gold.  Transaction fees: Each Ethereum transaction (including token transactions) includes the option to pay a fee. If the network is congested, a fee – known as gas – can help push through a transaction faster. The fee is chipped off from the user's total tokens.  New features: Sometimes builders need a token for paying for the functionality of their projects, but the native token on Ethereum, ether, is not enough for them. So, they create a new token with the functionality they need.  Future of the Ethereum token standard?  Despite its many benefits, the ERC-20 standard is far from perfect. ""Critical problems"" with the standard have been used to steal at least US$3 million, and during periods of high Ethereum congestion transactions can take long periods of time to process.  Developers need to code around this and other issues with ERC-20. Developers have also long been experimenting with alternative standards such as ERC223 and ERC777 that might eventually replace ERC-20. However, ERC-20 is by far the most popular standard for now.  How many ERC-20 tokens are there?  As of December 2020, there are 829 projects based on the ERC-20 token standard and over 350,000 token contracts, according to a dynamic list from Ethereum data provider, Etherscan.  Which coins are ERC-20 tokens?  There are a surprising number of top crypto projects that were built using the ERC-20 framework, including:  Tether (USDT)  Chainlink (LINK)  Binance coin (BNB)  USD coin (USDC)  Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC)  Dai (DAI)",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/09/what-is-the-erc-20-ethereum-token-standard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bab55c513dc0a1e33b40cdc6a4c44c1139599c3-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The second-largest cryptocurrency registered a record high of $1,824.59 during European trading hours, surpassing the previous peak price of $1,761.35 hit on Feb. 5, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The cryptocurrency is now trading lower at $1,764, representing a 5.5% gain on a 24-hour basis. Ether has more than doubled in value this year, outperforming bitcoin's 58% rise.      The latest gains could be attributed to expectations that Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) regulated ether futures would boost institutional participation. The CME futures contracts went live on Monday.      The bullish sentiment may have received a boost from the recent GameStop saga and turmoil in legacy markets underscoring what some say is a need for more democratization of finance. Ethereum's blockchain dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Aside from the above factors, the cryptocurrency may have benefitted from low liquidity on exchanges. The number of coins held in exchange addresses fell to a 16-month low of 15,243,945 on Monday, according to data source Glassnode.      The exchange balance has been sliding since August, likely due to investors taking direct custody of their coins or moving them to DeFi protocols.

42433559,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzIhh,1612870351,Bitcoin Could Rally Further as Tesla Leads Corporates on Treasury Investments,"Bitcoin's bull run may be set to intensify as the market anticipates a pick up in corporate demand prodded on by Tesla's major investment in the cryptocurrency.      ""Prices can fly very high, I expect other heavyweights to follow suit,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over WhatsApp, referring to Tesla's (TSLA) bitcoin purchases made earlier this year.      On Monday, the electric car maker disclosed its $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin and signaled openness to acquire more digital assets, kicking the bitcoin market into overdrive. Bitcoin saw a record single-day move in dollar terms on Monday, rising by over $8,000 to levels above $46,000 and roaring to fresh lifetime highs above $48,000 early today, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      While several publicly listed companies such as MicroStrategy (MSTR)have adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset over recent months, Tesla's move is notable given that it is the first Fortune 500 company to diversify cash holdings into the cryptocurrency.      ""Although the actual amount isn't large comparatively, the signaling effect and market reflexivity of projecting other global market-leading companies to do the same will have a positive spiral effect on prices,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said on its Telegram channel.      ""Reflexivity"" is a theory that a positive feedback loop between expectations and economic fundamentals can yield a substantial price rally. Tesla's bitcoin buys may have validated the long-held bullish narrative that the cryptocurrency acts as a reserve asset. More buyers, therefore, could join the market, putting upward pressure on prices.      The market is now pricing in the likelihood that other corporates will copy Tesla and Microstrategy's neo-treasury management strategy, according to John Kramer, trader at GSR. ""Tides are continually shifting in crypto and what may be lurking close to port are sovereign funds becoming the next wave of institutions to adopt this corporate playbook,"" Kramer said in a Telegram chat.      Investor interest in call options (bullish bets) has now increased in a sign investors are positioning for a continued price rally.      ""We are seeing high volume across the board in call options ranging from $56,000 to $72,000,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""If the options market is any indication of the enthusiasm across investors, we will be going a lot higher,"" Dibb added.      Additionally, multiple 100-plus call option contracts have been bought at strikes of $44,000, $48,000, and $52,000, according to Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas.      The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of bearish puts relative to calls, are firmly entrenched in the negative territory, per data provider Skew. That shows call options are drawing higher demand than puts.      However, increased activity in call options ranging from $52,000 to $72,000 does not necessarily mean traders are anticipating a bull market peak around these levels. Besides, trying to predict a precise topside target is pointless, given that the cryptocurrency is in a multi-year bull market, according to Kruger.      At press time, bitcoin is trading mostly unchanged on the day near $46,500. The slight drop from highs looks to be a typical bull breather often seen following a strong rally.      The broader bias would remain bullish as long as the trendline rising from $10,000 is held intact.      The ""Elon [Musk] rally"" has established $42,500 as the new support, and prices could rise to $50,000 in coming weeks, according to Dibb, referring to Tesla's founder.      The cryptocurrency may face some selling pressure if regulators express concerns regarding Tesla's plans to adopt bitcoin as a payment means for its vehicles.      Also read: Apple Should Launch Own Crypto Exchange, RBC Analyst Says      However, Kruger is not worried about a potential regulatory hurdle.

In order to fall in line with the rest of the financial system, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have been asked to obtain, hold and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of transactions, known colloquially as the “Travel Rule.” Global anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) expects the crypto industry to implement the new rule by June 2021.      The response from the crypto industry has been enthusiastic, including a widely agreed-upon standard for the format of the data payload VASPs must share (known as the InterVASP messaging standard, or IVMS101), as well as a number of technical solutions focused on how best to implement the rule currently being built by crypto firms, banks and consortia.    Read more: Group Backed by ING Bank, Fidelity and Standard Chartered Releases Crypto AML Tools    Less attention has been given to how all this additional customer data should be stored, according to Malcolm Wright, chief compliance officer of 100x Group, the owner of BitMEX.      “Solution providers have been concentrating on the transmission of the data to make sure that it's immediate and secure,” Wright said in an interview. “But what about when the data actually arrives at its destination? How can you ensure that it’s stored securely and appropriately to the right sort of standards?”      Wright, who led the development of the data-storage principles (and was also instrumental in working with Sian Jones of XReg Consulting to create the IVMS101 standard), decided to leverage BitMEX’s seasoned security experts, with the intent to “start a conversation” around data storage via an open-source project that industry and regulators can chime in on.      “This kind of completes the puzzle,” Wright said. “You have the IVMS standard for the format of the data. You have the protocol providers, who will be transmitting the data. And then you have some principles around the storage of the data.”    BitMEX post-enforcement    Seychelles-based BitMEX was thrust into the spotlight last year following an enforcement action from U.S. authorities around weak compliance procedures at the firm, which saw arrest warrants issued for some senior executives and co-founders.    Read more: Crypto Trading Platform BitMEX ‘Attempted to Evade’ US Regulations, CFTC, DOJ Charge    BitMEX owner 100x Group hired Wright, formerly the compliance chief at Diginex, in October 2020. Since then the firm’s know your customer/anit-money laundering (KYC/AML) processes have been revamped, starting with the removal of any historic non-KYC’d accounts on the platform.      BitMEX’s Travel Rule Data Storage Principles focus on things like access management, encryption standards and keeping Travel Rule data separate from other operational customer data.      Like the IVMS101 messaging standard, Wright thinks this security benchmark will further grease the wheels when it comes to implementing the FATF mandate, which may involve VASPs looking to onboard each other as they side with certain technical solutions.      “So If BitMEX chooses to be exchanging data with another VASP, then we can say, 'Are you operating to a minimum set such as these?' So that also helps to get confidence among VASPs that they can work together,” said Wright.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/09/bitmex-introduces-data-storage-framework-for-fatfs-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07e6c9fb6f8ba9564b685e7abba89bb6c6e837c2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The social media site, which said both new and existing investors participated but did not disclose their names, plans to double its headcount with the funds as well as build out its “video, advertising, consumer products” and international efforts, according to a blog post.      According to the Wall Street Journal, this means Reddit plans to have a total of 1,400 employees by the end of 2021 and now enjoys a $6 billion valuation.      The company has made headlines over the past few weeks, most notably when its r/WallStreetBets community helped pump GameStop’s share price and other securities to triple-digit growth, triggering Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and congressional hearings. This mania later spread to dogecoin and XRP, both of which saw massive price run-ups.      “Time and again, we have seen the power of community and connection alongside the growth and evolution of those communities and the humans behind them,” Monday’s announcement said.      The blog post didn’t mention the GameStop pump, though a Super Bowl ad purchased by the company for Sunday night’s game obliquely referenced it, saying “one thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything when they come together around a common idea.”      Reddit did not discuss its current financial situation but noted in Monday’s announcement that it sees over 50 million daily users and said its direct advertising revenue increased 90% over the past quarter, compared to the last quarter of 2019.      “We continue to invest in building and improving the ways people on Reddit connect – whether that’s traditionally through text-based discussions or through video or live streaming,” the blog post said.
