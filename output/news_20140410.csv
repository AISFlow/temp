42397543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXYa,1397169340,Deposit Freeze at Chinese Exchanges Drives Bitcoin Price Below $400,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell below $400 for the first time since November 2013 on 10th April, as major China-based bitcoin exchanges began reporting that they had received notice that their bank accounts would be shut down by banking partners.  The initial drop occurred following an announcement from Chinese exchange BTCTrade.com, which was then corroborated by similar statements from Huobi and BTC100.org.  The price of bitcoin has fallen rapidly in recent weeks, after rumors surfaced on 27th March that suggested the PBOC, China's central bank, would be looking to more tightly enforce restrictions it passed in December meant to ensure a separation between its nationalized banking system and the nascent digital currency industry.  Though no official announcement of the new policy has been made, the statements from major exchanges suggest that the rumored 15th April deadline for the enforcement of this stricter rule interpretation is being enforced.  USD markets plunge 13%  As illustrated by the USD BPI, the sell-off began at approximately 1:00 UTC on 10th April.  The price fell from $440 to $410 within a few hours of BTCTrade.com's initial announcement, before fluctuating between $407 and $412.  At 15:00 UTC, the price began to fall precipitously, tumbling from $406 to $389 by 15:15 UTC. Two hours later the price briefly climbed above $400 before sliding into the $390 range.  At press time, the price of 1 BTC on the USD BPI was $381.  CNY markets down 11.4%  Chinese markets reacted quickly to the news from domestic exchanges.  According to the CoinDesk CNY BPI, the price slipped from ¥2,726 to ¥2,490 within five hours of the announcement.  After reaching a then-low of ¥2,248, the price fluctuated over the next 10 hours, peaking at ¥2,531 at 8:30 UTC. The price began to fall at approximately 14:30 UTC, slipping from ¥2,508 to ¥2,424 over the next 45 minutes.  At press time, the price of one bitcoin on the CNY BPI was ¥2425.

Gox, as part of a bid that will require the approval of its Japanese bankruptcy court.  The investors are offering to pay 1 BTC for the troubled exchange, an amount which, at press time was worth $383, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (USD BPI).  The Wall Street Journal reported that the investor group would assume all of Mt. Gox's liabilities and obligations.  In documents submitted to the Japanese bankruptcy court, the group reportedly outlined plans to resuscitate Mt. Gox, which included proposals for customers who hold outstanding claims against the exchange.  Jumpstarting Mt. Gox  The single-bitcoin valuation is based on the premise that the true value of Mt. Gox is difficult to determine.  Wrote the Journal:  ""According to people familiar with the plan, the group is justifying the low price because of the 'information vacuum' over Mt. Gox's 550,000 missing bitcoins, currently worth about $220 million. It isn't possible to place a value on the lost coins, they said.""  Creditors will have two options. They can either receive a prorated amount from the 200,000 bitcoins recovered by Mt. Gox equal to roughly 20 percent of their claim, or obtain an equity stake of that amount in the revitalized Mt. Gox exchange.  The investor group pledged to set aside 50% of transaction fees to pay back creditors over time.  Diverse group seeks ownership  The investor group behind the bid includes venture capitalist Brock Pierce, founder of a number of bitcoin-related businesses including KnCMiner and GoCoin, and the creator of a prominent bitcoin syndicate.  Other members of the group include John Betts, a former Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs executive who would serve as the new Mt. Gox CEO, and William Quigley, managing director for Clearstone Venture Partners, a VC fund based in Santa Monica, California.

42397548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXZZ,1397163313,Startup Accelerator Boost VC Hosting Silicon Valley Bitcoin Hackathon,"Boost VC  , the first startup accelerator to accept bitcoin companies in Silicon Valley, will host a bitcoin hackathon to run from 25-27th April.  The event will be held at the Boost offices in San Mateo with enough space for 100 participants.  Ross McKelvie  , the lead engineer for Boost, told CoinDesk that the organisation is looking for next-generation bitcoin companies to form out of the weekend session.  Said McKelvie:  ""We’re looking to find the next bitcoin ideas that take it to the next stage.""  Boost has committed to funding 100 bitcoin startups within the next three years. Hosting a bitcoin hackathon is a way for the organisation to help encourage new business ideas within the digital currency industry.  Entrance fee and prizes  As fitting for a bitcoin-based event, Boost will charge an entrance fee equivalent to $25 in BTC.  The point is to keep entrants committed to the hackathon, and to get bitcoin circulating as a method of payment, according to McKelvie:  ""Along with the companies we’re building and launching here at Boost, bitcoin should be used more as a currency instead of an investment.""  The hackathon is sponsored by Coinbase, snapCard, Vaurum, Coincove and CrowdCurity. The prizes are 5 BTC for first place, 2 BTC for second and 1 BTC for third.  Pitches and judging will take place at 3:30 PM on Sunday, April 27.  Veteran bitcoin entrepreneurs and VCs will be on hand at the hackathon to serve as judges and mentors for the event.  Startup ideas are graded on a point system with a 100-point scale. Points will be awarded for a startup's idea (25 points), business plan (25 points) and product (50 points).  Bitcoin ideas  Boost is looking for ideas that can incorporate bitcoin in any way. But, that's the only stipulation.  McKelvie explained:  ""We're not requiring anything other than that [the idea] incorporates bitcoins.""  To better illustrate, he cited companies like CrowdCurity, which focuses on crowdsourcing IT security yet uses bitcoin to provide incentives for researchers to find vulnerabilities in websites, and Arbiter, which facilitates in-game app payments via bitcoin, as examples of startup ideas that would make the cut.  ""I would look at what bitcoin is and see how I could apply it to different fields.""  Using just the block chain to build something is an idea that McKelvie said was interesting. But, the fact that there are already a lot of bitcoin companies with APIs gives developers a lot of options to plug into.  Said McKelvie:  ""Pretty much every single exchange is going to have an API for you to work with. And most companies that offer software as a service have an API.""  Hackathons build bitcoin businesses  Hackathons are a good way to quickly prove an idea could work, as it needs to be completed in a short time frame.  The NYC Bitcoin Center hosted a hackathon a few months back that produced some interesting ideas in bitcoin mining and hardware, while Coinbase recently ran an online-only BitHack to encourage global developers to uncover interesting ways to use the company's API.  That competition resulted in Coinbase Apps, a marketplace that shows off software from various developers using Coinbase's platform in novel ways.  McKelvie, who is also Boost VC's lead engineer, believes that this hackathon will attract software development talent in the San Francisco Bay area to build some good bitcoin business ideas.  ""I think there are a large amount of bitcoin people in Silicon Valley that would love to meet up and work on a project together. They could meet some other people, and potentially start a business.""  There is a registration form available for interested participants. There is also a refer-a-friend discount available for those who register.

42397532,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXMm,1397158273,Bitcoin Core Developers Weigh in on Side Chain Proposal,"These days, everyone wants to add new features to the bitcoin block chain, but now one team thinks that it's found a way to do it responsibly - by creating ""side chains"" that can interact with bitcoin.  The process, known as 'two-way pegging', has some hefty backing. It is supported by Adam Back, the developer of the HashCash, the algorithm bitcoin uses to generate and verify currency.  On the business side, it has Austin Hill, a Canadian entrepreneur and angel investor who in 1997 founded Zero-Knowledge Systems, an anonymous networking and privacy technology company. Hill, who raised more than $80m for the endeavor, likes to say it was Tor, before Tor was invented.  Block chain 2.0  Clearly, the money and the technical know-how are there. So, how will it work?  [post-quote]  There have been two different approaches to expanding bitcoin's functionality in the past. One has been to introduce new features that piggyback on it, using the bitcoin block chain's existing resources. Counterparty is one example of this, and Mastercoin is another.  The other is to just create whole new frameworks for next-generation cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin. Examples of these are NXT and the still-unlaunched Ethereum proposal.  The problem with completely separate altcoins and frameworks, says Hill, is that they they are not interoperable. They create new ""races for scarcity"", with each one representing a new asset in short supply.  But, there are several problems with bitcoin, too, says Hill, which is why exchanges like Coinbase generally run their own transactions outside the block chain.  Hill told CoinDesk: ""There is a practical reason why some of those things can't operate on the block chain, and that's because at peak, they're doing more transactions than bitcoin can support right now.""  Instead, Back and Hill want to 'shard' the block chain, creating another block chain, which has a two-way relationship with bitcoin's own.  This will have two major benefits, Hill suggests: functionality, and scalability.  ""We could have US and Canadian dollars, smart derivatives, option shares, and future contracts. A whole series of programmable trust instruments. A lot of people had talked about these things, and how the block chain could be adapted for this, but I hadn't seen anyone lay out how it would come to pass.""  And secondly: ""By sharding, you can have orders of magnitude faster transaction processing and you can start to scale bitcoin.""  Two-way pegging  In October, Back had proposed a concept called one-way pegging, in which bitcoins could be 'moved' from the bitcoin block chain to another block chain called a side chain, that was merge-mined with bitcoin. Bitcoins would be marked in the bitcoin block chain as having been transferred. Another coin in the new block chain would be marked as a representation of the transferred bitcoin.  Then last year, bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell figured out a method for two-way pegging, in which bitcoins could be moved back and forth between the side chain and the block chain.  This would allow them to be transferred at will, so that the bitcoin network wouldn't lose its bitcoins forever when they were transferred, but could get them back if the owner decided to transfer them back into the bitcoin block chain.  Bitcoin would be 'firewalled' from the side chain, meaning that any security issues that arose in a side chain wouldn't affect people who were only involved in the bitcoin block chain.  This opens up some interesting possibilities, says Back:  ""You can have multiple competing side chains that compete at the bitcoin level. Perhaps one that's optimised for micropayments. You could move bitcoins into the micropayments sidechain, and then back again and then into the smart contract sidechain.""  The advantage here is that, unlike altcoins, they would all be interoperable, with the bitcoin block chain (or, as he calls it, the ""main chain"", used as a common point of transfer.  Throughput  So, that takes care of functionality. But what about throughput? The current transaction rate on the bitcoin network is relatively low, at something under seven-to-nine transactions per second, which is why all of those off-chain transactions happen, in exchanges and elsewhere.  The downside of that is that they become difficult (but not impossible) to audit in any publicly visible way.  Says Hill: ""You are still having to extend and move your coins off the block chain into a trust me security model. That has led to huge amounts of theft.""  So, that's the proposal. What do core developers think?  ""In particular the notion that a different chain might be designed to natively support things like smart contracts is funny, given that Bitcoin already supports them,"" argues Mike Hearn, the brains behind BitcoinJ, and a core developer since bitcoin began (he spoke about them as early as 2012, arguing that all the pieces of the puzzle were in place).  The recent introduction of 40 extra bytes into bitcoin transactions for arbitrary messages (such as those associated with smart property or smart contracts) supports that view, although third parties have asked for more space.  Hearn also doesn't think that alternative side chains can solve the scalability problem, which in any case is solvable purely within the bitcoin network, he argues.  ""It's not as if there's some impossible limit beyond which Bitcoin can't go,"" he protests, pointing to the Bitcoin Wiki's scalability page, which breaks down how much further we can push the network.  ""With some fairly straightforward software improvements, bitcoin should be able to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second or more. To quote Satoshi, 'it never really hits a scale ceiling',"" he says.  Gregory Maxwell, who first proposed two-way pegging, says that it could provide some relief for bitcoin, though:  ""I don't think this will remove the need to increase bitcoin's throughput entirely, but if the technology matures fast enough it may allow for a more conservative approach that increases size only when its very clearly safe to do so.""  Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik argues that off-chain transactions are an enabler, not a problem.  ""In the real world, millions of USD transactions happen every day that are not directly or immediately reported to a bank or governmental authority.""  Garzik describes himself as a fan of off-chain transactions and points to his own side project, payment channels, as an example of setting up high-volume transactions with other systems outside the bitcoin network.  Approval  So, some experts believe that two-way pegging could provide some useful respite for bitcoin from a scalability perspective, if side chains were able to connect with audit-able, fraud-proof private chains designed for high throughput. Those side chains could also be many and varied, each designed with their own specific properties for tasks like microtransactions and derivatives, say.  But, for two-way pegging to work, changes have to be made to the Bitcoin protocol. Will Back and Hill's venture be accepted by the bitcoin open source community?  Said Garzik:    ""One thing open source developers try to avoid is pre-approval based on some future supposition. We have no idea what the future will bring, any more than anyone else.      Once a concrete proposal appears in a pull request, then we can give a reasonable comment based on engineering evaluation.""    If the changes necessary to allow bitcoin to talk to other side chains are made, then it could relieve the bitcoin developer community of requests to tweak the blockchain to suit third-party purposes.  Maxwell calls it the one change to rule them all.  ""Once adopted, people could try out speculative and innovative changes, while enjoying the network effect of bitcoin's substantial adoption, without having to go ask anyone— not developers, not the community— for permission.""  Hill and Back, who claim to have some core developers supporting their venture, plan to announce the full details - and its official name - by mid-May.

42397531,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXOk,1397155804,Study: Bitcoin Wallet Attacks Rose Sharply in 2013,"There were nearly 6 million detections of malware capable of stealing data from bitcoin wallets in 2013, according to a new report released by cybersecurity firm Kapersky Labs.  Entitled ""Financial Cyberthreats in 2013"", Kapersky's report looked more broadly at a range of cyberattacks – from phishing to mobile malware, but put a special emphasis on examining how digital currency wallet users are being targeted by criminals online.  Perhaps most notably, Kapersky found that 1 million wallet owners fell victim to a malware attack in 2013, up from less than 600,000 in 2012. Attacks on digital currency wallets constituted roughly 20% of all attacks that involved financial malware last year.  Read the report:  ""Among all finance-related malware, tools associated with bitcoin demonstrated the most dynamic development.""  The full, 35-page report provided additional information on malware that targets wallet data, as well as programs that secretly upload mining software to the victim's computer.  The report draws on information collected from Kapersky's global security infrastructure.  Attack figures rise with bitcoin's price  The amount of detections for wallet-targeting malware programs rose significantly in 2013 compared to 2012 levels, when according to Kapersky, less than 2 million detections were registered. This figure includes all observed attacks, including those that were not successful.  Kapersky reported a more modest increase in the amount of malware attacks that uploaded mining software to affected computers, rising from roughly 500,000 in 2012 to more than 2 million in 2013.  Almost 800,000 users encountered mining malware attack in 2013, compared to less than 200,000 the year before. Overall, mining malware attempts accounted for 8.9% of all detections.  The report noted that beginning in October 2013, the number of detected mining malware attacks fell while the number of wallet-targeting programs started to climb. It said:  ""This could be the result of the above-mentioned idiosyncrasy of the Bitcoin system, where the more ‘coins’ that are generated, the more difficult it is to generate new ones. This could also drive malicious users to focus on searching for and stealing bitcoin wallets holding already-generated cryptocurrency.""  Attacks on wallets began to rise sharply in September 2012, according to the data. During 2013, the number of attacks peaked in August 2013, with additional periods of heightened activity during April and November-December of that year.  This finding suggests that the number of attacks increased with the price of bitcoin, as prices hit new highs during both these periods.  Malware's growing threat  Malware that targets both wallets and home computers used by miners poses an increasingly serious threat to the digital currency ecosystem.  Earlier this year, Dell SecureWorks identified 146 types of bitcoin malware currenty circulating on the internet. Due to the risk, some have turned to paper wallets as a way to securely store their bitcoins.  Two apps  previously available on Google Play were identified by a cybersecurity team which turned affected Android devices into litecoin and dogecoin miners. Further, in late March, Symantec noted an increase in the number of mining malware attacks which targeted Linux-based computers.

While bitcoiners are less known for charity giving, Sean's Outpost, founded by Jason King, is a homeless outreach project that is funded by bitcoin donations.  Furthermore, after Japanese-American Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was, possibly falsely, 'outed' as the founder of bitcoin by Newsweek, an online campaign raised over $20,000 in bitcoin to support him.

The results are based on a survey issued on 17th March that received more than 200 responses.    From Californian wineries to bars in Beijing, 2013 was widely considered a banner year for bitcoin, as business owners around the world began to take advantage of the technology to cut costs and woo new and influential consumers.      Unsurprisingly, expectations were high for 2014, and so far, it's delivered with major brands such as Lord & Taylor, Overstock and TigerDirect following the lead of early adopters to accept bitcoin for payment.    Still, while merchant adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies is on the rise, less is known about these new additions to the digital currency ecosystem as a demographic – why they accept bitcoin, how they do so and whether they consider their experience with bitcoin to be positive.  In Part One of this series, we'll seek to better define the merchants who are operating in the space to paint a picture of this influential sector of the expanding ecosystem.  51% began accepting bitcoin in the last three months    In total, 51.8% of respondents reported that they began accepting bitcoin within the last three months. Nearly one-fifth (17.8%) reported adding bitcoin as a payment option within 30 days prior to the survey.      Still, there were a sizeable number of merchants who have long supported bitcoin. Roughly one-third (29.2%) of respondents have been accepting bitcoin for six months or more, with 12.5% reporting that they've been accepting the currency for over one year.      When Did You Start Accepting Bitcoin? | Create Infographics      Despite fears that the recent decline in the price of bitcoin would turn merchants away from the volatile ecosystem, the survey suggests that its negative attention may have actually bolstered interest in bitcoin.    71% accept bitcoin online; 88% own bitcoin    The survey found that of the merchants who accept digital currency, 71% of respondents do so online, while 34% of respondents accept bitcoin at their bricks-and-mortar stores. Some merchants surveyed accept bitcoin both online and at their physical stores.      While it may not be surprising that the digital payment method has been most widely used online, the margin is notable, as it suggests that merchants are twice as likely to accept online than at a physical location.      Furthermore, the vast majority of merchants who accept bitcoin also reported that they own or owned bitcoin, with 88% saying that they have done so.      Just 12% of merchants who accept bitcoin said they have never owned bitcoin.    59% accept bitcoin to boost the ecosystem    Perhaps most surprising, was that despite the many benefits bitcoin can bring to businesses in terms of savings, only 8.2% began accepting bitcoin to save money, and just 8.2% were encouraged to do so by their customers.      The majority of merchants (59%) say they began accepting bitcoin to show their support for digital currency.      What Was the Main Reason You Started Accepting Bitcoin? | Create Infographics      Still, the results lend credence to those who have accused some companies of trying to take advantage of bitcoin's popularity. Nearly one-fourth (24.2%) said that the main reason they began accepting bitcoin was that it was a marketing opportunity.

42397535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXQi,1397140366,Legg Mason's Bill Miller: Buffett is Wrong About Bitcoin,"In an interview on CNBC's popular morning program 'Squawk Box', Legg Mason's Bill Miller dismissed Warren Buffett's statements on bitcoin as flawed.  The former Legg Mason CFA, chairman and CIO, and current portfolio manager for the Legg Mason Capital Management Trust reiterated his support for bitcoin, directly addressing the legendary investor's opinions on the subject in the process.  Buffett has been outspoken in his views about bitcoin as an investment, calling its value a 'mirage' and urging investors to 'stay away’ from the digital currency, though his statements have suggested he sees value in bitcoin's underlying technology.  In contrast, Miller has been open about owning bitcoin and what he sees as its potential to maintain and grow its value long-term.    Now, guest host @billmiller_lmm tells us why he's bullish on #bitcoin #thelastword      — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 10, 2014    Overall, Miller was respectful when disagreeing with Buffett, though he suggested that the investor's thinking on the matter was misguided, stating:  ""I have enormous regard for Warren, but I think there's a logical flaw in his thinking here. It may very well be the case that bitcoin is worth nothing, but I think it's a really interesting intellectual and technological experiment.""  Miller's support is also notable considering that he has actually lost money investing in bitcoin, as he reported that his BTC holdings have declined 20% to date.  — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 10, 2014  Bitcoin is not a check  In his 14th March interview on CNBC, Buffett compared bitcoin to checks or money orders, arguing that since its primary value was as a payment system, the idea that it could be a worthwhile investment was incorrect.  However, notably, Miller took direct aim at these statements on CNBC:  ""[Checks] have no value because they are infinitely creatable. There are 12m bitcoins out there and there will [only ever] be 21m. If there were 21m checks in the world and that was all there were, and all transactions went through checks, checks would be very, very valuable.""  Still, Miller agreed with Buffett on his point that the main benefit of bitcoin was its use as a payment system.  ""I think he had it exactly right in that its main value, potentially, is as a payment system. [It's] potentially disruptive as you can send it anonymously, you can send it without paying the interchange fees and that kind of thing.""  Bitcoin will be the lasting digital currency  Miller also weighed in on the subject of whether bitcoin could face competition from any of its available alternatives, citing the popular theory of path dependance, which attempts to explain why the first-to-market solution is often the one that becomes most widely used.  Miller listed historical examples of this phenomenon, noting that the most efficient or best ideas don't always win out. Specifically, he cited the fact that ""beta was better than VHS"", and that ""the QWERTY keyboard was not the most efficient way to type"".  Explained Miller:  ""Once you reach a certain state, it becomes very difficult to dislodge that. I think bitcoin has probably won that, less so cryptocurrencies.""  Miller also weighed in on why bitcoin is a preferable investment to gold.

Adber Espinoza and Pascal Reid were arrested in February following an undercover sting operation. Police made the arrests after undercover officers took to LocalBitcoins.com posing as credit card fraudsters.  Officers were looking for someone to launder their cash and buy bitcoins to fund illegal activities, namely to buy stolen credit card data. Having allegedly agreed, Reid and Espinoza both stand accused of laundering money and running an unregistered money service.  Can’t launder without money  The Internal Revenue Service recently issued new guidance which classified bitcoin as 'property' rather than currency. However, even before the IRS statement bitcoin was not considered 'money', at least not in the eyes of the law.  Lawyers representing Reid and Espinoza are planning to use this technicality to their advantage. The suspects have pleaded not guilty and their defence is now looking to have the charges dropped, since bitcoins are not defined as 'money', they argue money laundering legislation should not apply to them.  However, Miami-Dade County prosecutors disagree. They insist money laundering charges can stick and believe they fit the alleged crime, Fox News reports.  Legal precedent?  According to the IRS bitcoin guidance, issued on 25th March, digital currencies will be treated as property. However, this guidance only applies to federal taxes – general rules for property transactions still apply for bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle says this is the first time any state decided to bring money laundering charges in a case involving bitcoin.  Earlier this month a similar case was made by Joshua Dratel, Ross Ulbricht’s defence lawyer. Ulbricht is, of course, facing serious charges stemming from his association with online drugs bazaar Silk Road.  Dratel argues that at least one count of money laundering against Ulbricht should be dismissed, citing FinCEN and IRS guidance as proof of his argument. However, the case against Ulbricht to that involving Reid and Espinoza – as they allegedly accepted cash for their services, while Ulbricht stands accused of dealing solely in bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/10/lawyers-want-bitcoin-money-laundering-charges-dropped-on-technicality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4911e0918485f07e02cfe40073eb07b98f0dd1e-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXcW,1397129545,How Dogetipbot Turned a Spoof Altcoin into a Tipping Phenomenon,"Bitcoin might not be considered a currency in some circles and, right now, government agencies are starting to look at it as more of a speculative asset.  Although BTC is highly divisible, it has yet to take off as a method of microtransactional payments – a fact not helped by bitcoin's potential to skyrocket in price due to hoarding by speculators.  Dogecoin  , however, has emerged as a favorite microtransaction method on reddit. In fact, most people get their first dogecoin via tipping on the community-oriented site. And that's all because of Dogetipbot.  How it works  Dogetipbot interfaces with the reddit API to facilitate transactions on the site. When someone makes a comment, a reply can be made that includes a command to tip someone an amount of dogecoin:  Fifty DOGE is worth around two US cents. That may not be much, but it’s the denomination that is enticing.  A comparable bitcoin valuation for the same two cents is 0.00004512 BTC, which is a bit hard to wrap your brain around and just looks messy. So what would people rather receive, 0.00004512 in BTC or a 50 DOGE tip?  And the process is simple. A message in a user's reddit inbox gives someone the option to accept or decline a tip.  Said Josh Mohland, the co-founder of Dogetipbot:  ""Most of the time, people receive a tip, and all you need to do is respond with 'accept'.""  Dogetipbot by the numbers  Mohland provided some statistics to CoinDesk to show how popular the Dogetipbot service is on reddit:  ""We've got over 32,000 users with a balance higher than zero. The average transaction is $0.25. We’re averaging a little over a million in dogecoin tips per day.""  A million of anything usually sounds like a large number. In the world of doge, that's about 1 BTC, however. Mohland says, though, that when there are fundraising efforts or charity drives, the amount can jump drastically.            He said that there have been days, such as April Fools', when the number of DOGE tips are the equivalent of 10-15 BTC in one day:  ""[The average] 3,000 active users a day, can jump up to 5,000-10,000 based on the level of activity. There’s quite a few ‘power users’, I should say.""  Mohland adds that Dogetipbot is approaching a total of 150m DOGE tipped via reddit so far.  Donation driving force  After tipping, donations are one of the biggest drivers of dogecoin's transactional nature.  Some of the best known examples of this include raising money for Indian Olympic athletes, the Kenyan water crisis and an accidental circumstance that led to a NASCAR driver getting 20m DOGE in race sponsorship.  In the latter instance, Alex Green – founder of Moolah, a cryptocurrency payments platform – typed in a 20m DOGE donation, instead of the two million he meant to send for Joe Wise's No. 98 Chevrolet sponsorship campaign.  Moolah also helps with donation campaigns, and although many larger donations come in directly through the Dogecoin protocol, Dogetipbot plays a big part according to Green:  ""A lot of the shibes with smaller amounts of coins to give tend to tip to the donation address on reddit via Dogetipbot.""  The term 'shibes' is a dogecoin community term for people active within their sphere, and references the Shiba Inu dog type that is the coin's mascot.  Green says that the tipping culture inspired Moolah to create Mootip, a micropayments platform that went live on image hosting service Imgur. With Dogetipbot's plans to move to other social networks, Green has decided to focus Moolah on other things:  ""With the great work that Josh [Mohland] is doing with Dogetipbot, have decided to pull out of that sector and leave it to his more-than-capable hands.""  Growth plans  Mohland says that reddit is just the beginning for Dogetipbot.  Twitter and Imgur are the next steps for Dogetipbot social media integrations, and he is considering other services as well. However, there have to be modifications to how the bot performs on certain services, he said:  ""The Twitter API – there’s certain things we can’t do, like unsolicited direct messages. Their API rules are pretty restrictive.""  Tipping and donation campaigns have been significant in helping the reddit community increase the general acceptance of cryptocurrencies.  Mohland says, however, that some social media or community-powered sites make it downright impossible for Dogetipbot to function the way that it does on reddit:  ""Facebook and YouTube, I’d say, are the two biggest ones we have requests for. But their terms of service wouldn’t allow it, unless we had a special exemption. Reddit’s been very positive on our end.""  Off-blockchain  Dogetipbot 2.0, the newest version of the software, has its own internal ledger that calculates account deposits and withdrawals. So when people send or receive a tip, it’s off the block chain. Only when coin is moved to an external wallet is the dogecoin block chain used.            Dogetipbot 1.0 was simply a fork of a tipping client called altcointip, but that software was unable to handle the sheer mass of transactions through the tip bot.  Said Mohland:  “We were processing so many transactions a day that it just got to the point where it was testing the limits of what [altcointip] was capable of.”  This is the reason why Dogetipbot keeps an internal ledger of account deposits and withdrawals – to reduce strain on the system.  ""We were using the dogecoin daemon for the longest time with version 1, but on the new version we have an internal ledger,"" said Mohland.  Mining origins  Mohland was initially a litecoin miner. When he heard about dogecoin, though, he pointed his scrypt rig in its direction and his wallet was soon bulging with DOGE.  ""I thought [dogecoin] was hilarious, so I decided to point my miners at a dogecoin pool and got about three million dogecoins,"" he said.  It was the viral aspect that got dogecoin itself to where it is today, something that many startups pine for.  Said Mohland:  “It kind of just spread virally. At the time [dogecoin] was still considered a joke. It wasn’t worth anything at all.”  Mohland said that Dogetipbot just happened – there wasn't a whole lot of planning, and people in the dogecoin subreddit were asking for it. So he forked the altcointip client and then posted what he had done on reddit back in December 2013.  He didn't expect any sort of traction for Dogetipbot in the beginning. Now, it's a full-time thing for Mohland, as he has since started a company called Wow Such Business, Inc. to run his tip bot:  ""I forked altcointip, and got that up and running. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and my post had got on the front page of reddit. So it kind of just happened overnight.""

42397542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXXb,1397124329,Canadian Senate Meets Bitcoin Community in Fact-Finding Session,"What is Canada’s place in regulating bitcoin? This is the theme running through the Canadian Senate’s Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce’s study on the use of digital currency.    The Bitcoin Strategy Group, BitAccess and CAVirtEx sat before the senators on 9th April to demonstrate how bitcoin is purchased and stored. Their representation marks the first presence of bitcoiners in the Senate sphere.      The Canadian Senate has already heard from the Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance, economic historians and other academics. On Thursday, April 10th, the committee will hear directly from the Royal Bank of Canada, the Canadian Bankers’ Association and the Canadian Payments Association.      The mission of this study is to understand virtual currencies. In bitcoin’s case, the question is “How do we treat this? Do we regulate this?”      The panel covered a range of topics, including wallets and bitcoin storage, the three ways of acquiring bitcoin (peer to peer, exchanges and bitcoin ATMs), and allowed for targeted testimony from Canada’s largest virtual exchange – CAVirtEX – and Ottawa-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess, who both offered their unique perspective as business owners working daily with bitcoin on the need of government regulation.      Unfortunately, the committee hearing was cut short by a Senate vote. As a result, the first half of the presentation was testimony, followed by a live ATM demonstration.      Christopher Reed, Policy Assistant to Senator Irving Gerstein, the Chair of the Committee, was the first individual to purchase bitcoin from an ATM within session in parliamentary history when he inserted C$100 into the BitAccess machine.    Demonstration session    The Senate is at the beginning of its 18-month long study with the objective of researching and learning about bitcoin. Seeing person-to-person transactions, as demonstrated by Kyle Kemper, a partner at the Bitcoin Strategy Group and Victoria van Eyk, a bitcoin consultant, and an in-person demonstration using the ATM was integral to this understanding as it made bitcoin more 'tangible' and accessible.      CAVirtEx’s newly hired Advisor, former Ottawa mayor Larry O’Brien, represented the exchange’s view that Canada needs to act on regulation, and fast. Regulating the 'on and off-ramps' of bitcoin is required to transform exchanges into serious businesses, with proper checks-and-balances in place to give consumers confidence in transacting with the digital currency.      Due to the last-minute vote, significant content was omitted, however.      [post-quote]      The Bitcoin Strategy Group hopes to return in the future to focus on the day-to-day benefits of digital currencies that we can all relate to, including the opportunity for cost savings in the remittance world – where Western Union pocketed $1.1 billion in 2013 for transferring funds, mostly to developing nations – the future of micropayments and 'social tipping' for the arts and online content, and the huge benefit for retailers when using bitcoin to transact with.      In a further demonstration, the Group purchased cupcakes from local Ottawa bakery The Flour Shoppe to show the Senate first-hand that local retailers are getting on board with the digital currency, and that it is easily tradeable.      The latter part of the hearing was a robust question and answer period. Many Senators questioned the specific need for regulation.      Senator Paul J. Massicotte questioned the need for bitcoin regulation, asking if it undermined the essence of bitcoin in the first place. Joseph David, CEO of CAVirtEx responded quite quickly, stating that, if Canada hopes to remain in the bitcoin exchange business, banks need to cooperate, and that requires government regulation.      He added:      “Our only other option is going offshore.”            Education and understanding    CAVirtEx’s stance on regulation drew questions from the Senators, who wondered if the very act of regulating undermined bitcoin’s libertarian roots. One senator also brought up the possibility that regulating the currency would add so many costs that the benefits would disappear.      Kyle Kemper called for Canada to “become a global leader on the bitcoin opportunity” and pressed for increased education and understanding before implementing any regulation.      Kemper explained:      “Canada has become one of the leading countries in the world in terms of Bitcoin entrepreneurship and innovation. Before we can come to any conclusions, we must understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, and what the future with Bitcoin may look like.”              Overall, the present Senators had a better-than-average understanding of the currency and the protocol, and were actively engaged throughout the entire presentation. Their questions also touched on HST and taxation concerns, volatility risk with merchant purchases, and bitcoin’s impact on the current Canadian dollar money supply.    Regulation questions    The question from the Senate remains: “What is necessary from us?”      Influential bitcoiners like Andreas Antonopoulos, Chief Security Officer at BlockChain.info, regularly oppose regulation, citing the ability of the community to self-regulate as sufficient for the industry.      Additionally, it was mentioned that there are already regulations in place that keep bitcoin 'in check', including FINTRAC – an independence agency that reports to the Ministry of Finance. Many large bitcoin businesses, including panelists CAVirtEx and BitAccess, follow FINTRAC regulations.      However, some senators disagreed with the idea of self-regulation, citing government regulation as “necessary” for bitcoin to succeed. Joseph David requested that bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and regulated in the same way. This comment drew interest from the assembled senators, as it was the first time the idea had been raised.      Regulation is currently a hot topic for bitcoin, as it becomes more mainstream. The recurring theme at the recent Inside Bitcoins New York conference was regulation. Indeed, the US government is also educating themselves on bitcoin: is it a coincidence that a Robocoin ATM was installed and demoed on Capitol Hill on 8th April, while Canada’s Senate were introduced to the local bitcoin ATM on the 9th?      Funnily enough, there was a complete lack of press at the Senate committee hearing tonight, as compared to the overwhelmingly attentive journalists capturing every moment of Congressman Jarod Polis’ purchase of bitcoin on Capitol Hill.      Either way, government is interested. Canada is currently in a unique position to be a leader in the bitcoin space. The country has made it this far without any regulations, however it’s time to be proactive on establishing a policy framework for regulators who are looking for guidance with this sphere.

42397540,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXUe,1397118375,Bitcoin Price Drops 10% as Chinese Exchanges Stop Bank Deposits,"Bitcoin prices crashed today as Chinese businesses began receiving official deposit shutdown notices from banks, confirming recent suspicions of an impending crackdown. Exchanges will stop account recharging via bank accounts between now and 15th April.  Even though the news has been anticipated for over a week now, bitcoin prices sank under $403 from a high of $450.74 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index after companies began making public announcements on their sites.  Exchange BTCTrade.com made an announcement just before lunchtime in China, followed shortly after by BTC100.org and Huobi. Interestingly, it appears Chinese banks started with smaller exchanges before working up to those with larger trading volumes.  The announcements have all come via the banks themselves, as the PBOC has still not provided exchanges with any official announcement 'on paper'.  BTCTrade's statement read:  ""With a heavy heart we make this announcement, that BTCTrade just received a telephone call from our bank the Kejicheng (Tech City) branch of China Agricultural Bank Hangzhou, that if we do not stop using our bank account to conduct bitcoin related businesses by 4/15 our account will be frozen. Therefore, we are forced to stop all RMB deposits by 4/15 midnight, although withdrawals will not be affected at [present].""  BTC China  CEO Bobby Lee said his company would not be changing any of its banking arrangements until it receives some form of official notice, which hasn't arrived yet.    ""So far, we still have NOT received any official notices from Banks or the PBOC,"" he said.      ""I have indeed heard that some other exchanges apparently have received notice, but we have not.""    BTC38.com  , which specializes in altcoin trading, suspended account funding via bank deposits on 4th April.  At that time, prices of digital currencies other than bitcoin dropped by 20% or more. Hardest hit were megacoin (MEC) and TAGcoin (TAG), which each lost around 50% of their value, while quark fell by 40% and dogecoin around 25%.  Even litecoin, which is traded on most major platforms and is not considered an altcoin per se in China, fell by over 20% in value last week. It is currently trading on BTC-e for just $10.22.  Focus elsewhere  OKCoin  and FXBTC also stopped some account funding options after receiving notices from their banks and payment processor partners, but promised to continue trading otherwise after April 15th.  OKCoin CEO Star Xu said, however, that the company was focused more on future expansion plans, and would maintain regular daily operations otherwise.  Said Xu:  ""OKCoin's margin management, risk management, and cash withdraw and coin withdraw functions are working properly at this moment, OKCoin's English version site will be up quickly, OKCoin will establish overseas offices and move servers there if needed.""  Community unperturbed  In fact, much of China's bitcoin community shares that spirit and does not seem perturbed by regulatory moves.  ""OK is always here, rumor-spreaders can leave now, we already have plans for April 15th,"" said OKCoin's Vice President He Yi.  The industry so far has shown nonchalance in the face of previous government bans, whether implied or actual, since last December, and have developed new ways for customers to move money in and out of exchanges without direct access to bank accounts. These have included a variety of third-party payment processors, pre-paid cards, and a voucher system.  Even BTCTrade's announcement today ended on a positive note, informing of the company's intentions to expand overseas in the near future.  ""BTCTrade has always set our sites on the global market since coming online, and we have already registered companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and the US. We are planning to commence USD services soon, and the Japanese version of our website is already online and operational, and a new version will be online before 4/15.""  ""Very soon we will publicly reveal our cold wallet address, and utilize 100% proof of reserves, in order to ascertain that the platform does not engage in any transactions, and that user assets are safe, open to public scrutiny.""
