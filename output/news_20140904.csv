42426019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhv1h,1409868611,ATM Industry Group: Bitcoin ATM Sector Needs More Oversight,"The ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) has released a new report that aims to encourage the nascent bitcoin ATM sector to adopt standards that promote consumer protection and security.  The paper is the second report issued by the non-profit industry association on the subject of bitcoin ATMs this year, following a March release that assessed how both bitcoin and bitcoin ATMs could more broadly affect the traditional ATM market.  Building off the first release, the most recent report suggests that the bitcoin ATM industry needs to adopt methods of self-governance now, before its products are disseminated more widely.  Further, the ATMIA argues that the bitcoin ATM industry should turn to the traditional financial system for guidance as it navigates this process.  The ATMIA wrote:  ""Our main conclusion is that there is currently insufficient supervision of bitcoin ATMs. These machines should be brought into the fold of the wider ATM industry, becoming part of the industry, subject, in particular, to security best practices and other aspects of the industry’s code of conduct.""  In remarks, ATMIA CEO Mike Lee stated he hopes the report will encourage the bitcoin ATM industry to join the wider ATM industry, and for the sector to form relationships with traditional ATM operators who may be able to offer valuable expertise.  The comments echo findings from a joint ATMIA and Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA) report issued in May that also suggested a collaborative approach would be beneficial for both business sectors.  Recommendations extended  In particular, the ATMIA issued a set recommendations for how it believes the bitcoin ATM industry could best regulate itself to instill consumer trust and bolster security.  The ATMIA suggested the bitcoin ATM industry should:  Create conditions for a 'license to operate' for bitcoin ATMs  Develop international security best practices to fight cybercrime and money laundering  Foster relationships with the wider payments and ATM industry  Start an international accreditation program from bitcoin ATM operators.  The report went on to propose precisely how the industry could self regulate, which included establishing a registry of bitcoin ATM machines with licensing powers for operators and the ability to guarantee deposits, among other capabilities.  The ATMIA added: ""We recognize the need for some sort of self-regulation at least for part of the bitcoin value chain.""  An important innovation  While direct in its proposals, the ATMIA praised bitcoin in its report, suggesting that the digital currency could evolve to become an attractive solution for the global remittance market.  The ATMIA wrote:  ""In short, we are seeing signs of typical 'creative destruction' of a genuine innovation in the payments space.""  Specifically, the report pointed to digital currency startups like ZipZap and Ripple Labs as examples of companies working toward this goal in a way that suggests more innovation to come.  The non-profit went on to state that bitcoin ATM manufacturers and operators could become a vital part of this ecosystem, provided they move to provide transparency and ensure that consumers understand all the risks involved with the use of their products.  The report concluded that the future is bright for bitcoin, even though the bitcoin ATM industry has challenges to confront:  ""Looking ahead, the jury is out as to whether bitcoin will ever become a mainstream currency. It does appear to be on track, however, for becoming an important global currency.""

42426017,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhuzh,1409864448,Ripple Unveils Next-Generation System for Digital Transaction Consensus,"Decentralized systems like digital currencies rely on consensus. This enables the network to agree that certain events – transactions, in the case of bitcoin – have taken place.  Miners are certainly needed to generate new bitcoins. Yet, their role is far more critical in confirming that bitcoins were actually sent from one place to another, thus maintaining an agreed-upon 'truth' in the network. This keeps the block chain reliable and, arguably, underpins its very existence.  However, maintaining consensus in a decentralized network isn’t simple. The risk of bad actors disrupting transactions or fabricating new ones is an old problem and the subject of much debate and study. Some, though, argue that the bitcoin network’s size and compensation mechanisms account for this possibility.  A recently released white paper from Ripple Labs examines how decentralized mechanisms can prevent bad actors in a block chain payments system from creating fake transactions. The Ripple Protocol consensus algorithm (RPCA) uses a node election system to establish the veracity of new transactions, adding them to a continuous chain of closed transactions that are considered absolute.  David Schwartz, chief cryptographer for Ripple, told CoinDesk that the RPCA is another step in the long evolution of digital money and transaction systems.  He explained:  “Satoshi [Nakamoto], with bitcoin, came up with the first solution to the double spending problem that didn’t require central authority. And that scheme worked, and it allowed bitcoin to be so phenomenally successful. But, it was the first such scheme, and it’s probably not going to be best such scheme and there’s going to be innovation in that area.”  Schwartz suggested that next-generation consensus mechanisms, such as those introduced by Ripple, are pushing bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s work even further.  Finding truth faster  The goal of the RPCA is to make it possible for a globally disconnected network to agree without relying on proof-of-work infrastructure.  Each server in the Ripple network is tasked with voting on a new batch of candidate transactions during rounds that take place every few seconds. Transactions agreed upon by the network are confirmed and made permanent once the round closes.  This approach is different from bitcoin’s, for which several confirmations by the mining network are often needed before bitcoins can be used or re-spent. Election node systems have been utilized in other block chain applications in the past, including projects like darkcoin that mix transactions through a network of master nodes.  Trusting the generals  The underlying concept – maintaining truth in a network where the potential for fraud exists – has been discussed for decades.  First labeled as the “Byzantine Generals Problem” in a 1982 study, the problem of keeping a group of connected but separate parts honest is akin to an army attacking a city suffering from an infiltration of spies. Because the couriers carrying messages between generals can’t be trusted, a way must be found to ensure that information coming from the different parts to the army is true.  How does this apply to decentralized payment systems like bitcoin and Ripple? In order to maintain network integrity, a majority of participants must be accepted as truthful. Should someone or a group of bad actors gain control of the network, they have the potential to disrupt it. At the very least, this risk threatens the overall legitimacy of the system itself.  Bitcoin solves this problem by creating a reward incentive, thus promoting good behavior among network participants. The application of incentive to the transaction confirmation process makes miners want to contribute to a successful – and public – ledger.  Accessing global money  As Schwartz explained, the existing infrastructure for sending payments around the world is too onerous and costly for many to utilize. The result is that many are locked out of affordable money and are forced to rely on expensive services.  Finding a way to quickly establish the truth for transactions, then, would enable new methods of sending money abroad to be established. By giving servers the ability to establish transaction veracity without crunching memory-intensive calculations, he said, Ripple opens the door to lower-cost avenues for worldwide money access.  Schwartz told CoinDesk:  “I think everybody in the industry knows that international remittances are broken, there’s no good technical reason for why someone shouldn't have access to wholesale foreign exchange rates. It’s just the way the system developed.”  Decentralized network image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/04/ripple-unveils-next-generation-system-for-digital-transaction-consensus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/955a2e287dda1e7220540d918c8a1b6a3e7b8e28-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhv5h,1409852749,MIT Bookstore Accepts Bitcoin Payments as Campus Interest Grows,"The MIT Coop bookstore, a retail store serving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is now accepting bitcoin for T-shirts, textbooks, school supplies and more.  The news comes amid increasing interest in bitcoin at the university and ahead of a scheduled 'airdrop' of $500,000 in bitcoin to MIT undergraduates. The project, which will provide $100 to every MIT student, is scheduled to take place sometime later this fall.  The MIT Coop  is already equipped with a bitcoin ATM, a development that Jerry Murphy, of the bookstore's management firm, said made accepting bitcoin a natural decision.  Murphy told Boston Magazine:  “MIT has a reputation of being on the cutting edge of a lot of things, and the student body has an interest in bitcoin. All these factors came together and we said, ‘Let’s give it a shot and see if it makes sense’.""  Notably, the MIT Coop will accept bitcoin through a partnership with Georgia-based bitcoin payment processor BitPay.  First purchase confirmed  Speaking to CoinDesk, MIT Bitcoin Project organizer Dan Elitzer confirmed that he had completed what was likely the first bitcoin transaction at the MIT Coop, purchasing an MIT-branded hat with bitcoin.  Boston Magazine had earlier indicated that no transactions had been made as of the publication of its report.  While the bookstore's initiative may be off to a slow start, those close to both the MIT Bitcoin Club, the university's on-campus bitcoin interest group, and the MIT Bitcoin Projecthttp://bitcoin.mit.edu/announcing-the-mit-bitcoin-project/ believe that spending will increase this fall following the airdrop.  Chris Yim, co-founder of Boston-based bitcoin ATM operator Liberty Teller and an MIT alumnus, told CoinDesk:  ""I remember I probably spent several hundred dollars on books my first semester at MIT, so this will be a very nice way to spend bitcoin, very applicable. I think it's going to be interesting to see the volume it drives through [our ATM].""  Bitcoin interest on the rise  The announcement also follows the completion of the MIT BitComp, a summer-long app development contest led by the MIT Bitcoin Project. Started in June, that competition ended earlier this week, with block chain-powered online identity startup Ethos winning the $5,000 grand prize.  The MIT BitComp was not the first bitcoin-specific event on campus, however.  This May, the university played host to the MIT Bitcoin Expo, a day-long conference that brought leaders in the bitcoin industry face-to-face with MIT students eager to learn more about the emerging technology and potential careers that may be available as the ecosystem develops.  Elitzer told CoinDesk that the excitement and energy around these projects is mounting, and that he hopes this momentum carries through to the airdrop this fall.  Elitzer said:  ""We're really excited to see how all these different groups around MIT are starting to get involved and excited about bitcoin. [...] We're currently waiting on our research proposal and hopefully be able to get the bitcoin in the hands of students and really take this thing to the next level.""

The Sweden-based bitcoin mining company said in a statement that GP Bullhound, a technology-focused investment bank, acted as the advisor for the funding effort.  Creandum  , a venture capital fund based in Stockholm that has invested in companies such as popular streaming music service Spotify and mobile payments firm iZettle, led the round.  KnCMiner  is one of several mining companies to announce major funding deals in 2014. Earlier this year, BitFury announced that it raised $20m in new capital while others in the space, such as PeerNova, have also raised undisclosed amounts.  In a statement, co-founder Sam Cole said that the new funding will allow KnCMiner to build out its existing services such as its cloud mining offering and consumer-facing mobile tools.  Cole added:  ""We are delighted to welcome our new investors and thrilled to have the opportunity to extend our lead within the bitcoin ecosystem. In tandem with our considerable investments in IP, this round of funding will further cement our lead in hardware design and deployment of cryptocurrency services.""  In recent weeks the company has unveiled some of its future plans, which include data center operations in the Arctic Circle and a broader push to grow in what is becoming an increasingly competitive sector of the bitcoin economy.  About Creandum  The company that led the funding round has a broad portfolio of technology companies. Founded in 2003, Creandum's focus on the digital economy has led to stakes in payments and media firms.  Beyond Spotify and iZettle, Creandum has invested in companies like independent game studio PlayRaven and Vivino, which designed a mobile app that recognizes wine bottle labels. Last month, Creandum helped fund an online auto repair marketplace called Autobutler.  According to its website, the firm seeks to ""help build market leaders within consumer, software and hardware.""  Technology bank's role  GP Bullhound, the investment bank that managed the KnCMiner funding round, has a long history facilitating tech company mergers and acquisitions.  The bank has done business with a number of high-profile companies in the technology and digital sectors, including Spotify and mobile money service Monitise.  In a statement, Per Roman, managing partner for GP Bullhound, said that the deal reflects its belief that bitcoin holds significant promise for the world economy.  He explained:  ""We believe bitcoin will have a tremendous impact on a global scale. KnC is already the leading vendor of mining equipment and we are delighted to act as advisor as well as investor to this world-class management team.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/04/kncminer-announces-14-million-series-a-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8a3d6f9c86668d93ff707e665bb31034927c29e-1100x733.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426018,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhv3h,1409839281,PayStand Releases Bitcoin Plugin for WordPress Merchants,"PayStand has released an e-commerce plugin for WooCommerce that will give WordPress merchants a new way to accept bitcoin.  With the news, PayStand joins BitPay to become the latest bitcoin payments processor to integrate its services with WooCommerce. The free e-commerce toolkit is a popular method for WordPress websites to accept payments.  Speaking to CoinDesk, PayStand CEO Jeremy Almond suggested that his company's solution could offer a more attractive option to WordPress merchants who are testing the waters with the cryptocurrency.  In addition to bitcoin, PayStand allows merchants to accept credit cards and e-checks, features that Almond said will enable his company's plugin to find a unique audience.  Almond told CoinDesk:  ""Cards aren't going away tomorrow. [...] We can go to a WordPress merchant and say, 'Here's an offering where you can still take cards and electronic checks, but you can offer something that is free for transactions.' [Bitcoin is] global and it solves a lot of problems around payments.""  PayStand's news is the latest in a series of developments involving the wider WordPress community and bitcoin.  In November 2012, WordPress itself announced that it would allow customers to buy upgrades using BitPay. The development is often cited as a milestone for bitcoin's merchant processing community, as the platform was one of the first major brands to endorse digital currency.  Meeting developer needs  Almond stressed that his company's WooCommerce plugin tool aims to appeal to both novice business owners and more established developers looking to integrate a bitcoin payments offering into their website.  Framing his new offering as flexible to the needs of both demographics, he said:  ""Our process is very simple, one click of a button you can install the product, so it's not very complicated, you don't need developers to do it, you can have credit card processing right next to it. You can turn it on and turn it off, it's very easy to use.""  Established developers, in turn, will be able to use PayStand's API to build out more extensive and unique solutions, Almond added.  Bitcoin key to business model  The CEO went on to brand the offering as a natural fit for his company given that WooCommerce is one of the most used shopping cart toolkits, and that WordPress powers one in five e-commerce websites.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our business ultimately wants to see bitcoin thrive, so going places like WordPress and other mainstream areas where we can continue to get your everyday merchant aware and able to take payments and that's a key goal for us.""  While PayStand offers multiple payment options, Almond stressed that the company simply wants to serve as a bridge to emerging payment types.  Though he declined to offer specific figures, Almond said he has been pleased so far with the number of PayStand merchants that have enabled the company's bitcoin payment option since his service launched in April.  He concluded:  ""Our goal is to build a bridge from traditional to next-generation payments, and I think our strategy is working for our merchants.""

42425998,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpDh,1409835716,BitFury Capital Invests in Bitcoin Security Specialist BitGo,"UPDATE (4th September 16:00 BST): A BitFury spokesperson has confirmed that this is the second investment by BitFury Capital.      BitFury Capital, the investment arm of bitcoin mining infrastructure provider BitFury, has announced an undisclosed investment in BitGo.  The news marks the venture capital firm's second investment in recent weeks, following confirmation that it had invested in an anonymous bitcoin wallet provider.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien elaborated on the significance of the deal, though he declined to offer any specifics.  Praising BitFury as a leader in the bitcoin mining sector, O'Brien told CoinDesk:  ""BitFury is one of the largest companies in the bitcoin space and they're looking to invest further in global entrepreneurship and really exciting companies in the space. To have the endorsement from your customer, saying they not only want to be a customer, but also want to be an investor, that's a big deal.”  Although neither company disclosed the size of the investment, O'Brien did suggest that the sum was smaller than BitGo's $2m seed funding round and $12m Series A.  ""We don't disclose investments unless they're of a particular size and scale,"" he said, adding that securing a valuable client relationship was more important than the capital raised.  In conjunction with the deal, BitFury announced it would use BitGo's enterprise multi-signature platform for its treasury management needs.  Platinum customer  BitFury  is the company’s latest Platinum-tier customer. BitGo says it has witnessed a growing interest in both its product and enterprise financial management tools, which are tailored to the needs of the bitcoin industry.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov suggested that the company's recent expansion was a key driver behind the deal, saying:  ""As our business has been scaling rapidly, we were looking for efficient and secure bitcoin corporate treasury solutions that would satisfy our operational needs and meet our corporate governance and reporting standards.""  The CEO added that the company’s diversified operations offer unique management challenges, requiring the right operational tools and accounting transparency.  “This partnership with BitFury Group has the potential to grow and establish new standards for the industry,"" O’Brien added.  Growing interest in multisig  O’Brien noted that BitGo is the only company to successfully deploy and commercialise multi-signature technology.  The CEO added that he has seen a lot of interest in BitGo's Enterprise product since its launch in April. The attention is coming from a variety of clients, including financial services experts, hedge fund managers, investors, e-commerce clients and bitcoin miners, he said.  “At this point, we've had over 500 companies sign up for BitGo Enterprise, we're in the process of enrolling and qualifying them right now. [...] The reality is that people are realising that this is no longer a do-it-yourself industry.”  Many early players in bitcoin tried to develop their own security technology, often with lacklustre results, he added, concluding: ""Much like VeriSign provided a brand for Internet security, BitGo is doing the same for bitcoin.""

42425985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhoth,1409826294,Top US Colleges Begin Offering Bitcoin Courses,"Two top-ranked US universities, New York University and Duke University, are offering courses on cryptocurrencies for the first time.  Professor Geoffrey Miller taught the first class of NYU's new course, The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies, yesterday. 35 students attended the session – the first in a series of 14 – which covered the fundamentals of money.  Miller, a faculty member at NYU's law school, teaches the course with Professor David Yermack, who is on the faculty of the university's business school.  Yermack says the course aims to examine the impact of cryptocurrencies on the fundamental principles that underpin current notions of law and finance.  ""The course is not so much about teaching a knowledge of bitcoin, but it's to show how some of the issues about property, finance and contracts are going to change very quickly in the next century. The technology is forcing people to reexamine long-held assumptions.""  Blockbuster class  Yermack and Miller are joined by Duke University Finance Professor Campbell Harvey, who is preparing a course on cryptocurrencies that will be offered to students next spring.  Both  schools at NYU and Duke are ranked in the top 10 of their respective categories in the US News and World Report college rankings. Notably, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam graduated from Duke in 2010.  Harvey's course at Duke is titled Innovation, Disruption and Cryptoventures and will focus on the potential of businesses that use the block chain.  The course will be offered to students at Duke's computer science department and its law and business schools. Harvey is confident that the course will be a hit with students.  He said:  ""I think it's going to be a blockbuster. The problem will be turning people away.""  For Yermack, teaching a course on bitcoin is a departure from a career spent studying corporate governance and executive compensation issues.  Last autumn, he gave an impromptu speech about bitcoin at a finance conference in Puerto Rico, having ""torn up"" his original keynote address as the bitcoin price soared.  ""It was very well received. The phones kept ringing after that, and I haven't really been able to research much else since,"" he said.  Academics need to step up  Even as the NYU and Duke professors gear up with new digital currency classes, they say that not enough academics are currently engaged in research on cryptocurrencies.  Yermack said that coming up with a syllabus for his course was challenging, due to the small number of published peer-reviewed articles on bitcoin.  Similarly, Harvey said that the block chain's potential is stifled by a lack of basic understanding of its potential uses, and that it is up to academics to ""step up"" and present the information.  He added:  ""It's clear that [cryptocurrencies are] not going to go away, and they might morph into something a little different than what we see today.""  Notably, several other universities already offer degree courses and other programmes around bitcoin. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus offers a masters in digital currency while the UK's University of Cumbria offers two certificates on cryptocurrencies.

42426000,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpHh,1409791843,"CoinOutlet Enters Bitcoin ATM Market With Low-Cost, Two-Way Model","Robocoin, Lamassu, BitAccess, Genesis Coin, BitXatm – the global bitcoin ATM market is already being served by a number of emerging manufacturers. However, that isn't stopping new entrants from attacking the space.  With its late-August launch, CoinOutlet is hoping to make inroads in this burgeoning sector of the industry, investing now while interest in bitcoin ATM offerings remains high and new locations for bitcoin ATMs are still being discovered.  Following the announcement, CoinDesk spoke with CoinOutlet founder and CEO Eric Grill to discuss why he feels his company can succeed in the bitcoin ATM space given the challenges his company will face in the form of both competition and regulation.  Grill explained that his company's advantage is in the buying process, saying:  “It’s pretty simple and straightforward. You get them right away, you don’t have to wait, you don’t have to give us your bank account information. I think these kiosks will become more than just kiosks as regulation becomes more clear.”  The anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliant, two-way machines are now available for purchase around the globe. 10 units are already being prepared for shipment.  Priced to sell  Notably, each CoinOutlet bitcoin ATM machine retails for $8,000 and features both local currency and digital currency support.  The pricing means CoinOutlet offers a middle-ground option in the market. By comparison, Robocoin's two-way physical bitcoin bank branches and Genesis Coin's two-way ATM model retail for $15,000 and $14,500, respectively, while Lamassu's one-way bitcoin vending machines sell for $6,500.  Lamassu's bitcoin vending machines can be equipped for two-way functionality, however, this requires operators to purchase a companion stand, which retails for $5,500.  However, CoinOutlet does have competitors in its price range. BitXatm offers its two-way models for €3,900, or roughly $5,100, though it recently inked an exclusive agreement to sell its US units to one operator.  The future of kiosks  Looking ahead, Grill said that the ATM space is still very much in its early stages and that the units could serve as the basis for new types of financial and wealth management.  For example, Grill suggested that a restaurant could offer a bitcoin ATM as both a teller machine for digital currency as well as a point of sale (POS) to facilitate bitcoin acceptance.  Grill explained:  “Any merchant that has this in their store can also use their ATM as a POS system. If someone wants to pay in bitcoin, they can ring it up on here. There’s no chargebacks – that’s one way we can get in the door with a lot of merchants is offering a free POS system.”  He added that on an international level, ATMs can be utilized as physical exchange points for commodities, precious metals and whatever else a user wants to trade.  However, Grill noted that given the regulatory uncertainty in the US, it’s unlikely that this type of functionality will hit the market soon.  As the technology is still in its infancy, it’s possible that the bitcoin ATMs we know today could be radically different tomorrow.  Regulatory hurdles  When asked about his experiences working with financial regulators, Grill said that nearly all the conversations he has held in the past year have been constructive and informative.  While some have expressed a lack of understanding regarding both the purpose and the underlying technology of a bitcoin ATM, regulators – particularly state-based agencies – have been open to the concept.  Grill said that overall, many federal and state-level contacts simply want to learn more about digital currency. He also suggested that regulators don’t view bitcoin negatively, saying that they are more enthusiastic than many community members suggest.  He told CoinDesk:  “I don’t want to call them friendly, but I don’t think they're looking to impose these harsh rules on us. They want to protect people.""  That being said, Grill believes that the regulatory environment remains very fluid. He cited a recent decision by financial regulators in North Carolina to utilize existing legal frameworks to oversee bitcoin rather than adopting an approach akin to New York’s BitLicense proposal.  Grill added:  “We can’t comply with [the BitLicense] as a company. We could do it technically, but the burden – that expense is humongous. That’s gonna keep us out of New York.”  Images via CoinOutlet, MadBitcoins",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/09/04/coinoutlet-enters-bitcoin-atm-market-with-low-cost-two-way-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9f38e0fc92e575cadfa417c01d8b083bf6d4f7e-1495x813.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
