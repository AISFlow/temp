42377904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uc5,1417976746,Surviving and Thriving in Minecraft's Latest Virtual Bitcoin Economy,"Gaming has long been seen as a potential use case environment for bitcoin and other digital currencies, given that the online entertainment sector is an established testing ground for new payment mechanisms and models.  Differences in implementation and focus aside, digital currency holds the potential to constitute core functions within a gaming environment. Today, both new and existing games are beginning to tap bitcoin for inclusion in their platforms.  A new Minecraft server named BitQuest is hoping to utilize decentralized currencies to boost participation, as well as create a more dynamic gaming environment. BitQuest follows in the footsteps of several other bitcoin-powered servers, including the now-defunct BitVegas which once offered various mini-games denominated in digital currency.  Incorporating the Xapo API and the game’s broad capabilities for developers, the BitQuest team has created an environment in which bitcoin functions as its base currency in an organic, easy-to-understand way. Notably, players are unable to deposit bitcoins: “bits” can only be gathered from in-game actions through an item-based resource system.  According to chief developer Cristián Gonzáles, this approach keeps the playing field fair for both new and experienced players. The game is funded through a mixture of donations, sponsorships and an in-house mining operation, and players that want to withdraw their accrued bits need a Xapo wallet.  Gonzáles told CoinDesk that ultimately, the goal is to keep the in-game currency truly decentralized in the gaming environment by keeping the door open to new and interesting ways to generate bitcoin natively. While still in beta, he says BitQuest is proving that bitcoin has a role to play in virtual gaming ecosystems.  He explained:  “Any popular game that works with money like Candy Crush, Diablo, League of Legends works like this: You give them real money and they give you ""game money"" to spend within the game, and soon you're locked-in the game economy. We chose to use the reverse model so we can have a totally open game economy truly owned by the players and not a game company.”  Into the wild  In Minecraft, players create tools, collect resources and build. The game’s endlessly-expanding landscape and sandbox-style gameplay has made it a hit with child and adult players worldwide and ultimately led to a buyout of Minecraft maker Mojang Games by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.  BitQuest players can earn bitcoin through the accumulation of emeralds, one of the many resources that one can collect through their adventures.  Emeralds can be accrued by killing monsters, collecting tips from other players, contributing in notable ways to the community or even duking it out with other players in the player-versus-player (PvP) arena. Each emerald is worth 0.000001 BTC and can be used in the game’s programmed marketplace as well as various peer-to-peer activities involving other players.  According to Gonzáles, Minecraft is the perfect environment to test whether or not bitcoin can form a suitable basis for a virtual gaming currency:  “Bitcoin is the best candidate to be the official currency of virtual worlds and BitQuest, making it beyond gambling, using it to fuel virtual societies for fun and connecting people together, is a leap forward in the direction we want to see Bitcoin in gaming.”  The secret to surviving in the Minecraft wilderness rests on two basic truths: that you need tools to survive, and that your shelter is your strongest ally.  The game doesn’t drop you in the wilderness right away. Beginners appear within Bitcoin City, a large settlement at the center of the BitQuest universe. Featuring a bank, a marketplace, an arena and yes, a church to the almighty bitcoin, Bitcoin City is home to all the key components of the in-game bitcoin economy.  Like many other servers, BitQuest allows you to claim a humble patch of wilderness for your own, so CoinDesk’s intrepid explorer set out to make his mark in the world. Along the way we visited some impressive structures and found a convenient road leading further into the unknown.  At last we found a place to call home. With a small pool, trees and a rock outcropping that contains some coal – more on the importance of this later – this sanctuary within the vast uncertainties of the Minecraft world will almost certainly prove to be the able bulwark against whatever monsters (the chief source of emeralds, according to the BitQuest team) may be out there once the night falls.  Making your way in the wilderness  The first order of business is familiar to every Minecraft survivor: punching down a tree.  Trees litter the landscape, and luckily, our little hideaway contained a few trees ripe for the punching. Minecraft players combine resources to create items, and the wood you collect can be used for a wide range of things.  After turning the recently-cut wood into wooden planks, we’re ready to make the crafting table. You need to this make pretty much anything you’ll need in the wilderness, so getting one made is a top priority – especially if the sun is coming down soon.  You first need a pickaxe to start digging into the stone, which invariably will lead you to better tools. A weapon is important in the Minecraft wilderness – once the sun sets, zombies, spiders, skeletons and other unique horrors cooked up by the BitQuest team can easily come wandering up to your settlement.  A friendly passer-by who stopped by what this reporter affectionately dubbed Camp CoinDesk provided some much-needed stone, so we got right to work on a stone pickaxe and sword. Then, it was time to dig...  ...and dig. As you can see, you’ll often spend your time carving into the landscape in search of more rare and useful resources. These can be traded with other players on the server for other goods – at the time of this writing, about a dozen players are currently in BitQuest, though during a prior chat with one of the developers, as many as 50 players were logged into the game.  Though CoinDesk’s intrepid explorer did not encounter any monsters that dropped emeralds, we did have a chance to spend some of the free 50 emeralds provided to each player. Among Bitcoin City’s intricately designed buildings is the Bank, in which players can deposit or withdraw their emeralds.  Bitcoin City features a number of automated shops where players can spend their emeralds.  Shops can be created and programmed by players in the game, and while sparsely populated at the time of this writing, the marketplace could become the home of a bit-based economy if more players get involved.  During his visit to the marketplace, CoinDesk’s intrepid explorer bought some orange-colored wool for a bed and food supplies for the wilderness.  Looking ahead  BitQuest’s public beta doesn’t have an end date, and according to Gonzáles, much of the work now is focused on building out new services and jumping on the bugs that inevitably crop up with any experimental system.  He pointed to the community as the driver of success given the game’s recent kickoff, adding that players are collaborating on projects, hunting for issues to report, and are even submitting ideas in code form to help the process along. Gonzáles also cited the community's help in giving new players tips on getting started.  According to Gonzáles, future plans include improving transparency, which means sharing the bitcoin address tied to the currency backing the in-game emeralds.  “Soon we will reveal the wallet address so you will be able to see it on the blockchain for complete transparency,” he explained. “Donations have been pretty cool and we are confident this game will continue for a long time.”  Gonzáles joked that since the game launched, he and many others have had little sleep as a result of both coding the game and exploring its ever-endless expanse. This reporter will admit that he, too, found himself digging for virtual blocks in the early hours and, at press time, a large cache of iron ore is currently being smelted in order to make better tools and a suit of armor.  Gonzáles continued:  “We aren't very proud of having players with very little sleep completely addicted to BitQuest, but even we have been doing the same providing support, patching bugs and having so much fun that we barely sleep too!”  Screenshot images via BitQuest/Minecraft",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/07/surviving-and-thriving-in-minecrafts-latest-virtual-bitcoin-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e637af3f36cf1f0033a886a1f0fa4fb872ef9fa-1492x831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uYJ,1417968735,Why Bitcoin Remittance Services Should Leave the 'Bitcoin' Part Out,"The sister cities of Hong Kong and Macau currently house more than 200,000 migrant Filipinos between them.  The breakdown is fairly homogenous in terms of occupation: the largest group consists of 160,000 Filipinas working on Foreign Domestic Helper visas on the Hong Kong side, with a little under 17,000 on the Macau side.  Together, the two groups transferred over $380m back to their families in the Philippines in 2013, amounting to between 30% and 40% of their collective wages.  The remittances industry has become something of an obsession of mine over this last year, as we have begun the long process of thoroughly educating ourselves on the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) situation around the world and rolled out our bitcoin remittance service.  There's an oft-touted statistic when discussing the 'global remittance challenge' that I love sharing: in 2014, an estimated $436bn will be remitted around the world by migrant workers, and $47bn of that will be spent on transaction fees.  It's a great soundbite, because it's so startling. $47bn! That's five times India's education budget, 14x South Africa's healthcare budget, and the entire GDP of Kenya.  ""Surely, there is something we can do about this,"" I naively thought, at the start of this process.  It was a staggering proportion of remitted funds lost to the (arbitrary?) costs of transmission and, in my mind, that constituted the proverbial industry that was ripe for disruption. Of course, it's never as simple as that. There is, after all, a huge difference between the possibility of disruption and the ripeness thereof.  Upon closer inspection, in fact, it appears as if the remittances industry is being quasi-disrupted on a fairly regular basis.  Inside a remittance hub  During Rebit.ph's recent trip to Hong Kong, we spent hours talking to the patrons and vendors at the popular mall World Wide House (WWH), which on a Sunday constitutes the densest concentration of Filipinos in the country.  Each of WWH's four floors have a dozen or so separate remittance establishments, and every one of these shops had lengthy queues extending outwards from their respective windows.  As the financial capital of Southeast Asia, Hong Kong's remittance industry is predictably competitive. Each shop reportedly pays upwards of 55,000 HKD ($7,096) in monthly rent, so only the strongest businesses survive.  The most popular of these shops is probably the Franki Exchange Co. Even in this fiercely competitive environment, they have managed to open three branches in the same mall, practically one per floor.  A quick inspection of their rates shows why. Their pricing is cheap — almost unbelievably so — and their workflow is streamlined enough that they are processing customers at a rate of nearly one per minute. The average Filipino remitter can expect to queue up for about an hour to send money home, which is important if you only have one day a week with which to run all your errands.  Uneven playing field  However, Franki Exchange and its rivals are not really disrupting the industry, so much as optimizing their own business processes to extreme levels.  For all intents and purposes, they are no different from any other remittance provider – using large amounts of liquidity on the receiving end of the transfer to ensure quick turnaround times, and reconciling the transactions internally in bulk at a later date.  It's this 'pre-fund' remittance model that makes it prohibitively expensive for a new player to come in and attempt to innovate. Most businesses simply wouldn't have enough capital to be competitive.  But that is the nature of remittances when you are dealing with traditional fiat currencies. Your customers can't wait for days to be able to receive their cash – they need it in hours.  To make this possible, vast cash reserves on the Philippine side are needed in order to quickly fund the payouts. Internal reconciliation then occurs after the fact, using the not-so-swift SWIFT network or the legacy automated clearing house (ACH) system, which both take days and several correspondent-bank hops to move cash from one country to another.  This is, in a roundabout way, why the disruption of the money transfer industry seems imminent.  Cryptocurrency allows reconciliation to occur in real-time, meaning that cash reserves don't need to be nearly as vast. Instead of a week's worth of reserves, you now only need enough for a day, significantly levelling what used to be an extremely uneven playing field.  Bitcoin in the background  At a bitcoin panel in Hong Kong in October, we spoke about remittance challenges, the OFW situation, and the solution we were currently road-testing in the market.  Other members of the panel included Dave Shin of Paywise, an enterprise payment solution looking to replace SWIFT, and Matt Ventura, who operates various Genesis1 Bitcoin ATMs in Macau. We were all, in our own ways, approaching the remittances challenge from different sides and it was helpful to see the growing local interest.  Just over a month later, the first cash-in, cash-out remittance solution powered by bitcoin was piloted in World Wide House, with Bitspark in Hong Kong acting as the intake and Rebit in the Philippines acting as the payout.  Reconciliation occurs in real-time via bitcoin between the two companies, in a fraction of the time required for traditional fiat.  Filipina domestic helpers could hand over HKD and be assured that it would be magically available for pickup as pesos (PHP) at a neighbourhood pawnshop 800 miles away within the same day. Even in this limited trial at World Wide House, the interest generated was palpable.  In this situation, bitcoin is invisible. It is about as relevant to the customer as SMTP is to the average Gmail user – that is to say, not at all. The only things that matter to the customer are that this new service is offering cheaper remittances and is at least as reliable as any other traditional provider.  The Hong Kong–Philippines remittance corridor is, by itself, a huge opportunity, but it's important to remember that it's just the tip of the $30bn Philippine money-transfer iceberg. And then beyond that, there is the even larger $436bn global market, a vast ice shelf of opportunity.  The amount of customer savings that a truly disruptive solution could generate would be enough to put millions of children through school, invest in diaspora-supported infrastructure projects and have a significant impact on the poorest sectors of our world.  It seems that all we have to do in order to make this happen, is leave the 'bitcoin' part out of it.

42377889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uLj,1417962352,FirstMark Director: Bitcoin Needs Entrepreneurs Who Understand Money,"Despite the record levels of venture capital pouring into the bitcoin ecosystem, there is still one determining factor that is holding back overall ecosystem development – the inexperience of the technology's entrepreneurs.  At least, that's the opinion of FirstMark Capital managing director Lawrence Lenihan, who, despite overseeing his firm's first bitcoin investment in Coinapult this October and being a self-described ""bitcoin bull"", argues that many current bitcoin entrepreneurs fail to understand how the traditional financial system works.  Lenihan, whose firm has backed marquee startups such as Lumosity, Pinterest and Shopify, indicated that this knowledge gap has impacted his firm's ability to capitalize on its own interest in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Lenihan told CoinDesk:  ""I think, honestly, a lot of people in bitcoin don't understand money. They might understand bitcoin because they read about it and were early on it, but they don't understand how the global money system works and that's when this thing really takes off. In terms of FirstMark's investment, we need industrial-strength businesses and I want to see industry-strength entrepreneurs start them.""  Despite his critique of the ecosystem, the SecondMarket board member indicated that he first learned of bitcoin through that company's chairman and former CEO Barry Silbert, and remains convinced of the technology's long-term potential.  ""I am a gigantic believer that, once you get through all the bullshit around bitcoin and the pretense, you're going to see how unbelievably instrumental this is going to be as a currency, as an asset and as a platform,"" he added.  Threat from traditional finance  To bridge this gap and grow bitcoin to its full potential, Lenihan suggests that entrepreneurs with an established knowledge about the financial system are needed.  ""The guys who work with money now, understand it,"" Lenihan said. ""They can learn bitcoin. I think it will be harder for the bitcoin people to really learn about money in the way that these financial institution people do.""  Lenihan, however, acknowledged that bitcoin entrepreneurs are not ""burdened by historical bias"", a factor that potentially enables them to innovate. Still, he asserted his belief that those with traditional training who are able to begin to think more openly about bitcoin will be best positioned to tackle challenges that garner investment from firms like FirstMark.  ""The companies that we want to back, I want to see people who understand the security consequences around money, the transactional consequences around money,"" he added.  Coinapult, he said, met and exceeded this requirement. Lenihan went so far as to call the team ""the best of the technologists and the tinkerers in the bitcoin world,"" adding:  ""It was a no-brainer to take a stake in them.""  Locking in value  Lenihan argued that the key differentiator for Coinapult is how it aims to reduce bitcoin's volatility through its LOCKS product, which allows users to lock in the value of their bitcoin to another asset, be it gold or US dollars.  Calling it an innovative consumer application, Lenihan stated that he believes more products like this are needed to help introduce consumers to bitcoin. Notably, LOCKS is only available to consumers outside the US.  ""The success of bitcoin is going to happen when no one knows it's bitcoin,"" he said. ""With LOCKS, what you have is portable money that you can spend wherever you are and it removes you from the volatility risk that's inherent in bitcoin at this point in time.""  Lenihan suggested that such solutions wouldn't be needed should bitcoin payroll be more common, but that as long as US dollars and bitcoin co-exist, consumers will want to be protected from price fluctuations between the two currencies.  ""If I'm paid in dollars and I have bitcoin, that value is changing every single day. I don't want that, that's not why I'm using it, I'm using it to spend,"" he continued, echoing a belief issued by thought leaders in the space.  Playing a waiting game  Ultimately, Lenihan indicated that while ""everyone"" in venture capital is looking into bitcoin, he's comfortable waiting for choice investments given the long growth timeline the technology will likely take.  ""Everyone is taking a look at bitcoin, but I don't think it's going be the next big thing,"" he said. ""I think it will look like it's never going to be a thing, then it will be the most gigantic thing.""  Lenihan went so far as to envision a future where bitcoin disrupts the highest levels of the established financial infrastructure, adding: ""Before you know it, you're going to see governments that aren't going to try to print money, they're not going to have dollars, they're going to distribute bitcoins because all the people have cellphones.""  As for the question of how this transition will take place, Lenihan was less specific, suggesting it may take a ""cataclysm that roils governments"" for bitcoin to be more widely adopted.  Lenihan concluded:  ""Will we have something like that in the next five years? Yeah, I think so. But, it's going to take something like that to really make that happen.""
