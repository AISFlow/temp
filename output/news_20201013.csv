42405181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLYGe,1602627151,Tim Draper’s Draper Goren Holm Raises $25M for Blockchain Venture Fund,"Venture capitalist Tim Draper’s investment office Draper Goren Holm is sinking larger investments in virtual currency-only startups.      Draper Goren Holm, a cryptocurrency investment firm in Los Angeles, told CoinDesk that it raised $25 million for its first venture capital fund to buffer its startup accelerator and back blockchain companies at higher investment valuations.      The venture fund is planning to invest $250,000 to $500,000 in seed, Series A and a few later investment rounds, the firm said, whereas the accelerator funds pre-seed rounds for between $10,000 and $50,000 and 4% to 10% ownership stakes in startups.      “A majority of the value is captured in winning companies as they grow,” Alon Goren, a co-founding Draper Goren Holm partner with Josef Holm, said. “If we don't have the cash to double down or triple down, we get diluted and lose some of that value.”      Draper Goren Holm, which brought Tim Draper onto its partnership last year, has invested in CasperLabs, a blockchain that mimics the Ethereum blockchain’s model; Vertalo, a Tezos blockchain security token issuer; and Tezos Stablecoin Technologies, a Tezos Foundation offshoot developing stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to fiat currencies.      Forge, a subsidiary of French investment bank Societe Generale, selected Tezos in September to test the issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and digital securities.      Billionaire Tim Draper’s namesake Silicon Valley venture capital firms – Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which he departed in 2013, Draper Venture Network, Draper Associates and Draper University – have invested in preeminent technology companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, Hotmail, Skype, Twitter, Twitch, Baidu and Ancestry.com.

The Ethereum blockchain also shows more than 650 transactions where investors have been whitelisted or registered. (The true number of registered investors could be higher because of how long the know-your-customer (KYC) process takes.)  According to Douglas Borthwick, chief marketing officer and head of business development at INX, the sale has seen interest from retail, accredited and institutional investors.  Doing an IPO on-chain gives the public, and INX itself, a novel outlook on the process, which traditionally has been a back-room affair.  Traditionally, to get information on who beneficially owns an interest in securities held at central securities depositories like the Depository Trust Company, investors or issuers would have to go to the investment banks or broker-dealers who coordinated the sale.  Because INX is self-issuing and national exchanges cannot list digital securities, the sale is only available in 15 states in the U.S. The exchange is also selling tokens to investors abroad.

42405177,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLYDh,1602624016,Around 100 Italian Banks Are Officially on a Blockchain,"After the latest addition of 42 banks, about 100 Italian banks are officially operating on the country’s banking blockchain network, Spunta, built on R3’s Corda, the Italian Banking Association (ABI) announced Tuesday.    Banks first joined the blockchain project designed to improve interbank data transfer and settlement speeds back in March 2020 and by May, 55 banks had joined the network.  According to ABI’s announcement, since March 204 million transactions were processed on Spunta’s infrastructure, and the association predicts this number will exceed 350 million by the end of the year.  The blockchain speeds up the complicated process of interbank reconciliation, where banks have to agree on how much money is owed by one bank to another.  Earlier this year, an ABI official said that traditionally, reconciliation took weeks to complete, but because the blockchain keeps a verified interbank transfer log, processing can be done within a day.  Spunta is a project created by ABI Labs, which began trialing interbank transfers on Corda as early as 2018.  Italian banks joined the Spunta network in waves. There have been 32 banks since March, joined by 23 more in May, and 42 more in October, according to the announcement.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,397 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,313-$11,730  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was able to crack $11,700 in the past 24 hours, going as high as $11,730 on spot exchanges such as Bitstamp. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization then trended downward, dipping to as low as $11,313 before settling at $11,397 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoiners Have Trillions and Trillions of Reasons to Ignore US Election      Despite bitcoin’s downward move Tuesday, Cindy Leow, portfolio manager for multi-strategy trading firm 256 Capital Partners, said its overall upward price trend since Oct. 8 has created a new bullish price floor. Leow’s analysis shows bitcoin above $11,000 signals a longer-term bull trend. However, if bitcoin's price goes below that “support” level, she maintains, a long-term bear market could develop.      “Since its break upwards at the end of last week, bitcoin's support now squarely rests on the average price paid for BTC since the early September peak at $12,000. This new support is at $11,000,” Leow told CoinDesk.      The declining influence of Seychelles-based derivatives venue BitMEX, which is mired in a myriad of regulatory and legal issues, appears to have had a positive impact on the market, Leow noted.      “With BitMEX and its aggressive liquidation engine slowly becoming less relevant, bitcoin’s sudden $1,000 wicks are growing more infrequent, another healthy sign for BTC,” she added. Wicks are the vertical lines that appear at the top and bottoms of candles in technical charts that indicate the total price range during a specific trading period.      Indeed, bitcoin’s implied volatility, which forecasts price gyrations and is used often by options traders to analyze trading strategies, is at a low not seen since July.      Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter trader based in Italy, notes that bitcoin has been operating in tandem with the stock market. Increasing correlation with the S&P 500 based on data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index seems to back this up.      Andreotti predicts bitcoin’s price could hit fresh 2020 highs should stocks also continue to rise. “If the S&P 500 can break into all-time highs, bitcoin could move up to $13,000.”    Ether locked in DeFi stalls    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down in Tuesday trading at around $378 and slipping 2.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: COTI Launches Decentralized ‘Fear Index’ for DeFi Markets      Since Sept. 18, the amount of ether “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has remained relatively flat, averaging around $8.26 billion. Ether holders park the cryptocurrency in various smart-contract based protocols on the Ethereum network and receive a “yield” in return.      By contrast, the amount of bitcoin locked in DeFi has for the most part steadily increased, and is now closing in on 150,000 BTC.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, said bitcoin holders may be seeing a powerful DeFi use case for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency that didn’t exist until recently.      “Until recently, bitcoin was isolated from the power and flexibility of Ethereum,” Mosoff said. “Now, bitcoin holders can wrap their BTC and interact with a decentralized exchange, or borrow against a stablecoin.

Some takeaways:      Once in the business of cryptocurrency mining, Diginex sold most of those operations in 2018 and changed its focus to developing a digital asset financial services stack that includes an exchange, custodian, trading system and other complimentary business lines.      The company is centered around its institutional-focused exchange, Equos, which competes with several well-established players in a high-risk and competitive environment.

The language used was a hypothetical. CoinDesk regrets the error.

Director of Research Ria Bhutoria wrote that the crypto’s current market capitalization “is a drop in the bucket compared with markets bitcoin could disrupt.”  Bhutoria argued that while institutional inflows may damp bitcoin’s uncorrelated performance, the crypto is “fundamentally less exposed” to the “economic headwinds” that other assets will likely face.  Bitcoin is therefore a “potentially useful” asset for uncorrelated return-seeking investors.  “In a world where benchmark interest rates globally are near, at, or below zero, the opportunity cost of not allocating to bitcoin is higher,"" the report said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/13/fidelity-report-says-bitcoins-market-cap-is-drop-in-the-bucket-of-potential,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42405178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLYFf,1602619992,Validator Vote Transitions NEAR Protocol to Proof-of-Stake Mainnet,"Decentralized application blockchain NEAR Protocol is live following a six-month release roadmap begun in May, according to the developer team.      The Andreessen Horowitz-backed blockchain project successfully transitioned to phase 2 of Mainnet today, Oct. 13, following an unexpected vote from the network’s validators, NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      “It is now possible for anyone to send or receive tokens, to create accounts, to participate in validation, to launch applications or to otherwise use the network,” the team said in a release shared with CoinDesk.      Polosukhin said the project’s “liquid democracy” function that allows token holders to delegate governance to validator pools unexpectedly led NEAR Foundation members to launch the network earlier than expected.      The network was previously operating under a limited Proof-of-Authority (PoA) model. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)–compatible blockchain is now operating under its own “Threshold” Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.      NEAR Foundation CEO Erik Trautman told CoinDesk the project took longer to vet over the summer months than originally intended as “edge case” performance issues were being addressed. He said some 1,000 delegations occurred ahead of the vote that launched NEAR on Tuesday.

The new report, published on the Bank of Russia’s website on Tuesday, does not promise an immediate launch. According to the report, the bank is open to feedback on the idea until Dec. 31. Then it will evaluate the data and possibly pilot a digital ruble with a limited set of users. Only at that point will the bank make a decision on whether or not such a project will be officially launched.      The report proposed a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that will complement other forms of money, namely cash and bank accounts. Whether it will use a distributed ledger, a centralized system or a hybrid is an open question. The report underscores the value of smart contracts, which were pioneered on the Ethereum blockchain.      CBDCs have been a buzzword for a while. Various central banks are discussing the topic and the People’s Bank of China is moving fast to launch a digital yuan.      This isn’t the first time Russia’s central bank has explored this concept. Last summer, the Bank of Russia’s head, Elvira Nabiullina, said the bank will not issue its own digital currency any time soon but was studying the question.      Unlike cryptocurrencies and stablecoins (specifically mentioned in the report), the digital ruble’s viability will be guaranteed by the government and the Bank of Russia in particular, the report said. The already-existing digital payment infrastructure used by payment terminals and ATMs can be also employed as payment rails for the digital ruble, the Bank of Russia believes.      The digital ruble will stimulate innovation and competition in the financial sector because it will make transfers of funds from one financial broker to another faster and easier, the report said. It can also help make sure the funds allocated to government-funded projects are not misappropriated as a result of corruption. Each unit of the digital ruble can be tagged according to how exactly it can be spent.      Read more: Russia’s Latest Draft Bill Would Still Largely Ban Crypto, Stifle Miners      The report pays special attention to privacy.

In particular, banks will have access to information on who participated in a transaction, but not the purpose of the transaction, the report reads. The users of the digital ruble will be go through know-your-customer (KYC) procedures on the Bank of Russia’s tech platform.      The regulator envisions that the potential launch of the digital ruble can create a period of instability for banks if people start withdrawing funds from their accounts to buy digital rubles.

42384911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwwh,1602613269,Ethereum's Top Dapps Are Increasingly Turning to 'Rollups': Here's Why,"Ethereum scaling solutions are heterogeneous, which, as a result, makes them hard to monitor.      For those conversant with all things Ethereum, rollups are the newest need-to-know technology that largely made their debut one calendar year ago at Devcon V in Osaka, Japan. In fact, a majority of the top 20 Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) have switched or plan on switching to a rollup solution in the coming months, according to teams polled by CoinDesk.      For example, Coinbase Wallet now has native support for Optimism’s OVM testnet, according to a Tuesday blog.      Entirely different from the fruit variety, a rollup is an off-chain aggregation of transactions inside an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum users can transact inside the contract with security guarantees their transactions won’t be misused and they will settle to the mainchain at some future point.      The main advantages of transaction aggregation for dapps were witnessed time and time again this summer as the average Ethereum transaction fee broke historical records numerous times.      Read more: Decentralized Finance Frenzy Drives Ethereum Transaction Fees to All-Time Highs      The method of guaranteeing transactions is where rollup constructions diverge: On one side are Zero knowledge proof rollups (ZKR), relying on math; on the other are Optimistic rollups (OR), relying on financial incentives.    Lay of the land    Rollups have been around in concept since 2014, described as “shadow chains” by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.      Ethereum developers – like all blockchain devs – have been searching for viable scaling options since the project’s launch in 2015. Most solutions have failed or only partially worked, including Plasma and state channels. Those failures led many developers to revisit Buterin’s shadow chains, which we now call rollups.      Indeed, in a blog this month Buterin called rollups the “scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future,” due to high demand for a scalable blockchain today. Ethereum 2.0 – a new, sharded, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain – is intended as a long-term fix, but won’t be production-ready for years.      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      The two best-known rollup firms are Paradigm-backed Optimism, formally known as Plasma Group, for its OR and Matter Labs for its zk-Rollup, ZK-Sync. Teams like Fuel Labs and Starkware are also working on much hyped implementations.    Rollups as throughput solutions    One point of clarification is needed, however. Rollups are not a scaling solution for Ethereum or any blockchain, but a “throughput solution.”      Scalability, as Summa co-founder James Prestwich said in a July tweet, increases the number of transactions a network can process without changing hardware requirements.      Throughput, on the other hand, increases the number of transactions as well but requires more hardware to get it done.      As Prestwich notes, the hardware issue truly boils down to what is required to validate every transaction. Layer 2 (L2) solutions like ZKR and OVR require additional hardware setups because the proof to settle rollup transactions on-chain often requires additional hardware support to get the job done.    ZKR vs. OR    The nexus of ZKR and OR is the mechanism that proves the validity of transactions. In plain language, that means the bundle of transactions included in a rollup needs to be verified in some sort of way.      Stepping back, rollups can be thought of as a mining block, of sorts. Transactions are moved off-chain, bundled, sequenced and then sent back to the mainchain.      ZKRs bundle a group of transactions, compress them and slap on a zero-knowledge proof to certify the state transitions validity, as Buterin describes in a 2019 blog post. When the transaction is sent to the mainchain, the block is verified by the attached zero-knowledge proof.      Read more: EY Reveals Zero-Knowledge Proof Privacy Solution for Ethereum      ORs, on the other hand, use game theory. Instead of attaching a proof, a sequencer leaves a bond up for grabs called a fraud proof that is seizable if a sequencer commits any malicious act such as sequencing transactions against prior rules.      That’s what makes Optimistic rollups optimistic: They operate under the assumption everyone is acting ethically, but include a fallback in case a malicious party arrives.    Trade-offs    At first take, ZKRs may seem more favorable than ORs: There’s no bond, and trust is ensured by the zero-knowledge proof.      But ZKRs do have some drawbacks, at least for now. For one, ZKRs do require specialized hardware to create the computationally expensive proof.      For example, privacy coin zcash is based on zero-knowledge proofs and was not able to launch shielded transactions on its mobile wallet until this year because of the difficulty of creating those proofs without large computational power.      Read more: Zcash Latest Hard Fork ‘Heartwood’ Makes Mining Private      Additionally, ZKRs cannot interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the same manner ORs can. This limits the application of ZKRs to a few blockchain actions such as a basic transaction.      “The advantage of fraud proofs is their simplicity – Zk-rollups require writing your contracts as a complex zero knowledge circuit and lots of fancy math. This means you can't use the EVM, so you lose a half-decade of developer tooling and mindshare,” Optimism co-founder Ben Jones said in an email to CoinDesk.      Matter Labs founder Alex Gluchowski told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that Optimistic rollups have their own particular issues as well.      For example, a tension exists between how large an OR can be compared to the amount of an asset it is processing, Gluchowski said.      In other words, it's theoretical an OR-based sequencer processes enough transactions that it becomes profitable to misuse their position as a sequencer – even if they could have the fraud proof slashed. In that way there is likely an upper bound on the number of transactions an OR can be trusted with processing compared to ZKRs, he said.      “The more assets a single OR has, the more vulnerable it becomes for various attacks. And the more transactions in a single OR, the harder it gets to run a full node, further decreasing security,” Gluchowski said.

42384916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlx2z,1602609590,"Blockchain Bites: G20’s CBDC Rules, Ethereum 2.0’s Tests, Blockchain's $1.7T Boost","CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us. Today's intro is written by CoinDesk research analyst Christine Kim.    This year, 2020, is proving to be wildly successful for Ethereum in terms of market performance and technological development.      Since January, ETH has so far tripled in value, beating out the gains made by the majority of the top crypto assets by trade volume. The only other crypto asset in the CoinDesk 20 that has outperformed ETH in the markets year-to-date is the LINK token, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain.      A growing number of stablecoins, which are crypto assets that track the value of one or more base assets such as the U.S. dollar, are beginning to be issued primarily on Ethereum. As of the end of September, 70% of stablecoins were issued from Ethereum. The collective demand for these assets has also grown significantly over the last nine months. Total stablecoin market capitalization has tripled year-to-date and now exceeds $20 billion.      But it’s not only Ethereum-based tokens that have seen a surge in demand this year. The underlying utility of new decentralized applications on the network have increased dramatically too. Trade volume on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Curve Finance has soared from $4 billion to over $22 billion from January to September. As of Sept. 29, monthly aggregate DEX volume makes up for over 10% of total trade volume.      As if the growth in value and network activity on Ethereum wasn’t eventful enough, core developers building the next phase of Ethereum’s base layer technology expect to see the first phase of “Ethereum 2.0” go live before the end of the year. To this end, users are beginning to explore what options are available to participate in the seminal launch of the new Ethereum blockchain.      For a full rundown of the main Ethereum-related trends and events of 2020, download the full research report, featuring additional chart visualizations about the network and its upcoming 2.0 launch, here.      Also, be sure to tune in to the virtual event invest: ethereum economy tomorrow.    Featured panel    The move to ETH 2.0 will bring the Ethereum network ever closer to fulfilling its original vision: that of a ""world computer"" that plays host to a parallel, decentralized financial system. This system has taken the crypto world by storm recently, but has been limited by ETH 1.0 infrastructure. Will ETH 2.0 be the rocket fuel that takes this nascent financial engine mainstream?      Vitalik Buterin will go live, kicking off invest: ethereum economy, at 9:00 a.m. ET tomorrow.    Ethereum 101    With final preparations for the launch of Ethereum 2.0 soon to be underway, CoinDesk’s Christine Kim spoke with lead developer at Prysmatic Labs Raul Jordan and project lead at DAppNode Eduardo Antuña Díez about what’s left to do and what comes next.      Raul Jordan, who has been building Ethereum 2.0 software for over two years, explained his team would be wrapping up all feature development by Oct. 15.      “At that time, it’s all hands on deck to just have good documentation, good user experience, fix up security holes [and] basically prepare for launch. That’s where we are today if all remains on track,” said Jordan.      The final features currently in development by Prysmatic Labs and other software development teams include making sure different code implementations of Ethereum 2.0, also called “clients,” are interoperable and can be used interchangeably by a user without running the risk of losing validator rewards.      It’s not only client developers who are beginning final preparations for this network upgrade. Ethereum startups building hardware and tooling for users to participate in the Ethereum 2.0 launch are also working on adding last-minute features to their products.      Díez said, “The most important thing that we realized after the first [Ethereum 2.0] testnet is that people need to know the status of their validators. Having a good monitoring system to be able to know when your validator is down … we are working in that direction.”      Before Ethereum 2.0 goes live, Jordan and Díez both noted a new contract will be created on the current Ethereum blockchain to receive deposits of 32 ETH. Only once this contract accumulates a minimum of 524,288 ETH, which is worth roughly $181 million at time of writing, will the new Ethereum blockchain officially kick-start at midnight UTC the following day.      About the security of the deposit contract, Jordan said, “There’s no way to retrieve [funds]. … It’s considered a burn in the short term. It’s not like there’s any sort of admin key or any sort of way to take those funds out. There’s no way somebody can take all the ETH that is locked in there.”    The ledger    Christine Kim and colleague Shuai Hao put together a history of Ethereum in five charts. Originally published this summer, an excerpted version is reprinted here.      Part 1: A Bloodless Secession      Not one year after the launch of Ethereum, a seminal event split the community in two – resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called “ethereum classic,” cloned from the original Ethereum codebase.      Ethereum classic was created July 20, 2016, after $60 million worth of ether was stolen from users of a dapp known as The DAO. After weeks of deliberation, Ethereum developers reached a consensus that they should turn back the clock – reverse The DAO hack transactions and restore users’ lost ETH.      The changes could only be implemented through a network-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork. Those who opposed the change argued in favor of retaining the integrity of the original blockchain’s history of transactions and balances – hacked funds and all.      On July 20, 2016, when the upgrade to restore user funds was executed, the Ethereum blockchain split in two. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack and did not upgrade the software created a parallel network, Ethereum Classic.      Since the split, the Ethereum network has hard forked seven additional times, though none of these subsequent upgrades have reached the same level of controversy as “The DAO Fork” of 2016.      Part 2: Those Darned Cats      The first dapp on Ethereum to gain real user traction was a collectibles game known as CryptoKitties. At the height of their popularity, tokenized cats were trading on Ethereum for upwards of $200,000. However, the influx of users and a high volume of transactions from this one viral dapp clogged the Ethereum blockchain to unprecedented levels.      A backlog of 30,000 transactions had piled up by December 2017, meaning that users would have to wait days for their transfers of ETH to be confirmed.      The developers behind CryptoKitties hastened to help stem the tide of new users by increasing game fees. Shortly after CryptoKitties’ launch, Ethereum saw the highest total for daily transaction fees in its history, on Jan. 10, 2018. Over $4.5 million was collected in fees by Ethereum miners that day.      In many respects, the CryptoKitties craze was the rude awakening that reminded Ethereum developers of the platform’s technical limitations.      Part 3: Testing the Limits      The popularity of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – a way to crowdfund early stages of a cryptocurrency project – by dollar amount raised reached its peak in 2018. A total of $7.8 billion was raised for over 1,000 projects that year. According to ICObench, over 80% of all ICOs rely on the Ethereum blockchain to create their tokens and issue them to investors.      Trends like the ICO boom of 2018 are indicative of the ways blockchain technology can be leveraged in more ways than simply peer-to-peer electronic cash. Ethereum, as the world’s first general-purpose blockchain platform, has become the central hub where dapp developers congregate to build any and all types of use cases for blockchain, be it gaming- or finance-related.      Part 4: Dapp Dominance      In order to ensure interoperability between different dapps on the network, common frameworks were developed – like the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. These innovations have blazed the trail for other general-purpose blockchain platforms to emerge since Ethereum’s birth in 2015.      EOS, stellar, tezos and tron are four cryptocurrencies in the top 15 by market share that also feature dapp creation and deployment. Despite the growth in the number of alternative dapp platforms, Ethereum remains the most popular general-purpose blockchain both in terms of number of users and dapps, as shown in the chart above.      Ethereum hasn’t fulfilled its vision yet, however. Developers are convinced that the current blockchain infrastructure as it currently exists is wholly inadequate to handle an influx of millions, if not billions of users around the world.      Part 5: The Long Road to 2.0      The Ethereum 2.0 roadmap is almost as ambitious as the original one which brought the first dapps into existence. While the launch of this technology is forthcoming, an important part of understanding Ethereum’s five-year history lies in studying the many iterations that Ethereum 2.0 underwent in its years of planning.      Originally, Ethereum 2.0 in 2015 was thought of as the final development phase for the project and dubbed “Serenity.” Serenity was tentatively expected to be rolled out 16 months after initial mainnet launch (which would have been November 2016). The upgrade would transition Ethereum from its reliance on a computationally intensive process for block production inherited from Bitcoin, known as “mining,” to a more energy-efficient process of validating.      To this end, developers created what is called the “difficulty bomb” to slowly but surely encourage this transition away from mining. The bomb, which was activated on March 14, 2016, increases the difficulty levels for miners to find an Ethereum block over time. This schedule at which this bomb slows block production has been delayed three times over the course of the last five years as developers re-worked plans for launching Ethereum 2.0.      While there is no telling what new technologies and standards of blockchain practice will be innovated as a result of Ethereum 2.0, looking back at the first five years of the network’s development does give some indication. In that time, Ethereum has undergone network-splitting upgrades, faced crippling technology bottlenecks, advanced new forms of fundraising for crypto projects and formalized a launch plan for migrating to Ethereum 2.0.    At stake    Ben Edgington, an Eth 2.0 adviser for ConsenSys, reflected on the year of testing and configuring the Beacon chain, the first real implementation of Ethereum 2.0. His conclusion? It’s time for Ethereum 2.0 to launch.    Skin in the game    We’ve spent the last nine months testing the life out of this thing. The year began with huge, long-running single client testnets: Sapphire, Topaz and Onyx networks run by Prysmatic Labs. In April, there were small multi-client networks: Schlesi, Witti and Altona – all named after subway stations, in keeping with Ethereum testnet tradition.      And then the big one, the Medalla testnet. Named after Medalla Milagrosa on the Buenos Aires Underground, it has been running for over two months, with four different client implementations involved throughout that time. It continues to run today with over 50,000 validators actively participating, making it one of the largest decentralized consensus networks in existence.      Progress has not all been smooth. A few days after the start of the Medalla testnet, one of the clients suffered a critical issue that disrupted the chain for a few days. But this is what testnets are for. We kept the chain running and were able to bring it back to full health, with a slew of lessons learned.      Perhaps the biggest lesson? It is hard to faithfully replicate proof-of-stake on networks that are not incentivized. Participation in these testnets is completely free, which is not at all realistic. On testnets, stakers can neglect their nodes with no real consequences; they can register thousands of validators then just switch them off and they can put down stakes but never join the network.      On the real beacon chain, with significant value genuinely at stake, we expect user behavior to be quite different.      This is why it is now time to go live with the beacon chain. We have tested everything else in every way we can: the deposit contract has been formally verified; the deposit tools have been audited; the specification has been audited; the beacon chain has been formally modeled; the node discovery protocol has been audited; the networking protocol has been audited; the crypto-economics have been simulated; we are running incentivized attack nets; we’ve been doing fuzz testing; every client has undergone at least one third-party security audit. Hundreds of pairs of eyes have scrutinized the whole process over the last year.      However, the real beacon chain will have real rewards and real penalties, and we simply can’t simulate these with testnets.      We’ve tested these things as far as we can in the lab: Now it’s time to run it in the wild.    Top shelf    G20, CBDCs The Group of Twenty (G20) – an organization of finance ministers and central bank governors representing the European Union and 19 countries across every continent – is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to formalize the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in banking systems. Well-designed CBDCs could be interchangeable with existing money, settle high volumes of transactions instantaneously, be impervious to cyberattacks and lead to greater monetary oversight. There are also privacy concerns the industry must reckon with. The G20’s regulatory stablecoin and CBDC framework are expected in 2022.      Coinbase backspin? Tennis superstar and investor Serena Williams may have shed her stake in popular U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, according to a Business Insider report. The website of Williams’ venture firm, Serena Ventures, no longer displays Coinbase among its portfolio firms. The company first listed the investment in Coinbase in April of last year. William has also tweeted about the investment at the time. If indeed her VC firm has divested its stake in Coinbase, it may come as the result of a recent statement from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who effectively banned employee activism at the exchange and said the firm would focus solely on its financial mission.      HBCUs & blockchain Dozens of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are exploring the next phase of decentralized technologies in a bid to put Black students at the forefront of new blockchain protocols. “These schools see it as a way to participate in Web 3.0,” said Tonya Evans, chairperson of the MakerDAO Foundation and visiting professor at Penn State’s Dickinson Law School. “We were not participating in the dot-com era. Most of the Black community didn’t know about it at the time.” Ryan Cooper, a graduate of Bowie State University who started a campus blockchain group, said, “On the East Coast, certain majority-white colleges do this with their spare time anyway. At HBCUs, you have to incentivize this.”      $1.7T boost Blockchain technology stands to boost the global economy by $1.7 trillion in the next decade, according to a new report by consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC economists forecast a tipping point in 2025 if blockchain technologies are adopted at scale across the world, and expect blockchain applications to boost global gross domestic product (GDP) by $1.76 trillion, (1.4% of global GDP) by 2030. “Serious activity around blockchain is cutting through every industry across the globe right now,” Steve Davies, global Blockchain leader at PwC, said in the report. According to the report, blockchain will make the biggest impact on Asia’s economy with China, India and Japan driving adoption in the region.

42384913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwzD,1602602159,Ethereum Is Building the Internet of Value,"The internet is at the cusp of entering a new phase, one where entrenched rulers are dethroned, more power is reclaimed by individuals and value moves as freely as cat GIFs.      To understand why we need a better internet in the first place, consider this question: Isn’t it weird the internet isn’t good at money? Think about it. The applications we use every day to search, to communicate, even to shop; the companies that dominate the web are very bad at dealing with money, even if they’re very good at making it. There’s a separate checkout process, where you repeatedly enter all your information. Cards issued in some countries don’t work on local websites in other countries. Sometimes you wait for what feels like an eternity watching that tiny wheel turn, to have the transaction fail.    Camila Russo is the founder of The Defiant, a content platform focusing on decentralized finance, and the author of ""The Infinite Machine"" about the history of Ethereum. Previously, she was a Bloomberg News reporter covering markets in Buenos Aires, Madrid and New York. She is a speaker at CoinDesk's invest: ethereum economy event beginning Oct. 14.    More complex transactions are almost unthinkable. Influencers and creators should be able to monetize their likes, retweets and views, with micropayments streamed from followers, without any platform taking a cut. Less-famous mortals should get paid if they opt in to view ads or consent to sharing their information. Transferring ownership of valuable assets, from art to real estate, shouldn’t take several intermediaries and tons of paperwork.      There’s the internet’s TCP/IP protocol. There are apps built on top of it. And, separately, there’s the financial system, which relies largely on infrastructure built before the internet was invented. SWIFT, IBAN, the rails handling most international money transfers, weren’t designed to handle actual money. They’re messaging systems where transfers can take up to five days and cost around $50. National money transfers fare a bit better, but in the U.S. they still take at least one business day to settle (money rests on weekends, apparently).      Attempts to update these systems – SEPA in Europe, the Faster Payments initiatives in the U.S., VisaNet for card payments – have resulted in a messy patchwork that doesn’t solve the core problem. Fintechs try to improve the situation, but they’re building on the same old carcass.      At a time when we have global, cheap, fast communications, we should have an equally global, cheap, fast financial system.    My kingdom for your data    The second big problem with the internet today is that we access it through a handful of companies with “walled gardens.” A better analogy is kingdoms. You need a passport to enter. Once you’re in, it feels like you’re roaming free but the price to pay is the king watching your every step, collecting your information and then selling it to fill his coffers. You don’t get a cut, but you do get the incredible services the web offers today.      These kingdoms – Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple – aren’t always clear on what they’re collecting. We’re also left in the dark on what our data will be used for. Is it purely market research or will it be leveraged to, say, influence the U.S. presidential election?      See also: Camila Russo - Five Years On, Ethereum Really Is the ‘Minecraft of Crypto-Finance’      Also, not anyone is free to build on these lands. Developers have to stick to specific guidelines and go through an approval process that can take days, knowing that rules can change without warning, and that their app submission can be rejected. Live apps aren’t off the hook either because they can get outright banned.      Like any for-profit company, the platforms’ goal is to extract as much value from as many users as possible. They’re incentivized to stomp out or buy out anything that comes close to threatening their hold, stifling innovation and competition in what should be the most dynamic industry. The result? We’re getting products and services that are likely not as good as they should be.    An internet of value    The internet is ruled by innovation-stifling monopolies that have stopped us having an internet-of-value. Organizations built on top of the current internet network have almost no other option than to become for-profit corporations, with code that’s proprietary and closed to the public. But when the network itself is designed to transfer value, it enables different business models to emerge.      In this new frontier, users retain control of their funds and their personal information. They roam freely without bowing to any king. Value – that is, money, assets, securities, property – is as native to internet apps as cat videos. And it’s already happening.      This is not about “crypto.” It’s not about the next bitcoin, or getting in on the next hot token that will pump.    There’s no question the internet of value is coming to shake traditional finance and the current web, for the simple reason that it’s many times better.    This is about a shift in the very foundation of the web.      There is a money layer that's being added on top. A distributed network that transfers value without relying on banks, settlement and clearing agents. Money moves faster, cheaper and globally – just like the rest of the internet does.      And this network isn't only good at transferring value. It can also process anything a computer can, allowing developers to build applications on top. The difference from the internet apps we’re used to is that in these applications value isn’t an afterthought; it’s at the very core. The name of this new base layer for value is Ethereum.      Payments can be made seamlessly, and that’s just the start. More complex financial services are now at the fingertips of anyone with access to the network. Users can trade tokens at a few taps, and because value can be programmed this can range from the network’s native token ether, to synthetic representations of everything from gold to a Tesla stock. It can even tokenize San Francisco’s “poop index,” where people can profit from the city’s rising number of feces sightings.      Venezuelans can buy tokens linked to the value of the dollar. And not only that, they can deposit them in lending protocols and earn interest on those tokens. Speculators can borrow from those asset pools to trade. Others can have a computer program automatically execute a trading strategy, like a robo-adviser on steroids. There’s a no-loss lottery, streaming salaries almost by the second, tokenizing and trading limited-edition T-shirts, which are delivered in their physical versions, and can also be worn in virtual reality worlds.      For developers, financial applications are the low-hanging fruit to build on top of a value network, but it’s only the beginning.    An open protocol    A core feature of this network and the applications built on top is that the code is available for anyone to inspect, track and riff on. It means builders can settle anywhere without fear of unpredictable rulers. The base layer itself, the Ethereum blockchain, is owned by a community of millions who can’t unilaterally change rules, ban or censor apps or individuals.      The fact that the code is open makes it harder for companies to build monopolies. If users don’t like the rules, they now have the choice of taking the open code and making a copy of the application.      The ability for these open organizations to have their own associated token – a share-like digital coin – makes open-source business models sustainable.      See also: Camila Russo - Sale of the Century: The Inside Story of Ethereum’s 2014 Premine      It makes it possible for developers and entrepreneurs to build quality products and services outside the bounds of traditional for-profit corporations. Users and builders of the protocol hold the native token, which gives them ownership of the protocol and rights to participate in governance. As the protocol gains traction and use increases, token holders benefit. This enables a world where the platforms we use aren’t competing with their integrations but working with them. It’s a way to change the paradigm from zero-sum to win-win.      This is all still very experimental. It’s risky and it often breaks. The financial applications on Ethereum currently hold $11 billion, a tiny amount by global financial markets standard. But it’s not nothing, and it’s growing and becoming safer, more resilient by the day.      Ethereum itself, where much of this activity is happening, is only five years old. Maybe it’s the Ethereum platform that brings this new internet to the masses, or maybe it’s another network like it.      But there’s no question the internet of value is coming to shake up traditional finance and the current web, for the simple reason that it’s many times better.

In an announcement Tuesday, Marathon said it's teamed up with Maryland-based Beowulf Energy for the venture. Beowulf develops and operates power generation and industrial infrastructure facilities internationally.  The arrangement will see Marathon co-locate a bitcoin mining facility within Beowulf's Big Horn Data Hub at its 105-megawatt power station in Hardin, Montana.  Beowulf will supply electricity for the mining farm at a production cost of $0.028 per kWh, according to the announcement.  That's 38% below Marathon's current aggregate power cost for mining and facility operations, $0.034 per kWh.  The company says this, in turn, will cut its breakeven costs to mine one bitcoin from approximately $7,500 currently to $4,600.  Under the deal, Beowulf is also becoming an equity shareholder in Marathon, while the mining firm will retain all of the bitcoin mined at the Big Horn facility.  Marathon plans to install 11,500 S19 Pro Antminers previously acquired from manufacturer Bitmain; 500 of the devices are already in place, it said.  The facility is expected to be fully operational in Q2 2021, with an output around 1.265 exahashes per second.  Marathon said the center has the capacity for nearly three times the planned number of miners, giving ample scope for future expansion.

Persistence has built the back-end infrastructure for a trade finance system that will allow small and medium-sized buyers to more easily find financing for commodities purchased from sellers, traveling between the main trade hubs of Asia, places like Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, among others.      The startup closed a $3.7 million token round led by Arrington XRP, along with Alameda Research and South Korean stablecoin company Terra, among others. The backers are purchasing the Persistence token, or XPRT, which is set to be released sometime late this year or early next year, once macroeconomic conditions appear to be stabilized, said Persistence CEO Tushar Aggarwal.      ""Commodity trading is a notoriously difficult industry to penetrate,"" Aggarwal told CoinDesk in an interview, noting that other firms like Perlin and Centrifuge have already entered this space.      Persistence's advantage, Aggarwal said, lies less in its technology than in its business-development strategy.      To build an application that would appeal to companies outside of the blockchain industry, Persistence settled on Tendermint as its base layer, after investigating both Ethereum and Waves.      ""A big focus of ours is the institutional folks. On the institutional side we tried to abstract away some of the complexity,"" Aggarwal said.      Read more: Cosmos Gains Traction in India Amid Broader Crypto Resurgence      The specific trade finance platform was built as a separate application atop Persistence, called Comdex. That platform was turned over to a third party that already has access to the trade finance industry. Invoices get turned into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can then be collateralized to back loans.      ""Because it's driven by people who already have networks, you just accelerate the process,"" Aggarwal said.      Comdex's website shows its CEO is Uday Joshi, whose LinkedIn page shows that he has an additional role at Rhodium Resources. Joshi is also depicted in Rhodium's corporate brochure, which describes the firm as specializing in the ""physical trading of commodities and trade logistics,"" with access to more than $1 billion in trade financing credit lines.      Though only a testnet now, Aggarwal said that ""$41 million worth of commodities have been tokenized on-chain, which also represents the transaction volume.""      Because the XPRT token is not yet live, Comdex and Persistence are simply running the technology now and keeping track of the performance of the validators on the testnet, with redundancies built in to back up the chain in case there is some kind of failing.

42384912,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwxx,1602594793,COTI Launches Decentralized 'Fear Index' for DeFi Markets,"Enterprise-based fintech platform COTI has rolled out a decentralized crypto market volatility index (cVIX) to help investors assess and quantify risks.    Launched Tuesday, the cVIX is explicitly designed for the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.  The index is created by computing a decentralized volatility index from cryptocurrency option prices and utilizes the Ethereum-based oracle network Chainlink as a source for required financial data.  The cVIX is similar to the stock market's VIX index, which indicates the level of implied volatility, or investors' expectations of how volatile the equities would be over a specific period.  Such indexes are sometimes referred to as ""fear indexes"" because they often reflect the market's worries about the underlying asset.  The index will initially support trades and deposits in ether (ETH) and stablecoin tether (USDT) and add other tokens shortly.  Traders can hedge themselves against a potential rise in market volatility by taking a long position in the cVIX.  Similarly, traders positioned for a spike in volatility by employing option strategies such as straddles (a simultaneous long position in both a call and a put with the same strike prices) can hedge against market stagnation or low-volatility period by taking short positions in the CVIX.  Extreme readings on cVIX could be considered as contrary indicators. In traditional markets, a bull run often ends with record-low readings on VIX indicators.  ""cVIX can be used by liquidity providers who play the role of the insurance company and earn fees in the process. In the event of a trader buying a long or short on cVIX and losing the trade, liquidity providers are the ones to recoup the lost trade,"" the press release said.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/13/coti-launches-decentralized-fear-index-for-defi-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f12f5083c27ed44c71417765653a4f7f7e9c81d8-1920x1355.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlx1j,1602593164,First Mover: Stimulus Winning as Biden Surges in Polls and Bitcoin Eyes $12K,"The outcome of next month's U.S. presidential election may not matter much for bitcoin's price: Economic stimulus in the trillions of dollars is likely no matter who wins, bolstering the largest cryptocurrency's appeal as a hedge against inflation.      President Donald Trump over the past week has reversed his opposition to a new government-spending bill following April's $2 trillion coronavirus-aid package. He signaled his eagerness to strike a deal with leaders of the opposition Democratic party, who have proposed a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. According to Axios, he told senior lawmakers in his own Republican party that he wants ""a big deal.""      If Trump wins in November, he's likely to continue supporting stimulus spending or easy monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, given his four-year track record of jawboning the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates whenever signs of weakness appear, while boasting about U.S. jobs growth and stock market increases. He also could push for a new round of tax cuts.      Trump's Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, has already rolled out his own $5.4 trillion agenda that includes increased budget allocations for education, housing, health care, paid leave and fixing crumbling infrastructure, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Biden campaign has pledged to cancel a substantial portion of Americans' $1.5 trillion in federal student debt.      Such expenses would come on top of what already seems like an unending sea of red ink: The U.S. government's budget deficit for the 2020 fiscal year tripled to $3.1 trillion. And economists say the Federal Reserve is likely to keep printing money in coming years to help finance the budget gap.      ""Because the economy's hands are tied and policymakers' hands are tied, the wiggle room that any party in power is going to have is limited,"" said Chris Wallis, chief investment officer of Vaughan Nelson Investment Management, a division of the French financial firm Natixis, told First Mover in a Zoom interview. ""There's no atheists in a foxhole. Nobody is going to worry about deficits.""      Wall Street analysts have debated in recent weeks whether a Trump or Biden victory would be better for stocks. What's good for bitcoin might be easier to pinpoint, since most digital-asset market analysts say the Federal Reserve's $3 trillion of freshly printed money this year has helped to push up prices for the largest cryptocurrency.      The upshot? For voters, it's a choice between Trump and Biden. But bitcoin might be a winner either way.      Read More: Bitcoiners Have Trillions and Trillions of Reasons to Ignore US Election    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin bulls are taking a breather, having powered gains for the sixth consecutive day on Monday. That's the longest daily winning run since August 2019.      The momentum is likely to continue as the growing institutional participation highlighted by the payment company Square's recent $50 million investment in bitcoin has bolstered investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.      Technical charts have turned bullish with the cryptocurrency's convincing move above the Sept. 18 high of $11,200.      Last, open interest in futures listed on major exchanges across the globe has increased by 20% alongside a rally in prices. Futures trading volume also doubled to $14 billion on Monday.      A rise in open interest and volumes alongside an increase in prices is said to validate the uptrend. In other words, the latest bullish move has legs.      ""The probability of bitcoin rising to $14,000 from current levels is stronger than the odds of a decline to $10,500,"" Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Eyes $12K After 6-Day Streak of Gains    Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Cryptocurrency rallies after Grayscale (owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group) announces that Ethereum Trust has become SEC reporting company.

42384909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwvR,1602590519,Serena Williams Looks to Have Dropped Coinbase Investment After Activism Row,"Tennis superstar and investor Serena Williams may have shed her stake in popular U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.      As reported by Business Insider late on Monday, the website of Williams' venture firm no longer displays Coinbase among its portfolio firms.      Serena Ventures – a company launched in secret in 2014 – first listed the investment in Coinbase in April of last year. Williams also tweeted about the investment at the time.      ""Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity,” the tweet read.      If indeed her VC firm has divested its stake in Coinbase, it may come as the result of a recent statement from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who effectively banned employee activism at the exchange and said the firm would focus solely on its financial mission.      As CoinDesk reported, Armstrong started planning the company's non-activist position after several Coinbase engineers protested this summer after the CEO refused to publicly say that “Black lives matter,"" though he did tweet that (in all caps) soon after. Polarizing political conversations in company chat rooms were also said to have influenced the decision.      Armstrong saw a mix of support and criticism for his apolitical stance following the announcement.      Staff unhappy to stay on that basis were offered severance packages by Coinbase, and perhaps 5% of employees have taken that offer in recent weeks.      It's not clear how much money Serena Ventures had invested in the exchange.

42384914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlx0T,1602587246,Bitcoin Eyes $12K Price After 6-Day Streak of Gains,"Bitcoin's six-day run of gains has shifted the focus to the psychological hurdle of $12,000. Some analysts are looking even higher.    Bitcoin closed up for the sixth consecutive day on Monday, confirming its longest daily winning trend since August 2019, CoinDesk data shows.  The cryptocurrency has rallied from $10,500 to $11,700 since last Wednesday.  According to eToro market analyst Simon Peters, the upward move is likely to continue.  Payment company Square's foray into bitcoin has boosted investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects and got the community wondering which other companies could potentially be next, he said.  Technical bias, too, has turned bullish with the cryptocurrency's convincing move above resistance at $11,250.  Peters, however, warned that some consolidation may be seen before a move to $12,000, as the cryptocurrency looks overbought in the short-term.  ""There is every chance we could see a little dip (hopefully staying above $11,000). But the best case is for range play at current levels followed by a run to $12K in the coming days/weeks,"" Peters told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has come under pressure in the past 12 hours, falling from $11,723 to $11,450.  With the pullback, the hourly chart relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back into underbought (bullish) territory below 70.  Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, believes there is scope for a bigger bullish move in the near term.  ""The probability of bitcoin rising to $14,000 from current levels is stronger than the odds of a decline to $10,500,"" Heusser told CoinDesk in a Twitter message.  Supporting the bullish case is the pick up in open interest and trading volumes for futures listed on major exchanges.  Global open positions or open interest increased to $4.3 billion on Monday – the highest level since Sept. 2, according to data source Skew.  Open interest has risen by nearly 20% so far in October.  Meanwhile, futures trading volume doubled to $14 billion on Monday to hit the highest level since Sept. 21.  A rise in open interest and trading volumes alongside a rise in price is said to confirm an uptrend.  However, upside may be capped near $12,000, as there are large sell orders placed around that level on the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and some Asian platforms, according to Heusser.

42384906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwsv,1602585010,Your Wallet in 2030 Will Be Full of Free Money,"Ten years ago, humanity wrestled with a generational crisis named COVID-19. In the wake of the pandemic and its cataclysmic fallout, seismic changes occurred and a wellspring of ideas burst forth.      The weaknesses of our society laid bare, people were freed to think differently about the social contract. Conversations around the function of money and who controlled its minting began, triggered by the unprecedented money printing provoked by the pandemic.    Yoni Assia is the founder and CEO of eToro, the world’s largest social investment network, and the Founder of GoodDollar.org, a non-profit to enable basic income via blockchain technologies. This post is part of Internet 2030, a series exploring the future of technology and the digital economy.    People began asking questions. If an international emergency could motivate governments to fire up the printing machines, where does money come from? If it’s so simple to give money away, why isn’t it going straight to people? Why did people pay tax in the first place? And why were banks benefiting from discounted currency before transferring interest costs to the plebeians?      What started as a murmur of disquiet grew into a crescendo of discontent: Why should these institutions dictate how money is issued and who benefits from its trickle down distribution? As economic shockwaves precipitated humanitarian catastrophes throughout the world, the systemic corruption was painfully exposed, making the case for bold new ideas. How could money be more fair, transparent and free?      See also: DeFi Meets Universal Basic Income With Just-Launched Project From eToro    Universal basic income    Ten years on, money is free. The last decade has been one of profound change and digital innovation. No, we are not all living in the lap of luxury – the wheels of industry continue to turn, work remains to be done, people still seek employment. However, just as the internet made information free, technology has served to make money more freely available and immune from vested interests.      Over two decades ago, Bitcoin introduced the notion of permissionless digital currency that exists beyond the purview of central banks and nation states. It’s the antithesis of a monolithic legacy system whose integrity had been eroding for centuries. In 2030, non-government, internet money has become the norm. A plethora of digital currencies and assets have permeated the mainstream and become the world’s de facto money.      People around the world hold digital wallets that support various virtual currencies – bitcoin, protocol tokens, fiat-pegged stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) – in our multi-currency future. Money is no longer monolithic; different currencies serve different needs and use cases.      Cash’s instant settlement properties exist in the digital realm and competition has served to reduce fees and lower barriers throughout the world. What’s more, the immutable, auditable nature of blockchain means that modern CBDCs are major upgrades on the fiat standard of old. People buy goods and services, save and invest via their digital wallets, seamlessly moving between digital currencies in the “back end,” the blockchain experience finally obfuscated.    By freeing money, we have repaired democracy, and are moving closer to a world whose financial system is more free, accessible and fundamentally fair.    Governments and financial institutions have recognized that they cannot ignore financial innovation, and must embrace digital currency in order to compete. In fact, much of the value and innovation over the past decade has come from countries willing to experiment by merging the best elements of centralized and decentralized finance, resulting in fully digital systems that create greater access to the financial system.      Change wasn’t an option, it was a necessity: Conventional “trickle-down” economics perpetuated inequality, limited prosperity and rewarded only those with capital.      Even before the coronavirus-led mass unemployment and societal unrest, vast labor market shifts and widening inequality forced authorities to look closely at basic income initiatives. Slowly but surely, governments realized the vast majority of citizens didn’t have enough money in their accounts to get through the month, forestalling economic growth for all. The days of the global central banking cabal were numbered.      Furlough schemes and “helicopter money” cemented the basic income concept in the minds of many, who began to demand governmental cartels break away from outmoded Keynesian economic models and better serve the citizens to whom they were, after all, answerable.      See also: Frances Coppola – How Central Banks Could Use Digital Cash to Deliver Universal Basic Income    Human-centric capitalism    In 2030, monetary power has shifted towards the individual. The popularization of digital currency has accompanied further advances in digital sovereignty and digital identity. Where in the past countries expanded by waging conflict, now they compete for human attention and loyalty. When the nature and ownership of money changes, so do the incentive structures and business models.      Web 3.0 technologies coupled with sound money have gradually altered incentive structures in popular services such as Google and Facebook, with platforms now paying the people to use them. This was an unthinkable notion 10 years ago, when tech giants tracked our every movement and action and built multi-billion dollar businesses off the back of data-driven advertising.      Like governments, the tech giants have fallen into line. We are no longer the products, we are the clients.    What the future of money looks like    The future of money – which is to say the money we use in 2030 – is indelibly inscribed on-chain and distributed globally at scale. Free movement of money is no longer a pipe dream, it’s a reality. Ten years isn’t a long time, but already it’s difficult to believe that we once trusted the walled gardens of central banks to control the money flow. We reflect with naivete that we once expected powerful elites and kleptocrats to manage money and reduce inequality.      As the source of our money has become much more distributed, as transparency of issuance, allocation and use has become the norm, as the physical and digital worlds have integrated more closely, and as governmental overreach has been checked, our financial system has become a hub of innovation. Money flows to people from multiple sources, including governments, corporations and decentralized autonomous organizations of people and communities. It empowers monetary entrepreneurship, driving further growth and financial opportunities.      Through breaking the monopoly on money, new incentive systems and entrepreneurism has flourished, particularly in the developing world. By freeing money, we have repaired democracy and are moving closer to a world whose financial system is more free, accessible and fundamentally fair. A new age of enlightenment has begun, and contemplation of the days and decades that stretch tantalizingly before us no longer inspires dread. It inspires hope.

42384910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwuB,1602583932,The Securities Clarity Act Is Simple and Logical (and Bad News for Lawyers Like Me),"On Sept. 24, 2020, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced a bill called the Securities Clarity Act “to provide a path to regulatory certainty for digital assets and other emerging technologies under securities law.” Unlike previous attempts at crypto-friendly federal legislation, I believe the Securities Clarity Act deserves support from the crypto community at large, for the following reasons.      The Securities Clarity Act does two things:      1. It defines an “investment contract asset” as:    an asset, whether tangible or intangible, including assets in digital form— (A) sold or otherwise transferred, or intended to be sold or otherwise transferred, pursuant to an investment contract; and (B) that is not otherwise a security [under section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933].    2. It includes the following language in all applicable legislative definitions of a security:    The term ""security"" does not include an investment contract asset.    That’s it.      That’s the whole bill.    The Securities Clarity Act is technology- and asset-agnostic    The Securities Clarity Act doesn’t care if your digital asset is on the Bitcoin network, the Ethereum network or any other blockchain network. In fact, it doesn’t even apply strictly to digital assets. Just as the tracts of farmland with orange groves in SEC v. W. J. Howey Co. (which gave us the HoweyTest, the default way to determine whether something is an “investment contract”) weren’t securities, unless they have special characteristics, any other assets sold or transferred pursuant to “investment contracts” would not be considered securities under the Securities Clarity Act.    The Securities Clarity Act is not overly broad    Previous federal legislative and regulatory “blockchain initiatives” (including the Token Taxonomy Act and the Token Safe Harbor) have been far too broad, in my opinion, effectively carving out special exceptions for sales of digital assets that might otherwise be considered securities transactions and asserting that “securities laws don’t apply because ... well, blockchain.” These efforts have been further complicated by relying on technical concepts like “distributed digital ledger” and “decentralization” as part of their framework. Even in our own industry, there is often a lot of confusion as to the correct meaning of “decentralization.” Do we really want federal judges and bureaucrats to tell us what it means?    The Securities Clarity Act doesn’t change the application of the Howey Test    One of the greatest things about the HoweyTest, at least in my opinion, is its flexibility. The Securities Clarity Act doesn’t change that. For example, even if the Securities Clarity Act had been adopted and in effect at all relevant times, the recent federal court ruling that Kik's token sale violated U.S. securities law would not have come out any differently. The act does not try and address the token sales that were the subject of the case, just the status of the tokens themselves.      Read more: Grant Gulovsen - Masternodes in Legal Limbo as Regulators Fail to Act      Although KIN tokens would be considered “investment contract assets” under the Act (and therefore not securities, since the KIN tokens themselves do not have the features of stock, debt or other types of enumerated securities in the Securities Act of 1933), under the facts of the case, Kik told token buyers that KIN would increase in value if Kik raised enough money from the sale of KIN to build and launch the Kin ecosystem. If that’s not promoting “an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits from the efforts of others” then I don’t know what is.    Winners and losers    As with all federal legislation, there will be winners and losers if the Securities Clarity Act becomes law.      First, cryptocurrency exchanges would be the biggest winners because their analysis of whether a given digital asset is (or is not) a “security” would become much more straightforward. It would be, “Does the digital asset itself (separate from the manner in which it was sold) resemble any of the more traditional types of securities listed in the Securities Act?” If not, then the digital asset will not be a “security.”    But that’s okay, because the crypto industry has been very good to me the past few years. If I lose some business because of the passage of this bill, I am in no position to complain.    Second, sellers of digital assets would also win because it would be easier to get tokens listed on exchanges (although as the Kik example above shows, just because a seller’s tokens aren’t securities, doesn’t mean that the seller wasn’t still offering investment contracts and – if those offers were made to the general public without registration or an available exemption – then those transactions would violate the Securities Act of 1933).      And three, because sellers of digital assets would have a much easier time getting their tokens listed on exchanges, the biggest losers under the Securities Clarity Act would be lawyers – such as myself – whose practice includes drafting opinion letters for token issuers who seek to have their tokens listed on exchanges.      But that’s okay, because the crypto industry has been very good to me the past few years. If I lose some business because of the passage of this bill, I am in no position to complain. Following the legal one-two punch suffered by crypto over the past few weeks (i.e., the previously mentioned Kik decision and the filing of federal charges against BitMEX for attempting to evade U.S. regulations), our industry desperately needs clarity and this bill, if adopted, would go a long way in achieving that.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Grant Gulovsen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/13/the-securities-clarity-act-is-simple-and-logical-and-bad-news-for-lawyers-like-me,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f9e98cbac1e68519ac39ca483e3f74c63ac341a-2250x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital pass will use ""sophisticated cryptographic techniques"" in order to verify individuals' health statuses while ensuring the underlying data does not become public, the company said.  Users can manage their information through an encrypted smartphone wallet app, according to the project's website.  They can load health results, such as COVID-19 tests, by scanning a QR code into the app, which can then be viewed by parties with access to the user's data.

42384897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlwf5,1602579600,Bitcoiners Have Trillions and Trillions of Reasons to Ignore US Election,"The outcome of next month's U.S. presidential election may not matter much for bitcoin's price: Economic stimulus in the trillions of dollars is likely no matter who wins, bolstering the largest cryptocurrency's appeal as a hedge against inflation.      President Donald Trump over the past week has reversed his opposition to a new government spending bill following April's $2 trillion coronavirus-aid package. He signaled his eagerness to strike a deal with leaders of the opposition Democratic party, who have proposed a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. According to Axios, he told senior lawmakers in his own Republican party that he wants ""a big deal.""      If Trump wins in November, he's likely to continue supporting stimulus spending or easy monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, given his four-year track record of jawboning the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates whenever signs of weakness appear, while boasting about U.S. jobs growth and stock-market increases. He also could push for a new round of tax cuts.      Trump's Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, has already rolled out his own $5.4 trillion agenda that includes increased budget allocations for education, housing, health care, paid leave and fixing crumbling infrastructure, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Biden campaign has pledged to cancel a substantial portion of Americans' $1.5 trillion in federal student debt.      Such expenses would come on top of what already seems like an unending sea of red ink: The U.S. government's budget deficit for the 2020 fiscal year tripled to $3.1 trillion. And economists say the Federal Reserve is likely to keep printing money in coming years to help finance the budget gap.      ""Because the economy's hands are tied and policymakers' hands are tied, the wiggle room that any party in power is going to have is limited,"" said Chris Wallis, chief investment officer of Vaughan Nelson Investment Management, a division of the French financial firm Natixis, said in a Zoom interview. ""There's no atheists in a foxhole. Nobody is going to worry about deficits.""      Wall Street analysts have debated in recent weeks whether a Trump or Biden victory would be better for stocks. What's good for bitcoin might be easier to pinpoint, since most digital-asset market analysts say the Federal Reserve's $3 trillion of freshly printed money this year has helped to push up prices for the largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is up 63% year-to-date, versus 9.4% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks.      Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist for the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley, told CNBC on Monday that ""no matter who wins the election, by the first quarter we'll have an additional stimulus that's probably still required to make sure that the recovery continues.""      Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson wrote Monday in a report that the next relief bill isn't likely to come until early February, but ""stimulus is coming, and the longer it is delayed, the bigger it will be,"" and the more likely the Fed finances the extra costs.      ""It almost seems like the market doesn't really care who wins at all,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote last week in a note to clients. ""All investors care about is stimulus, which both parties seem willing to provide amply.""      There's a long way to go before the economy recovers. Some 12.6 million Americans were unemployed at the end of September, more than double the number early this year, prior to the pandemic. And now some health experts are warning of a new wave of coronavirus cases, which could dampen consumer confidence or result in new lockdown measures that might crimp output.      Any costs to jolt the economy out of its doldrums might be separate from the ever-growing list of investments needed to address nagging environmental and social concerns.      According to a report last month by the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, some $110 trillion of investments could be needed by 2050 to wean energy production off of carbon-intensive fuels. That works out to about $3.7 trillion a year.      There's also the prospect of costs to reduce racial injustices. Aside from the basic unfairness of practices like redlining, voter suppression and profiling by police, institutionalized racism hurts U.S. economic potential by limiting opportunities ""for a large number of Americans,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic argued in a speech last month. A study cited by Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson put the estimated cost of slavery reparations at $14 trillion.      Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has made no secret of his stance that the government needs to ramp up spending to fuel the recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession. In a speech last week, Powell said that without more aid, households and businesses would experience rising ""insolvencies,"" which could harm ""the productive capacity of the economy.""      Fitch, the bond-rating firm, wrote Monday in a report that voters consider the economy to be the top issue in the 2020 election, and that a stimulus package of about $1 trillion or more is likely whoever wins.      If the federal government doesn't ply the economy with trillions of dollars of spending, traditional stock and bond markets could quickly sell off. And such a dry-up in market ""liquidity"" might force the Fed to increase its monthly asset purchases or provide new forms of emergency lending. Currently, the Fed is buying $120 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage securities a month, a pace that works out to $1.44 trillion a year.      ""This cycle has needed central bank liquidity support on an unprecedented scale, and will need substantial additional liquidity support, if for whatever reason the global recovery is knocked off course,"" Deutsche Bank Chief International Strategist Alan Ruskin wrote last week in a report.

For voters, it's a choice between Trump and Biden. But bitcoin might be a winner either way.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/13/bitcoiners-have-trillions-and-trillions-of-reasons-to-ignore-us-election,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The free digital currency is destined to be spent at 3,389 stores set up to handle the electronic means of payment as part of China's latest test, and promotion, of its national digital currency.  The Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), as it is known, has been given no definitive timeline for its launch but a giveaway in Shenzhen may signify efforts by China's central bank to ratchet up its plans.  One obstacle for obtaining the nation's digital yuan requires users to open a digital wallet, which has raised concerns over how children and the elderly can participate.  As cited in AsiaOne's report, an unidentified user said the digital currency was a ""litmus test"" for the ""new economy"" with the potential to unseat the U.S. dollar’s role as the dominant global currency.

As announced in a recent press statement, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) aims to use the platform to create, share and amend documents with other supply-chain participants to reduce complexities in its shipping processes.  TradeLens will assist CP's intermodal shippers to share documents with other participants in the supply chain including consignees, beneficial cargo owners, customs agencies, dray operators and shipping lines.  ""Global shipping is a profoundly complex business and TradeLens is improving the information-sharing processes that support the industry,"" CP Vice President and Chief Information Officer Mike Redeker said in the announcement.  TradeLens was jointly founded by IBM and Maersk in 2018 and is said to have more than 700 million events and six million individual documents processed annually.  In effect, the platform attempts to reduce the time it takes to process normally manual administrative tasks by deferring those tasks to automated digital procedures supported by blockchain tech.

42432924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO26rh,1602549794,"IMF, World Bank, G20 Countries to Create Central Bank Digital Currency Rules","International financial authorities and 20 of the world’s largest economies are establishing official standards for regulating and issuing sovereign digital currencies.      The Group of Twenty (G20) – an organization of finance ministers and central bank governors representing the European Union and 19 countries across every continent – said in a report Tuesday it is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to formalize the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in banking systems.      According to the report, by the end of 2022 the G20 members, the IMF, the World Bank and the BIS will have completed regulatory stablecoin frameworks and research and selection of CBDC designs, technologies and experiments.      Stablecoins are digital currencies that are often linked to physical currencies such as the U.S. dollar. The IMF and the World Bank will have the technical capabilities to facilitate CBDC transactions involving the countries by the end of 2025, the report said.      The countries will “examine the scope for new multilateral platforms, global stablecoin arrangements and central bank digital currencies to address the challenges that cross-border payments face without compromising on minimum supervisory and regulatory standards to control risks to monetary and financial stability,” said the G20 Financial Stability Board (FSB), a body formed after the 2008 financial crisis.    Multinational alliances    The G20 roadmap on stablecoins follows a joint report released by seven central banks last week through the BIS in sketching out a transnational front around nationalized digital currencies.      Last week's report, authored by the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), the Swiss National Bank, Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), outlined properties the central banks would require from CBDCs in their countries.      The North American, European and Japanese banks said CBDCs would need to be interchangeable with existing money forms and resemble cash in its ease of use in a swathe of payment types at little or no cost.      CBDC systems should also connect to legacy financial technologies, settle high volumes of transactions instantaneously around the clock, be impervious to cyberattacks and outages, and comply with regulations and monitoring that apply to money already in circulation and that retain central bank power, the report said.      CBDCs could improve cross-border payments, counter Facebook libra-like corporate digital currencies and transfer emergency fund payments to consumers during the coronavirus pandemic, the report said. But CBDCs would not be anonymous and self-running, the report said, diverging from the virtual currencies whose distributed ledger technology they would borrow.      Bitcoin transactions run on a blockchain network that masks and silos personal data from central actors, while central banks would maintain access and visibility into CBDC payments and identities.      The ECB and the BOJ also stated this month they were looking into issuing CBDCs. An ECB report said a decision to issue a digital euro would be announced next April. BOJ officials have said digital yen experiments are starting in the spring and called for a concerted effort to match China’s digital yuan, the most expansive central bank digital currency being trialed yet.
