42426670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvXh,1456872326,5 Blockchain Startups Join Plug and Play FinTech Incubator,"Bitcoin remittance company Abra is one of five startups working with blockchain technology to be accepted into the latest financial technology program operated by California startup incubator Plug and Play.  Abra, BlockNotary, BlockSeer, Skuchain and Token are the blockchain startups set to take part in the program, among a total of 23 participants.  Startups in the initiative will take part in mentoring sessions and pilot programs over the course of the three-month initiative.  The incubator draws support from a number of firms involved with blockchain-services or consortia devoted to exploring applications of the technology, including BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deloitte, Deutsche Bank, MUFG, Santander, Sumitomo, TD Bank, USAA and US Bank.  Scott Robinson, founder and director of Plug and Play FinTech, said in a statement:  ""With our latest additions of globally leading financial institutional partners, our ecosystem continues to scale with opportunities for growth on behalf of our startups both in Silicon Valley and in markets across the world.""  The selection of blockchain startups in the latest Plug and Play batch reflect the different use cases currently being explored for the technology. These include cross-border remittances, file notarization and trade finance.  1. Abra  Abra  leverages blockchain technology to merge money transfer and payments via a digital cash wallet that works globally. As with other digital currency wallet services, there is no bank or other institutional third party involved in managing, storing, sending or accepting funds.  Abra seeks to enable the purchase and storage of digital currency directly on the smartphone. The startup gets around the issue of lack of local exchanges in many parts of the world by building a network of so-called 'tellers' that will exchange users' digital currency for cash.  The firm closed a $12m Series A round, and has raised $14m in capital to date.  2. BlockNotary  BlockNotary's  'proof-of-existence' app is aimed at reducing the risk of copyright infringement by allowing users to upload any digital content from their mobile device and store a ""digital fingerprint"" of that content on the blockchain's immutable ledger.  Should it ever be required, the owner of the content can use that record to prove they possessed the file at a certain point in time.  BlockNotary is also working on 'Video Interview' – a blockchain-based know-your-customer (KYC) solution designed to ""help businesses reduce costs and risks by providing trustful and pleasant customer experience"".  3. BlockSeer  BlockSeer  is a data science company with a focus on blockchain analytics and forensics.  The startup aims to provide a vehicle for visualizing the flow and direction of bitcoin transactions, and in the past has highlighted the movement of stolen coins.  Its analysis toolshttps://www.blockseer.com/features are used by law enforcement, including the US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the firm says – along with legacy financial institutions.  4. Skuchain  Skuchain  says it has built ""patent-pending"" solutions using blockchain technology for supply chain and trade financing.  Aiming to drive efficiencies in the complex world of supply chain, the startup plans to enable ""collaborative commerce with innovative supply chain finance and inventory tracking"".  To that end, it has come up with a concept of ""smart locks with digital keys"" that are known as 'brackets' (a loose acronym for 'Blockchain-based Release of funds that Are Conditionally Key-signed and Triggered by Signals'). These brackets mean that, when certain agreements are met, the funds move automatically.  As well as making currently existing financial instruments faster and cheaper, brackets can introduce brand new instruments too, Skuchain says.  5. Token  Designed by a team of bankers and tech experts for ""compliance and compatibility"", Token is working on creating a bank-hosted payment system specifically designed for use in the digital era.  The firm's software is claimed to be able to ""mitigate the security risks of allowing third-party providers accessing a bank's infrastructure"".  It combines smart tokenization with public-key cryptography, open protocols and developer APIs.

42426659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvFh,1456852990,ISITC: Majority of Securities Firms Plan to Explore Blockchain This Year,"A new survey by the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC) has revealed that the current buzz around blockchain is driving a focus on technological investment within the financial sector.  ISITC  is an industry trade group focused on standards and efficiencies in securities transaction processing. It boasts hundreds of member companies from across the globe, including major institutions such as BNY Mellon, Citibank, JPMorgan and more.  In its annual survey, which polled 45 member firms from a variety of areas within financial services, the association says it set out to examine perspectives on the industry’s ""progress and focus"" for 2016. The findings revealed that 62% of firms see investment in technology as a main area of focus for 2016–2017, with an interest in both blockchain and cybersecurity technology cited as driving factors.  Specifically, ISITC says, 55% of firms are monitoring, researching or already developing solutions for blockchain technology. A hefty 74% of firms also mentioned specific plans for investment aimed at improving cybersecurity – a climb from 57% last year.  As evidence of the new interest in FinTech, 62% of firms saids investment in infrastructure is an area of operational focus for 2016, possibly driven by the need to reduce costs – a factor that 80% see as the biggest challenge in the next year.  'Disruptive technologies'  Blockchain tech has widely been viewed as a way for a number of financial sectors to drive new efficiencies, as well as reduce crimes like fraud given the transparent and immutable nature of the technology.  ""New and emerging technologies have taken the financial services industry by storm,"" said Jeff Zoller, chair of ISITC and vice president at US investment firm T Rowe Price, adding:  ""The results of our annual member survey confirm this sentiment, as firms plan increased investment in blockchain and cybersecurity technologies, as a method for combating long-term risk and cost.""  The CEO of ISITC Europe, Nigel Solkhon, recently spoke to CoinDesk in interview, saying that he believes that the current interest and investment in blockchain tech among financial firms will reveal its impact in just 12 to 18 months.  The association has also announced that the theme of new technology and innovation disrupting the financial services industry will be the primary topic at the ISITC 22nd Annual Industry Forum and Vendor Show, taking place on 20th-23rd March, at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel.

42426663,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvLh,1456849988,Japanese Legislator Calls for Bitcoin Tax Exemption,"A legislator in Japan’s ruling political party has called for bitcoin purchases to be exempt from an 8% consumption tax, a regional news source says.  The issue was up for debate during a budgetary committee hearing in the lower house of the Japanese legislature, the Diet, on 5th February. As reported by Nikkei, Liberal Democratic Party member Tsukasa Akimoto put the question of exempting bitcoin purchases from the tax to Finance Minister Tarō Asō.  ""Can't you consider not imposing consumption tax on bitcoins in line with the international trend?"" Akimoto asked.  Asō is reported to have defended the country's tax policy by saying that “Japan is not alone” in taxing bitcoin purchases.  The debate comes as Japan pushing ahead with what appears to be a policy drive to regulate digital currencies, as well as the business sector that has grown up around the technology.  A draft regulatory proposal prepared last year by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) indicates that Japanese regulators are looking at tightening data reporting requirements for exchanges.  Most recently, Japanese regulators have begun exploring the idea of regulating digital currencies in the same class as government-issued currencies.  A proposal will reportedly be submitted to the Diet for consideration later this year. However, when reached for comment, the FSA, the country’s top financial services regulator, told CoinDesk that ""nothing has been decided yet"" in terms of any concrete proposals.  These moves have taken place in the wake of the collapse of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that declared bankruptcy in early 2014 and whose CEO is currently under police detention in connection with an ongoing fraud investigation.

42426653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvv3h,1456847409,Bank of America Latest to Conduct Blockchain Trade Finance Trial,"Bank of America has revealed it is developing a blockchain-based trial centered on trade finance.  The move is the latest that finds the multinational banking institution seeking to position itself as an early adopter of the technology. In late December, Bank of America revealed it had filed a rush of new patents related to the industry, a development that followed the November news it had partnered with consortium startup R3.  Financial News reports that Bank of America believes blockchain could come to replace the more manual processes that dominate global trade.  Jason Tiede, head of innovation for global transaction services at Bank of America, told the news outlet:  ""We are working on a pilot in the trade finance space. As trade finance often relies on manual, paper-based processes, it serves as an interesting use case of the value of digitising an asset on a distributed ledger.""  Notably, the project is being developed with another unnamed bank, outside of R3. Tiede suggested Bank of America’s pilot could be completed by this spring.  With the announcement, Bank of America joins Standard Chartered and Development Bank Singapore (DBS) as major banks that are seeking to apply blockchain technology for use in trade finance. Both Standard Chartered and DBS are currently working on a Ripple-based solution they aim to commercialize following successful testing.

42426658,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvDh,1456842634,Microsoft Certifies Ethereum Offering in Blockchain Service First,"BlockApps, a startup providing Ethereum blockchain software for enterprises, has become the first certified offering on Microsoft Azure's Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) marketplace.  With its latest post, Microsoft also announced that asset exchange provider AlphaPointhttps://alphapoint.com/technology.html and Internet-of-Things micropayments startup IOTA have joined its Azure BaaS platform.  Launched in October, Microsoft has been steadily adding providers to its blockchain testing environment for enterprises, though BlockApps' Strato platform is the first to gain certification.  Calling the news ""a watershed moment"", Marley Gray, director of blockchain strategy at Microsoft, saidhttps://consensys.net/static/BlockAppsonAzureMarketplace.pdf:  ""The simple, rapid and flexible one-click deploy of Ethereum blockchain architecture launched on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace enables enterprises and developers to quickly deploy a certified blockchain environment on Azure.""  Gray added that he believes the offering will expedite enterprise blockchain development, as it enables enterprises to develop proofs-of-concept (PoCs) and scale to full production systems.  Key milestone  The IT giant recently told CoinDesk that it plans for the Azure BaaS platform to scale up into a ""certified blockchain marketplace"" by this spring, with the aim of supporting ""every blockchain"" in its currently available testing environment on Azure.  BlockApps' Strato provides a single-node blockchain instance, which acts as a developer sandbox for testing Ethereum blockchain applications. The product can also connect applications to private and public Ethereum blockchains using a company API.  On the technical side, the product features adjustable consensus formation algorithms and transaction verification rules, such as instant, round-robin signature pool and proof-of-work and proof-of-stake transaction approval.  The company claims Strato can enable app development in just minutes when used in conjunction with Bloc – a web application development kit supporting the core features of the Ethereum Solidity smart contract language.  Gray has previously said that by this spring, blockchain startups will be eligible to undergo a more serious security vetting for certification.

42426664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvNh,1456827413,D+H: 2016 Will See Blockchain Solutions Reach Banking Consumers,"DH Corporation (D+H), a Canada-based provider of technology solutions to financial institutions, recently announced the integration of a proprietary blockchain solution with its payments hub, Global PAYplus.  The move makes D+H the latest payments vendor to carry out a blockchain integration. Following similar announcements by Dwolla, Earthport and PayCommerce, the developments can be viewed as a tipping point that finds blockchain moving from innovation labs and into real-world implementations.  For example, the Global PAYplus platform already integrates different payment types, currencies and systems into a single payments hub providing for large numbers of immediate payments – and D+H may soon offer 'blockchain' as a payment method alongside more conventional alternatives.  The advantages offered by blockchain and ""virtual ledger"" technologies, said Moti Porath, D+H's executive vice president of global pre-sales, are that they enable banks to simplify and reduce the costs associated with clearing, and can further ""achieve objectives related to immediate payments"".  It was that potential for fast transactions, he said, that drove D+H to become an early adopter of the technology:  ""We believe that 2016 will see banks transitioning from experimenting in the innovation labs to implementing solutions that drive value to their customers. At this time, we see the most relevance for blockchain capabilities in payments, so it made sense to move quickly to add capabilities to our global payments hub.""  While the blockchain integration is still not yet being used for live payments, Porath told us that the firm is currently in ""discussions and trials with certain customers"".  Though unable to divulge the names of these clients, he expressed the hope that significant news announcements would be made in the near future.  Blockchain node as central bank  Adding a blockchain solution demonstrates that Global PAYplus is ""adaptable to blockchain technology"", Porath said, and, further, that the technology is integrated to meet evolving peer-to-peer client payment needs.  He framed the project as a means for banks to streamline the process for conducting, operating and delivering payments, saying:  ""These institutions will be able to utilize a secure, closed loop, distributed ledger system to connect bank networks, move money in real-time, and improve access to liquidity.""  The firm's blockchain integration supports credit and debit transfers, as well as returns and rejections, and is best suited for immediate payment clearing schemes and inter-branch transfers, according to Porath.  The only precondition is that members of the scheme are operating as a private network, he added.  Going into the detail of how the system works, the D+H executive said that it establishes a node in the network that acts as a liquidity pool, with various liquidity pool accounts being funded by real external transfer (using SWIFT, for example).  ""The liquidity pool node simulates accounts in a central bank and, when value is exchanged and the blocks are being updated, the 'central bank' node is updated to reflect the exchange of value,"" he explained.  DIY effort  Notably, D+H formed a partnership with Ripple last October, aiming to deliver ""innovative payment capabilities"", although this latest blockchain product integration was fully built in-house.  The new multi-chain, private blockchain solution was built using open standards, and can provide access to ""any number"" of real-time gross settlement systems, Porath told CoinDesk.  Explaining why the company didn't use Ripple or another pre-existing blockchain solution, he expressed the firm's belief that there is a strong market for distributed ledger technology in a closed private network as opposed to a large open network.  ""If the technology is used in conjunction with a payments hub, it can provide a more secured environment and faster, more efficient money transfer and clearing,"" he said. ""At the same time, it [maintains] the privacy of the participants in the transaction.""  Providing a solution that adheres to regulatory requirements, such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, was also a factor.  Advice to the industry  Notably, D+H released recently a white paper, setting out five key principles the company believes the banking industry needs to get right with regard to blockchain.  The firm said it is ""encouraged"" by the potential positive impacts of blockchain on the payments industry, but warned that banks must be careful to address its five points in order for blockchain to fully realize its potential.  Key considerations in the paper include finding and addressing the right problem, and retaining the transformative potential of the technology.  ""If the past year was an era of experimentation and innovation for banks with regard to blockchain, then the year ahead could be the time we see this technology emerge from banks' back rooms to solve real business problems,"" said Porath in the paper, adding:  ""However, the technology must get certain things right in order to deliver on its transformative promise.""
