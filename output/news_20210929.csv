I always say it wants clarity. But it also does not want to be treated as a monolith,” Haun told CNBC’s Kate Rooney during the annual Delivering Alpha investor summit hosted by the business television network. A16z raked in $2.2 billion in June to launch its third crypto fund, the largest crypto-related fund to date.  Haun, a former federal prosecutor who created the U.S. government’s first cryptocurrency task force, said regulators “need to assess the fact that we’re beyond just financial use cases” in crypto, and regulation “can not be one size fits all.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission “has a place in this industry to regulate large portions of the industry. No question about that. There are increasingly larger portions of the industry that I don’t think fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction [that] might well fall under other regulatory bodies’ jurisdiction,” Haun said.  Asked to rate the performance of Gary Gensler, Haun declined to assign a grade to the SEC chairman. She reiterated her view that there’s a need for “even application” regarding regulations and said she remains “hopeful” that can happen under Gensler.  Haun serves on the board of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and noted that the company filed to go public, the “absolute pinnacle” of regulation, and was still subject to SEC criticism. Last week, Coinbase dropped plans to launch a crypto lending product after the SEC threatened to sue.  “I think there is a sense on the part of some in the industry that those who were trying to make good faith efforts, who were going above and beyond in terms of compliance and what they thought was required … are the ones that are being examined under the microscope,” said Haun.  In recent weeks, Gensler said that most crypto trading platforms need to register with the SEC, and referred to stablecoins as “poker chips.” Earlier today, Gensler reiterated support for a narrow group of futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/sec-crypto-regulations-need-even-application-says-a16zs-katie-haun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c10f0e93b0a32b2433fc1714cbc10effd732c8b-2048x2109.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZmrL,1632951409,ConsenSys-Backed Palm Blockchain to Host DC Comics NFT Drop,"Palm – a blockchain that is backed by blockchain technology company ConsenSys – scored a major win on Wednesday morning, announcing it will be home to a non-fungible token (NFT) drop from legendary comics publisher DC.  The NFTs will be “a thank you to its legion of loyal fans and an invitation to attend DC FanDome on Oct. 16,” a press release Palm shared with CoinDesk said, and conference attendees will be able to claim the NFTs for free.  Much like with the “Space Jam 2″ drop Palm hosted earlier in the year, collectors will also be able to claim a second NFT by sharing a social media link.  The release centers on five popular DC universe characters, including Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn. Each NFT will be a comic cover featuring one of the characters from one of three different rarity tiers.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Straith Schreder, executive creative director for Palm NFT Studio, said this will be the first of many DC-flavored drops:  “This is a long term partnership with DC with the goal of exploring how NFTs can shape the future of community-driven storytelling; to look at how digital objects can unlock experiences, and provide fans with a true stake in an evolving and complex comic book universe. In partnership with DC, Palm NFT Studio developed a large-scale drop to reward FanDome registration with art and future utility; designing the NFTs and creating the site, strategy and infrastructure behind the collection.”  Business development  While it seems that new NFT marketplaces and minting platforms are emerging every week, the competition is stiff and it’s increasingly difficult to stand out.  NFT collectors have demonstrated a willingness to hop between platforms, currencies and even different blockchains in pursuit of digital goods. As a result, the battle between issuers is being fought over intellectual property and licensing – whoever can secure well-known brands can also secure traffic and sales.  Despite being a relative newcomer to the market, Palm is claiming big brands. In July, the chain announced the launch of Space Jam 2-branded NFTs built in collaboration with the native Nifties marketplace.  Additionally, the chain is home to legendary British artist Damien Hirst’s “The Currency” – a run of 10,000 NFTs that can be redeemed for physical paintings.

Additionally, competitor chain Flow announced plans for National Football League collectible highlights today – a successor to its popular Top Shot NBA highlight collectible series.

42424540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2q9ph,1632950817,Pawn Your CryptoPunk: A New NFT DeFi Lending Market Blooms,"It’s like a pawn shop for NFTs.  A startup blockchain project called NFTfi is allowing users to borrow against their non-fungible tokens in a new project that sits at the nexus of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the red-hot NFT market.  NFTfi was created to allow users to mortgage their NFTs in exchange for other cryptocurrencies that can then be sold for cash. The service provides immediate liquidity to NFT holders who aren’t yet ready to part with their CryptoPunks or Bored Apes.  The new offering hints at the growing demand for DeFi applications as NFTs are bought by more people.  “NFTs are undoubtedly becoming a gateway into the DeFi space for mainstream audiences,” said Lauren Stephanian, a principal at Pantera Capital. “As new collectors become more active in the NFT market, they’ll seek new ways to leverage their assets through DeFi mechanisms like collateralized lending, fractionalized assets, staking and much more.”  Collateralized lending against NFTs joins a growing roster of services and derivatives products that various startups have rolled out to meet demand from traders. Other NFT derivatives projects include fractionalization platform Fractional, staking provider NFTx and cross-chain liquidity protocol Taker.  Once bought, NFTs are typically hard to use in a productive manner, unlike fungible tokens, which can be staked, lent out or otherwise put to work to generate yield.  “If you have a CryptoPunk and you need cash but don’t want to sell it, you can use it as collateral,” NFTfi co-founder Stephen Young told CoinDesk.  The loan can then be used in a variety of ways: converted into fiat, deployed into DeFi protocols or even used to buy more NFTs.  Determining the collateral value  The platform, which runs on the Ethereum network, allows anyone to make loans and set terms without an intermediary, similar to DeFi protocols Compound and Aave but using NFTs.  “The possibilities are endless when merging technologies,” said Daniela Henao, COO of Defy Trends, a crypto analytics company.  Borrowers could expect to get a loan amount of approximately 50% of the value of the NFT, with annualized interest rates typically ranging from 20% to 80%, depending on the desirability of the NFT. Lenders determine what they think is the fair value of the collateral, usually by looking at its recent sales history or the floor price of similar assets. The floor price is the lowest offer price at which an NFT from a particular series can be bought.  Once the terms are agreed by both parties, the NFT is transferred from the borrower’s wallet and into an escrow account, and a smart contract facilitates the loan. The lender is entitled to get back the underlying NFT if the borrower fails to return the loan and interest at the end of the term.  The company has done over $12 million in volume since launching in June 2020, said Young. The average loan size is $26,000 for the month, but the platform has already facilitated loans as high as $200,000. Default rates hover just below 20% and vary depending on the NFT.  Currently, loans are available in ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, or DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.  “There’s a few different types of people that use our service,” said Young. “Some are people who were really into NFTs last year and bought them with very little money. One of our users lost her job during [the coronavirus pandemic] and took out a loan to pay for expenses.”  Get pocket money, or double down  Young says other users of the service include university students putting up NFTs for pocket money, DeFi traders looking for liquidity to pay margin calls, and yield farmers (those trying to generate the highest returns possible from their assets) leveraging their NFTs to earn even higher rates using DeFi protocols.  CryptoPunks typically garner 18% APY for a lender, while a Bored Ape could fetch between 40% and 60% APY. Some loans have annualized interest rates as high as 100% or 150%.  However, some lenders may not be in it for the yield.  “A lot of the lenders actually want the NFTs, so they’re hoping the borrower will default,” explained Young. “Then they’re basically getting the NFT at a 50% discount.”  In February, the company raised a $890,000 investment round from venture capital firm CoinFund, a decentralized autonomous organization called The LAO and private investors including Dapper Labs CIO Roham Gharegozlou.  “In the future that we’re moving towards, meaningful interaction with NFTs will include not only gameplay or visual elements, but also financial components too, including those enabled by NFTfi’s expanding product suite,” Evan Feng, director of research at CoinFund, told CoinDesk.  Others view NFTs as a way for retail investors to get more involved with DeFi.  “DeFi has historically had a high barrier to entry due to the user experience gap, but NFTs are now offering a user-friendly entry point into popular DeFi use cases,” said Pantera’s Stephanian.  Of course, the project also highlights how the nascent but rapidly growing field of NFT derivatives could introduce leverage and more risk into an already volatile market – similar to the excessive lending and borrowing that has historically fueled asset-price bubbles in traditional markets.  “I see NFTs as internet-native property rights,” said Young. “You’re going to see value accrued to Internet property, and where there’s value, there’s finance.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/29/pawn-your-cryptopunk-a-new-nft-defi-lending-market-blooms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d7989606522c12cf4883655b64b573e82d62728-1000x644.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Wednesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated his support for futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds that would invest in futures contracts instead of the crypto itself, reports CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.  However, investors have not been quite as eager to plow into bitcoin futures-linked products. One bitcoin futures mutual fund has amassed only $15 million in assets two months after launch, according to a tweet from Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  For now, crypto markets are stabilizing after a volatile month. Some analysts expect trading volumes to rise in October.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $41,070, -1.5%  Ether (ETH), $2,793, -2.2%  S&P 500: +0.2%  Gold: $1,733, -1.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.527%  Bitcoin correlations  Over the past few months, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 stock index has risen. The recent sell-off across equities and cryptocurrencies encouraged some traders to reduce exposure to both assets, which are deemed to be risky.  Analysts are also concerned about rising inflation, which could stall the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic-induced recession of last year. For example, the rise in energy prices, considered volatile, has some analysts concerned about price instability. Slowing growth could present a headwind for equities and cryptocurrencies as investors position themselves for greater volatility and a reduction in monetary stimulus.  “Markets are getting comfortable with Fed tapering, which leads to bottoming in yields, steepening of the curve,” JPMorgan’s equity strategy team wrote in a Monday report, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting back on its bond purchases.  Unlike the S&P 500, bitcoin’s correlation with commodities continued to decline over the past few months, mostly due to the steady rise in oil and gas prices.  Funding rates remain neutral  Bitcoin funding rates have been neutral over the past few weeks, suggesting some caution in the futures markets as the spot BTC price oscillates in the $40,000-$50,000 range.  Funding rate refers to the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.  “Last week the funding rates climbed towards positive levels, but bitcoin’s momentum stopped in the middle of the week and the funding rates are now back below zero,” Arcane Research wrote in a report on Tuesday.  Further, the decline in BTC open interest (the number of calls and put option contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position) coupled with negative funding rates suggests that traders have been closing long positions following China’s crypto ban of last week, according to Arcane.  Bitcoin open interest rebound ahead?  Some analysts expect BTC open interest to recover, which typically occurs over the course of the month following expiration.  Last Friday, BTC had the largest options expiration since April. “This isn’t all too surprising, as quarter-end expirations tend to be larger than regular monthly expirations,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  Similar to prior expirations, BTC open interest and trading volume is expected to rebound. However, “if we don’t see that bounce, it could be a sign of continued market exhaustion,” Delphi Digital wrote.  Altcoin roundup  Ripple launches $250 million NFT fund: Ripple is launching a $250 million fund focused on exploring new ways to use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. The fund, unveiled Wednesday during Ripple’s XRPL developer summit, will aim to foster innovation in tokenization with a focus on NFTs. Ripple has been relatively absent so far from the NFT battleground, which has largely been dominated by Ethereum, with other ecosystems such as Solana also competing.  Algorand boosts smart contract performance with ‘Virtual Machine’ launch: On Wednesday, Algorand released a back-end upgrade to increase the computing power of Algorand-based applications, reported CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson. Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) will also make it easier for newcomers to develop programs atop the chain. AVM brings Algorand smart contract development “closer to the mental model” developers on other blockchains are used to, Chief Product Officer Paul Riegel told CoinDesk. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is widely used, with EVM-compatibility being a key way for new networks like Avalanche and others to gain steam.  R3 to launch a DeFi token: R3 announced its regulatory-friendly DeFi network and token – dubbed Obscuro – on Sept. 28 at this year’s CordaCon, R3′s annual developer summit, reported CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. The company later stressed that it would be a proof-of-concept, and a go-live date would be dictated by regulators. R3 is a startup that began with a consortium of banks trying to figure out how to use cryptocurrency.

The 12 relatively unknown options merchants accused of failing to register with the CFTC are New York-based, according to a Wednesday press release. The two companies that are accused of “making false and misleading claims of having CFTC registration and National Futures Association (NFA) membership”– Climax Capital FX and Digitalexchange24.com – are based in Texas and Arkansas, respectively.  The CFTC oversees derivatives markets rather than spot commodity markets. Rather than regulating commodities themselves, the CFTC regulates futures contracts and derivatives products like swaps.  The CFTC has traditionally taken more of a backseat role in crypto regulation than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but there are signs this might be changing as the two regulatory bodies jockey for power.  Earlier Wednesday, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay $1.25 million to settle charges with the CFTC after the regulator accused Kraken of failing to register as an FCM and offering illegal margined digital asset transaction services.  The CFTC also brought a high-profile suit against BitMEX, which it accused of offering U.S. customers leveraged and unlicensed crypto products. BitMEX agreed to pay a $100 million dollar fine to settle the civil charges.

42410970,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttQg,1632943434,China’s Bitcoin Ban May Be Bullish for DeFi – But Only Briefly,"A price rally for the native tokens of leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols came as no surprise after China tightened its crackdown on crypto trading, because DeFi trading platforms are, in theory, resistant to censorship  But according to Chinese DeFi founders, investors and legal experts, the bullish view on DeFi amid the ban on crypto-related activities could be short term, as they note that DeFi innovation in China will be killed in its infancy and capital flows from China to DeFi will gradually die down.  A Sept. 24 notice – which was co-signed by 10 Chinese government agencies, including the three main bodies of China’s judicial system – made it clear for the first time that China’s government forbids crypto-to-crypto trading and that individuals who live in China but work for offshore crypto exchanges are subject to legal prosecution. That set boundaries on what had previously been gray legal areas.  “The Sept 24 notice clarified the exercise of territorial jurisdiction over relevant employees from overseas virtual currency exchanges,” a note by Shanghai-based law firm Zhihe Partners published on Monday said. “By analogy, this territorial jurisdiction is also applicable to relevant employees based in China who work for decentralized finance (‘defi’) that has not established a legal entity.”  China’s authorities also warned crypto projects that have issued tokens that if their actual controllers are Chinese residents, it would be “necessary” to “carefully assess” new risks.  The crackdown prompted centralized exchange Huobi to begin to stop providing its service in China, and similarly, many Chinese DeFi projects are giving up their market in China, according to sources who agreed to speak to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject.  “Everyone is devastated,” one Chinese DeFi investor and project founder told CoinDesk. “Some good projects have moved overseas, and many WeChat groups for projects have disbanded in the past few days.”  “We are doing everything we can, but we still don’t know if it’s enough,” said a second DeFi founder, who told CoinDesk that their project is leaving the China market.  China-based projects won’t be the only ones that are suffering in the DeFi sector.  As over-the-counter (OTC) desks in China become more constrained, Bobby Lee, the former head of what was once the biggest bitcoin exchange in China, BTCC, pointed out any new capital flows into DeFi from the lucrative Chinese market will slow down.  OTC desks, which facilitate peer-to-peer trades, are a popular way for investors in China to buy and sell crypto, especially after China banned fiat-to-crypto transactions in 2013.  “The speed of any new capitals into DeFi will slow down in China,” the first DeFi investor said. “It’s like a water pipe that’s forced to become thinner … in that way, the latest crackdown in China is also having a major [negative] impact on DeFi.”  Nevertheless, some remain positive that the crackdown will be a bullish catalyst for DeFi in the long run.  DeFi tokens like UNI, PERP and DYDX all rose in price after the crackdown was announced.  Ben Yorke, vice president of marketing at decentralized exchange (DEX) WOO Network, which is powered by Taiwan-based market maker Kronos Research, said that the ban will mainly affect the retail money from China, because most institutional Chinese crypto traders have moved abroad already.  China’s latest ban, which aims to protect retail investors, according to Yorke, is likely to push more Chinese crypto OGs (original gangsters) who are overseas to look into the DeFi market.  According to a tweet from WOO Network on Tuesday, its daily trading volume has hit multiple all-time highs in the past few days. Yorke said the rapid growth is because Kronos is a liquidity provider for dYdX, a popular DEX that’s seeing an explosive growth on both its token’s value and trading volume in the wake of China’s ban.  “The regulation is fragmenting liquidity away from market leaders and pushing it into DeFi and tier two exchanges … this round of regulation … is making it less attractive for users to rely on being in legal gray areas,” Yorke said. “At the moment, DeFi seems like a proactive way to minimize custodial or platform risk.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | WOO,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING | WOO,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/29/chinas-bitcoin-ban-may-be-bullish-for-defi-but-only-briefly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33b8a900be8c5a5fc6de6204522c6d55082b3ca6-3318x2212.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424550,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2qADh,1632943345,Stand-Off Over $28T of US Government Debt Could Rattle Bitcoin Market,"As a pitched battle in the U.S. Congress raises the risk of a default on the government’s $28 trillion in debt, some cryptocurrency traders are speculating whether the gridlock might at some point cause a swoon in bitcoin prices.  “I think markets have been through enough of these limited episodes to have confidence that it’ll get resolved, but I think anxiety and volatility will creep in,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics.  During the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, when the U.S. government came close to the financial brink, bitcoin existed – but barely, having been launched just two years prior. At that point it was hardly traded or even tracked, its market capitalization well below $1 billion versus nearly $800 billion now.  The emergence of the largest cryptocurrency by market value since then as a major global investment means the price has become far more correlated with other risky assets, such as stocks, and it has proven vulnerable to sudden swings when traditional markets go haywire. Look no further than March 2020, when bitcoin prices tanked as the likely economic toll from the coronavirus came into view.  Economists warn the markets might again get a severe jolt if the U.S. government actually fails to make debt payments and fulfill its other legal obligations, such as funding Social Security and military salaries, and no quick resolution looks likely.  According to Christopher Russo, a research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, a U.S. default might trigger more than the casual “risk off” trade that happens periodically in markets. He used the word “catastrophe.”  “This is a project that was started by Alexander Hamilton back at the founding of the country with the assumption of the state’s war debt, the issuance of the first U.S. Treasurys and the commitment that these securities are backed by our full faith and credit,” Russo said. “To default on that promise for a day, I think, would have economic consequences that are potentially much greater than simply having a payment delayed. It would communicate to the world that something fundamental would have changed about the United States and our government.”  Not insulated  Bitcoin has sometimes reacted well to weakness in the American economy, such as last year when the cryptocurrency’s price quadrupled as much business and consumer activity went on lockdown. So in that respect, another seismic market moment might give bitcoin a chance to prove itself as a hedge against instability in U.S. government finances.  But the cryptocurrency industry is still immature compared with the traditional financial system and bitcoin is still largely considered a risky asset, so there’s ample skepticism the cryptocurrency will break free from any turmoil buffeting broader markets.  “That’s particularly hard or impossible to get in a crisis like a debt-limit episode,” Russo said. “During a default, correlations go up on everything. Stocks and bonds become more correlated, and bitcoin becomes more correlated with everything.”  During the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, the Republicans, the party controlling the Congress, worked with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling only after Democrats agreed to a series of future spending cuts. The debate briefly sent financial markets into a tailspin, and the credit rating firm Standard and Poor’s (S&P) downgraded U.S. debt for the first time in its history, stripping the government of its pristine triple-A rating.  This time around, Republicans are again playing hardball, and there’s speculation the Democrats, in the majority this time, might have to raise the debt ceiling via a so-called budget reconciliation process. This would allow them to pass legislation by simple majority, Vanden Houten said. (On Monday night, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have suspended the debt limit and kept the government open.)  One issue at play is determining when the federal government will actually run out of money if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. Vanden Houten’s forecasts point to the U.S. government running out of cash sometime around Oct. 25. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen thinks that date could be as soon as Oct. 18.  “This assumes that the Treasury [Dept.] will continue to be able to hold auctions and Wall Street dealers will be willing to participate in those auctions,” Vanden Houten said. “We can’t guarantee that will happen, and should the Treasury fail to raise enough cash, that could mean that they run into trouble even sooner.”  There may be an in-between scenario where the U.S. defaults on its debt briefly but financial markets remain calm, with investors assuming the debt limit will be raised eventually, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, a Yale University initiative focused on understanding financial crises. It’s unclear how long a default would have to last before investors lose their nerve, Kelly added.  “A lot of folks say if [the Congress raises] the debt ceiling one second too late, then the U.S. loses its status as the safe asset provider and the premier financial system of the world,” Kelly said. “That, I’m not as convinced of, but there’s always a risk for short-term volatility.”  A long-term drag on markets wouldn’t occur unless there was an extended period of default, which is “unfathomable,” Kelly said.  When the ‘save haven’ defaults  It is a conundrum that, historically, even when doubts have arisen about the U.S. Treasury’s ability or willingness to repay U.S. debt, investors have nevertheless snapped up the government’s bonds because they’re still seen as safe-haven assets in the midst of extreme uncertainty.  “In 2011, when S&P downgraded the U.S., we actually saw yields fall,” Kelly said. (A bond’s yield rises as the price of the bond falls.) “It’s sort of this paradox where when the debt ceiling issue leads to a risk-off attitude in the short term, the best potential assets for a risk-off event are still U.S. Treasurys. This makes me less convinced of this idea that if the government is one second late on payments that it will result in this long-term destruction of our stature in the financial system.”  While there is some merit to the idea that the dollar has no alternative, there’s nothing “written into the laws of nature” that means that can’t change, Russo added.  “If the U.S. government’s debt becomes risky or it’s perceived to become riskier because we default or for some other reason, the yields on Treasury securities will rise and investors seeking a safe asset could choose another country,” Russo said. “They might choose Germany, or they might choose France, or they might choose a combination of countries with different sovereign issuers, giving you maybe a risk-free return.”  Bitcoin might represent another option for some investors who see the cryptocurrency as an alternative to the predominantly U.S. dollar-based global economy.  But for bitcoin to rise in the immediate aftermath of a default, it would have to have zero or totally negative correlation with other assets, Russo said.  What happens after that is far less certain.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/29/standoff-over-28t-of-us-government-debt-could-rattle-bitcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e71b070ed51f7519bb4f8a9e8238059ba9c82a06-5773x3849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XDEFI is a wallet that will allow users to interact with nine different blockchains. Key features include proprietary gas pricing algorithms and automatically adding new tokens to wallets based on use.  Mechanism Capital led the funding round, with participation from heavyweights such as Alameda Research, Sino Global and Animoca Brands. The round also featured participation from DeFi power users and developers such as Darren Lau of Not3Lau Capital and pseudonymous Alchemix developer “Scoopy Trooples.”  Griping about user-experience barriers is one of the most popular pastimes in crypto. Clunky wallets are largely seen as a barrier to mass adoption, and new chains often have their own wallets, such as Solana’s Phantom.  This forces users to switch between various front-ends and services when trying to pursue cross-chain yield farming strategies – an often agonizing process in a field where speed and efficiency are key to returns. Despite the clear need, however, few challengers have emerged to the ConsenSys-owned MetaMask, comfortably the most dominant wallet.

On Wednesday, the company behind the proof-of-stake blockchain released a back-end upgrade to increase the computing power of Algorand-based applications. Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) will also make it easier for newcomers to develop programs atop the chain.  AVM brings Algorand smart contract development “closer to the mental model” developers on other blockchains are used to, Chief Product Officer Paul Riegle told CoinDesk. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is widely used, with EVM-compatibility being a key way for new networks like Avalanche and others to gain steam.  Getting more developers running faster code could be key for Algorand’s growth in the bustling decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. It is the 29th-largest blockchain by total value locked, according to DeFi Llama, well behind Ethereum, Solana and Tron.  Read more: Algorand Foundation Launches $300M DeFi Innovation Fund  Riegle said AVM simplifies smart contracts’ treatment of escrow payments, their ability to send transactions and their handling of slippage in trades. It also improves on the complex math underpinning “complex DeFi applications,” he said, such as the authentication procedures protecting cross-chain mechanisms, or bridges.  One developer is building a bridge with 14 signature verifications, he said. (Riegle noted that 14 cross-checks is “pretty out on the tail” of what’s normal, and as such would require uncommonly high computing power). “We can support those kinds of things now,” he said.  Algorand supported some of those things before – in a far more piecemeal manner. AVM makes it simpler to join those previously disparate bits together, according to Riegle.  The self-imposed guardrails regulating how much computing power Algorand smart contracts can call are also getting a 16-fold raise. Riegle said the boost does not impact overall performance on the chain, which can process 1,000 transactions a second.  Coming rollouts will further juice performance 10- to 40-fold “at a minimum,” he said.

42421051,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLJt,1632939826,Crypto Gains Ground in Latin America Amid Venture Capital Boom,"Latin America is experiencing a boom in venture capital (VC) investments.  In the first six months of 2021, the region registered nearly $6.5 billion in VC investments, a number even higher than the $4 billion registered in 2020 as a whole, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America (LAVCA).  Crypto is playing a big part in this regional investment surge, thanks to large sources with fresh money triggering unprecedented funding round levels and the birth of two crypto “unicorns” in Latin America, among several other milestones.  According to LAVCA, smaller crypto deals have been recorded in Latin America since 2016, when Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso raised $2.5 million from Cometa fund and several other venture capital firms.  “Then, in 2021, we saw a definite uptick in crypto investments in terms of volume and ticket size,” a spokesperson for LAVCA told CoinDesk.  Latin American crypto startups raised $517 million in announced VC funding during the first half of 2021, the same spokesperson said in a written statement.  Of the nine new unicorns, or privately held startup companies valued at over $1 billion, born in the first half of 2021 in Latin America, two are cryptocurrency related. Mexican crypto exchange Bitso was the first after raising a $250 million Series C led by Tiger Global, at a $2.2 billion valuation. Mercado Bitcoin, the largest crypto exchange in Brazil, raised $200 million in a Series B round from the SoftBank Latin America Fund and reached a $2.1 billion valuation.  These massive amounts for crypto firms this year far outstripped their 2020 counterparts. Bitso previously set a record for Latin American fundraising last year after raising $62 million – a mere fraction of its 2021 round – in a Series B.  Kaszek Ventures, which led that Series B round, is always looking for opportunities in Latin America, co-founder and managing partner Hernan Kazah told CoinDesk. However, the first waves of crypto projects were more global in scope and did not present specific solutions for regional problems, so Kaszek didn’t get involved.  There is certainly no shortage of regional problems to address.  “In Latin America we [are used to] exchange rate volatility, costly regulations and untrustworthy currencies. In Argentina, a 10-year-old understands that there are different exchange rates,” Kazah said.  He notes that projects are coming up with applications for local use.  “Those players will be able to do much better than global players in Latin America,” he said.  Ignacio Plaza, managing partner at Latin American venture firm Draper Cygnus, echoed these thoughts. In 2021, Draper Cygnus announced a $50 million early stage fund for pre-seed to Series A investments rounds.  According to Plaza, underdeveloped financial services in Latin America are one reason why the region is an ideal place for crypto.  “Crypto is going to replace the existing financial infrastructure,” he said,  Regionalize as soon as possible (or sell)  Some Latin America-focused projects, after raising big rounds, start expanding regionally.  Mercado Bitcoin, the largest Brazilian crypto exchange, plans to expand from Brazil to Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, Roberto Dagnoni, CEO and executive chairman of 2TM Group, Mercado Bitcoin’s parent company, told CoinDesk.  The company has already been in talks with peers about potential acquisitions, he added.  After it raised $50 million in a Series B founding round in September, Ripio plans to open operations in Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay before the end of 2021, Chief Brand Officer Juan José Mendez told CoinDesk. He added that the company plans to start operating in Spain in the first quarter of 2022. The company plans to announce the acquisition of an exchange in Colombia in the next few weeks.  On a smaller scale, two Argentina-based crypto exchanges, Lemon Cash and Buenbit, face similar scenarios. Both raised their Series A – $16.3 million and $11 million, respectively – and started their expansion processes across Latin America.  Bitso, established in Argentina and Mexico, is so interested in Brazil that the company’s co-founder and CEO, Daniel Vogel, moved to Sao Paulo and hired Facebook veteran Vaughan Smith as the company’s first chief operating officer to boost expansion in that country.  The flood of fresh money is also sparking mergers and acquisitions.  In February, Latin America-focused exchange Bitso bought Quedex, a crypto derivatives trading platform, based and regulated in Gibraltar, while Argentina’s Ripio acquired BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in Brazil, in an undisclosed transaction made in January.  Global players  Kaszek sees outstanding regional talent creating global projects. The fund made its first decentralized finance (DeFi) investment in August, leading a $3 million round in Exactly, a startup that is building an open-source, non-custodial credit protocol on the Ethereum platform, with a global scope.  Exactly was founded by Gabriel Gruber, an Argentine entrepreneur who had previously founded the proptech company Properati, later sold to OLX group.  NXTP Ventures, one of the oldest venture capital funds in Latin America, also invested in Exactly. According to co-founder and managing partner Ariel Arrieta, DeFi’s ability to enable and support growth is unmatched by other industries.  “It’s one of the factors that make these investments more attractive,” he told CoinDesk.  The fund started looking at crypto in 2013 when one of its limited partners, Wences Casares, founder of crypto bank Xapo, introduced the founders to the subject, Arrieta said. In the crypto and blockchain segments, NXTP Ventures’ portfolio currently consists of Securitize, Ripio, RSK, Koibanx and Waynyloan.  A large portion of the pitches Kaszek considers on a weekly basis is crypto-related.  “Before, the joke was that all the startups included the words ‘big data.’ Now they all include ‘blockchain,’” he said.  Companies are thus inclined to include the word “crypto” when it comes to raising money, according to Plaza.  “Today you can’t have any fintech project if you don’t include the crypto business,” he said.  Kazah said Kaszek’s crypto investments in 2021 will exceed those of 2020. “They won’t represent 100%, because we still see opportunities in fintech, e-commerce, marketplaces. However, we will certainly do much more than last year,” said the investor.  Plaza said he often sees presentations of crypto projects that raise funding rounds 10 times oversubscribed.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/crypto-gains-ground-in-latin-america-amid-venture-capital-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63b375baa32907a4ec0e3adf8d179e244908b910-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEOBZ,1632938490,Pro-Crypto Senator Lummis Says Stablecoins Should Be Audited,"Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) took aim at stablecoins on Wednesday, saying they “must be 100 percent backed by cash ... and this should be audited regularly.”  In a speech on the Senate floor that largely focused on the potential development of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), Lummis expressed her concern that stablecoins are not fully backed “in a transparent manner,” echoing the concerns of many in the crypto community.  The two largest stablecoin issuers – Circle and Tether – have revealed that their products were backed by a combination of cash, cash-like products, short-term securities and commercial paper. In attestations published earlier this year, Tether executives announced that roughly half of Tether’s reserves are held in commercial paper, while Circle said its reserves are largely comprised of cash and highly liquid money-market funds.  Those attestation reports, however, differ from full audits in that third-party auditing firms merely verify the information provided by the issuer. A full audit as suggested by Lummis would be a first in the stablecoin sphere.  Lummis isn’t the first crypto-friendly lawmaker to express concerns about stablecoins. Earlier this year, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) suggested that stablecoins might meet the definition of a security, which would subject them to regulatory oversight from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  A highly anticipated Treasury Department report on stablecoins is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.  CBDC Design  In her speech on Wednesday, Lummis also established her guiding principles for the development of a U.S. CBDC.  Lummis’ remarks come a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called on Congress for new legislation to authorize the Fed’s plans to create a digital dollar.  The key tenets of a digital dollar laid out in Lummis’ speech included legitimate need, financial inclusion, programmability, avoiding systemic risk and privacy.  “Americans must have confidence that a CBDC is not being used for surveillance purposes ... we cannot allow a CBDC to become a panopticon, as will soon be the case with China’s CBDC,” Lummis concluded.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/29/pro-crypto-senator-lummis-thinks-stablecoins-should-face-audits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf21555d21cbe08b43e15dd855aa534959009585-7431x4956.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394429,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEYj,1632934559,El Salvador’s Bitcoin Volcano Can Be a Model for Cleaner Crypto,"Yesterday afternoon, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a short video of workers installing a shipping container full of cryptocurrency mining rigs at a geothermal power plant surrounded by thick jungle. “First steps … #Bitcoin,” the president tweeted.  There is still a deep vein of skepticism about El Salvador’s bitcoin project. But taken at face value the video shows progress towards its second stage. The first came in early September when the Central American country made bitcoin legal tender. Now Bukele wants to harness the country’s potentially huge supply of clean, renewable energy to mine more of the cryptocurrency.  The implications, not just for crypto but for geopolitics, could be huge. El Salvador sits on the edge of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has 20 “potentially active” volcanoes, according to VolcanoDiscovery.com. They run the length of the entire country and have been harnessed to generate 21.7% of the country’s energy, according to the U.S. International Trade Association. (For comparison, all renewable energy sources together comprise only 12% of U.S. energy.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Even this large proportion represents only a fraction of the energy that could potentially be drawn from El Salvador’s volcanoes. But some potential sites sit miles away from population centers like San Salvador and San Miguel. Connecting them to the power grid would require extensive infrastructure buildout, much of it in inhospitable conditions.  Bitcoin miners, by contrast, can be installed on even the remotest site, and connected to the Bitcoin blockchain wirelessly. As bitcoin adoption continues to grow, this has the potential to radically upend the logic of energy generation, including the utilization rate of “stranded energy” like El Salvador’s remote volcanoes, wasted outputs like the methane flares produced by natural gas mining or unneeded energy from off-peak wind or hydroelectric generation.  El Salvador’s push illustrates why the most powerful benefits will likely accrue to renewable energy sources: They’re generally cheaper than fossil fuel sources. A volcanic power plant is simplicity itself. Basically, you drill a few big holes in the ground and use the heat to drive turbines. Compare Iceland’s Krafla volcanic power station, which resembles a red barn with a couple of tubes coming out, to the towering, tangled monstrosity that is an average natural gas power plant, and you can see the cost savings with your naked eye.  Some argue this makes bitcoin a potential driver of further renewable energy development, as laid out in the new documentary “This Machine Greens.” El Salvador may become a case study. If Bukele follows through, bitcoin could subsidize development of a much greater proportion of the country’s previously dormant power resources. In the long run, not all of that new energy will go to mining bitcoin – nearby communities could also benefit, and other new industries could even grow from the availability of cheap, clean power.  That’s where geopolitics comes in. El Salvador’s immense supply of volcanic energy has never been fully harnessed for the betterment of the nation because of technological limitations. By making energy portable, bitcoin has the potential to improve the economic standing of many nations with underutilized clean power resources. Guatemala, next door to El Salvador, has its own volcanic bumper crop: No surprise that nation, too, is thinking about bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,David Z.

Among these groups are crypto exchange giant FTX, which until recently was based in Hong Kong; proof-of-stake blockchain network Tezos; and derivative liquidity protocol Synthetix. It remains unclear whether organizers of such groups are employed by the companies.  The community organizers are encouraging group members to join their new or existing Chinese Telegram group, while some of the members are also creating new channels for their communities on Discord.  The move came after the People’s Bank of China started carrying out an extensive crackdown on crypto last week, declaring all crypto-related transactions illegal.

42411906,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwx3,1632932258,China Crypto Bans: A Complete History,"Those familiar with the crypto industry will understand that China’s crypto ban is not entirely a surprise. The country has maintained a hostile relationship with its crypto industry since 2013, when it rolled out its first set of crypto restrictions.  And while the recent ban may feel like the final nail in the coffin, it is to an extent a reiteration of the crypto directives issued by the country’s central bank eight years ago. Below is a complete timeline of China’s crypto bans to date.  Read More: US Claims Bitcoin Mining Crown Following China Crackdown  The precursors to China's crypto ban  2013: China bans banks from crypto transactions  China’s hostile stance regarding crypto dates back to Dec. 5, 2013, when the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the Ministry of Industry and Information and other financial watchdogs jointly issued a notice prohibiting banks from handling transactions related to bitcoin.  According to the statement released at the time, bitcoin was deemed a “special virtual commodity,” and so, it lacked the legal backing to function as a currency. More specifically, the ban was imposed because the digital asset was not backed by any nation or central authority. Also, the PBoC noted that bitcoin was a potential outlet for laundering cash. Although the regulator did not stop individuals from trading bitcoin, it did advise those involved to be wary of the risks involved.  This notice came at a time when bitcoin trading had begun to pick up considerable steam, with bitcoin’s price crossing the $1,000 mark for the first time barely 10 days before the ban was issued. Following the announcement, the value of bitcoin plummeted by over 30% on the now-defunct Mt. Gox Exchange, which at the time was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world.  As a follow-up to its ban on bitcoin transactions, the PBoC allegedly met with top third-party payment services in China on Dec. 16 and directed them to stop doing business with bitcoin exchanges. Two days later, BTC China (BTCC), the country’s largest bitcoin exchange at the time, announced it had stopped accepting yuan deposits, further forcing the price of bitcoin to fall.  2017: China bans crypto initial coin offerings  In an attempt to buoy a weakening yuan and block money from flowing out of China illegally, the country’s central bank began to investigate the activities of crypto exchanges in January 2017. The investigation focused on exchanges’ approach to forex management and anti-money laundering.  It would seem that its findings informed the decision to ban initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Sept. 4, 2017. At this point, ICOs were the hottest component of the crypto industry, allowing entrepreneurs and developers to raise funds for their projects by issuing and selling tokens.  The PBoC deemed ICOs an illegal fundraising mechanism. It went on to ban ICO platforms from issuing ICO tokens and ordered monies raised via ICO to be returned to investors. Among other things, the regulator noted that ICOs threaten the stability of the country’s economy and pose risks of “business failure.” The order also stipulated that financial institutions and non-bank payment companies were restricted from providing services that cater to token-based fundraising activities.  While China’s crypto community was still processing this new reality, regulators issued another directive forcing crypto exchanges to shut down voluntarily by Sept. 15. The leaked document sent to exchanges revealed that they were expected to wind down their operations and implement processes allowing users to withdraw their funds. The aftermath of this development saw some China-based exchanges move their operations to other countries while others had to close shop. Some of the affected digital asset exchanges were BTCC and ViaBTC.  To get around this restriction, Chinese crypto traders started to use offshore exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms for all of their trading activities.  2019: Attention turns to bitcoin mining  In April 2019, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) labeled bitcoin mining an “undesirable” industry in its preliminary list of sectors that should be encouraged, restricted or phased out by local governments. Bitcoin mining, which is a computer-intensive process of validating bitcoin transactions to earn newly minted bitcoin in reward, fell under the catalog of industries the agency considered to be highly polluting.  Read More: 8 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Mining in 2022  As expected, this development sparked some level of panic, considering that a significant percentage of bitcoin mining rigs are manufactured in China. Also, more than half of the world’s bitcoin mining power was domiciled in China because operators had access to cheap electricity. Although the NDRC eventually omitted bitcoin mining from its final draft after much deliberation, the entire episode was the first hint of things to come.  2020: Enforcement ramps up  For the better part of 2020, the Chinese government tightened its grip on crypto exchange activities within its borders amid an ongoing campaign to crack down on money laundering and fraud. In August, the PBoC revealed its intention to block over 100 foreign websites offering crypto exchange services.  2021: China bans crypto trading and mining  The Chinese crypto industry’s problems in 2021 began in May when the State Council doubled down on past crypto policies by calling for the restriction of crypto mining and trading. Before this, the provincial authorities of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Sichuan provinces, which were all major bitcoin mining hubs, had begun to introduce policies that stifled the operations of bitcoin miners.  Following the statement from the State Council, provincial governments began to take proactive measures to eradicate crypto mining. Regulators cited bitcoin’s energy-intensive nature and how it poses a threat to the country’s environmental goals as its core reasons for justifying the new crackdown.  Much like the impact of the crypto exchange crackdown in 2017, bitcoin miners were either forced to shut down permanently or move to other crypto-friendly countries. Because around 50% of the world’s bitcoin mining power was generated in China before the crackdown, the global bitcoin economy expectedly felt the brunt of China’s bitcoin mining ban.  As if the bitcoin mining crackdown was not enough, the country’s regulators opted to ban crypto trading altogether in September. Unlike the previous crypto transaction crackdowns, the country’s central bank, in conjunction with nine other state bodies, including the police and the supreme court, removed all shroud of doubt regarding the country’s stance on cryptocurrency and left no room for misinterpretation.  According to the joint statement released, the following provisions have been announced:  Regulators have deemed all crypto transactions (both crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto), trading and investments as illegal, whether executed via local or foreign platforms. This includes all bitcoin, ethereum and tether transactions.  Chinese nationals who work in marketing or tech support roles for foreign exchanges will now be subject to legal prosecution.  The NDRC has set out plans to ban crypto mining by severing investment in the sector, increasing electricity costs and blocking new companies from entering the industry.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aeb83546fb4c47e95fadab2bbc9a3b45ba3fef20-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEOCp,1632929555,Bitcoin on Track for Biggest Monthly Price Loss Since May,"Bitcoin appears to be set to end the seasonally bearish month of September on a negative note, because of instability in global financial markets, regulatory concerns and China’s decision to ban crypto businesses.  Despite trading 2.8% higher on the day at $42,200 on Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency was nursing a 10% monthly decline, the biggest since May, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  The positive market sentiment seen at the start of the month was bogged down by renewed regulatory fears stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) attempts to stop the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase from launching its lending program offering 4% annualized yields. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler doubled down on his call for crypto regulation and compared stablecoins to poker chips. Meanwhile, China’s decision to declare all virtual currency-related businesses illegal and turmoil in its property market added to the pain.  According to analysts, however, much of the selling pressure came from new investors. “What we see here is that older market participants are sitting tight on their holdings, shown by the average lifespan of spent outputs declines,” Blockware Intelligence’s newsletter dated Sept. 17 said. “As a general rule of thumb, high spending from older entities is bearish, low spending from older entities is bullish.”  Large traders appear to have bought the dip, keeping hopes of a year-end rally alive. The supply controlled by entities holding at least 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC has gone up 60,000 BTC this month, according to blockchain data firm Glassnode. Entities are clusters of addresses controlled by the same network entity. This would include both businesses like exchanges and custodians and individuals.  Analysts told CoinDesk last week that China’s stricter ban may have a limited negative impact at worst and that the cryptocurrency is likely to remain resilient to the Federal Reserve taper (scaling back of stimulus) expected to begin next quarter.  Historically, bitcoin has charted the biggest quarterly gains in the October-to-December period.  Focus now will be on how the U.S. debt ceiling saga unfolds. According to the Treasury estimates quoted by Brookings, Congress needs to raise or suspend the debt ceiling or the government won’t have the cash to pay all its obligations.  The S&P 500 fell 2% on Tuesday after a vote on a stopgap spending measure, coupled with debt ceiling suspension, was blocked in the Senate. A continued sell-off in stocks could weigh over bitcoin.  “We see that bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with S&P 500 has increased considerably during this [September] risk-off period. At the same time, bitcoin’s correlation with gold has decreased,” crypto exchange Luno said in its weekly research note. “Although bitcoin has many similar characteristics as gold, it still behaves as a risk-on asset and highly correlates to the stock market during market turmoil.”  Traders will also keep a close eye on the SEC’s final verdict on several bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and the regulators’ first response on futures-based ETFs.  “The final decision date for the spot ETFs (illustrated within the red rectangle in the chart) is rapidly approaching. VanEck will receive the final verdict by Nov. 14th, while the verdict for other funds follows shortly,” Arcane Research’s weekly note dated Sept. 28 said. “We expect that we will see action in the market running up towards these dates.  “The futures-based ETFs receive their first response shortly as well. Within the next 40 days, six futures-based bitcoin ETF applications will receive the first response from the SEC,” Arcane Research said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/29/bitcoin-eyes-biggest-monthly-price-loss-since-may,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d33266bc8a35085f24c10dcc6c9a6a4f10be993-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(NASDAQ: GREE) soared 30% after investment firm B. Riley initiated its coverage of the bitcoin miner with a buy rating.  B. Riley slapped on a $78 price target, which would represent about 200% upside. As traditional investors ponder their approach to digital assets, shares of mining firms, MicroStrategy and other companies have served as convenient bitcoin proxies. Bitcoin’s price is up barely 2% in the last 24 hours, making GREE’s surge all the more notable.  B. Riley said Greenidge may reach hashrate, or computing power, of 3.1 EH/s by the end of 2022 and 6.8 EH/s by the end of 2023 as the mining industry continues to flee China after the country’s latest crypto crackdown.  “We believe that Greenidge can fund this growth with cash on hand, free cash flow and borrowings,” B.

42421041,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLAb,1632924800,Why Did Virgil Griffith Plead Guilty?,"There has never been any doubt that Virgil Griffith did, in fact, go to North Korea and give a cryptocurrency talk. But the reason is still not immediately clear for his guilty plea on Monday, which ended the scheduled two-week trial in New York City on the first day.  The American citizen and former head of special projects at the Ethereum Foundation, accused of having tried to help North Korea break sanctions, had entered into a plea deal for a sentence of up to six and a half years, a reversal of the not-guilty position he had held for close to two years.  Ethan Lou’s new book is “Once a Bitcoin Miner: Scandal and Turmoil in the Cryptocurrency Wild West.”  Up until the day of, it looked as if the full trial would take place. Many thought Griffith would follow in the footsteps of other notorious hackers – like Aaron Schwarz, Weev and Kevin Mitnick – and fight the legal system, win or lose. Griffith was in remand after having his bail revoked, and his lawyers had specifically requested not one but two suits for court so he could “wear a different outfit on different days.”  Indeed, the formal document for the plea deal was dated Sunday, a day before the trial. Griffith’s lawyers have not elaborated on the matter publicly. The guilty plea is the latest cruel irony in a case that saw an adventuresome utopian disturb national security and geopolitics after wandering into one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.  In time, the full picture will emerge. It’s possible that a plea deal was always on the table, even if the parties did not say it publicly. While the judge is not bound by the agreement, the up to six and a half years it recommends for Griffith is vastly better than the maximum of 20 carried by the charge against him: conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. There is a lot we simply do not know yet.  What we do know is that Griffith has faced setback after setback in this case. For more than a year, as the matter progressed toward trial, the deck could have looked increasingly stacked for someone at the center of it all. And as Griffith revealed in court on Monday, the weight of it all compounded within him. Having been at that North Korean conference and followed the case closely, I was certainly not expecting a plea deal. But, in retrospect, I can see how it would make sense from Griffith’s point of view.  In court on Monday, Griffith didn’t even wear the suit jacket his lawyers had requested. He told the court he was being treated for depression and taking medication. At times he sighed audibly.  “I have a lot of complex feelings throughout my body,” Griffith said, adding that he had been meditating and had begun to realize with a “greater acuity” how “awful” he had been feeling.  Two blows had come in quick succession. The defense had sought testimony from the Ethereum Foundation’s general counsel, Tju Liang Chua, which it said was necessary to show that Griffith cared about obeying the law. Last Wednesday Judge Kevin Castel rejected a bid for Chua, based in Singapore, to give testimony remotely.  Read More: 7 Nights in Pyongyang: Inside the North Korean Trip That Got Ethereum’s Virgil Griffith Arrested | Ethan Lou  Then there was the matter of the defense’s request for a one-week postponement. Griffith’s lawyers told the court the prosecution had been “tardy” in disclosing evidence, and that the defense did not have “sufficient time to prepare for trial.” The prosecution said there had been no agreed-upon deadline for when to finish disclosure. Last Thursday, Castel said the prosecution did not act out of bounds and denied the postponement.  On top of everything, Griffith had spent the last two months in New York’s notorious Metropolitan Correctional Center. Griffith had violated his bail conditions by trying to access his cryptocurrency on the exchange Coinbase – to try to sell it to pay his lawyers.  The most well-known of Griffith’s lawyers, Brian Klein, had acted for the likes of the ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees and defended the entrepreneur Charlie Shrem in a civil suit against the Winklevoss twins. Also on the case were Keri Axel and Sean Buckley, both former prosecutors now at top firms. On Monday in court, Griffith called them “fabulous.” Such talents do not come cheap.  Yet, even they could do only so much. Griffith faced a single charge of “conspiracy to violate” the sanctions law. That is, he was accused of trying to help North Korea violate sanctions, not necessarily succeeding. What the prosecution needed to prove wasn’t the ultimate outcome of Griffith’s deeds but the underlying intent. And intent is subjective – not necessarily in a way that might favor Griffith but definitely in a way that is hard to predict.  After all, the facts were not in dispute. Both sides largely agreed that Griffith had spoken at the North Korean conference and had later planned further cryptocurrency activities to do with the country. The prosecution even had a recording of Griffith’s remarks in North Korea.  Indeed, as Judge Castel had pointed out, the defense’s submission on the Ethereum lawyer Chua’s potential testimony had cited files in the prosecution’s evidence. Everything was already out in the open. How a jury would view everything – it would have been quite the gamble for Griffith.  Sitting in court on Monday, ready to capitulate, Griffith no doubt remembered a time when he would have taken such a gamble. Not long after his arrest he had appeared scrappy in an almost cheeky way. When asked back then how he would answer the charges, Griffith said he wasn’t guilty or not guilty but “innocent.”  More than a year later, while it is yet unclear what specifically has changed, something definitely has. When defendants admit crimes, the court has to be satisfied they know what is going on and are not coerced. Griffith had to make the admission in his own words. In that moment, it seemed as if, bit by bit, the judicial process had chipped away at him. The pain in his voice was noticeable.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Ethan Lou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/why-did-virgil-griffith-plead-guilty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83f8dad2e1a8317be3d58e0a317e025049c060f1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund, unveiled Wednesday as part of Ripple’s XRPL developer summit, will aim to foster innovation in tokenization with a focus on NFTs.  Creators, brands and marketplaces will be given support to explore how the XRPL’s speed and cost can support new uses for NFTs.  The Creator Fund is being launched by Ripple in partnership with NFT marketplaces Mintable and mintNFT, and brand design agency VSA Partners.  Ripple has been relatively absent so far from the NFT battleground, which has largely been dominated by Ethereum, with other ecosystems such as Solana also competing.  The potential for the XRPL as a platform for NFT trading was highlighted by Japan-based financial services firm SBI Holdings in its “Building a More Sustainable, Scalable, and Accessible Future for NFTs with XRPL” report in July.  “The blockchain XRP Ledger has the ability to tokenize not only XRP but also a variety of other assets,” the report said.

TAT is reportedly in discussions with the Stock Exchange of Thailand over the introduction of TAT Coin and is weighing the regulatory and feasibility aspects of such a project, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.  The authority’s governor, Yuthasak Supasorn, said Thailand had to “prepare” its digital infrastructure as well as digital literacy for its tourism operators as it related to crypto.  “The traditional business model might not be able to keep up with the new changes,” said Yuthasak.  If developed, the token’s utility could facilitate the transfer of vouchers into TAT coin, boosting liquidity among tourism operators. It may also signal to the rest of the crypto world that Thailand’s tourism sector is back open for business as it attempts to grapple with the after-effects of COVID-19.  Thailand will lift its mandatory quarantine requirement in Bangkok and nine regions as of Nov. 1 for those who have been fully vaccinated, Reuters reported Monday.  Thailand’s TAT is an agency under the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. Its objective is to promote the country’s tourism industry and protect the environment.  Discussions with relevant authorities, including the country’s Ministry of Finance, will need to be conducted in order to determine if the agency has the power to issue such a token, according to the report.

42376100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEO7n,1632920400,"4K NFT Marketplace Goes Live, Bringing Physical Goods to the Blockchain","A tokenized Rolex?  4K platform, a marketplace that allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing physical assets, launched on the Ethereum network Wednesday morning.  The project expands the uses of NFTs beyond mere digital art into real-world luxury goods. With physical goods translated into NFTs, owners of valuable physical assets are one step closer to participating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  “Back in 2017, I knew NFTs were going to be a big thing, but I wasn’t sure in which form,” 4K founder Richard Li told CoinDesk in an interview last week. “In the real world, when someone makes $100 million they buy some art. Why not in the digital world? That’s when I saw the transition.”  The service adds to the furious pace of development in the NFT business, where digital collector cards like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes are fetching hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, and coders are even concocting blockchain-based software protocols that will let users borrow against their tokens, like a pawn shop for NFTs.  4K says it will bring real-world assets onto the blockchain by issuing users of the platform an NFT symbolizing ownership of a physical good. The company obtains the item from a seller, authenticates, insures and stores it. The NFT holder can then trade their NFT for the physical item.  Upon redemption, the NFT is destroyed, meaning the holder cannot possess both the physical object and the NFT simultaneously.  “4K is an analog to digital converter for physical collectibles,” Curtis Spencer, co-founder and partner at venture capital firm Electric Capital, an investor in 4K, told CoinDesk.  Based on the latest data, over 5,000 people have signed up for 4K’s website drops and over 10,000 people have registered for early access to the marketplace.  The platform would also allow international access to covetable luxury goods, some of which are not available across geographies. “It’s a democratization of these types of markets,” Li said.  According to Li, most sales of luxury artworks occur only “on paper,” with no physical transferring of goods. “The ownership changes, but the pieces don’t move,” Li explained. NFTs therefore make ownership of non-fungible, real-world items easy to trade and gift, potentially disrupting traditional marketplaces or auction houses such as eBay, Christie’s and Sotheby’s.  Li said the auction houses are taking advantage of the NFT boom “by extracting value from the ecosystem and turning crypto assets into fiat.”  He said 4K aims to do the opposite, bringing physical assets on-chain and growing the crypto market.  “If you made your money in crypto, you should support the crypto community,” Li said.  The company completed a $3 million seed round in July led by Electric Capital, Crosscut Ventures, Collab+Currency, Ethereal Ventures and IDEO CoLab Ventures. At the time, the company had a $30 million valuation.  “With this physical asset bridge and marketplace, we get all of the superpowers of NFTs such as transparency, authenticity and composability in DeFi,” said Electric’s Spencer.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/4k-nft-marketplace-goes-live-bringing-physical-goods-to-the-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/375fcef288d03fbbbef52604f7dc9ad104d085c9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwENtx,1632919660,"R3, Once Banking’s Blockchain Bet, Is Spinning Up a DeFi Token","R3, the startup that began with a consortium of banks trying to figure out how to use cryptocurrency technology in a private setting, is now looking to enter the vast expanse of decentralized finance (DeFi).  R3 announced its regulatory-friendly DeFi network and token – dubbed Obscuro – on Sept. 28 at this year’s CordaCon, R3′s annual developer summit, later stressing that it is a proof-of-concept, and a go-live date would be dictated by regulators.  “Our team is working on a proof-of-concept project for a private, permission-less DeFi network, with a corresponding token,” R3 representative Nick Murray-Leslie said via email. (“Private” and “permission-less” sounds confusing, but refers to R3′s work with Intel SGX to create a closed setting for transactions while holding onto the open nature of DeFi.) “Our goal is to design, test and have it shovel ready from a technological standpoint for next year.”  Proponents of open and truly permissionless DeFi are considering ways to make their platforms more regulation-friendly, such as introducing know-your-customer (KYC) checks and features like the whitelisting of users. R3, with its privacy-centric Corda platform, is coming at this problem from the direction of a more traditional, regulated product design, in one of the more pronounced pivots in recent memory.  Read more: Aave Proposal Enlists Fireblocks to Aid DeFi Protocol’s Mainstream Finance Push  R3 said Obscuro, a layer 2 network of specialist nodes using Intel’s SGX enclaves, has the potential to reduce front-running in DeFi applications by crypto miners who are privy to large, market-moving trades and insert their own trades to take advantage.  “We intend that it’s going to be possible to deploy Ethereum contracts to Obscuro almost unchanged, following a model established by other layer 2 platforms. Additionally, Obscuro will roll up encrypted transactions to a management contract on Ethereum. Again, this roll-up concept is established by other layer 2 platforms,” R3 said in response to CoinDesk’s questions, adding:  “We are considering building a prototype DEX to illustrate the capabilities of the platform and the potential to prevent front-running.”  R3 said the Obscuro token will find its way onto exchanges and is needed as a way to compensate Obscuro node operators for running infrastructure.  “A mechanism is needed to pass value from users. A utility token achieves this, and provides a role in determining the weight given to individuals in governance decisions,” Murray-Leslie added. “A token will likely follow the ERC-20 standard. This means that it should be possible for users to add trading pairs to DEXs, but whether to add to a centralized exchange is of course their decision.”  Enterprise recalculations  More broadly, the move by R3 represents a further concession that public blockchains, as opposed to shared databases within company firewalls masquerading as innovation, have proven to attract far more capital and usage.  In fact, the Obscuro announcement is not the first time members of the open-source Corda community have pushed for DeFi-like functionality and a token to run on the Corda Network.  This has been the continued focus of LAB577, a startup helmed by former NatWest banker Richard Crook, which last year announced the Cordite Society, a co-operative registered in the U.K., and its plans to release the XDC crypto token on R3′s Corda.  “LAB577 are delighted to see the launch of Obscuro, another step in the convergence of the leading blockchain technologies,” Crook said Wednesday via email, adding:  “The need for privacy, identity, finality and governance in the financial industry has remained unchanged. It is for the blockchain technologies to meet the requirements, not the other way around.”  Update (Sept. 29, 13:20 UTC): Adds further information from R3.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/r3-once-bankings-blockchain-bet-is-spinning-up-a-defi-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb2a82aa50e1e77b65c443c49bff9ff4869b99ed-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEOE5,1632915000,Ethereum Is Only as Strong as Its Weakest Link,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  “You’re only as strong as your weakest link.” This adage is especially true when it comes to decentralization and even more important when you are potentially building a new base layer for the world economy.  Over the past several years, Ethereum has developed a strong track record for security while maintaining permissionless access to its platform and the applications built on top. As the network merges to Proof-of-Stake, it’s vital the network continues to mitigate any possible point of failure.  According to CypherPunks, “an Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients.” Each node runs a client to host their implementation of the network and verify an accurate history of blocks and their transactions. The two most popular clients on Ethereum’s proof of work chain are Geth and Parity. We recently saw a Geth bug affecting over 54% of nodes, reaching high severity and causing those nodes to split from the network.  Ethereum’s developer teams and community have recently discussed the need for further client diversity on the Beacon Chain as Prysm accounts for nearly two-thirds of the current composition. Developers have made it clear that Prysm itself is not the issue, rather it is the high degree of concentrated composition among nodes running the single client. Developers are, therefore, advocating for validators to switch to minority clients to reach a distributed balance across the chain.  Any large client bug can create quite the headache for Ethereum stakeholders, but the bug is amplified if a large portion of the nodes are all experiencing the same issue, potentially tricking the chain into believing their bugged chain is correct. An issue like this happening with two-thirds of nodes could lead to a chain split, creating larger security risk for users and developers, slashing issues for validators and potentially needing a bailout from the overall network, which is inherently not a very decentralized solution.  While Prysm is not inherently more risky than other clients, punishments for a client bug on a majority client will be amplified and could lead to pretty significant validator penalties. Validator downtime is further punished during large outages, making majority client bugs a larger issue for individual stakers as well. Therefore, running a minority client will reduce slashing risk and it will become more important for the wider network as we move closer to the Merge, when the current network is transitioned into the Beacon Chain.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  The dYdX community reconfirmed that its token’s utility is strictly governance and will not be used as a means to redistribute revenue. BACKGROUND: Equity and token owners seem to be at odds because the equity investors associated with dYdX have all future rights to profitability and growth. The move may be part of a deal with early investors or a strategic play to avoid further regulation.  The founder of Yearn, Andre Cronje, released an open-source alternative to OpenSea in a move to disrupt the non-fungible token (NFT) trading markets. BACKGROUND: OpenSea is the largest NFT market by trading volume and takes a 2.5% fee from every sale on its platform. The crypto community believes OpenSea’s lack of a token, high fees and insider trading allegations makes the space ripe for innovation. Cronje released the code but does not plan on launching or operating the market himself.  A Bitfinex-controlled wallet accidentally spent $23.7 million in gas fees during a transfer of $100,000 in USDT. BACKGROUND: The transfer was done by DiversiFi, a Bitfinex sister company that allows its users to access decentralized finance (DeFi) without spending gas fees. DiversiFi noted that no consumer funds were at risk and the miner had sent back a majority of the funds later in the day.  SparkPool, the second-largest Ethereum mining pool, is suspending its services at the end of the month. BACKGROUND: China’s crackdown on crypto initially resulted in SparkPool’s decision to ban Chinese users, but after recent regulatory updates the pool has decided to shut down to users worldwide. The mining pool contributes nearly 22% of Ethereum’s processing power, or hashrate, and will continue to have wider effects on the network.  Fireblock’s head of business development, Rob Salman, proposed to make Fireblocks the first whitelisted institution on Aave Arc. BACKGROUND: Aave Arc will be a decentralized lending platform with whitelisting capabilities in order to onboard institutional clients and retain regulatory compliance. As a financial services provider, Fireblocks would aid in whitelisting other compliant institutions and bringing additional capital and services to decentralized finance.

42411902,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwn8,1632914153,What Is an ICO?,"ICO stands for “initial coin offering,” and refers to a formerly popular method of fundraising capital for early-stage cryptocurrency projects. In an ICOhttps://www.sec.gov/ICOsec, a blockchain-based startup mints a certain quantity of its own native digital token and offers them to early investors, normally in exchange for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether.  As a type of digital crowdfunding, ICOs enable startups not only to raise funds without giving up equity but also to establish a community of incentivized users who want the project to succeed so their presale tokens rise in value.  While ICOs can offer an easy funding mechanism and an innovative approach for startups to raise money, buyers can also benefit from both access to the service that the token confers as well as a rise in the token’s price if the platform is successful (big IF!)  These gains can be realized by selling the tokens on an exchange once they’re listed. Or, buyers can double down on the project by purchasing more tokens once they hit the market.  Read more: Investing in Crypto: Alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether  Ethereum’s ICO was one of the first real success stories using this relatively new type of fundraising mechanism, raising $15.5 million in 2014. Fifty million ether tokens (ETH) were sold at $0.311 each, and on May 12, 2021, it hit an all-time high of $4,382.73, offering investors a 1,408,903% return on investment. Now not only is it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, but it has enabled an entire ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps) to blossom from its technology.  A history of ICOs  It all started in 2013 when software engineer J.R. Willet wrote a white paper titled “The Second Bitcoin White Paper” for the token MasterCoin (which was rebranded as Omni Layer) and was able to raise US$600,000.  By 2014, seven projects had raised a total of $30 million. The largest that year was Ethereum: 50 million ether were created and sold to the public, raising more than $18 million.  2015 was a quieter year. Seven sales raised a total of $9 million, with the largest – Augur – collecting just over $5 million.  Activity started to pick up in 2016 when 43 ICOs – including Waves, Iconomi, Golem, and Lisk – raised $256 million. That included the infamous token sale of The DAO project, an autonomous investment fund that aimed to encourage Ethereum ecosystem development by allowing investors to vote on projects to fund. Not long after the sale raised a record $150 million, a hacker siphoned off approximately $60 million worth of ether, leading to the project’s collapse and a hard fork of the Ethereum protocol.  The DAO’s failure did not deter the increasingly ebullient enthusiasm for the nascent digital asset space, and in December the first fund dedicated to token investment got significant backing from old-school venture capitalists.  2017 saw ICO’s reach a new peak, in part to new technological advancements. 342 token issuances raised almost $5.4 billion and thrust the concept to the forefront of blockchain innovation. ICOs selling out in increasingly shorter periods of time fueled the frenzy, and in the haste to get ‘in on the action,’ project fundamentals became less important to would-be investors.  ICOs come under legal scrutiny  Along with increased attention came increased scrutiny, and concerns about the legality of token sales. This was evident when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) put out a statement in 2017 warning that if a digital asset sold to U.S. investors had the characteristics of a security (ownership rights, an income stream, or even expectation of a profit from the efforts of others), it had to abide by U.S. securities laws or face punitive action. More recently, Gary Gensler, the latest Chairman of the SEC, says he believes all ICOs are securities, and are therefore in breach of United States securities laws – hinting more class actions could be on the horizon.  Financial regulators from Australia, the U.K and a long list of other countries also issued warnings to retail investors about the potential hazards of participating in these potentially fraudulent offerings.  South Korea and China decidedly imposed complete bans on ICOs around the same time, while Thailand issued a temporary ban on token offerings a year later as regulators drafted up a new legal framework.  Despite the widespread regulatory concern regarding ICOs, there is yet no global consensus on passing blanket laws – or amending existing ones – to protect investors from flimsy or fraudulent token sales.  Risks of investing in ICOs  Any token sold via an ICO is considered a high-risk investment. The market is still under-regulated, scam ICOs are rife and investors have no protection if an ICO fails or turns out to be fraudulent. A 2018 Satis report prepared for Bloomberg stated almost 80% of ICOs at the time were believed to be fraudulent sales.  Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know  For anyone looking to participate in an ICO, it’s important to include the following in your due diligence process:  Review the project’s team to see if they have demonstrable experience creating successful businesses. Ideally, team members should also list their social media accounts so they can be contacted.  Review the project’s white paper and roadmap to see how the intended product or service will work, including when certain features will launch.  Check to see if any computer code has been audited by a third party. This will be a good indication that a project is serious about its security.  Look for typos on the website – this is usually an early red flag that a website has been made quickly with little thought, and could point to it being a scam.  Tokens, especially those that have had successful sales, are usually listed on crypto exchanges. Once listed, new investors who missed out on the token offering have an opportunity to purchase the coins. If a project has marketed itself well, there can be significant demand for its token post-ICO.  It’s become common practice, however, to see ICO investors offload their discounted coins onto the market to secure a quick-and-easy return on their investment or token prices to pump and dump heavily.  Few tokens seldom recovered in price from these types of sell-offs and is a big part of why ICOs are less commonly used today. A study from 2018 showed more than 50% of ICO projects failed to survive longer than four months after launching. Here’s a list of over 2,400 failed ICOs, or “dead coins.”  Further reading  What Is Cryptography?

A schedule for the first batch of five separate Kusama parachain auctions was then set between June and July, with each auction lasting 7 days.

42376099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEO5H,1632898830,"Crypto Exchange CoinJar Secures UK FCA Registration, Advocates For License in Australia","The U.K. subsidiary of Australia’s longest-running crypto exchange has received registration from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and is pushing for similar licensing in Australia.  CoinJar UK, which is based in London, joins a growing list of 10 other registered “cryptoasset firms” including Gemini Europe Ltd.  Beginning last year under the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing legislation, firms carrying out specific crypto activities in the U.K. must adhere to the amended money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds regulations by registering with the FCA.  The exchange is also advocating for a similar license to be implemented in Australia in order to shore up “corporate and consumer confidence” and monitor the industry’s businesses, according to a press release on Wednesday.  While CoinJar originated in Australia in 2013, the exchange relocated to the U.K. a year later as “part of a global expansion” to circumvent Australia’s Goods and Services Tax that, at the time, applied to crypto holders.  Crypto regulation in the country has often been checkered and haphazard, with digital assets becoming a legal asset class as late as 2017.  “The U.K. is a world leader in fintech and a progressive regulator,” said CoinJar CEO Asher Tan. With the establishment of the U.K.-Australia Fintech Bridge, we hope that a similar scheme is replicated here [Australia] via ASIC and AUSTRAC.”  CoinJar Digital Currency and Exchange Services are operated by CoinJar UK Limited, a private limited company registered in England and Wales. Meanwhile, CoinJar’s Australian affiliate is operated by NPS Payment Services Pty Ltd., a related entity within the CoinJar group of companies, according to the exchange’s Australia-based website.  “While we are willing, ready, and organized for cryptocurrency regulation in Australia, until it is brought into effect we aim to set the benchmark for best practice in self-regulation by adhering to the spirit of the FCA obligations on home soil,” Tan added.

42421045,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLEj,1632888302,"Ahead of Crackdown, Huobi Scrambled to Move Staff Out of China, Insiders Say","Months before China’s latest crackdown, the Huobi Global cryptocurrency exchange relocated substantial parts of its operations out of the country, primarily to crypto-friendly Singapore, former and current employees told CoinDesk.  Huobi had been trying to develop overseas operations since China’s earlier clampdown on crypto exchanges in September 2017. The following month, the company set up a separate legal entity in Singapore.  But senior management and a portion of its staff continued to operate in China, until May of this year.  Since then, considerable parts of operations such as business development and marketing began moving overseas, while the less-controversial technical teams remained in China, the current and former employees said.  That way, it would look like Huobi’s company in China was just a tech provider for a crypto exchange that was headquartered and operated abroad, potentially shielding the company from another crackdown, one of the sources said.  On Friday, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced the latest restrictions, which appear to jeopardize even the tech staff Huobi left in place:  “For domestic staff of relevant overseas virtual currency exchanges, as well as legal persons, unincorporated organizations and natural persons who know or should know that they are engaged in virtual currency-related businesses and still provide them with services such as marketing promotion, payment and settlement, technical support, etc., they shall be investigated in accordance with the law.”  The sources, four ex-staffers and one who still works there, did not want to be identified, citing confidentiality agreements. The former employees said they have been keeping up to date with the company by talking to current staff.  They all said that Huobi, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, was trying to hedge its bets over the last few months in case Chinese authorities decided to take action against the company. They said it was hard to tell whether the staff move was a temporary or permanent measure.  When asked on Sept. 22 (the week before the PBoC’s latest measures) about the former employees’ claims, Huobi co-founder Du Jun said the company “is in the process of expanding globally” so “overseas hirings have accordingly increased.” The expansion will “improve Huobi’s ability to ensure business continuity for its users,” Du said.  Following the PBoC’s Friday announcement, a Huobi representative said that “there are no plans to lay off staff,” adding that the company “has been pursuing a global distributed office structure” and that “many of the employees are not in mainland China.”  Gray area  Crypto exchanges were supposedly shut out of China in 2017, when the government prohibited them from allowing Chinese consumers to trade crypto for renminbi.  After the 2017 ban, Huobi, OKEx and other exchanges essentially moved out of China on paper. Huobi continued to operate in Beijing, where senior management stayed, and provided trading services to Chinese customers, the sources said.  “The unspoken secret is that most of [Huobi’s] users are in China,” one source said.  Huobi tacitly acknowledged serving Chinese customers on Saturday when it announced, in response to the new regulations, a plan to stop serving such users by the end of the year. The company also removed mainland China as a country/region option on its registration page. By contrast, Binance said it blocked Chinese users and ceased its exchange business there back in 2017, Chinese media reported.  Regulators allowed Huobi and others to stick around and operate in a grey area.  They were interested in learning more about these businesses and keeping an eye on them, but it looks like “they ran out of patience,” one of the sources said.  Huobi in particular reportedly had a close relationship with China’s central bank, starting around the time of the 2017 ban.  But the exchange received a notice in May 2021 warning that regulation would be tightened further, another one of the people said.  The tides turn  Also in May, the State Council of China called for the country’s top regulators to carry out a sweeping ban on crypto trading and mining, citing financial and environmental concerns. The clampdown intensified over the next few months, culminating with the comprehensive policy plan released on Friday.  In June, Chinese censors started blocking social media and internet results for “Huobi” and other crypto exchanges. Later that month, Huobi said it suspended leverage trading for users in China.  FTX and Binance also scaled back margin trading globally.  But as recently as late July, leverage trading was still available to Huobi’s Chinese users without a VPN, a tool commonly used to bypass China’s Great Firewall, two users told CoinDesk.  Also in June, BTC China announced it was closing down its trading operations and OKEx-affiliated exchange OKCoin shut down a Beijing corporate entity.  In July, while Huobi’s migration was underway, the exchange dissolved its own Beijing-based entity, explaining that it was not in use any more. Mining public disclosures, long-time Chinese reporter Colin Wu tweeted that Huobi hoped to move to Singapore.  On July 31 the PBoC said it would continue its hardline stance on crypto trading in the second half of the year.  About a month later, the central bank said it had completed the “rectification” of illicit crypto transactions.  Culture Clash  When Huobi started moving its staff overseas in May, it still seemed to be a long way from meeting its global aspirations.  The effort after the 2017 crackdown to become a company with global revenue by attracting more non-Chinese customers and organizing overseas offices had mixed results. Two people with direct knowledge of Huobi’s expansion following the 2017 ban described a dysfunctional process.  Huobi hired plenty of local staff in new markets, but decision-making remained firmly with managers at headquarters in Beijing, who often didn’t understand local conditions, the people said.  Many of the company’s top executives don’t speak English, the sources said. This made communication with offices outside China difficult.  A Huobi spokesperson would not directly respond to these claims, but said the company has made “substantial progress” in its “global growth strategy” over the past few years.  The representative said that Huobi’s “business scope covers 140 countries across five continents,” and that it counts over 1,000 employees worldwide.  Outside China, the lack of a common language was detrimental to organizational cohesion, one of the people said.  Huobi branches in Japan and Korea found more success in part because their CEOs spoke Chinese and could better communicate with management in Beijing, the source said.  Because of the importance of local, personal relationships, Huobi is unlikely ever to move fully out of China, the former employee said.  The exchange’s C-suite is barred from leaving the country, according to the Wall Street Journal. As a result, the executives’ direct reports also have to stay in the country to maintain their relationship with their bosses, one source said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/ahead-of-crackdown-huobi-scrambled-to-move-staff-out-of-china-insiders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d7dee8ed5e5664964827ef1107bc62e7c20708f-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Typically, crypto funds use alternative structures that come with a lock-in and costs for clients to get in or out.  “This collective investment scheme license allows institutional clients, and then later retail clients, to invest into crypto assets on a liquid basis through fund structures,” Buehler told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  ”It means there is now the opportunity for institutions to establish their fund structures for crypto as a liquid asset, so people can subscribe today and can sell tomorrow.”  Global context  Cryptocurrency markets across the world may be depressed due to oncoming U.S. regulation or China’s latest crackdown, but Switzerland, with its regulatory clarity, seems to march to the beat of its own drum.  In terms of how asset managers will respond, Buehler estimates crypto should make up around the same tranche size in portfolios as gold going into 2022 – around 3%.  In order to get this license, SEBA had to work with an asset manager, in this case, Switzerland’s Crypto Broker, part of Crypto Finance AG. On the custody side of things, SEBA is developing its own cold storage vault with the help of custody tech partners Fireblocks (which recently opened an office in Switzerland) and Switzerland-based Taurus.  “Institutional adoption is only at the beginning since a lot of institutional capabilities are still lagging the market demand,” Buehler said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/29/switzerlands-seba-bank-snags-first-finma-license-for-liquid-crypto-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db6b158cf83871c5be27843a4cb6cc02066ccc29-4000x2715.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
