9565163,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3937868-bitcoin-set-to-end-week-14-higher-after-tremendous-rally-sees-it-go-past-25k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1676677446,Bitcoin set to end week ~14% higher after tremendous rally sees it go past $25K,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on Friday was on track to end the week 13.8 % higher , in stark contrast to broader equity markets which were weighed down by concerns over the future of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. The weekly rally staged by the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw it surge past the $25K mark on Thursday to touch a multi-month high. Part of the bounce has been due to a so-called ""short squeeze"" that has resulted because of more short liquidations than normal, according to Coinglass data on Wednesday. In a rare dynamic, the surge in prices across cryptocurrencies this week has diverged from the price action of broader U.S. stocks. Crypto traders appeared to have major appetite for risk and seemed to shrug off concerns over more rate hikes from the Fed after hotter-than-expected consumer price index and producer price index reports. ""Bitcoin is in the retreat at the end of the week, not immune it seems to the sharp shift in risk appetite throughout the markets. That comes after an immense rally earlier this week that saw it hit an eight-month high on Thursday,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. ""Regardless, bitcoin bulls will no doubt be excited by recent developments in the price and may feel more optimistic than they have since 2021,"" Erlam added. Some of the sheen was taken off the rally on Friday, with cryptocurrencies weighed down by headlines surrounding Binance ( BNB-USD ) ( BUSD-USD ), which was reportedly weighing cutting off its ties with certain U.S. business affiliates. ""Many crypto traders are paying close attention to the report that Binance might exit relationships with US companies as pressure from regulators intensifies,"" said OANDA analyst Edward Moya. ""Binance is the world's largest exchange and if it abandons key US relationships, that is a major setback for the cryptoverse,"" Moya added. The news about Binance came a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the exchange was expecting to pay fines to settle U.S. regulatory and law enforcement investigations of its business. Looking at the broader picture, Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) weekly surge buoyed the global crypto market cap, which currently stands at $1.12T, up 3.3% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . SEC Pressure Continues The weekly rally in cryptocurrencies came despite continued regulatory crackdown from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some of its actions this week include: On Friday, the SEC said it had brought charges against NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce surrounding misleading statements about tokens sold by EthereumMax. On Thursday, the SEC charged Terraform Labs PTE and Do Hyeong Kwon with allegations of conducting a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the SEC had prepared a draft proposal that could make it hard for hedge funds, private equity firms and pension funds to work with cryptocurrency-related firms. Also on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC would potentially bring charges against stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust over breaching investor protection laws. Paxos was also ordered by the New York Department of Financial Services to end its relationship and stop the issuance of new dollar-pegged BUSD ( BUSD-USD ) tokens. The SEC actions this week come in the wake of the Commission's crackdown on crypto exchange Kraken last week. Countries Act on Crypto The Bank of Russia will launch a pilot program for the country's central bank digital currency at the start of April, according to a report on Friday. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said it would launch a pilot program in April to test out its digital yen. CoinDesk on Thursday reported that cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Canada will come under increased regulatory scrutiny. United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi on Wednesday said that its technology ecosystem, referred to as Hub71 Digital Assets, had committed more than $2B of capital to back web3 startups and blockchain technologies. The UK's financial regulator on Tuesday said it was taking enforcement action against unregistered cryptocurrency ATM operators. Other Notable News Exchange traded funds related to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and to the blockchain in general have skyrocketed in 2023, with a few names having jumped close to or more than 100%. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of independent research provider Fairlead Strategies, told CNBC that stocks and crypto were likely to see retracement amid ""greedy"" sentiment. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was up 3.5% to $24.63K at 1841 ET and ether ( ETH-USD ) was higher by 3.2% to ~$1.70K. SA contributor Kevin George on Monday warned that though investors have cheered the January rally in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the bounce was technical in nature and nothing had changed fundamentally in the world's largest cryptocurrency. Here is the performance of some crypto-related stocks on Friday: Coinbase ( COIN ) -0.6% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +6.8% , MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +3.5% , Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) +3.6% , Bakkt Holdings ( BKKT ) +0.6% , Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) +1.5% .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3937868-bitcoin-set-to-end-week-14-higher-after-tremendous-rally-sees-it-go-past-25k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9565163.jpeg

42414381,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5M0y,1676673137,"Filecoin’s FIL Token Jumps More Than 30%, Sparking Interest in Virtual Machine Launch","Filecoin token FIL rose sharply on Friday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The jump fueled social media excitement about the blockchain’s March launch of its Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a software platform that will introduce smart contracts and enable developers to design decentralized applications on the Filecoin network.  The coin’s price jumped from $5.38 at 10:00 UTC to a high of $7.82 at around 5 p.m. ET (22:00 UTC). FIL was trading at $7.35 at the time of publication, up 36.7%.  It wasn’t immediately clear what prompted the rally.  Twitter user Colin Wu, who tweets under the name Wu Blockchain, generated buzz on the subject by sharing news of the pump along with information about the network’s upcoming smart contracts launch to his more than 250,000 followers.  FVM’s addition to Filecoin will render the network a full-fledged layer 1 blockchain.  The network announced FVM’s launch in September at the FIL Singapore conference, promising the software platform would support an array of user programmable applications such as perpetual storage, storage replication and repair automation and liquid staking through block rewards. The platform also has the capability to support the creation of data-centric decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which would facilitate pay-per-view transactions and the creation of Web3 games, among other applications.  FVM will be interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing Filecoin to form cross-chain bridges enabling crypto funds to move from one blockchain network to another. Its compatibility with EVM and layer 2 blockchains will also decrease user gas fees and increase transaction speed, which Filecoin hopes will bolster its adoption by the decentralized finance (DeFi) community.  DeFi projects, including the development of layer 1 blockchain protocols, have garnered a strong following in the wake of a host of major cryptocurrency firm collapses that have shaken investors’ faith in centralized exchanges.

The Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution claimed the denial of its application was unlawful, alleged the Federal Reserve Board and Biden administration coordinated a series of public statements to accompany the rejection of Custodia's application and said the Federal Reserve Board – not the Kansas City Fed – was ""pulling the strings.""  The Federal Reserve denied Custodia's application to be a member of the Federal Reserve System at the end of January, and Custodia's master account application was rejected ""immediately after,"" the suit said.  ""Defendants had a non-discretionary duty to grant Custodia’s master account application and not to discriminate against Custodia in its ability to access all bank services using that account. Any other outcome eviscerates the dual-banking system that has served our nation since its founding,"" the filing said.  Custodia first sued the Fed last year, alleging at the time that the Fed had missed a legal deadline to make a decision on its application for a master account.  ""Confronted with discovery requests to the Kansas City Fed and a looming deadline for the Board to produce an administrative record that would have revealed the Board’s control over the Kansas City’s Fed’s decision-making process, Defendants tried to moot the litigation. On January 27, 2023, in a coordinated maneuver orchestrated by the Board in consultation with the White House and leaked to reporters by Board officials the day before it occurred, the Kansas City Fed reported the denial of Custodia’s master account application immediately after the Board denied Custodia’s membership application,"" Friday's filing claimed.  The lawsuit makes the case that the Fed cannot reject Custodia's application, noting that the statute says Fed services ""shall be available to nonmember depository institutions.""  In a statement, Custodia spokesperson Nathan Miller said, ""Custodia Bank today continued its ongoing lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank by filing an amended complaint that zeroes in on the core legal issue: whether Congress even granted the Fed discretion to decide master accounts at all.""

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has now jumped in five of the last seven weeks.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, has enjoyed a similar upbeat path, gaining 11.7% during the past seven days.  Liquidated short positions drove BTC prices skyward on Wednesday. Data from crypto information platform Coinglass showed approximately $65 million in BTC liquidations and $42 million in ETH liquidations on Tuesday. By contrast, only $16 million in BTC and $5 million in ETH liquidations occurred on Thursday.  The price increase coincided with higher-than-average volume, a bullish signal in its own regard. Equally high volume Thursday, however, pushed prices to the downside, although prices held most of the prior day’s gains, a sign of resiliency in both BTC and ETH.  Momentum in both has risen in line with performance, but has not yet reached technically overbought levels. BTC appears to be establishing support at $24K, while ETH appears to be settling in near $1,650.  When looking at the top 20 coins by market capitalization, BTC and ETH finished near the middle of the pack, at sixth and seventh, respectively.  OKB, the token for Malta-based crypto exchange OKEx, led gainers, rising nearly 33%, while LEO was the laggard, falling 0.28%.  OKB’s rise follows its launching of a new blockchain dubbed “OKBChain,” which is separate from OKXChain, its current EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible protocol.  According to OKX founder Star Xu, the new blockchain will focus on creating a decentralized ecosystem that allows users to access decentralized applications. OKB also released a proof-of-reserves report in January, announcing $7.5 billion in BTC, ETH and tether (USDT).  OKB is up 168% over the last 90 days and 99.2% year to date.

OpenSea said in a tweet that for “a limited time” it will charge 0% in marketplace fees, and default all collections without on-chain royalty enforcement to optional creator royalties starting at 0.5%.  The marketplace has also adjusted its blocklist of other marketplaces that don't honor full royalty payments to creators, allowing sales on NFT marketplaces with the same policies.

On Wednesday, Blur’s trading volume surpassed OpenSea for the first time since it went live in October.  OpenSea has taken a hardline stance in the debate over creator royalties, launching a royalty enforcement tool in November that allows new collections listed on the site to delegate royalties on-chain. This tool also blocks these collections from being resold on marketplaces that don’t enforce royalties, like X2Y2 and Blur.  In January, Blur reportedly found a loophole in this tool, allowing collections that enforced royalties on OpenSea to uphold their percentages on Blur. On Wednesday, Blur published a blog post aimed at NFT creators that laid out the differences in royalty payment options between its platform and OpenSea, encouraging its users to blocklist OpenSea in order for creators to collect full royalties on its platform.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/17/opensea-goes-zero-fee-creator-royalties-optional,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35cdc41cf0c4d49c2cdb92b2049bcfafc1f36b86-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414388,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5Ms2,1676668105,Arbitrum Native Decentralized Exchange Camelot Growing Massively in February,"Camelot, a relatively new decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Arbitrum network, has seen huge growth since launching at the end of 2022. Daily trading volume has jumped 369% since the first day of February, hitting $18 million on Friday at presstime, according to Camelot’s analytics page.  So, too, has the price of Camelot’s native token, GRAIL. It’s up 520% this month, recently fetching $2,833.47, per CoinGecko. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, the number of users and transactions on Camelot has grown more than 120% in the past day.  Camelot’s recent strides coincide with similar progress for Arbitrum, the biggest Ethereum layer 2 scaling system. It’s also the fourth-largest blockchain overall in terms of total value locked (TVL), with more transaction volume than even Ethereum’s main network.  The surge in users and transaction volume in the past day corresponds with the launch of TROVE, the governance token for yield-bearing index protocol Arbitrove, which is also built on Arbitrum. The public sale of TROVE occurred on Camelot on Friday, Feb. 17, and will end on Monday, Feb. 20, at 9 a.m. ET (14:00 UTC).  Camelot’s tokenomics includes two tokens – GRAIL and a nontransferable governance token called xGRAIL – to create a balance between incentivizing users to grow liquidity on the protocol and enhancing the long-term health of Camelot’s ecosystem, according to its documents. Arbitrum’s top decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange, GMX, uses a similar dual token model.  Camelot redistributes its swap fee earnings to xGRAIL token holders and uses the earnings to buy and burn GRAIL from the open market to maintain constant buying pressure for the DEX’s native token.  Additionally, the first GRAIL bond market on Camelot will go live later on Feb. 17, allowing users to purchase GRAIL and xGRAIL at a discount to the market.  Camelot’s TVL, a popular statistic measuring the overall value of crypto assets deposited into the protocol, is on a tear, core contributors said on a Feb 16 community call. The Arbitrum native DEX’s TVL has jumped 276% to $62.71 million in the month of February, according to DeFi TVL aggregator DeFiLlama.  Arbitrum doesn’t yet have a dominant DEX, according to Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.  ""No de facto DEX on Arbitrum (yet) means the market will look to find a Velodrome equivalent,” he said to CoinDesk, referring to the most popular automated market maker on rival layer 2 network Optimism. Velodrome boasts a TVL of $216.32 million, per DeFiLlama.  GMX, the largest project on Arbitrum with a focus on financial derivatives, has a TVL of $505 million, 794% bigger than Camelot’s, per DeFiLlama and has 356% more transactions than Camelot in the past 30 days, per Nansen.  But Camelot is catching up. Nansen data shows that in the same time period, GMX has seen a 15% increase in users and 22% rise in transactions, while the number of users and transactions on Camelot soared 242% and 384%, respectively.  Even though Arbitrum developers haven’t stated any plans for a token or airdrop yet, the increased activity on Camelot, and subsequently on Arbitrum, may be attributed to users hoping to boost their on-chain activity as a means to receive an Arbitrum airdrop, added Teng.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARB | AIRDROP,Sage D.

This week, the SEC filed a complaint against the Singapore-based crypto company and Kwon, claiming they mislead investors about the terraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin. According to the complaint, Terra and Kwon engaged in fraud, the sale of unregistered securities and the sale of unregistered security-based swaps. The Terra ecosystem collapsed in mid-2022, with reverberations subsequently felt throughout the crypto industry. Kwon is being sought by Interpol.  The SEC’s complaint further alleges Terra misled investors by misrepresenting the health and stability of UST, which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar. Terra's LUNA token played an important role in maintaining the price of the UST stablecoin.  “UST’s price falling below its $1 peg and not quickly being restored by the algorithm would spell doom for the entire Terraform ecosystem, given that UST and LUNA had no reserve of assets or any other backing,” the filing stated.  “When you market LUNA as something that can be obtained by exchanging [UST] and that the value of LUNA will also increase depending on the various actions that are taken … that's also a security,” Massad said.  Read more: SEC Sues Terraform Labs, Do Kwon for Misleading Investors on TerraUSD Stablecoin  Massad, who believes the SEC and CFTC can work together on regulating crypto by using a self-regulatory organization (SRO), said he thinks there are areas of the industry that need clarity and a comprehensive framework. However, it may come down to reading between the lines.  “The industry often complains about lack of regulatory clarity, but you just need to have good lawyers who can read the law and say, ‘Yeah, that’s probably a security,’” he said.  No need to wait on stablecoin regulation  Massad said investors don't have to wait for Congress to act on regulating stablecoins.  “While legislation would be great, we don't need to wait for legislation,” Massad said, noting he co-authored a white paper on that very topic in August that was published by the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center.  “Bank regulators have the ability today to create a framework that could license stablecoin issuers [and] require that the tokens be fully backed by cash or Treasury securities,” he said. If bank regulators so choose, he added, they could impose requirements for capital and liquidity, including how, where and what chains stablecoins are traded on, while ensuring that “those chains have adequate resilience and procedures.”  Read more: Jump Crypto Is Unnamed Firm That Made $1.28B From Do Kwon’s Doomed Terra Ecosystem: Sources",POSITIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/17/former-cftc-chairman-sec-was-absolutely-right-to-sue-terraform-labs-do-kwon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/278d1dae8bd5f9fc971e66aad86f023aa806e76f-1718x976.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421369,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuA9,1676658514,Bitcoin Ordinals Can Lift the Entire Crypto Ecosystem,"Let me posit two reasons why, over the past month, bitcoin has surged to its highest level since mid-August and outperformed every other major asset in both crypto and traditional markets.  Together, they highlight the unique advantage that Bitcoin draws from its status as the oldest, most established and most decentralized protocol and from a surprising new opportunity to harness that.  The arrival of the Ordinals Protocol, which enables users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, essentially creating Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens. This has demonstrated a new, high-value use case for the longest-running cryptocurrency chain. Already, one report from research firm FSInsight argues that an Ordinals-driven resurgence in development and the expansion in the total value transacted and secured over the Bitcoin blockchain should drive up its price.  A string of U.S. regulatory actions has highlighted the risks that many, if not all, major non-Bitcoin blockchains will fall afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler’s hardline position that most tokens are securities. It appears bitcoin is the one reliable exception to that. That’s making it attractive in relative terms to Ethereum’s ether, Solana’s SOL and all others.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Many “maxis” might celebrate this moment as proof that their beloved Bitcoin is proving itself as the one and only – except perhaps those who see the addition of “JPEGs”to its blockchain as an abuse of Satoshi’s original intent to form a new system of money.  But I’ve never thought it constructive to view the crypto landscape through the maxis’ zero-sum-game lens. And right now, while it might seem as if they should be running a victory lap, it’s possible to look at that same landscape and see a much more integrated, constructive future for all crypto protocols emerging out of this moment.  Layer 0  Over time, I see a situation emerging in which Bitcoin functions as a kind of uber-anchor for everything. Its role will be to be a kind of ultimate “layer 0” record of truth. Meanwhile, Ethereum and other smart contract platforms could take on higher-level functionality, with each specializing in different types of transactions and data-processing that the rather clunky, limited-function Bitcoin blockchain is not built to perform. It will need greater cross-chain operability, but there are plenty of people working on that.  Read more: Bitcoin NFTs Challenge the Blockchain’s Largest Use Case: Money  Most other layer 1 crypto protocols – meaning base-layer blockchains with their own native tokens – are based on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, including Ethereum. With the Securities and Exchange Commission shutting down Kraken’s staking service in the U.S., signaling that it will be difficult for all but the most sophisticated retail U.S. investors to participate in those blockchains’ validating networks, investing in ether and other such tokens seems poised to become the domain of institutional players.  This is not ideal – especially because of the risk of censorship and regulatory capture that comes from centralizing staking pools in corporate hands. But here’s where, in a world of integrated, interoperable cross-chain transactions, Bitcoin’s base layer of immutable record-keeping could act as protection against such threats.  Bitcoin’s wide, geographically dispersed community of users and miners ensures that governments will have a hard time shutting it down. The fact that Satoshi’s absence has left authorities with no lead developer to subpoena also puts this in a different realm from all the other protocols for whom there are mostly identifiable founders.  The bottom line is that Bitcoin has proven to be sufficiently decentralized that U.S. authorities have conceded that the leading cryptocurrency is not a security. In this new, politically tense environment, this gives it a distinct advantage.  Bitcoin finds a new community of innovators  It’s also why the Ordinals Protocol is so important. The Bitcoin blockchain now has a purpose beyond peer-to-peer payments, whose mainstream appeal has always been undermined by regulation of the on- and off-ramps to the banking system and by bitcoin’s own price volatility. Now that it incorporates NFTs – the most important crypto innovation since Bitcoin itself – the Bitcoin blockchain is engaging with creators of digital content, the backbone of the internet economy. That will unleash a torrent of new creative innovation in the space.  As that happens, it will drive others in the crypto community to build better bridges and integrations between Bitcoin and alternative protocols. It could accelerate the work already being done by developers working on Cosmos, Polkadot, Polygon and other bridging and interoperability protocols to build mechanisms for moving assets across chains and reduce crypto industry participants’ dependencies on singular layer 1 blockchains.  Read more: The Ordinals Protocol Has Caused a Resurgence in Bitcoin Development  Already this week, the NFT Capsule team at blockchain services company Bloq launched “Ordinary Oranges,” a collection of Bitcoin-inscribed NFTs that are accessible on the Ethereum mainnet and have a “burn” option that returns the NFT to the Bitcoin chain.  The beauty of such arrangements is that users can have the security of a Bitcoin-proven asset while also tapping the greater programmability of decentralized applications and layer 2 protocols running on the Ethereum virtual machine, as well as the deeper liquidity that exists in Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.  I see these kinds of developments leading to a more integrated crypto ecosystem in which different protocols perform different functions, with all of it anchored into a 15-year-old deeply established proof-of-work blockchain that no U.S. regulator can shut down.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Michael J.

42414389,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5MxL,1676656906,Coinbase Exec: US Congress Needs to ‘Step Up’ Its Crypto Regulatory Efforts,"Coinbase, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, would be willing to register its dormant broker dealers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as long as lawmakers provide clear direction for the crypto industry, said Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at the centralized exchange.  “We need Congress to step up,” Shirzad said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday. “We've got bipartisan leaders in the House, Senate [and] all relevant committees … who've all stepped up and said, ‘we want to bring crypto under regulation.’”  In contrast, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has said the federal agency’s existing rules already provide clear regulations for crypto platforms that issue tokens, and that the agency’s securities laws could be applied directly to the crypto markets.  But Shirzad pointed out that “every crypto token is not a security,” and that the debate over whether “every crypto is a security or not is a very American one.” According to him, the U.S. approach to crypto regulation does not mirror what is going on in other countries and thus could be stifling innovation.  “There’s no other country in the world that has as fragmented a regulatory system as we do,” he said, noting that the U.S. is perhaps among the only countries in the world to use two different market regulators, one for commodities – the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – and a securities regulator, the SEC.  “In every other country in the world … there’s one market regulator,” Shirzad said. “They provide ground rules around what kind of investor protections [and] market integrity rules you need, and the crypto ecosystem can operate under those rules,” he said, giving crypto companies the ability to “to innovate, grow, develop, [and] provide products that customers want, while ensuring customers get the protections and disclosures that they need.”  Whether the U.S.-based centralized exchange would register with the SEC as a regulated exchange, Shirzad said that it “would love to register” the two dormant broken dealers it owns but that “the reality is there is no path to registration.”  “It’s not a matter of coming in and talking, filling out a form and registering,” he said. “‘Has anyone successfully done it? What would you register as? How do you overcome the fact that tokenized assets are not allowed to be traded either on a broker dealer or on a national stock exchange? What’s the workaround to allow crypto markets generally or tokenized debt or equity to trade in an SEC authorized way?’”  But at the moment, Shirzad said, “there is no clarity and no path on any of that.”  Is staking in danger?  Shirzad said he does not know whether all staking is under attack in the U.S., but he sees a need for the U.S. to at least push to be a competitive crypto player.  “It’s really important for the United States to remain a part of the crypto ecosystem,” Shirzad said, and that if the U.S. were to fall behind in crypto innovation, “it would be catastrophic for American national security interests.”  But crypto could face challenges as the SEC continues to trudge along its regulatory enforcement roll.  Last week, the agency settled with and fined crypto exchange Kraken, ordering it to close down its staking-as-a-service platform to its U.S. customers. Nearly a week later, it said it would plan to bring enforcement action against stablecoin issuer Paxos for the alleged sale of an unregistered security token, Binance USD (BUSD). This week, the agency said it would be suing stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, for misleading investors.  For the time being, Shirzad said “It's only fair that all of us who are trying to build this really dynamic and transformational ecosystem should have some clear rules for the road,” he said.

42414387,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5Mmj,1676656820,Coinbase Investors Prepare for Another Likely Disappointing Quarter,"Coinbase (COIN) shares were down about 3.5% Friday, faring better than many of its crypto stock peers as the overall tech sector was hit hard and the price of bitcoin fell 1% over the past 24 hours. MicroStrategy (MSTR) was down almost 8.5%, while miners such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Argo Blockhain (ARBK) were down more than 6% each.  But investors in Coinbase will likely have to prepare themselves for another lackluster round of quarterly results from the U.S.-based crypto exchange when it posts its fourth-quarter and yearly 2023 earnings report on Tuesday after the market close.  Analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate Coinbase’s revenue fell to $589 million in the final quarter of the year, down just a hair from the $590 million reported in the previous quarter, which was already crippled from negative sentiment in the crypto space following the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius Network in July.  “We think fourth-quarter [earnings] and 2023 guidance are likely to disappoint, and we see little risk of the stock getting away from us at least around earnings,” Chris Brendler of D.A. Davidson wrote in a note Thursday. Brendler downgraded shares of Coinbase from buy to neutral because he thinks a breather may be in order after the stock almost doubled in value so far this year.  As for full-year results, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in December the company’s revenue will be half or less of what it was in 2021. The crypto exchange has struggled amid sharp price drops in cryptocurrency prices and continuing ripple effects from the collapse of rival exchange FTX.  Analyst estimates for Coinbase’s annual revenue in 2022 are currently set for $3.1 billion, which would be a 61% drop from the previous year.  “​​Anyone trading Coinbase shares should buckle up for this upcoming earnings report,” said Oanda’s Edward Moya. “Option activity implies we will once again see a major move following the earnings release. A near 20% move could occur following their results and earnings call.”  Expectations for 2023  Investors will be especially looking for more guidance on what 2023 holds for the exchange, given the tumultuous start to the year for the crypto industry.  Crypto-related assets including Coinbase have rallied significantly so far in 2023. COIN is up over 95% year to date while bitcoin (BTC) crossed the $25,000 mark for the first time in six months on Thursday. For the year, bitcoin is up 47%, while the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up more than 46% for the year.  But regulatory actions by the U.S. government – including the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) shutdown of Kraken’s staking service in the U.S. as well as the Commission’s plan to sue Paxos for allegedly selling BUSD as an unregistered security – have cast a shadow over the industry’s recent bull run.  “We would expect regulation to be at the forefront of this earnings call,” Needham analyst John Todardo told CoinDesk. “The main focus will be on staking as well as [stablecoin] USDC as both segments saw regulatory read-throughs recently.”  JPMorgan analysts on Friday cut their price target for Coinbase shares from $60 to $52 due to ongoing regulatory risks to the company’s digital-focused businesses, including staking, USDC stablecoin and custody. The Wall Street bank wrote that it sees Coinbase’s staking business particularly at risk because it had anticipated Coinbase would auto-enroll its clients in Ethereum staking following the Shanghai Fork in March, which would have the potential to increase the exchange’s revenue by up to $1 billion.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned other platforms could be subject to investigations into their staking services, which could include Coinbase. The exchange’s staking business has potential for speedy growth if the SEC doesn’t crack down on the service.  However, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has argued that his exchange’s staking business is “fundamentally different” from Kraken’s.

Blockchain intelligence firm Nansen also labeled the address as BlockTower Capital’s.  BlockTower did not immediately return CoinDesk’s request for comment.

According to people familiar with the matter, it was Chicago-based Jump Crypto, a company whose parent has deep roots in conventional finance and has become a giant in digital assets.  A spokesperson for Jump Crypto said the company had no comment. The news was first reported by The Block.  Read More: SEC Sues Terraform Labs, Do Kwon for Misleading Investors on TerraUSD Stablecoin  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) complaint this week accused Kwon and Terraform of committing securities fraud and selling unregistered securities that hurt U.S. retail and institutional investors. Within the complaint there’s reference to an unnamed U.S. trading firm that had an exclusive market-making arrangement with Terraform Labs, the developer of the UST stablecoin. That anonymous firm was not accused of wrongdoing.  That company – which CoinDesk’s sources identified as Jump Crypto – was able to buy heavily discounted luna tokens, the assets that supported UST. The firm deployed only $62 million to help keep UST’s price near $1 in May 2021, according to the SEC complaint, but earned $1.28 billion by selling off discounted tokens that it had purchased according to the terms of its agreement with Terraform Labs.  Jump Crypto was active in the Terra ecosystem, frequently posting governance proposals and heavily invested in the project, including building a Terra cross-chain bridge and co-leading a $1 billion capital raise to seed the Luna Foundation Guard. Jump Crypto President Kanav Kariya also served on the board of the Luna Foundation Guard, which stewarded Terra’s multi-billion-dollar bitcoin reserve treasury. The reserves were depleted in May 2022 in a failed attempt to restore UST’s dollar peg and also siphoned to a Swiss bank account controlled by Kwon, according to the SEC complaint.  Terraform’s terms  Terraform Labs said that UST, Terra’s ill-fated “decentralized” stablecoin, would stay pegged to the price of $1 solely as a result of a state-of-the-art “algorithm.” That algorithm – which was codified in blockchain-based computer code called smart contracts – was supposed to print and burn luna, UST’s speculative sister token, to serve as a sort of shock absorber for UST’s price.  The SEC contends, however, that Terra’s stablecoin ecosystem relied on human-driven market-making operations – rather than autonomous bits of computer code – to stay afloat.  Read More: Jump Crypto's Bet on a Decentralized, Cross-Chain Future  According to the SEC, Terraform Labs recruited an unnamed “third party” trading firm – Jump Crypto, according to CoinDesk’s sources – to serve as a market maker for its token ecosystem. According to the terms of the agreement, the SEC said, there were instances when the trading firm was able to buy luna for as little as 40 cents while it traded for $90 on the open market.  When the UST stablecoin briefly wobbled a few cents off of its $1 peg in May 2021, Terraform framed its eventual recovery as a proof-case for the success of its algorithm. But according to the SEC, the stablecoin was only actually able to recover as a result of the third party, which stepped in to covertly buy up Terra's tokens to backstop the market sell-off.  The SEC says Terra modified its market-making agreements with the firm after this sell-off event, removing the preconditions it needed to satisfy in order to buy up discounted tokens.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,"Tracy Wang, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/17/jump-crypto-is-unnamed-firm-that-made-128b-from-do-kwons-doomed-terra-ecosystem-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13a06ba7a815568df7a76fc1b6df99dc2b57f8a8-4485x3364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421373,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuGL,1676650628,4 Huge Revelations in the SEC’s Charges Against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday released a 55-page document detailing various charges of fraud against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs, the so-called ""company"" Kwon founded to develop the Terra blockchain. Broadly, the SEC alleges that Kwon and others “engaged in a scheme to deceive and mislead investors … in the U.S. and abroad.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     The documents also contain a number of major revelations – claims that were previously merely suspected or entirely unknown, but that the SEC appears to have confirmed in its investigation. The SEC’s findings paint a much clearer picture of the entire Terra system as a fraud, one just as elaborate and calculated as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. They also point to a variety of unnamed counterparties who could eventually be targeted as collaborators in the fraud.  Here are four of the most important discoveries.  1. TerraUSD’s 'stability' was a complete and conscious fabrication.  The most important new information laid out by the SEC is that in May 2021, when it experienced a small depegging from its $1 target price, Terraform and Kwon “secretly discussed with a third party that the third party would purchase massive amounts of UST to restore the $1.00 peg.” This worked, and terraUSD returned to $1.  But this bailout was not discussed publicly. Instead, Kwon and others cited the May 2021 restoration of the peg as proof that terraUSD was “automatically self-heal[ing].” This narrative, which the SEC calls a complete fabrication, was key to enticing subsequent investors into the scheme.  See also: Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon Still Says He's Not on the Run  This is a precise analogue of the fake laboratory tests that earned Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes a decade-plus prison sentence.  2. Do Kwon and his allies are cashing out – big time.  There have been a variety of tentative attempts to trace funds, particularly bitcoin, flowing out of Terraform Labs and affiliated entities after the collapse of the Terra system. Most recently, a South Korean news site claimed to have spotted Do Kwon cashing out about $100,000 worth of BTC in Serbia.  But the SEC allegations include vastly more concrete and sweeping claims. They claim that Kwon and accomplices “transferred over 10,000 bitcoin from Terraform and Luna Foundation Guard … accounts to an un-hosted wallet.”  They have, the SEC claims, converted over $100 million of that bitcoin into fiat withdrawals through a Swiss bank since June 2022. So Do Kwon may yet be living very high indeed in his Serbian spider hole.  3. The Chai 'deal' was even faker than we thought.  It has long been understood that Do Kwon overstated the extent and duration of the relationship between Terra and the Chai payments platform, an e-commerce system in South Korea. Specifically, Kwon was known to have claimed Chai was using Terra for payments processing long after any such partnership had ended.  But the SEC details far more proactive, in some cases incredibly elaborate, efforts to misrepresent the Chai-Terra relationship. Above all, it describes the use of a server, known internally at Terraform as the “LP Server,” which “replicated the real transactions that Chai was processing in Korean won.” In reality, according to the charges, “no Chai transactions occurred on the blockchain.”  In other words, not only did Do Kwon exaggerate the Chai-Terra relationship in his own statements, he created an entire fake server to move fake money around to simulate fake transactions, with the clear goal of deceiving investors.  4. It turns out US regulation does matter.  Finally, one for fun: In an infamous 2021 interview on CoinDesk TV, anchor Christine Lee challenged Do Kwon on his apparent disregard for U.S. regulators and enforcement. He said U.S. regs were “not that interesting.”  Well, even if Do Kwon wasn’t interested in U.S. law, U.S. law is very interested in Do Kwon. As detailed in the new charging documents, Kwon and his team “engaged in conduct within the United States that constituted significant steps in furtherance” of their alleged crimes. The documents detail a healthy number of U.S. victims and argue the conduct described “had a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States,” giving ample legal standing for the SEC’s charges.  One final detail may be the most gratifying (and funniest) of all for those eagerly awaiting a reckoning for Do Kwon’s unique cocktail of idiocy, duplicity and hubris. Among the activities cited as providing legal standing for a U.S. prosecution of Kwon are the use of his infamous, bullying Twitter account to promote terraUSD to Americans. He also notoriously used Twitter to belittle and dismiss critics who warned of exactly the flaws that led to terraUSD’s implosion last May.  This wealth of new information is, frankly, a bit unusual in this sort of charging document, particularly in crypto-fraud cases.

Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao is looking to end relationships with U.S. banks and service firms, and is also re-evaluating its U.S. venture capital investments, according to Bloomberg’s source. Binance is also considering delisting tokens issued by U.S.-based projects, including Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Bloomberg wrote.  Shortly after the report was published on Friday, Zhao denied the exchange was considering delisting tokens attached to U.S.-based projects on Twitter, adding blockchain “has no borders.”  “We pulled back on some potential investments, or bids on bankrupt companies in the U.S. for now. Seek permission first,” Zhao said in another tweet.  The New York Department of Financial Services earlier this week took action against Binance-branded stablecoin Binance BUSD, which is issued by Paxos, and Binance has also been scrutinized for its transactions with crypto bank Silvergate. The crypto exchange has been investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service.  U.S. regulators have been taking heavy enforcement action against crypto players in the last couple of weeks, leaving Binance bracing itself for SEC fines after crypto exchange Kraken was forced to shut down its staking service in the U.S. and pay a $30 million fine.  Binance’s U.S. customers are serviced by Binance.US, which claims to operate completely independently and says it has no plans to leave the U.S., according to Bloomberg.  Earlier this month, Binance said it was temporarily suspending U.S. dollar bank transfers by its customers.  “Like every other blockchain company, we are conducting a careful cost-benefit analysis and will pivot our business as necessary to protect our global user base,” a Binance spokesman said in an email to CoinDesk.

JPMorgan cited ongoing regulatory risks to the company’s digital-focused businesses, including staking, USDC stablecoin and custody, as the main reasons for the change in outlook.  “While we continue to agree with the consensus view that thoughtful rules and regulations are what is needed to deliver greater confidence in and growth for the crypto ecosystem, we see regulation through enforcement as a risk to digital-focused businesses,” analysts wrote. “However, recent actions by the [Securities and Exchange Commission] put different pieces at risk, including staking, USDC stablecoin and custody.”  Coinbase shares were down 0.5% to $65.27 on Friday morning.  Coinbase’s staking business is particularly at risk because JPMorgan had anticipated Coinbase would auto-enroll its clients in Ethereum staking following the Shanghai Fork currently set for March, bringing Coinbase up to $1 billion in revenue, the note said.  The Shanghai Fork is a network upgrade that will address staked ether withdrawals and reductions in gas fees for developers. It is considered to be a new era for the Ethereum ecosystem.  “Given the regulatory environment, we see a more cautious Coinbase avoiding auto-enrollment,” JPMorgan said. “While [ether] staking still presents a revenue opportunity, we expect it will be much smaller and will take much longer to develop.”  Read more: Coinbase Downgraded to Neutral at DA Davidson Ahead of Earnings",NEGATIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/17/jpm-cuts-coinbase-price-target-due-to-regulatory-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b72c814a5f36ec4258e84c9181120f4a0e8b3717-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC filed suit against the company and Kwon for misleading customers on a number of issues, including the sale of unregistered securities.  The filing alleges the defendants first transferred more than 10,000 bitcoin ""from Terraform and Luna Foundation Guard crypto asset platform accounts to an un-hosted wallet,"" which was used to store crypto outside of custody or exchange platforms.  ""On a periodic basis since May 2022, Terraform and Kwon have transferred – and continue to transfer – [b]itcoin from this wallet to a financial institution based in Switzerland and have converted the [b]itcoin to cash,"" the filing said, adding that since June 2022, more than $100 million was withdrawn from that Swiss bank.  The complaint adds that by the end of May, crypto tokens attached to the enterprise including the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and luna token ""were essentially worthless, wiping out more than $40 billion in combined market value.""  The collapse of Kwon's crypto enterprise last year sent ripples through the industry and set off a series of high-profile bankruptcies that are ongoing. Authorities in South Korea, who are looking for the disgraced founder, have also frozen funds that are suspected to be tied to him.  Swiss financial regulator FINMA declined to comment on the case, and said it ""regularly cooperates (actively and passively) with international authorities in the context of administrative assistance.""

The company made its last payment to Stone Tower Air LLC in October 2022, just before it stopped making debt payments to its lenders. The world’s largest bitcoin miner by computing power filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December.  ""Levitt is one of the lowest-paid employees on salary, making $60k annually. The only incentive for him is to increase shareholder value, which is why he offered his jet at a discounted rate for employees,"" a company spokeswoman told CoinDesk.  Stone Tower Air flies an Embraer ERJ-135BJ Legacy 600, according to Airfleets.net and other airplane tracking websites.  ""For efficient travel and use of time, Stone Tower Air is a charter flight company used in the past by Core Scientific for transporting employees, clients and potential clients between our data center sites in remote locations,"" which are often far from major airports, the spokeswoman said. She also noted that the move saves the company money with below-market rates versus using a third-party charter.  While the private-jet travel was revealed in an earlier filing, stating that the company had reimbursed “certain officers and directors of the Company for use of a personal aircraft for flights taken on Company business,"" the direct link to Levitt was not.  The U.S. bankruptcy code primarily defines “affiliated” persons as those that directly or indirectly own or control 20% or more of the voting power of a given company.  Core Scientific remains the largest bitcoin miner in the world, in terms of hashrate, through its restructuring process.

42421379,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuKT,1676641500,Bitcoin NFTs Challenge the Blockchain’s Largest Use Case: Money,"There has been a lot of noise and questions recently about Ordinal Inscriptions.  So what are they? The simple answer is that ordinals are non-fungible tokens (NFT) you can mint on the Bitcoin blockchain.  But Ordinal Inscriptions aren’t your usual NFTs. Unlike Ethereum NFTs, which depend on off-chain metadata that can be modified, Ordinal Inscriptions enable all data to be inscribed directly on-chain.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  It was this flaw in Ethereum NFTs that caused software engineer Casey Rodarmor to deem Ethereum NFTs incomplete and launch the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol.  Those in favor of change believe Ordinal Inscriptions could cause an important shift in the bitcoin community and improve the technology behind NFTs.  Yet, many questions I’ve been receiving from clients boil down to, “is this good or bad for bitcoin?” and “will this disrupt the usability of it.”  A case against change?  Despite the potential benefits of Ordinal Inscriptions, there has been a lot of debate over whether they are a “good use” of block space.  The challenge has been that as more Ordinals are being inscribed, the cost of bitcoin transactions has risen. That’s because Ordinals introduce additional, non-financial data on the Bitcoin blockchain that bog down on-chain confirmation times. This includes images, audio clips, even games.  Those not in favor of Ordinals see this as an impediment to the ability of Bitcoin to scale and reach full global adoption.  Inscribing non-fungible characteristics to satoshis, the individual increments of bitcoin, may challenge bitcoin’s use case as first and foremost money.  Ordinals challenge the fungibility of satoshis in the Bitcoin network. All satoshis should be equal or they begin to lose a significant trait of money.  But Ordinals can alter the value of these units of money. Take rare collectible coins as an example: While a penny may have a face value of exactly 1 cent, its design and mint year could make it worth a dollar or more in the eyes of some beholders.  This debate over whether these individual units must be deemed equal is unfolding before our eyes, and I think it needs to be understood.  Bitcoin is money, and that’s the largest and most important use case, impacting the most people in the world. Which is why I believe that Ordinals and other use cases both known today and yet to emerge will remain niche.  I view this as an exciting period – but one that, as many fads do, will fade. I don’t see Ordinals being the desire for many to use Bitcoin’s block space.  Bitcoin is money. In my opinion, any changes to the protocol should be slow and methodological.  Read more: To Understand Bitcoin, We Need to Understand What Money Is  Ultimately, the markets decide  One of the biggest yet baseless claims I often hear is how Bitcoin doesn’t evolve or change.  Now, are there kernels of truth in that? Sure. You don’t “move fast and break things” when working to build the next global monetary system; we’ll leave that for VC start-up tech firms.  However, there have been some upgrades that demonstrate the need and merit of change. The Lightning Network, for example, could accelerate bitcoin commerce and everyday use.  Inscriptions are yet another example of attempts to change the blockchain. Inscriptions became eligible in bitcoin blocks with the most recent upgrade to the protocol called Taproot.  Read more: Taproot, Bitcoin’s Long-Anticipated Upgrade, Has Activated  Ultimately, the beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it’s permissionless and the ultimate free market for uses. And this is what fosters change.  At the same time, free and open markets will dictate if Ordinals are demanded and are valuable. The permissionless nature of Bitcoin allows for this competition to play out.  Ordinals may stick around if individuals want to see them become a mainstay in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is governed by consensus rule – which is why running a node is essential and why the ""blocksize war"" was foundational for Bitcoin.  Ordinals are not an attack on Bitcoin but could begin conversations again with a hard or soft fork. I view a hard fork as Ordinals' most painful and trying outcome.  The advisor takeaway  As an advisor with clients with bitcoin and questions on Ordinals, the most significant takeaways revolve around what makes bitcoin unique. Most, if not all, other cryptocurrencies are decentralized in name only – Bitcoin is not.  But due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, developers are free to modify Bitcoin’s current rule set. If demand is there and the modifications result in splits in bitcoin holders and the community, investors will have a choice over what to do with their money.  If we see a hard fork, any new tokens or projects would accrue to clients and they could then decide if they want to hold, sell or buy.  While it might seem scary, I doubt Ordinals will create that much friction and division within Bitcoin. Even if it did, one could be passive and simply let the market forces play out. Being an open, permissionless protocol allows for moments like this to occur, and that’s healthy in the long term.  Regardless of opinions of “right” or “wrong,” seeing the conversations and debates happening about Ordinals is good. It allows bitcoin to test its resilience and robustness. We will continue having these conversations as Bitcoin proceeds on its path toward global adoption.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/17/bitcoin-nfts-challenge-the-blockchains-largest-use-case-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b382c9698252d5bc6e574343da45947707b338aa-7071x4985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC alleged that investors were misled about the stability of the algorithmic stablecoin UST, the depegging of which from the U.S. dollar “spelled doom for the entire Terra ecosystem.” The collapse of terraUSD last year sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry and was followed by a wave of bankruptcies of prominent firms, and ultimately the meltdown of crypto exchange FTX in November.  DeFi protocol Platypus Finance suffered a flash-loan attack worth over $8.5 million resulting in its stablecoin USP losing its dollar peg and falling to 48 cents. The hacker had exploited a flaw in the USP solvency check mechanism, making Platypus smart contracts think USP was fully backed. “They used a flash loan to exploit a logic error in the USP solvency check mechanism in the contract holding the collateral,” Platypus tweeted. A flash loan is a form of unbacked borrowing used on decentralized finance lending protocols to make quick profits when opportunities arise. Hackers make use of them to destabilize and drain tokens from such protocols.  Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi is looking to dismiss the bankruptcy case of Emergent Fidelity Technologies, a shell company 90% owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Emergent is the owner of 56 million shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and little else. BlockFi is claiming legal access to the stock, worth nearly $600 million at HOOD’s current price, as security for a loan made in November. By filing for bankruptcy in the U.S., Emergent liquidators are making things more complex, according to BlockFi, describing it as a “futile act,” given that the company has no employees, income or business. The Robinhood shares were seized by the U.S. Department of Justice in January as part of its investigation of fraud against Bankman-Fried.

42410833,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggru4r,1676638800,Crypto Has an Incest Problem,"Last year, failings at crypto issuer Terra ricocheted across the crypto ecosystem, ultimately claiming crypto exchange FTX, a giant in the space. This investigation of court records shows how the millions – if not billions – of dollars’ worth of exposures among companies including Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network allowed a ripple to turn into a tsunami.  It’s well known that crypto companies are closely intertwined, but privately owned firms like FTX don’t usually have to reveal their financial secrets. That changed when the exchange was placed in the transparent fish tank of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The numbers show a network that was interlocking, if not outright incestuous. That made the system overall less resilient. Legally untangling the mess is going to prove a long and costly process, spelling bad news for those hoping for their money back. Regulators are already setting themselves to the task of ensuring that it doesn’t happen again.  On Jan. 30, FTX’s sister trading firm, Alameda Research, sought to regain around $446 million it had transferred to bankrupt lender Voyager Digital. Voyager and its creditors declined, saying Alameda’s “inequitable and fraudulent conduct” had cost them over $114 million.  But that’s just the start of the mapping of finances among crypto companies – including hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Genesis, and lenders Celsius and BlockFi – that are now undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. (Genesis, like CoinDesk, is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group).  3AC contagion begins  After the terraUSD stablecoin and luna token collapsed, 3AC suffered some $200 million in losses and was the first casualty heralding a new crypto winter, a collapse that made further waves.  Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy on July 5, reported a $654 million loan to 3AC that accounted for a massive 57.8% of its loan portfolio. The bankruptcy filing of Genesis Global Holdco included its Asia-Pacific unit – which said it had lent $2.4 billion in cash and digital assets to the hedge fund. Celsius claimed loans worth $75 million, of which around only half has been restored by liquidating collateral. Lender BlockFi also says it suffered “material losses” from the bankruptcy of 3AC – one of its largest borrowers.  They all had dealings with the FTX empire too – even before Sam Bankman-Fried rode in to save the sector post-3AC. As of July 5, Voyager was owed $377 million by Alameda. Around the time it filed for bankruptcy in November, BlockFi, also the target of Bankman-Fried’s white-knight deals, said it had $355 million in crypto frozen on FTX, plus $671 million in loans to Alameda.  Celsius too had an FTX exposure in the billions. According to an examiner’s report, as of April the lender had borrowed $1.5 billion in stablecoins from FTX and had over $2.5 billion in assets on the platform. Alameda also posted around $520 million of FTX’s native token FTT to Celsius – which was intended to collateralize $814 million in loans, but whose value collapsed when the exchange did. Owed $226 million, Genesis is reported in FTX’s bankruptcy filings as the biggest unsecured creditor of FTX.com and its affiliates.  The smaller companies were also lending among each other. As of July 5, Voyager has reported an exposure to another bankrupt Genesis unit of $17.5 million. Celsius has also sought to claw back $7.7 million it transferred to Voyager in the three-month window before it collapsed on July 13.  All that money lay on unsteady foundations, thanks to FTX’s own murky relationship with Alameda. In November, CoinDesk revealed a blurring between the supposedly separate entities, and regulators have since alleged special lines of credit and inappropriate access to customer funds.  Meanwhile, 56 million shares in Robinhood Markets, purchased by FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang using a loan from Alameda, are now sitting in Emergent Fidelity, a shell company created specifically for the purpose, which has filed for bankruptcy protection in Antigua and the U.S. Around $600 million worth of the assets are now caught in a complex legal tussle among liquidators, the Department of Justice, FTX and BlockFi.  So what?  Regulators care about this kind of interconnectivity in finance, because it makes the overall system less resilient and reliable.  In 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers spread across the world thanks to complex and opaque transactions. Standard-setters now measure interconnectedness to determine if a bank is too big to fail. Too many assets and liabilities within the financial system and you have to issue extra capital.  For the time being, crypto contagion hasn’t spread further; with a few exceptions, such as Silvergate Capital, the sector is pretty well walled off from conventional finance. But the pattern is being used to justify regulation.  “The crypto-asset market is highly interconnected, which may lead to rapid contagion and the spread of stress among crypto-asset market participants,” international standard-setter the Financial Stability Board said in an October consultation, in which it proposed sweeping new standards for the sector.  Banks have tough laws on ownership, capital requirements and re-use of funds; crypto companies, at most, self-imposed norms that appear to be frequently broken. Celsius breached its own credit limits with major clients such as 3AC and Alameda, according to a court-appointed examiner; Bankman-Fried’s declaration that FTX didn’t invest customer funds now doesn’t seem credible. Alameda itself was able to borrow from FTX well beyond FTX’s limit for clients.  But beyond the financial risks, there are practical ones: When the mess hits the fan, intertwined companies are a lot harder to wind up.  If a major company goes bust – such as Enron in 2001 – it’s not unusual for others in the market to feel a second-order ripple, bankruptcy expert Mark Shapiro told CoinDesk – but crypto may be different.  “It doesn't happen very often where you see this level of different companies having connectivity with each other,” said Shapiro, a partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling’s New York practice.  “All these companies were more interconnected than people probably could have appreciated,” he said, describing the crypto turmoil as the biggest “domino effect” since Lehman Brothers.  U.S. law already views with suspicion any transaction made up to three months before a bankruptcy, and any transactions deemed to be fraudulent conveyances can also be clawed back. Now, multiple judges in separate courts of New York, Delaware and New Jersey will have to sort through the complex web of transactions and decide what belongs to whom.  Tough luck for any customer waiting for their funds, says Shapiro.  “Anything having to do with FTX is going to take a while,” he said. Victims of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme had to wait around a decade for resolution. This could be similar.  Infographic by Sage D.

42410821,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtUU,1676635249,"No, Hong Kong Won’t Be Allowing Retail Traders Access to Crypto on June 1","Hong Kong is warming up to crypto, and a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) – the local term for crypto exchanges – kicks in on June 1.  Does this mean crypto is going ""fully legal"" in the city for everyone, as a tweet suggests? Not at all.  While the situation may change later, for the time being the VASP framework for licensing exchanges, which just finished a multiyear consultation, allows them to provide access only to accredited professional investors. Retail investors are excluded.  The Hong Kong government has indicated that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), its securities regulator, may consider retail access to virtual asset services in the future, after further consultation.  In January, Reuters reported the SFC is in the process of considering which cryptocurrencies to offer to retail investors should the door eventually be opened to them. CEO Julia Leung is quoted as saying that only “highly liquid” assets will be on the list, and the choices will be very limited at first.  The city's authorities see June 1 as an opportunity, saying ""Brand Hong Kong"" is much more highly regarded around the world than, say, Seychelles or St. Kitts and Nevis. The regulator is expanding its headcount to deal with an anticipated flurry of license applications.  “We’re able to bring together investments globally,” Christopher Hui, secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (FSTB), said in an earlier interview with CoinDesk. “We can manage and also channel these investments in a well-regulated and also sustainable manner.”  Hong Kong’s credibility comes from its “rule of law, regulation, commercial modus operandi,” Hui said, and this translates well from traditional finance to crypto.  Others in Hong Kong, however, see things differently.  ""For those platforms operated outside of Hong Kong, we see little incentive to incorporate in Hong Kong, establish an office here, go through the strict licensing requirements, as the local market is small,"" Leo Weese, co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, wrote in a 2021 post. ""Local institutional investors will be able to interact with foreign platforms through their foreign subsidiaries.""  Still, he's optimistic the new regulations ""can reintroduce clarity and stability after years of uncertainty,"" Weese said in an interview. ""It is important that individuals are granted the easy access to bitcoin they have become accustomed to in the past 12 years.""  Those individuals, the retail investors, are bound to be excited by the chance to use a local Hong Kong entity to trade. After all, there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong, and Japan shows what happens when retail investors are able to trade in a regulated environment. Post-FTX, Japanese traders seem to be living in a parallel world, where their tokens were stored with a custodian and funds are being returned.  But it's not quite the retail investors' turn yet in Hong Kong.

42388041,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR33HP,1676632059,"Unlike Merge, Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Could Bring Ether Price Volatility","The next major catalyst for the crypto market is Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade scheduled in March, which will open up withdrawals of more than 16.5 million ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain.  The impending upgrade comes months after the Ethereum blockchain underwent a technological overhaul, dubbed the Merge, switching to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work setting.  Traders might remember that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, did not see much volatility after the Merge took place on Sept. 15 and conclude that the upcoming upgrade will be a non-event.  However, such conclusions may prove inaccurate, according to OrBit Markets, an institutional liquidity provider in digital assets options.  ""This time could be different though. While the Merge was a pure technological shift with no direct economic impact, the Shanghai upgrade will change the supply and demand of ETH both in the short term and long term, and therefore capable of having a significant impact on the ETH price,"" Yang Zhiming, co-founder of OrBit Market and former head of currency derivatives for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank, told CoinDesk.  The Merge, as the name suggests, combined Ethereum's then-proof-of-work blockchain with the proof-of-stake Beacon chain. While the pivotal upgrade made Ethereum more environmentally friendly and put ether on the path to becoming a deflationary currency, there was no immediate impact on the supply-demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency.  Ether's price dropped 10% to $1,472 on the day of the Merge but volatility quickly faded, with prices trading in a narrow range of $1,300 to $1,400 during the following four weeks. Ether's 30-day realized volatility fell from an annualized 85% to nearly 60% in the four weeks following the Merge, according to data sourced from Amberdata. Realized volatility is a backward-looking metric measuring the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period in the past.  The upcoming Shanghai upgrade could affect the demand-supply balance in the ether market right away, keeping the cryptocurrency more volatile than it was in weeks after the Merge.  ""Some $25 billion worth of ETH will become available for withdrawals and sale. With the staking yields expected to decrease following the upgrade, investors who previously staked may unstake and move to other assets offering better yields. This would create large selling pressures on the ETH price,"" Zhiming said.  While the entire staking balance of more than 16.5 million ETH cannot be withdrawn on the Shanghai upgrade day, the total staking rewards of more than two years, equating to around 1 million ETH, can be instantly taken out, according to Saxo Bank.  These ETH could be liquidated into the market, bringing price volatility, as Saxo Bank's Mads Eberhardt wrote last month.  Besides, ether could turn volatile in the days leading up to the event in a sign of the market endorsing fears of post-upgrade price turbulence.  Ether volatility swap  OrBit Markets recently suggested an ether volatility swap to profit from an expected increase in volatility in March.  A volatility swap is a forward contract on the future realized volatility of an asset, allowing traders to bet on the degree of price moves rather than the directionality of prices.  In traditional finance, swaps are primarily settled in cash, based on the difference between the pre-determined fixed volatility level called the volatility strike and volatility realized/observed during the period under consideration.  ""You can enter a March volatility swap (first fixing March 1, last fixing March 31), where you buy the swap at volatility strike of 70% volatility [vols], capped at 170% and floored at 45%,"" Zhiming said. ""Your maximum gain is 100 vols, and your maximum loss is capped at 25 vols.  The volatility strike, in this case, is 70%. Whether the swap turns in profit or loss depends on the degree of realized volatility in March, which will be known at the end of the said month. OrBit's volatility swap is denominated in Circle's dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC. In other words, profit, loss and collateral are all denominated in USDC.  ""Volatility swap is a very common and popular product in equities and foreign exchange markets and widely used by hedge funds and asset managers,"" Zhiming told CoinDesk.

According to the SEC's complaint, from April 2018 until the firm's collapse in May 2022, Terraform and Kwon raised billions of dollars from investors by offering and selling an interconnected suite of crypto asset securities, many in unregistered transactions. The complaint alleges that the scheme led to the loss of at least $40B in market value, including losses for U.S. retail and institutional investors. (Updated Feb. 17, 6:47 AM ET) The SEC alleges that Terraform and Kwon marketed crypto asset securities to investors seeking to earn a profit, claiming that the tokens would increase in value. In one example, they marketed UST as a ""yield-bearing"" stablecoin, which they advertised as paying as much as 20% interest through the Anchor Protocol. The commission also alleges that the defendants still have valuable proceeds from the Terraform ecosystem. The suit alleged that the defendants transferred more than 10K bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from Terraform and Luna Foundation Guard crypto asset platform accounts to a cold wallet. On a periodic basis since May 2022, Terraform and Kwon have transferred — and continue to do so — bitcoin from that wallet to a Swiss financial institution and have converted the bitcoin to cash. Between June and the date of the complaint, more than $100M in fiat currency has been withdrawn from the Swiss bank, the complaint said. (Added Feb. 17, 7:06 AM ET) Bloomberg reported in June that Terraform Labs was being investigated by the SEC as to whether it violated federal investor protection rules. In May, algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST ( UST-USD ) and its sister token Luna (LUNA2-USD) collapsed after the stablecoin lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, wiping out billions of dollars in value. In May, the Terra ecosystem approved Kwon's proposal to revive Luna through a new blockchain called Terra Classic.

42388054,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR34Kt,1676629088,Bernstein: SEC Tightening of Crypto Regulations Is Not an Existential Threat,"Regulatory action against the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin and its issuer Paxos was specific to BUSD and cannot be extrapolated to others such as USD coin (USDC), Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.  Some in the industry had expressed concern that crypto was “actively being de-ramped from the banking system, with an attack on stablecoins and custody rules,” the report said.  Bernstein notes that Circle, the issuer of USDC, said it had not received any notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  The custody rule change is currently a proposal, and is favorable for bank-custodians and thus positive for crypto custodians such as Anchorage Digital, which have bank charters, and also custodians that operate under state charters, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  “While the U.S. regulations seem to be getting harder, the regulatory murmurs from Hong Kong seem to be net positive, with expected easing of norms,” the report said. It added that “we would not be surprised if the crypto market is led by Asia to begin with, until the regulatory fears settle down in the U.S.”  The broker notes there have been large gains in cryptocurrencies this week, with total market cap inching toward $1.2 trillion. Sharp price moves are affected by short covering, but the move higher is also “forcing existing crypto investors to dial up exposure with every move,” the note said.  In recent months, bearish crypto investors have been ignoring very healthy user trends on-chain. The collapse of crypto exchange FTX triggered a spike in on-chain self-custody wallets willing to use on-chain exchanges, according to the note.  “Layer 2 ecosystems have been vibrant, with cheap transaction cost driving adoption and new app deployments,” Bernstein said.

42410815,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtDx,1676625489,Calm Before the Storm: Is UK’s Financial Watchdog Gearing Up for Enforcement Action?,"The U.S. has been busy cracking down on crypto firms these past two weeks, but on the other side of the pond the U.K.’s financial regulator has barely moved an inch. It may, however, just be the calm before a storm.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not been shy with its powers lately. The SEC announced charges against the Kraken exchange last Thursday for offering unregistered securities products, and the Wall Street Journal reported it plans to sue crypto issuer Paxos over its BinanceUSD (BUSD) tokens. On Thursday, the regulator filed suit against Terraform Labs, the issuer of the now-collapsed terraUSD stablecoin. Let’s not forget the SEC’s ongoing battle with Ripple.  Meanwhile, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority has 51 unregistered crypto companies serving clients in the country, which it has flagged but has not yet taken action against – or so it appears. Most of these companies have been on this list since 2021. If crypto firms want to operate in the country, they are (in theory) obligated to register with the FCA and comply with its anti-money laundering rules.  “I'm quite surprised to see the relative lack of action by the regulator against those firms. It has powers under the regulations to, for example, apply for court injunctions, to start criminal prosecutions, and I'm certainly not aware of those powers being used by the regulator at this point,” said James Alleyne, legal director at Kingsley Napley and a former FCA official, referring to the unregistered firms serving U.K. clients. That being said, the FCA could be taking action covertly, Alleyne added.  The FCA, to its merit, has been strict about which companies it approves for registration, much to the chagrin of the local crypto industry.  Of the 300 crypto firms that applied to register with the regulator, only 41 managed to actually register with it. The rest were either refused a license following a full assessment, rejected before the full assessment was conducted or withdrew their applications.  The regulator revealed this year that it had also flagged a few crypto firms looking to get registered to law enforcement and some investigations are ongoing.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus  The FCA has investigation and enforcement powers, as set out in the U.K.’s money laundering rules, to take action against firms that fall within its scope. Under these rules, operating without a registration is a criminal offense. On top of that, the FCA can also take enforcement action under existing rules for financial services if crypto firms unlawfully carry out other activities it regulates such as operating collective investment schemes, providing additional services, or issuing financial promotions.  Alleyne said more action against those 51 unregistered crypto firms is necessary to stop criminal activity.  “Those firms could potentially be posing a much higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing than firms which have now come into the regime and which are being supervised for those purposes,” Alleyne said.  The U.K.’s Conservative government is known for being somewhat open to crypto, aligned with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s bid to turn the nation into a hub for digital assets – and this has swayed the FCA ever so slightly.  Read more: The UK's FCA Says It Has Been Focused on the More Negative Side of the Crypto Debate  The FCA stands to get more powers once the Financial Services and Markets Bill passes later this year.  Meanwhile, the finance ministry’s consultation on crypto rules shows authorities want all local and foreign crypto companies including those that are already registered to apply for new authorization.  The FCA is also watching crypto promotions closely and has already warned companies in breach of its new advertising rules could end up with a two-year prison term.  So it's not a question of if the FCA will crack down on bad crypto actors, but a question of when – and perhaps, how soon.

""The aim of the pilot program is twofold: first, to test the technical feasibility ... and second, to utilize the skills and insights of private businesses in terms of technology and operation for designing a CBDC ecosystem in the possible event of social implementation,"" Uchida said.

The move also comes at a time when the BoJ is set for leadership transition, with Kazuo Ueda expected to take over the top job from Haruhiko Kuroda when his second five-year term ends in April.  In November 2022, Nikkei reported that, starting in the spring of 2023, the BoJ would work on experiments on a digital yen with three mega-banks and regional banks in the country.

42410848,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1yD,1676620643,How Solvency Check Error Led to USP Depegging on Avalanche-Based Platypus Finance,"A flaw in a key pricing mechanism led to Platypus Finance’s USP stablecoin losing over 50% of its intended peg with U.S. dollars earlier on Friday, developers said.  “We regret to inform you that our protocol was hacked recently, and the attacker took advantage of a flaw in our USP solvency check mechanism,” Platypus tweeted. “They used a flashloan to exploit a logic error in the USP solvency check mechanism in the contract holding the collateral.”  The solvency check mechanism tricked Platypus smart contracts into erroneously reasoning that USP was fully backed as intended. And that’s where the exploit started.  Platypus Finance, like other decentralized stablecoin exchanges, relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen for exchanging stablecoins cheaply with low slippage. The product is fairly popular, holding over $50 million in locked tokens as of Thursday.  An attack during late U.S. hours on Thursday saw exploiters use a flash-loan attack to steal over $8.5 million from Platypus, as CoinDesk reported.  Things to know  USP is a type of stablecoin. Its price is affected by how much is available in a place called the Main Pool. When more people swap other types of digital money for USP, the price may go slightly lower.  When there's less USP in the Main Pool, the price goes back up. To keep the price stable at $1, a fee is charged to people who borrow USP, and the fee increases when there is more USP in the Main Pool. This encourages people to borrow more or repay their debts.  Flash loans are a decentralized finance (DeFi)-specific mechanism allowing users to borrow high amounts of capital on little collateral as long as the loan is paid back within the same transaction.  Flash loans are not inherently bad: They are generally used by traders, but bad actors may use flash loans to trick a protocol’s smart contract into manipulating prices on liquidity pools and take over that pool’s assets.  How the attacker stole millions  Blockchain data shows the exploiter borrowed over $44 million from lending platform Aave for the flash loan, using it to supply liquidity to a trading pool on Platypus and tricking smart contracts into issuing $44 million of Platypus' LP token, called LP-USDC, in return.  All of this occurred over two transactions. These LP tokens were then deposited into a staking contract on Platypus – which issued 11,000 platypus (PTP) tokens as a staking reward.  The attacker was also able to get 41 million USP tokens using the $44 million LP tokens as collateral – as Platypus allows users to borrow USP stablecoins against their LP positions.  At this point, the attacker called an “emergencywithdraw” function on Platypus’ smart contracts to withdraw the $44 million originally provided to the Platypus liquidity pool. The solvency check error in the code failed to dissuade such a move – allowing the attacker to withdraw the tokens and repay the Aave flash loan.  However, the system did not retract the 41 million USP tokens that were issued – in turn allowing the attacker to swap them for the $8.5 million in liquidity available at that time on Platypus.  As of Friday, Platypus said it had contacted the attacker to negotiate a bounty in exchange for the return of the funds.  It added that relevant security parties and crypto exchanges were contacted. “We are currently working with several parties … including Binance, Tether and Circle, to freeze the funds of the hacker and prevent further losses. Right now, the USDT has been frozen.  “We are also exploring options for compensation and reimbursement for affected investors,” developers tweeted.

Emergent, an Antiguan shell company 90% owned by Bankman-Fried, owns 56 million shares of online broker Robinhood Markets (HOOD) plus some cash, and apparently little else.  Those assets are now the subject of a legal tussle involving FTX, BlockFi, the Department of Justice and the Robinhood Board. BlockFi believes Emergent’s Antiguan liquidators are making it even more complex by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  “Neither law nor equity require the doing of a futile act. But this bankruptcy case asks the Court to do just that – to ‘reorganize’ an empty shell,” BlockFi’s filing said.  The bankruptcy filing, made Feb. 3, was not made in good faith; the company isn’t eligible, having no employees, no income and no business; and the case exists “solely” to advance the interests of Antiguan liquidators who’ve already gained over $1.7 million in fees, BlockFi said.  BlockFi has taken legal action to secure access to the shares, which it says were security for a loan made Nov. 9. The Department of Justice seized the assets in January as it investigates fraud charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, who owns the remaining 10% of Emergent. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty while Wang has entered a plea deal.  Toni Shukla, one of the liquidators of Emergent appointed in Antigua, told CoinDesk her duties were to Emergent's creditors, even if there are competing claims as to who those creditors might be.  ""Chapter 11 protection is the only practical way to empower the debtor to defend itself, the assets and its creditors’ interests in the U.S.,"" Shukla said, repeating ""serious concerns"" made in earlier filings over the legitimacy of BlockFi's claim to the shares.

42410842,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1US,1676606084,"Crypto Theft Rose in 2022 as Scams, Ransomware Bounty Fell: Chainalysis","The volume of crime-related transactions rose for the second consecutive year, hitting an all-time high of $20.6 billion, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis says in its new ""Crypto Crime Report."" But that is a small share of total volume of the crypto market: less than 1%.  Thieves, hackers, exploiters  2022 became the biggest year for crypto thieves. According to Chainalysis, about $3.8 billion, more than in any other year, was stolen from various services and protocols, $775.7 million of which was stolen in October alone. At the same time, total revenue of scammers and ransomware hackers declined, the report says.  82.1% of all the stolen funds were taken from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, especially cross-chain bridges – protocols allowing users to trade assets between two different blockchains. “Bridges are an attractive target for hackers because the smart contracts in effect become huge, centralized repositories of funds backing the assets that have been bridged to the new chain – a more desirable honeypot could scarcely be imagined,” the report reads.  A growing trend in DeFi hacks is oracle manipulation, when an attacker compromises the mechanisms by which a decentralized protocol gets a price for traded assets, and creates favorable conditions for fast and super-profitable trades, Chainalysis says. According to the report, in 2022, DeFi protocols lost $386.2 million in 41 separate oracle manipulation attacks.  One example of this is a Mango Markets exploit, for which the alleged attacker, Avraham Eisenberg, was arrested and now is facing commodity manipulation charges in U.S. court.  North Korean hackers from the Lazarus group broke their own record in 2022: $1.7 billion stolen from several victims. Most of that money was sent to decentralized exchanges and several mixers: Tornado Cash, Blender.io and, after the shutdown of Blender, to Sinbad. Sinbad may have been launched by the same team that ran Blender, blockchain intel firm Elliptic said earlier.  Read also: Sanctioned Mixer Blender Re-Launched as Sinbad, Elliptic Says  The weight of sanctions  There might be one big skewing factor to the overall illicit transactions statistics: 43% of all 2022’s illicit transaction volume came from activity associated with sanctioned entities, Chainalysis said.  A big part of these illicit money flows are funds received by sanctioned entity Garantex, which is likely just “Russian users using a Russian exchange,” Chainalysis said, but most compliance professionals treat these transactions as illicit activity anyway, it adds.  In 2022, the U.S. sanctioned Russian darknet marketplace Hydra, exchange Garantex, crypto mixers Blender.io and Tornado Cash. Not all the money these sanctioned services processed were of criminal origins: Only 6.1% of the funds Garantex received came from illicit sources (still 20 times more than centralized exchanges in average); for Tornado Cash, the number is 34%, according to Chainalysis.  Sanctions seriously curbed the flow of funds into Tornado Cash, but Garantex remained as active as ever, and saw even more incoming funds from known scams and darknet shops, Chainalysis said.  Sanctions also seem to reduce the popularity of mixers: In 2022, $7.8 billion in crypto passed through mixers, compared to $11.5 billion in 2021. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned mixers Tornado Cash and Blender.io last year because both services had been actively used by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus.  Money laundering trends  Crypto infrastructure remains open to ransomware hackers because they most often send extorted money to centralized crypto exchanges, Chainlaysis said. The centralized exchanges, despite the intensified attention of law enforcement agencies around the world over the past few years, remain the major receivers of criminal funds, Chainalysis said.  Read more: Ransomware Variants Are on the Rise but Overall Gains Decline: Chainalysis  However, hackers that steal crypto from exchanges and other entities prefer DeFi platforms for money laundering, especially when the DeFi protocols themselves are victims, the report says. “In DeFi hacks, attackers often end up with tokens that aren’t listed on other exchanges, so they need to use decentralized exchanges (DEX) to swap them for more liquid crypto assets,” according to Chainalysis.  Other cybercriminals usually use darknet platforms, mixers and centralized exchanges with weak KYC (Know Your Customer) protections, like Bitzlato, whose founder and other staff members arrested in January.  Police double-spends  The report looks into a particular case of one ransomware strain, Deadbolt, which was active in 2022. Unlike the most infamous ransomware groups such as Conti, attacking large organizations for big ransoms, Deadbolt operators chose to target small businesses and individuals. In 2022 it received over $2.3 million from around 4,923 victims, who paid about $476 each, on average.  A twist here is the way this group sent decryption keys to their victims who paid the ransom: Once a victim sent a bitcoin transaction to Deadbolt’s address, another transaction would get triggered automatically, sending back a meager amount of bitcoin (around $1) with the decryption key written into the OP-RETURN field of the transaction data.  This mechanism helped the Dutch Royal Police, which investigated the group, to get decryption keys for a dozen victims without them having to par with their money. The police sent payout transactions to the hackers, but as soon as they received the key they reverted the payouts using the replace-by-fee mechanism.  Replace-by-fee allows replacement of the already initiated transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain with a new one with a higher fee, so the miners would include a more profitable transaction into the blockchain and the first one would became invalid as the bitcoin is already spent.

As part of the deal there will be a 5-1 reverse split of HUT shares with current shareholders retaining 50% equity in the post-merger ""New Hut"" entity. Going forward HUT will use mined BTC and the BTC in treasury to finance operations. Meaning the ""HODL"" days seem over for the time being. It has been a little over one month since my initial public coverage of Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ). Since that time, we've learned of a very large fundamental catalyst after the recently announced merger deal with US Bitcoin Corp. I'm not convinced this is actually a good deal for HUT shareholders. There are a variety of reasons for that opinion and I'll highlight my key issues shortly. Merger Details However, assuming merger completion, this deal would boost Hut's mining EH/s to 5.6. That would more than double the 2.7 EH/s the company disclosed at the end of January - and this is apparently not including the currently offline North Bay facility in that capacity estimate: Hut 8 According to the announcement deck , US Bitcoin Corp brings in 4 new mining sites, hosting revenue, equipment revenue, and ""managed infrastructure."" Hut 8 On paper, it is an interesting combination but there is quite a bit of key information that we simply do not know. And when things this big happen and we don't know key information, I tend to become cautious rather than euphoric. What We Know The Treasury HODL days are over for the time being as the company has stated it will be using Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to fund operations before this merger closes: During the interim period, we plan to cover our operating costs through a combination of selling the Bitcoin we mine, selling from our stack and/or exploring various debt options , as agreed under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Upon a successful close of the Transaction, we will take the opportunity to carefully review and determine our go-forward treasury strategy Following merger finalization, ""New Hut"" shareholders will split the equity 50/50 between current HUT shareholders and US Bitcoin Corp equity owners. Hut 8's leadership projected a post-merger market cap of $990 million, but I think that makes a lot of assumptions that are potentially difficult to justify from that outside looking in. As part of the deal there will be a reverse split of the current HUT shares on a 5 to 1 basis. From where I sit, this means unless US Bitcoin Corp can genuinely be valued the same as HUT 8 is today, current HUT shareholders appear to be getting diluted in a roundabout way. I take that view because I don't think we can assume the market will value new HUT shares at the individual unit price needed to keep current HUT investors whole post-merger and post-split. That brings us to what we don't know. What We Don't Know We frankly have no idea what the right valuation for ""New Hut"" should be post-merger because we don't have any idea what US Bitcoin Corp's balance sheet looks like. Answers weren't really provided by Hut 8 CEO Jamie Leverton to post-merger balance sheet questions during the company's merger announcement webinar. But I think we can reasonably infer US Bitcoin Corp is financially distressed just by looking at the important details in the announcement press release. For instance, US Bitcoin Corp has essentially forfeited a facility in Texas to a lender per a notation in the announcement: Hut 8's North Bay facility is not accounted for in the calculations provided as legal proceedings are underway with the site's third party energy provider. In addition, USBTC's former facility in Pecos, Texas is not accounted for in the above calculations as it has been transferred to one of USBTC's former lenders as part of a debt extinguishment transaction . And later in the release: Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Hut 8 has also agreed to provide USBTC with secured bridge financing during the interim period, with the expected amount of such financing ranging from US$6.0 – $6.5 million, subject to the completion of definitive loan documentation. In addition to US Bitcoin Corp giving up property to satisfy debt obligations, the deal isn't even done yet and US Bitcoin Corp is getting cash from Hut 8 up front through a bridge loan. I think we can safely assume US Bitcoin Corp is bringing some financial baggage with that EH/s capacity and probably not a lot of BTC. More Questions Now It was obvious Hut 8 had to do some sort of cash raise to fund operations going forward. Financing terms in this credit environment are likely not all that great, especially for crypto-related businesses. And selling the stack probably did make the most sense. But to stomach selling BTC to fund operations, it is pretty imperative that Hut 8 can replenish that treasury HODL before the halving. From the outside looking in, it seems this is the deal Hut 8 is making because it's likely the best deal the company can get at the moment. US Bitcoin Corp apparently needs cash and Hut 8 needs machines if it is going to meaningfully scale a Bitcoin mining operation before the halving. What is a bit unsettling from where I sit is just a month ago it appeared as though Hut 8 was transitioning to an HPC business. Now we're seeing a doubling of EH/s capacity that will only produce block rewards on par with current levels for an additional year or so following the merger - possibly less. Investor Takeaway It does feel like leadership isn't sure of the company's long term vision, and that's unsettling. Leverton balked at providing a picture of what the business could look like 3 years from now: we continue to try to make sure we skate where the puck’s going. And so, I can’t foresee how things are going to look in three years. But what I can say is we’re going to continue to do exactly what we’ve done for the last two years but now with even more strength and scale as a combined company under New Hut. If you had asked me to explain where Hut 8 would be in 3 years just a few weeks ago I'd have told you Hut will probably be a cloud computing and HPC services business that also mines a little Bitcoin. Yet here we are a little over a month later scaling up EH/s at the expense of the HODL approach. Without knowing how much debt New Hut is about to carry, I've sold off about half of my ""HUT HODL."" I could certainly become more excited about HUT again if US Bitcoin Corp's balance sheet isn't actually as bad as I anticipate it probably is. Until then, HUT is still a great trade when BTC is going up and probably a big sell when BTC is going down. For now, we don't have enough information to make a great fundamental case for Hut either way.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579287-hut-8-even-more-questions-now?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9523881.jpeg

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin shifted from flying high above $25K to sinking to $23.6K over the course of Thursday.  Insights: Alameda Research ranked among the crypto industry's largest market makers. Its collapse with its parent company FTX, has increasingly prompted startups to postpone their token launches.  Prices  Bitcoin Soars Early Past $25K, Tumbles Late Below $23.5K  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,098 −38.8 ▼ 3.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,618 −1187.6 ▼ 4.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,646 −54.5 ▼ 3.2% S&P 500  4,090.41 −57.2 ▼ 1.4% Gold  $1,842 +8.2 ▲ 0.4% Nikkei 225  27,696.44 +194.6 ▲ 0.7% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin was rising again Thursday and then it wasn't as investors seemed to have second thoughts about persnickety inflation, Federal Reserve monetary policy and crypto industry woes.  The largest digital asset by market capitalization was recently trading at about $23,618, down 4.8% over the past 24 hours and well off its high earlier in the day above $25,100. That mark represented BTC's first sojourn above $25,000 since August, reflecting rising optimism about inflation and the economy. But both seemed to vanish in the space of a few hours as an unexpected 0.7% month-over-month spike in January's producer price index (PPI) suggested that the U.S. central bank monetary had not yet succeeded in taming price increases that have bedeviled the economy for more than a year.  Industry-specific problems during the day also offered a reminder that crypto itself remained on rocky ground as investment bank D.A. Davidson analyst Chris Brendler downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to neutral from buy; a New York judge overseeing the criminal fraud case of Sam-Bankman Fried warned he might revoke the bond of the former CEO of disgraced crypto exchange FTX if Bankman-Fried continued to defy bail conditions; and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Platypus Finance suffered a flash-loan attack with a potential loss of $8.5 million.  Other cryptos turn red  Ether followed a similar path to BTC, rising well above $1,700 for the second consecutive day before retreating. The second largest crypto by market capitalization was recently changing hands at about $1,650, down more than a percentage point. Other major cryptos also seesawed with APT, the token of layer 1 protocol Aptos, recently sinking 7.9% after rising more than 9% earlier in the day. MATIC, the native crypto of layer 2 blockchain Polygon Network was up over 6.3%, despite paring gains from earlier. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were both firmly in the red a day after rising handsomely.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of overall crypto markets' performance, was recently down about 3.8% after spending much of the previous 36 hours in the green.  Equity markets, meanwhile, flinched at the PPI data with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all declining well over a percentage point. Investors remain wary about a strong employment market, an inflationary sign suggesting that economic growth remains solid.  Still, the recent crypto rally has a number of analysts feeling optimistic about prices. ""The [consumer price index] in the U.S. has been playing a less-influential role as more evidence shows inflation has proven to be stubborn to tackle, and investors are adapting and cautiously getting into risky assets as a way of coping mechanism,"" Adrian Wang, founder and CEO at digital assets wealth management company Metalpha Limited, said prior to the Thursday downturn.  ""We can expect the market going more bullish ahead,"" he said.  And Darius Tabatabai, the co-founder of Vertex Protocol, a London-based decentralized exchange, said that crypto markets seemed willing to move past the industry's myriad problems. ""The news that the [Securities and Exchange Commission] was investigating [stablecoin] BUSD earlier this week led to some pullback in prices, but with the market seeming to slowly shrug off the news and retail sales data hinting at a soft landing for inflation, and we may have the makings of another bull market,"" Tabatabai said.

Data from crypto price tracking platform CoinMarketCap shows that new coin applications fell throughout 2022, from 10,264 in the first quarter to 6,350 in the fourth. The drop accelerated toward year's end after crypto exchange FTX and its sister concern Alameda Research collapsed in November. Before going bust, Alameda was one of the largest market makers, providing billions of dollars of liquidity to large-cap and small-cap tokens.  Year to date, the figure is just 3,000 applications.  “Post-FTX we have seen liquidity dry as up to 50% on major coins,” Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Paris-based market maker and brokerage Flowdesk, said in an email. “On smaller market caps, the liquidity reduction has been even worse because Alameda has closed all their support for token issuers and other big market makers have reduced their exposure and activity.”  Chaumont said he is advising projects to postpone by three to six months. Flowdesk expects the bear market to be around for another 12 to 18 months.  Last month, the recently decentralized exchange dYdX said it was planning to delay its token unlock, which would release more than 150 million tokens to early investors and founders, to December 2023 with hopes that the market will have recovered by then. People familiar with the matter say it is because of concern over market liquidity.  Liquidity in bitcoin and ether markets as measured by the 2% market depth has dried up since Alameda went down, making it harder for traders to execute big orders without affecting the market price and for projects to issue new tokens.  The 2% depth represents a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price – the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices being quoted at a given time. Data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko show the 2% market depth for BTC fell to less than 8,000 BTC in January even as the cryptocurrency rallied over 40%.  “Crypto liquidity is dominated by just a handful of trading firms, including Wintermute, Amber Group, B2C2, [CoinDesk sister company] Genesis, Cumberland and (the now-defunct) Alameda. With the loss of one of the largest market makers, we can expect a significant drop in liquidity, which we will call the “Alameda Gap,” Kaiko wrote in a November briefing note.  Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that balances at key market makers have dropped. Cumberland currently has a balance of $75 million, down from around $220 million in early December; Wintermute has $122 million, compared with $1.7 billion last February and $4 billion at the end of October 2021, when the bull market reached its peak.  Amber Group, which jettisoned a sponsorship deal with U.K. soccer team Chelsea in December, has been through multiple rounds of layoffs. Arkham says it currently has a balance of $92 million, down from a peak of about $350 million in mid-2022.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, said March Zheng, the co-founder and managing partner of Bizantine Capital.  “Crypto markets are cyclical in nature, but it needs stress test conditions like the last few months to prove its resiliency for the long term,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “New token issuance activity has been down, but it gives more opportunity for incumbent and top projects.”  Zheng points to developments in Hong Kong as bullish sentiments for the market.  Meanwhile, the market continues to rally, with bitcoin pushing past $24.5K during Asian business hours Thursday while shorts were hit with considerable liquidation losses.
