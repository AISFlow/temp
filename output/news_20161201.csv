42427177,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BFh,1480630917,The Bitcoin Price Keeps Breaching $750,"The price of bitcoin keeps bumping up over the $750 mark.  The digital currency’s price broke through this key psychological level today, representing the sixth time that bitcoin has surpassed $750 since mid-November, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.  Bitcoin experienced these price fluctuations amid modest trading volume, as CoinMarketCap data shows that at no point during the session did 24-hour trading volume surpass $90 million. This lukewarm trading activity compares to last month, when 24-hour volume reached as much as $174 million on 3rd November and $173 million on 17th November.  The digital currency managed to breach $750 several times in November, climbing past this level before quickly falling back, according to BPI data. The digital currency first surpassed $750 on 17th November, briefly lingering above this level before surrendering its gains and then climbing once again.  Notably, the price of bitcoin has frequently exceeded $750 but has not breach $755 over the last few weeks.

42427178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BHh,1480615141,How Developers Are Responding to Ethereum's Unexpected Fork,"An unintentional split of the network was the latest event to shake ethereum.  By now, you might have heard the back-and-forth about so-called hard forks, a particularly contentious way to update a public blockchain. Some view it as a sometimes necessary means to update the network, while others see it as less than desirable path because it breaks consensus and everyone on the network needs to update to a new blockchain in order to participate.  Ethereum has hard forked three times over the past few months to fix technical issues. But the latest fork was different, because it wasn’t executed on purpose.  At issue is that ethereum has different implementations of the protocol to process transactions on the network in sync. The two most popular, Geth and Parity, implemented the code for the last technical hard fork slightly differently, leading to a Thanksgiving fork.  One consequence is that the ether price dipped to the lowest point it’s been at since April, or before The DAO crisis, according to ethereum’s event timeline. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, went as far as to call these recent challenges a ""crisis of identity.""  From the mid-summer unravelling of The DAO to an unknown hacker spamming the network to the point where users couldn’t complete smart contracts, it’s been a rough few months for the smart contract platform.  Yet ethereum developers have struck an optimistic tone, seemingly viewing the Thanksgiving fork as another learning experience and a chance to make the network better.  Developer response  Those involved with the project say that the team is looking to take steps in order to prevent future occurrences.  ""This time, the fork was detected within 6 minutes, which was a bit lucky,"" Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Holst Swende told CoinDesk.  Because developers might not always accidentally spot the problem in such a short time frame, they want to make sure that they're able to react quickly in a similar situation.  ""We're working on improving our capabilities for detection, analysis, communication/coordination between teams,” Swende said.  He added that they’re working on a ""Post Mortem"" report, outlining lessons learned from various ethereum bugs, which they aim to open up to the public soon.  One step being taken will involve making time for added testing of ""non-critical"" forks, or those that don’t need to be executed immediately.  Ethereum Foundation media relations lead Hudson Jameson noted that developers also plan to overhaul the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), a process by which developers propose new ecosystem standards or changes to the ethereum protocol.  ""There is also plans to eventually create an alternative web interface for listing EIPs so it will be easier for the average user to view EIPs without having to navigate a GitHub repo, which can be confusing at times,"" he explained.  Fixing the fork and beyond  There have been three other forks recently.  The last technical fork, Spurious Dragon, fixed a few different ethereum issues, including the deletion of the empty accounts that the attacker used to spam the blockchain.  Over the past week, developers have been using this newly granted power to delete all of these empty accounts, thus ""debloating"" the blockchain (a process that was officially completed on Wednesday). In the middle of this process, at block 2686351, a developer tried to delete an empty account, but didn’t use enough gas.  That’s where Geth and Parity had a minor disagreement— with big consequences. Geth went forward with deleting the accounts, whereas Parity didn’t. So, the network temporarily split into two.  The latest version of Geth, released the day of the fork, fixed the problem.  ""If you do not update, please be aware you will be on an invalid chain that is not supported,"" ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin wrote in response. (This comment got some flak, since Buterin was declaring which chain was correct.)  Further, Buterin described it as an issue with Geth, but other developers have argued otherwise.  Geth developer Péter Szilágyi remarked at the time that, ""We're trying to introduce the Parity bug into Geth so that we don't have to rewind the chain...""  Still, despite the minor infighting, the ethereum community views it as an opportunity to do better next time.  Blockchain 'menace'  Yet there are some who think it's a problem that will continue to impact the ambitious smart contract blockchain. To some, the problems described above vindicate a position offered by bitcoin's pseudonymous creator during a debate from six years ago.  ""I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network,” Satoshi Nakamoto said in a discussion with Gavin Andresen, former lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core.  One potential ""menace"" is that every client on the network needs to function nearly the same, even while written in different programming languages. If there’s a slip up (in ethereum’s case, small disagreements of how to delete the empty accounts), the network could split.  ChromaWay co-founder and CTO Alex Mizrahi argued recently that while multiple implementations might be considered a good thing in other instances, the risk of monetary loss showcases why it might not be appropriate for cryptocurrencies.  So, some argue that a fork was an inevitable result, but since bitcoin and ethereum networks are perceived as competitors, it’s hard to determine the honesty behind this analysis.  Since ethereum doesn’t a wide user base, it might not have impacted that many people. In this case, those miners that accidentally continued to mine on the ""wrong"" chain probably lost money. Anyone who made a transaction on the wrong chain might be surprised to see that it didn't go through.  In the end, a similar event would perhaps be more worrying on a more widely used platform.

42427173,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0B7h,1480611670,Finland's Central Bank Organizes Blockchain Event,"Finland’s central bank co-organized a seminar on blockchain last week.  The Bank of Finland held the event in partnership with the country’s Ministry of Finance. The seminar took place on 24th November, according to the central bank.  Attendees included government regulators, local academics and companies based in Finland, drawn from institutions like Aalto University, Lappeenranta University of Technology and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Representatives from firms like Microsoft and Finnish energy firm Fortum were also in attendance.  In statements, central bank representatives said the event supports ongoing research into new technologies like blockchain.  Governor Erkki Liikanen was quoted as saying during remarks at the event:  “Our task is to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the payment system and the overall financial system and to participate in their development. Research into, and support of, new innovations shaping the financial sector constitute part of this work.”  The hope, according to the central bank, was to spur discussion on “a common view and strategy” for the technology in the Finnish public and private sectors. Ten blockchain projects were presented during the one-day seminar, focused on applications in both government and finance, among other areas.  Though no new initiatives were announced or pledged, the central bank said that discussions during the event were, in part, aimed at promoting the development of “guiding principles” for future work among stakeholders in Finland.

42427172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0B5h,1480606986,Australian Digital Currency Advocates Launch Self-Regulation Effort,"Digital currency advocates in Australia have launched a new code of conduct initiative aimed at promoting self-regulation in the nascent technology space.  The Australian Digital Currency & Commerce Association (ADCCA) announced today the launch of the Digital Currency Industry Code of Conduct, which the group said was a result of recommendations in 2015 Senate report. The initiative was first announced in February.  One of the key suggestions in that report was that, as the government formulates a more concrete strategy for regulating digital currencies like bitcoin, self-regulation among companies working with the tech can help fill the gap. Since then, Australia has moved to extend anti-money laundering rules to bitcoin exchanges – a position reflected in the new conduct code. Meanwhile, officials have been looking at ways to eliminate a much-maligned “double tax” on the purchase of bitcoin.  Nicholas Giurietto, CEO of the ADCCA, said in a statement:  “The self-regulatory model that we have developed gives Australian consumers confidence that they are dealing with a business with standards that they can trust, while implementing AML/CTF safeguards.  Those backing the initiative, including Deloitte’s Australian branch, positioned the launch from the perspective of consumer safety and outreach.  “It is all about making digital money safe. Our collective aim is to develop standards of consumer protection that hold participants to account and to a very high standard of conduct,” said Richard Miller, Deloitte advisory partner.  The launch comes as Australia continues to implement its fintech policy goals. Yet more changes are on the horizon, as the country’s chief financial reporting standards agency has pushed for international work on digital currency standards. Business regulators in Australia have also hinted that they may scrutinize acquisition deals involving blockchain startups or the technologies they’ve developed.

42427175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BDh,1480600742,Major Japanese Banks Seek Lower Costs With Blockchain Payments,"Several major Japanese banks, in partnership with bitcoin exchange bitFlyer and Deloitte Japan, have published the first results of a blockchain interbank payments trial.  The Blockchain Study Group, which includes Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc., have spent the last year collaboratively testing the technology for uses in bank-to-bank payments. The results of the specific trial disclosed today relate to the issuance of payments. According to the institutions involved, future testing will be widened to include the clearing and settlement of those transactions.  The contents of the report, a full copy of which can be found below, represent perhaps some of the more granular details of blockchain experimentation in Japan to date. Since the start of 2016, a range of proofs-of-concept have been developed and tested by financial institutions in Japan, primarily in the areas of payments, document management and digital currency.  The trial involving bitFlyer and Deloitte fits squarely in this context. But it’s in the report’s conclusion, however, that the authors dig into the bigger-picture outcome from the trial.  The authors note:  “Through practical experiment of domestic interbank payment operation, possibility in benefitting from cost reduction effect in system development by leveraging blockchain technology was confirmed. However, various issues exist in the application of blockchain technology to the domestic interbank payment operation, such as in methods to interface to existing bank systems and to areas outside payment, and in methods to fulfill non-functional requirements of high levels.”  In other words, while the proposed system can make it potentially cheaper to transact from one bank to another, the existing infrastructure isn’t quite ready to integrate with the technology. Further study, the report goes on to explain, will focus on how to alleviate some of these problems.  Nuts and bolts  The report itself contains intriguing details about how bank-driven blockchain systems might look in production.  Included in the report is a diagram detailing the structure of how participants interact with the proposed network. Transaction validation, for example, would be a process reserved for select banks – known as “core nodes” in this instance. “Application nodes”, on the other hand, would constitute the banks that are sending or receiving transactions that are including in the blocks created by the core nodes.  According to the report, the prototype system was capable of processing over a thousand transactions per second.  “In the assessment to the experiment environment constructed this time, it was proven that the performance throughput in particular achieved 1,500 transactions per second and that the level sufficient for actual operation is expected,” the authors wrote.  As for the specifics behind those cost-cutting measures, the report highlights that reduced expenditures for software licenses, hardware, and maintenance would all be lower when compared to technologies utilized today. Costs related to middleware and applications were noted to be lower as well.

42427176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BBh,1480597809,China's Huiyin Group Launches $20 Million Bitcoin Fund,"Huiyin Group, a multibillion-dollar investment company based in China, has announced the launch of Huiyin Blockchain Ventures (HBV), a subsidiary fund focused solely on investments in the sector.  Launching with $20m in committed capital, HBV will now seek to invest the funds over the course of the next six to 12 months. The fund will be managed by James Wo, the son of Huiyin Group founder, and focus on improving the blockchain ecosystem through investments in infrastructural projects and new use cases.  But while the firm may have ""blockchain"" in its name, those close to the fund suggested the firm is unlikely to invest in enterprise or so-called alternative blockchain projects.  Wo indicated that the fund will have a special focus on projects building on or otherwise supporting the bitcoin blockchain.  Wo said in a statement:  ""We are seeking to invest into bitcoin-related companies to help enrich the industry, as we see a large opportunity for a return on our investment. As the bitcoin industry continually matures, the use of bitcoin will continue to grow and proliferate in China, as well as the rest of the world. HBV intends to be at the forefront of this technology as it continues to gain traction globally.""  The firm has already started investing through their fund, backing Indian bitcoin brokerage Unocoin, content monetization platform Yours and Purse.io, a bitcoin-powered e-commerce marketplace.  Purse CEO Andrew Lee will also serve as an advisor to the fund.  Family business  For Huiyin Group, HBV's parent fund, the announcement follows its more recent move into the technology sector. (Huiyin Group is a family-owned investment group that has focused on traditional industries like real estate, energy and agriculture).  But in the past few years, Wo and his father have taken a personal interest in bitcoin, which ultimately led to the creation of the new fund.  Speaking about the family, Lee said:  ""Out of all the investors I've spoken to [in China], they have a deeper commitment to bitcoin than anyone else, and probably the best economic and political ties to the Chinese economic machine to really further the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Lee also hinted at much larger investment announcements in the bitcoin ecosystem to be revealed in the coming months.

42427181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BJh,1480595446,Zcash Prices Are Finally Beginning to Show Some Stability,"The price of Zcash is beginning to show (relative) stability.  Despite the sharp volatility it has repeatedly experienced since going live on 28th October, movements calmed yesterday, providing the privacy-oriented digital currency with uncharacteristically modest price fluctuations.  Opening the session at $68.72, ZEC climbed as much as 6% to reach $72.94 during the day, CoinMarketCap data reveals. The digital currency later gave up these gains, declining to roughly $68.68 by 20:50 UTC, 5.8% lower than the daily high and roughly on par with the opening price.  The digital currency experienced these relatively modest price fluctuations amid light volume. (ZEC's 24-hour volume hit $1.28m at points, CoinMarketCap figures show).  This figure compares to daily volume of $4.8m and $3.53m on 1st and 25th November, respectively.  The relative calm is serving as a contrast to the wild fluctuations seen in late October when it surged to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2 million) on Poloniex and declined to 1 BTC, all within the span of just a few weeks of trading.
