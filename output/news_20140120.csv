42425312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0nh,1390254053,Streetwear Trendsetter Hypebeast Now Accepting Bitcoin,"Hong Kong-based alternative fashion news site Hypebeast revealed in a Twitter post on 20th January that it is now officially accepting bitcoin for purchases at its online store.      Hypebeast sells a wide variety of high-end streetwear and accessories, including hats, hoodies and headphones from brands like Eastpak and Puma, as well as notable designers such as Raf Simons. Prices range from under $20 to over $100 with the majority of its featured brands being from smaller, independent labels.      Cop with Bitcoins: Now Accepted at the #HYPEBEASTStore. Head over to the store now: http://t.co/k3AUjTUM00 pic.twitter.com/BtOHyjp5f0      — Hypebeast (@HYPEBEAST) January 20, 2014      With the announcement, bitcoin joins Alipay, American Express, MasterCard, PayPal, UnionPay and Visa as payment methods accepted at the Hypebeast store. Georgia-based payment processor BitPay will process the site's bitcoin transactions.    Customer reaction    The announcement, issued via the brand's official Twitter account, proved popular on social media, garnering nearly 80 interactions in the first hour alone. Reactions were positive among the site's fan base, though a closer look at bitcoin demographics suggests the sales success of the initiative could be an interesting test case for bitcoin.      For example, Hypebeast users are predominantly male, and at 18-to-30 years old, younger than the average bitcoin enthusiast according to recent research. An upswing in sales from this younger demographic could indicate that bitcoin is beginning to gain influence and build upon its existing base of users.    What is Hypebeast?    Founded as a blog in 2005, Hypebeast has quickly evolved into a major influencer in the online fashion space, with Fast Company noting that founder Kevin Ma's ""stamp of approval can help make or break an underground or indie brand trying to catch the attention of influencers or even savvy mainstream consumers"".      In a 2011 interview with Forbes, Ma credited the success of his site to its high-profile fans, such as Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco, who has collaborated with and advocated for the online fashion site.    Online retail    While not a major international name, Hypebeast is nonetheless another online retail outlet that has announced bitcoin acceptance in recent weeks, following in the footsteps of Overstock, whose announcement was seen as a watershed moment for the industry, one that could push big names like Amazon and eBay closer to acceptance.    Following the announcement, rumors began to surface that NewEgg would follow Overstock's lead, however, no formal announcement has yet been made by the California-based company.  As of February 2012, Hypebeast was garnering roughly three million unique views a month, with the majority of its traffic – 50% to 60% – originating in the United States.

42425305,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0jh,1390240386,Jamaican Bobsleigh Team Raises $30k in Dogecoins,"The Jamaican bobsleigh team has received more than $30,000 worth of dogecoins from what can only be described as a community meme-loving bobsleigh enthusiasts.  The dogecoin community took to Reddit and made it all happen in less than a day. Technically the team has not qualified for the Sochi Olympics yet, but the team’s pilot Winston Watts is confident that his guys will make it through.  The only hurdle in their way is the Dutch team, which will probably be forced to withdraw as it has not managed to achieve the standard set by Holland’s national Olympic Committee. In other words, the last of the 30 bobsleigh teams to take part in the Olympics will either come from a Caribbean nation that gets most of its ice in cocktails, or the only country in Europe without a hill.  However, even with the Dutch team out of the way, the Jamaicans will need a bit of help, as they are about $40,000 short. The team needs more equipment and it has to cover travel expenses, but luckily the Jamaican bobsleigh team has quite a following. The Internet responded to their plea for donations by collecting more than 26m dogecoins, or about $33,000. Since dogecoin is very volatile, the community exchanged the dogecoins into bitcoins and pledged to transfer 35 BTC to the team.    FANS can now make a donation to our Jamaica Bobsleigh Team at http://t.co/f5FItpLRMl Thx #JamaicaBobsled #Sochi2014 pic.twitter.com/cA6Nu8bbGj      — Team Jamaica (@JamaicaOlympics) January 20, 2014    The team has also launched an indiegogo campaign with a target of $80,000, which should be raised over the next 20 days. It has managed to raise just over $5,000 in a single day, so it seems to be doing well – and anyone who pledges $50 will get a cool Team Jamaica T-shirt.  In addition to third-party funding, pilot Watts has already spent more than $165,000 of his own money to bring the team to Sochi. Watts clearly has a lot riding on the success of online funding drives, but so far it seems everything is going well.  The Jamaican bobsleigh team made their debut during the 1988 Olympics in Calgary and it quickly became a media darling. A fictionalized account of the original team’s exploits was the basis of Disney’s 1993 film Cool Runnings. The team remains the only Olympic bobsleigh team from a tropical nation to this day. Jamaica managed to qualify for the 1992, 1994 and 2002 Winter Olympics, but it has been absent from the Olympic scene since then.

42425294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Rh,1390236831,Cigar Industry Receives Bitcoin Boost,"It seems Hong Kong's goo-filled ASIC mining facilities and jazz-playing cigar bars have at least one thing in common: bitcoin.  Australia's largest premium cigar retailer, Brisbane-based Fine Cigars Australia began accepting the currency after receiving several email requests from customers.  The company's general manager, Matthew Mroczek, said he and the company were already comfortable with bitcoin by that stage. Fine Cigars Australia accepts bitcoin directly into a personal wallet without using any payment processor, and even uses bitcoin at stages further up the supply chain.  ""We have been using it for several months now to pay some of our suppliers in places like Mexico and Nicaragua because it is simply a far more efficient method of payment,"" he said.  ""To go through normal banking channels it would take two days for them to get the money, which delayed the delivery to our customers. Not to mention the problem with currency movements over such a time period.""  ""The alternative to that was costing us about 5-6% through Visa or Paypal. However with bitcoin it only takes an hour and the cost is usually only 1% of the transaction.""  Fine Cigars sells over 200 different brands of cigar, mainly sourced from Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. According to its website, the business was started in 2009 by ""a group of Australian connoisseurs, exasperated at the availability, dismal quality and limited selection of cigars in Australia"".  Mroczek said he was able to pay suppliers directly in bitcoin thanks to a deal ""with a couple of people that I have a long history with"".  Cigars for bitcoin  Another large international online cigar purveyor, Puro Express, also accepts bitcoin and even offers a 10% discount to customers who pay using the currency. The company also sells cigars for bitcoins through Red Solis and CigarExport.com.  Puro Express has offices in Switzerland, Spain, Hong Kong and Las Palmas, and ships mostly from Geneva. Open since 1997, it specializes in Cuban cigars and cigar culture accessories, with guides and even an iPhone app to aid selection.  Vicky, a spokesperson for the company, said Puro Express received its first bitcoin payment in March last year and sales in bitcoin are increasing every month. Like Fine Cigars Australia, Puro Express doesn't bother with a payment processor.  ""We do not use a payment processor we keep our bitcoins. Our pricing is updated according to the exchange rate against the USD, at minimum hourly. If it's particulary volatile, I run a routine that updates the exchange rate more often,"" she said.  The company does not, however, pay its own suppliers in bitcoin just yet. But its international customers also run up against barriers when dealing with banks.  ""It is great to see bitcoin on the increase, it's so much easier for international tranasactions,"" Vicky continued.  ""We're seeing a huge increase in the number of customers who have to phone their bank to have international charges authorized before a charge will go through on their card. Bitcoin is so much easier.""  Among Puro Express' accessories are humidors of various sizes, cutters and lighters (but disappointingly no smoking jackets). Butane is usually the fuel of choice for lighting cigars or, if you're inclined, $100 bills.  But if you'd rather put those Benjamins to better use acquiring more bitcoin, this online store offers more affordable and appropriate fiat lighter options.

42425306,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0ph,1390233638,Could Bitcoin Surpass Google's $384 Billion Market Cap?,"Just how big a financial opportunity is Bitcoin?  Recently, Wall Street has been starting to ask that very question, paying more and more attention to the upstart alternative currency.  The first analysis by a registered broker dealer which attempted to value bitcoin's worth was published on 1 December by Wedbush Securities.  While Los Angeles-based Wedbush is a respected securities firm, it doesn't count itself among the first-tier of investment banks, or the ‘bulge bracket’ as its known on Wall Street. The Wedbush research report contained some novel analysis and perspective, but it was also ‘light’ in that it weighed in at just one and a half pages.  In short, it was not yet clear just how interested Wall Street was in Bitcoin.  However, when bulge bracket member Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) and its well-regarded currency analyst David Woo followed Wedbush’s lead with a detailed 11-page report and valuation analysis, it became clear that Wall Street was taking the cryptocurrency seriously.  Bitcoin’s price is only part of what interests Wall Street  What grabbed the most headlines from both the Wedbush and BAML research reports was the bitcoin price analysis offered by the competing houses.  [post-quote]  David Woo and his team at BAML gave a maximum fair value estimate for Bitcoin of $1,300. Gil Luria and Aaron Turner of Webush shied away from providing a specific number, instead suggesting a potential 10x-100x range above its value at the time of their report.  What grabbed fewer headlines, but was arguably more interesting, were the comments in each report about the real opportunity Bitcoin presents to disrupt the existing financial services industry.  In the words of Luria and Turner: “the long-term threat posed by this technology is mostly to the payment networks (V, MA) and technology facilitators such as CIW, in our opinion. We believe [cryptocurrency] technology may have advantages in introducing new capabilities and a superior point-to-point cost structure to the current hub-and-spoke branded networks.”  The natural follow-on question from this is just how big are the payment networks and technology facilitators?  Measuring Bitcoin’s disruption potential  Table 1 below presents a list of companies in four sectors which Bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem touch – payment processors, payment hardware, bank software, and money transfer and ATM outsourcing.    Table 1: Bitcoin Ecosystem - Comparable Company Market Caps ($s millions)    The first point worth highlighting is that the combined total market capitalization for the basket of companies in Table 1 was $314bn as of 10th January, 2014. This is a significant figure, and not so far off from the current market capitalization of Google ($384bn).  In short, if you were simply wondering why venture capitalists are interested in investing in Bitcoin then you need not look any further than this number.  (Note: An important feature to observe about the basket of companies presented above is that it is largely dominated by North American firms. While many of the above companies are global leaders, the basket is missing European and Asian firms due to data availability constraints. This analysis may thus materially skew downwards the total global market capitalization for these sectors of the financial services industry.)  Of the $314bn in total market cap, it is also interesting to note that $210bn in market cap (or two-thirds of the total for this basket of companies) is made up by just two firms: Visa and Mastercard. The value which is concentrated in these two payment processors speaks volumes about why venture capitalists have focused their largest investments to date in bitcoin processors such as Coinbase.  Large Market Caps = Large Profit Margins  Why do some of the companies in Table 1 have much larger market caps than others?  Factors such as total revenue, growth opportunity and management team (among other elements) all play an important role in determining valuation for publicly traded companies. But the single financial measure which Wall Street arguably obsesses over more than any other is profit margins.    Table 2: Bitcoin Ecosystem - Comparable Company EBITDA Margins    Table 2 summarizes the EBITDA margins for the same basket of companies. Here we can quickly see part of story behind why Visa and Mastercard have such large market capitalizations. The two payment processors have the highest EBITDA margins in the basket at 66% and 58%, respectively. Such high margins make for an attractive target for would be disrupters.  While it is tempting to focus on the largest companies which Bitcoin has the opportunity to disrupt, smaller operators should also fear Bitcoin.  The largest of the money transfer and ATM outsourcing companies, Western Union, has a $9bn market cap, which is not far from Twitter’s market cap at its IPO pricing. Part of the reason for Western Union’s high market cap is that the firm can earn upwards of 10% per transaction on international remittances, leading to a plump EBITDA margins of 25%.  The overall size of the sectors which Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt combined with relatively fat profit margins explain a significant reason behind why investors and Wall Street see big things in store for Bitcoin.

42425299,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Zh,1390230925,Bitcoin Classified 'Commodity' by Finland Central Bank,"Bitcoin has been classified as a commodity in Finland after the Scandinavian country’s central bank declared that it did not meet the definition of a currency.  The Bank of Finland  concluded that bitcoin simply doesn't meet the legal conditions required to be considered a form of electronic payment, either.  Paeivi Heikkinen, head of oversight at the bank, told Bloomberg that bitcoin was more comparable to a commodity at this point.  “Considering the definition of an official currency as set out in law, it’s not that. It’s also not a payment instrument, because the law stipulates that a payment instrument must have an issuer responsible for its operation,” Heikkinen said.  Finland open to digital currency  Unlike some countries, Finland has so far embraced a more liberal attitude towards digital currencies. In addition, these currencies are remarkably popular in certain circles.  A recent survey carried out by Nordnet AB found that one in ten Finns is interested in investing in digital currencies. Among men interest was a bit higher, with 17.2% of those questioned saying they would consider investing in bitcoin. The country is also home to one of Europe's first permanently installed bitcoin ATMs.  This latest statement is unlikely to change very much. Finns will still be able to exchange bitcoins and make investments. However, Heikkinen warns that nobody guarantees the value of bitcoin and huge fluctuations are commonplace. He notes: “It’s at your own risk.”  Regulation may prove necessary  Despite Finland’s liberal attitude, Heikkenen believes more should be done to supervise digital currencies.  “The changes in value are totally unregulated and very vulnerable to news, speculation and hoaxes. If the phenomenon grows and begins to cause side effects, officials will then have to consider whether to regulate it and how,” he said.  Heikkenen raises an interesting point. For the time being there is simply not a lot of need for regulation, as the bitcoin economy is relatively small. Some regulators like the Chinese central bank have clearly stated that bitcoin does not pose a threat to fiscal or monetary stability.  However, with greater adoption it is only logical to expect more calls for some form of regulation. While speculators might not like it, a sound regulatory framework that would eliminate many ambiguities related to digital currencies could actually boost bitcoin adoption worldwide.

42425307,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0rh,1390225278,Chicago Ready to Host a Flourishing Bitcoin Economy,"On 7th January, the temperature in Chicago was -4 degrees Farenheit (that’s -20 degrees Celsius). That evening, a Tuesday, nearly 40 people ventured out in to the Arctic conditions and gathered at the Atlas Brewing Company for beer and food. The reason? Bitcoin.  In a city with a population of 2.7 million, 40 people at a bitcoin meetup is clearly a drop in the ocean. But bitcoin’s Chicago cheerleaders say it’s a sign of a dedicated community, one they say is growing. What’s more, they argue, the city is ripe to host a flourishing bitcoin economy.  Experimenting with bitcoin  At the end of this month, The Chicago Sun-Times, the US’ ninth-largest newspaper and a daily Chicago newspaper, is set to become the first major US newspaper to try out a bitcoin paywall.  Starting on 1st February, for 24 hours only, the newspaper will allow users to get over its paywall by making a bitcoin donation. The experiment, in collaboration with San Francisco-based BitWall, will help to test the functionality of a bitcoin paywall.  “We are becoming a tech-savvy city,” says Jonathan Solomon, 28, founder of Chicago Mint. “But it wasn’t always this way.”  A self-described “bitcoin ambassador”, Solomon has made it his mission to get as many of Chicago’s business as possible to accept bitcoin. His fledging startup helps small businesses integrate bitcoin payments via companies like Coinbase and BitPay.  “Businesses may have heard of bitcoin but aren’t ready to take the leap themselves,” he tells CoinDesk via Skype. “I see myself as giving them the final push.”  Despite not having the tech reputation of places like San Francisco or New York, tech startup investment in Chicago is growing, with the city’s startups raising billion dollars in 2013, a jump of 169 percent from 2012, according to Built in Chicago. In 2012, a new startup was founded every 24 hours in Chicago.  Chicago is just getting started  One the earliest, if not the first, Chicago business to start accepting bitcoin was a t-shirt company, 7bucktees, owned by Booshworks, back in early 2012. A Robocoin bitcoin ATM is reported to be coming to Chicago later this year and at the recent bitcoin meetup, the Atlas Brewing Company became the first bar to accept bitcoin payments. On Coinmap.org there are just a handful of listed bitcoin businesses.  “Chicago is just getting started,” say Gil Valentine, founder of Great Lakes Chicago Bitcoin, a Chicago-based bitcoin news site, a founder of Invincible Wallet, a digital wallet company. “In relation to New York and Miami we’re behind … We are just starting to see businesses here in Chicago accepting bitcoin.”  Like almost every where else in the world, awareness is part of the challenge. Though Steve Soble, owner of the Atlas Brewing Company, accepted bitcoins on 6th January, which Solomon facilitated, he says he’s still unsure about fully integrating the digital currency.  “We have not made up our minds whether or not to take it yet. We like the idea of it but we are not yet comfortable with it,” he said. “It is a little intimidating and there are a lot of differing opinions on whether or not it is a good idea for businesses to take it.  “What makes me uncomfortable is the volatility and we have been warned by our credit card processors not to ever take it. It was verbal communication and they said it was risky. It was not a threat or anything like that.”  Skate to the puck  For Jonathan Solomon, who is currently enrolled in Chicago’s Starter School, a kind of college for training digital entrepreneurs and another example of Chicago’s growing tech fluency, winning over business owners like Soble is central to his mission.  And though Chicago isn’t yet synonymous with bitcoin, he thinks it one day will be, which is exactly why he moved here. He quotes Canadian ice hockey star Wayne Gretzky:  ""You skate to where the puck is going to be, not where the puck is""  Chicago skycrapers image via Josh*m/Flickr    Other images by Neil Sy, Chicago's first photographer to accept bitcoin",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/20/chicago-ready-to-host-a-flourishing-bitcoin-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b5f9614b2c2d30b89fc5faa207a209062b5cf2d-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425303,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0hh,1390220452,South Korean Bitcoin Exchange Nets $400k in Silicon Valley Funding,"Updated 21st January  South Korean bitcoin startup Korbit has announced that it will receive $400,000 in funding from various Silicon Valley investors.  If that figure doesn't impress, the names behind it might. The list includes DFC founder Tim Draper, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, SV Angel founder David Lee and Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket and a high-profile bitcoin advocate.  Draper said bitcoin's growth in Korea has been remarkable, adding that Korbit is setting a good example for bitcoin companies around the world. He argues Korea could play a leading role in the future of global finance by capitalizing on innovations like bitcoin.  Korbit's profitability  As it stands, Korbit is the biggest bitcoin exchange in Korea with more than 20,000 users. One of its competitors, Coinplug, also received $400,000 in funding from SilverBlue, another Silicon Valley investor and is currently developing a POS application for Korean merchants.  Korbit CEO Tony Lyu said the company is already profitable, but it needed strategic investors to grow its lead and improve global competitiveness.  ""We'll be spending the extra money on hiring great talent and improving our infrastructure,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""We're working hard to fill the gaps in the bitcoin ecosystem here in Korea.""  The exchange was established just seven months ago and it has already received funding from a foundation for young entrepreneurs, formed by Korea’s banking alliance.  Last week Korbit started processing all operations in real-time and it claims to be the world’s fastest bitcoin buying platform, as users can sign up, pay, and withdraw their coins in under three minutes.  Regulation in South Korea  Although South Korea’s bitcoin economy is relatively small compared to that of China or Japan, the government does not appear to be interested in regulating or limiting the use of bitcoin.  Last month, the Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service issued a joint statement, saying that they would not recognise bitcoin and other digital currencies as legal tender.  At the time, the officials said bitcoin simply does not meet the conditions to be considered a currency and therefore it does not meet standard regulations governing online transactions.  Interestingly, Korbit managed to secure the funding deal thanks to its participation in a Silicon Valley summit last year, which was supported by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. In other words, it appears that the Korean government and its banks are supporting bitcoin startups, albeit indirectly.

42425308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0th,1390217710,Bitcoin Trading Thrives at London's First Satoshi Square Event,"London held its first Satoshi Square event on Saturday 18th January – a bitcoin meetup combined with live face-to-face trading of the sort popularly imagined to dominate Wall Street.  Part networking event, part trading floor and part public outreach, the event attracted everyone from bitcoin entrepreneurs to curious members of the public.  “We want to increase awareness of bitcoin among the general public. Bitcoin is a concept that’s quite difficult to get your head around, so we want to bring the public together with people who are experts in digital currency,” said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a bitcoin insurance startup in the UK, and organiser of the Satoshi Square event.  One of those experts was Hugh Halford-Thompson, co-founder of quickbitcoin.co.uk, a UK-based bitcoin marketplace.  “London’s bitcoin community is good, just look around,” he said, gesturing to the crowd of roughly 100 people who had congregated at Spitalfields Market for the event. “But the biggest thing we all want to do is kick off the [bitcoin] economy.”  Halford-Thompson was doing his best to grow the community on Saturday, helping people set up wallets and educating them about bitcoin. As we talked a women approached us to talk about bitcoin and he leapt into action, “Have you got an iPhone or Android, we can get you set up!”  But the bitcoin economy is a bigger challenge, he said:  “It’s moving in the right direction, but I think a bigger problem than regulation is the banking issue. Irrelevant of the regulation, they don’t want bitcoin companies or bitcoin services. My view on that is they probably don’t want bitcoin to work.”  Although there are a few bitcoin businesses in London, like The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, the city still lacks a natural home for bitcoin in the same way that Berlin has the Kreuzberg area.  “What I’d really like to do is get a group of businesses in a similar area, introduce them to bitcoin, get them set up and get an economy together,” says Halford-Thompson.  Other bitcoiners at the event were mainly happy to be among like-minded people. As you would expect for a community built around a digital currency – and for any community in 2013 – much of the interaction happens online.  “It’s nice to meet with people in real time. Using bitcoin in the real world, it’s rare,” said Mark, 59. Like many in the community, the former soldier’s main interest in digital currencies was anonymity.  “Anonymity is the most important thing to me … the products I buy fall into an area that bitcoin doesn’t want to be associated with.”  He declined to provide more details, but noted the impressive speed with which the “criminal fraternity” had adapted to bitcoin.  Of course most of the people there didn’t fit this stereotype, borne out of bitcoin’s previous association with the Silk Road. The site’s demise, thought to be bitcoin’s death knell, arguably freed bitcoin to enter the mainstream untainted by a high-profile connection to drugs and illegality. Some residue still remains, however.  “Even techies are suspicious of it, they think it’s a bubble or it's a scam,” said Scott, 43, a mobile developer and creator of Bitty Bot, which trawls bitcoin marketplaces every five minutes and tweets the best prices.  Events like Satoshi Square, held out in the open (and unfortunately the cold), are an important tool in dispelling these myths and stereotypes. The answer to the question “What’s bitcoin?” was on fine display on Saturday. Simply, it’s the ordinary people who use it because they believe we can build a better foundation for finance in the 21st century.

42425300,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0bh,1390196471,Fledgling Altcoin NXT Now Listed on BTER Exchange,"Is it possible to have an truly alternative altcoin? The developers behind new digital currency NXT think so - and they're gaining traction. The altcoin, which was officially launched on Jan 3rd, just signed BTER as an exchange partner.  NXT  works in a different way to bitcoin, and to other coins like litecoin that use different algorithms for mining. The currency isn't mined using computing power. Instead, it uses a version of Proof of Stake (PoS), which was a concept initially pioneered by peercoin.  PoS works by awarding new coins to existing coinholders based on the number of coins they already have. The idea is to generate new coins without having to chew up vast amounts of energy as the bitcoin network does. NXT does this by working out how many coins everyone has, and using these figures in conjunction with a random math function to work out who will be forging the next block. That person then processes all of the transactions in the current block, and is awarded some coins for it.  Avoiding double spend and 51% attacks  One of NXT's unique characteristics is that everyone knows who is going to be mining the next block. Everyone on the network then sends their transactions to that person. This drastically reduces traffic, claims the development team, while also decreasing confirmation times practically to zero. The team claims credit card-like transaction times.  This solves a perennial issue faced by bitcoin users. They run the risk of a double spending attack, where someone sends a bitcoin and then persuades the rest of the network that it didn't happen, enabling them to spend the coin again somewhere else.  To engineer that kind of attack, the fraudster would have to mine their own block with their own, falsified transaction records, separately to the rest of the network, and then convince others miners that they should accept it as the real one.  To protect against that, bitcoiners are supposed to wait for the next block in the real block chain to be mined (which takes around ten minutes), before accepting a bitcoin payment. Some people suggest waiting for six confirmations, which can take longer. People on the bitcoin network often allow zero-confirmation bitcoin transactions, but they do it at their own risk.  What's to stop someone on the NXT network from trying to convince the rest of the network that a transaction didn't actually happen? This is where a concept called transparent forging comes in.  In NXT, everyone knows who's supposed to be mining the next block in the block chain. If they're trying to mine a fraudulent block and fork the chain, then that means that they can't be mining the real one. The network can detect this, and reduces that miner's mining power to zero, thus choking off their efforts.  NXT is different to peercoin, which only uses PoS for part of its base of coins, using PoW for the rest. Peercoin will grow this percentage over time. NXT starts with 100% PoS, and isn't mining any coins, because they have already all been produced.  ""The term pre-mine does not apply to a true Proof-of-Stake (PoS) currency such as NXT, as there is no mining in the traditional sense of most coins, most notably bitcoin,"" said NiftyNickel, one of the coin's organizers. ""Investors gain additional coins through PoS based on transaction fees. Unlike PoS hybrid implementations, NXT is able to reward those that protect the network while avoiding inflating the money supply.""  The NXT team created the entire base of NXT coins - one billion of them - in advance. 75 investors then purchased the coins, putting in a total of 21 BTC. They then began trading them directly in the forums, or via the first central exchange set up for that purpose, called DGEX. Investment was open to everyone, says NiftyNickel.  ""I have foreseen this in the peercoin paper that currencies could be issued like stock IPO,"" said Sunny King, founder of peercoin. ""Although we didn't attempt this approach for peercoin as we think the mining industry is a better method of issuance for currencies, probably more fair, but of course this is subjective and everyone could have different opinions.""  John Manglaviti, King's community development manager on peercoin, who also helped to kick off the Feathercoin community in the early days, has been involved in NXT. He schooled NiftyNickel in some community building tactics, and also owns around $12,000 worth of coins at its current market cap.  Manglaviti wishes NXT all the best, and welcomes an innovative coin into the altcoin community. Nevertheless, it has its challenges. One of the advantages of a hybrid PoW/PoS system, such as peercoin's is that not all of the coins are owned by a small group at one time.  ""If the initial distribution is rather small, in cases such as NXT, there has to be every effort from the community to encourage the original founders to distribute the coin as quickly as possible,"" he warns. ""If hoarding occurs, it will drastically effect the liquidity of the coin, the community will lose interest and the price will plummet.""  BTER, which seems to be a haven for altcoins, might help to increase the coin's liquidity somewhat. In the long run, though, the NXT developers want to expand from central exchanges to a decentralized exchange mechanism. This is a tough technical problem, and various people have tried it in the past.  NXT's team isn't afraid to pile on ambitious features. The team also wants to tackle some other problems, some of which have been successfully implemented with other coins, and some which haven't. No one coin has done them all yet.  One such feature is a naming and messaging system. NXT Alias will allow a user to substitute a string for any uniform resource identifier (URI), which is a digital asset of any kind, such as a phone number, image, NXT account number, or web page.  NXT's decentralized domain name and messaging system also enables people to host their own web sites and chat to each other anonymously. This is akin to the naming system in namecoin, although it will doubtless be implemented differently under the hood.  Another thing that NXT promises is coloured coins, which is something that the bitcoin community has been discussing for a long time. This would enable coins to be 'marked' with specific attributes, so that they could be used to describe other assets, including virtual ones (stocks, bonds, and derivatives), and physical ones (your house or car, perhaps).  ""On one hand, it's nice to see a coin attempt to do something different rather than being just another bitcoin/litecoin/peercoin clone with just basic parameters modified,"" said Manglaviti. ""The crypto community grows tired of all the knock-offs and NXT provides hope for a new direction. On the other hand, it's a brand new coin without a proven history. I would have much seen a rock solid user friendly client on day one, rather than some of the more flashy features that have been released.""  NXT wants to impress, though. It has made its code open source, and the developers continue to add to it over time. So how much is it worth?  Market capitalization is a tricky thing to calculate for a coin like this. Coinmarketmap.com, which includes NXT and Ripple in its list, puts NXT at number 6 in market cap. Dustcoin.com includes neither, rendering NXT invisible.  NXT is worth a tiny fraction of bitcoin - far less than, say, a litecoin or a peercoin. When it was first distributed, a bitcoin was worth 47.6m NXT based on the amount invested, and the number of people who invested it. Or, to put it another way, each NXT was worth roughly one forty-seven millionth of a bitcoin.  Now, at the current ask price, each NXT is worth roughly one six hundred thousandth of a bitcoin. That's a decent rise in just a few months of unofficial trading. It's still worth relatively little. But because the team released all of them at once, the coin can obtain a large market cap very quickly. A billion very cheap coins can be worth a lot.  This makes NXT and bitcoin - even NXT and peercoin for that matter - entirely different animals. So whether you'd want to include their market cap on a broader list or create a new one with hardly any coins on it is a personal decision. One thing's for sure: if a coin is innovative enough to warrant its own category, it's worth keeping an eye on.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/20/fledgling-altcoin-nxt-now-listed-on-bter-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e9f7943ec5b6a776d0b5097e3f5988740e7502d-1000x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
