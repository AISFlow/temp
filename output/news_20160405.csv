42426756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUhh,1459892074,R3 Announces New Distributed Ledger Technology Corda,"Consortium startup R3CEV today announced it is working on a distributed ledger that might otherwise be considered a blockchain, but which the company made perfectly clear is anything but.  Far from the permissionless ledger of transactions popularized by bitcoin, R3's technology, called Corda, claims to be tailor-made for financial institutions. The only information that’s decentralized is whatever the members choose is necessary.  In a blog post published today, R3’s chief technology officer and the man in charge of the project, Richard Gendal Brown, described one of the key differences between Corda and what most people in the industry think of when they imagine a blockchain.  Brown wrote:  ""We are not building a blockchain. Unlike other designs in this space, our starting point is individual agreements between firms... We reject the notion that all data should be copied to all participants, even if it is encrypted.""  Other key differences include that the developers of Corda, who include chief engineer James Carlyle, and lead platform engineer Mike Hearn, focused from the beginning on the legal language around how disputed agreements are resolved and on concerns unique to regulated financial companies.  ""We need to make it easy to write business logic and integrate with existing code,"" wrote Brown, who was hired from IBM in September to lead the project. ""We need to focus on interoperability and we need to support the choreography between firms as they build up their agreements.”  Unlike bitcoin's blockchain which distributes the entire history of transactions among its nodes, Brown highlighted that in Corda only verified transactions are shared.  Regulators are given ""supervisory observer nodes"" from which they can monitor the system, a functionality that is being built into blockchain systems, including Overstock's tØ platform.  Early today Bloomberg reported that R3's consortium members, who participated in creating the tool, will be testing Corda over the coming weeks. In the coming months the company plans to release the core of the platform as open source, ""possibly as a contribution to other endeavours,"" according to the blog post.

42426752,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUZh,1459889561,Blockstream Adds Another Marquee Developer in Security Pioneer Christopher Allen,"Blockstream has hired online security pioneer Christopher Allen as its standards and identity practice specialist, a role that will find him taking the lead on the company’s work with the open-source Hyperledger blockchain project, among other efforts.  The venture-backed startup, best known as a provider of enterprise tools focused on the bitcoin blockchain, was among 10 new firms to join Hyperledger last week, a move that followed more informal work with its members to discern its technical vision. Blockstream is notably one of the largest contributors of funding for Bitcoin Core, the ecosystem's largely volunteer development community.  In statements, Allen struck an inclusive tone, noting that he hopes to position Blockstream as a leader in an ecosystem that has increasingly embraced other blockchain protocols and technologies.  Allen said:  ""Standards groups will enable members of the larger blockchain community to manifest shared visions, to grow their markets, to participate in the public good and commons, to align their investments and to find mutually supportive roles. That is the true goal of ecosystem leadership.""  Blockstream’s hire, announced today, adds yet another veteran coder to the company’s already deep pool of talent that includes hashcash inventor Adam Back, Confidential Transactions author Greg Maxwell and Segregated Witness author Pieter Wuille.  Allen is perhaps best known as the co-author of IETF TLS Internet-draft, which underpins much of the existing e-commerce security on the Web. He is also the co-founder of Consensus Development, which in the late 1980s helped Netscape develop SSL, a widely used communications security protocol.  The company said his mandate at Blockstream would include all technical standards work, decentralized identity and strategic initiatives with international standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and Oasis.  Blockstream has raised a total of $76m venture capital from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures, Real Ventures, AXA Group and others. In January 2016 the company announced a strategic partnership with “Big Four” accounting firm PwC to build blockchain services for its clients.  Michael del Castillo contributed reporting.

42426757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUfh,1459884647,Regulation a Doubled-Edged Sword for Blockchain Clearing and Settlement,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based entrepreneur, Ethereum Foundation advisor and advisor to Consensus 2016, CoinDesk's flagship conference. He is also the author of the upcoming book, The Business Blockchain.  In this feature, Mougayar explores how blockchain could shift the world's regulatory landscape for financial institutions, weighing some of the factors that will impact how governments and regulators interact with the technology.  Let's start with a fact. Interbank settlement takes days to clear because of regulation and a multi-party intermediary infrastructure.  This is also commonly accepted as a challenge the blockchain could help solve. Every segment of the global capital markets ecosystem today is getting ready for some type of leap to address friction in the settlement lifecycle.  Some of the applications being looked at today include:  Bonds  Collateral management  Commodities  Derivatives  Over-the-counter (OTC) markets  Swaps  Syndicated loans  The repurchase market  Unregistered/registered securities  Warehouse receipts.  Whether via lip service or real work, most stakeholders and participants providing these market functions have declared an interest in blockchain tech.  Yet some questions about their approach remain. For example, while we've heard about a range of big bank blockchain trials, we've yet to see their real-world impact.  Without this, we have to ask: Are we talking real disruption, or are we going to improve things by a little? Further, what is the role of regulation in lubricating this next evolution?  Seeking answers  The variety of financial services regulatory authorities around the world might rival the number of ice cream flavor varieties. More than 200 such bodies exist in 150 countries, and many of them have been eyeing the blockchain and exploring how to go about updating their rules to account for the technology.  Imagine if each one of these bodies issued their own type of blockchain regulations, without coordination, or without due consideration for the full implications of such policies. Not only would a mess ensue, but potentially, the blockchain technology industry might wind up shackled as a result of the resulting regulatory confusion.  The Commissioner of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), J Christopher Giancarlo underscored that specific point during a speech he made on 29th March at a conference organized by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  He said:  “Yet, this investment faces the danger that when regulation does come, it will come from a dozen different directions with different restrictions stifling crucial technological development before it reaches fruition.”  When the Internet arrived, governments and policy makers were smart enough to not regulate it too early – a choice that contributed to its long-term growth. The reality facing financial services institutions is that, once again, they will be at the mercy of the regulators when it comes to blockchain tech.  Some vexing situations could arise if regulations don’t keep up with technology or social developments. Look at the case of Uber fighting 50-year-old regulations geared toward taxi cartels, or the difficulty in updating regulations against telecommunication industry monopolies.  Banks are between a rock and a hard place. Blockchains are worldwide, but much of the current regulatory climate today has forced innovators to focus on serving local needs rather than global ones.  Legalizing blockchain transactions  Regulation has offered a degree of protection – but it could also be the blockchain's undoing.  In order for blockchain-based business interactions to achieve widespread use, transactions processed on blockchain will need to be recognized as legally binding and acceptable within existing compliance requirements.  This might involve revisiting recordkeeping rules, or at least ensuring that new regulation does not specifically prevent institutions from using the blockchain to run these kinds of transactions.  At the very least, rules should be put in place that allow them to experiment with that technology and continue showcasing new capabilities – learning where they can lead.  You can already see examples of this in various jurisdictions looking at creating so-called ""sandboxes"" for innovation.  A better inter-banking network?  Each financial institution has its own proprietary systems, and each is required to use private networks they either own or control to move money in their possession. This mesh of complexity is certainly not helpful for clearing transactions quickly.  By way of its powerful vision of a single ledger, blockchain tech is questioning if financial institutions can continue depending on proprietary systems that silo them off from one another. The prospect of a more homogeneous – but also more transparent – audit trail of global transactions could offer unique insights and lower risks.  The litmus test is to run transactions without a central intermediary in the middle.  Verifying identity and validating counterparties can be done in a peer-to-peer manner on the blockchain, and that is the preferred method that organizations should be trying to perfect. Already, several blockchain trials and proofs-of-concept have demonstrated this capability.  Can the financial services industry cut the intermediary umbilical cord and favor peer-to-peer transactions, while at the same time recording all activity in a way that satisfies regulators? Technically, the answer is yes. But here is the dilemma: Banks don’t want to change banking.  Rather, startups want to change banking. And if blockchain can alter the way these institutions interact, reconciling these positions will be interesting to watch.  These issues and subjects will be discussed during an upcoming panel session at Consensus 2016.

42426758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUjh,1459877562,IBM Watson is Working to Bring AI to the Blockchain,"IBM is currently attempting to merge artificial intelligence and the blockchain into a single, powerful prototype.  With blockchain tech's promise of near-frictionless value exchange and artificial intelligence’s ability to accelerate the analysis of massive amounts of data, the joining of the two could mark the beginning of an entirely new paradigm.  Over the past three months, IBM’s chief architect in charge of Internet of Things security Tim Hahn has focused specifically on introducing the blockchain to his company’s artificially intelligent computer named Watson.  Hahn told CoinDesk:  ""What we’re doing with blockchain and devices is enabling the information those devices supply to effect the blockchain…You begin to approach the kind of things we see in movies.""  Potential applications include using distributed ledgers to let devices perform tasks like running self-diagnoses at set times and more advanced services that may someday let regulators virtually go back in time to the point where a device failed and ""to identify exactly what went wrong,"" Hahn said.  Watson meets IoT  While exciting, the work is still in its early days of development.  As recently as last March, IBM announced it planned to invest $3bn over four years to build an entire unit dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), the term used to describe the connection of a wide range of hardware devices such as washing machines and thermostats to the Internet.  Such connections are predicted to generate $235bn in revenue by the end of the year, an increase of 22% from the year before, according to a 2015 report by Gartner. The report projects 6.4 billion connected devices could be in use globally by the end of this year, a number predicted to reach as high as 20.8 billion devices by 2020.  But, with all that opportunity comes security risks as well.  For Hahn's project, the Watson Internet of Things group — a merger of the IBM Internet of Things Foundation and IBM Watson — this means exploring how artificial intelligence might help make those ""smart"" things safer.  He said:  ""We found that there’s this interesting convergence between IBM Watson capability and the Internet of Things Foundation and we decided it would be even better if we combined the two.""  IBM breaks down Watson Internet of Things into four categories: how devices are connected; how information is managed, stored and transformed; how risks are managed; and how data is analyzed.  Hahn’s work focuses specifically on the third category and how blockchains might be used to make devices safer for their users, in part by reducing human involvement in their operation.  A Watson-powered blockchain  “Its early days,” Hahn said. “And we’re just playing around with prototypes now.""  Still, one of the features of those early prototypes lets device-owners register on the blockchain, and with smart contracts, create different tiers of access, giving different users functionality in personalized ways.  Not only could user-specific registration help prevent corporate-owed devices from being misused, but it could help prevent the users themselves from being injured.  In the future, a device's registration will need to last its entire “lifespan”, according to Hahn, across different owners and including the state of its firmware, permanent software that might be used to help regulators identify the exact point a device breaks or begins to malfunction.  Using blockchain tech, artificially intelligent software solutions could then be implemented remotely.  ""You better be ready to actively update your devices throughout the lifecycle of your devices,"" Hahn said. ""As we know, vulnerabilities will be discovered long after the device is released.""  Joint ownership of a device, where multiple companies have a vested interest in its current state of production and operational status, could also be improved by an artificially intelligent blockchain, Hahn suggested.  ""The blockchain will let those parties collectively agree on the state of the device and make decisions on what to do based on language coded into a smart contract,"" he continued.  Earlier experiments  While IBM’s work integrating Watson with the blockchain is relatively new, the company has been experimenting with blockchain tech for some time.  As far back as 2014, IBM’s former vice president Paul Brody described to CoinDesk how blockchains could power the Internet of Things. In January 2015, IBM and Samsung jointly revealed a proof-of-concept called ADEPT that integrated BitTorrent, Ethereum and TeleHash at the CES in Las Vegas.  In February 2016, Hahn spoke at this year’s InterConnect conference on mobile and cloud technology about how the Watson Internet of Things platform could be implemented to help prevent risks for a wide range of different businesses.  As part of Hahn's work to improve security by integrating blockchain with Watson, he identified other potential areas of improvement including security analytics, data protection, auditing and logging.  Hahn told CoinDesk:  ""I don’t think blockchain and security are synonymous. They might be related, but they’re certainly not synonymous functions. One does not beget the other. There’s plenty ways to insecurely use the blockchain.""

42426763,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUph,1459870243,Bitcoin Wallet Startup Now Extending Credit to Users,"Bitcoin payments startup BitPagos is now giving its wallet users access to credit through its Ripio wallet offering.  At launch, the offering will be available to a select number of users in Argentina, who will be able to borrow between $500 and $1,000 in bitcoin directly from the service, with credit extended based on the user's annual salary. Users would then pay back the loan in three or six-month installments, plus interest.  Ripio and BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano said his team is seeking to make the digital currency more accessible for online consumers.  Serrano told CoinDesk:  ""Right now if you’re a bitcoin user, you’re a holder of a debit card, in terms of making a payment. You need to fund your wallet by buying bitcoins, and then when you’re spending, you’re spending your actual funds, it’s money that you have.""  Further, the company stressed the benefits to this system over more traditional financial products, noting it requires no credit card, bank account or account maintenance fees.  At launch, Ripio is working with select merchants to trial the payments service, including local e-commerce startup Avalancha, which began accepting bitcoin last year. Avalancha will give 10% discounts to customers who buy on credit with bitcoin.  Serrano said Ripio has been working on the concept for over a year, and that he sees it as yet another way the community can use the bitcoin network as a rails for payment.  ""We’ve been focused on building solutions that solve people’s problems,"" he said, adding: ""This is a way to make payments or allow our consumers to do payments in a more seamless way.""

The Bank of Ireland used a blockchain as a vehicle for creating visibility into client trading activities, working in partnership with professional services firm Deloitte. Framing the experiment through the lens of regulatory compliance, the Bank of Ireland said that the project showed the potential to cut compliance costs while increasing transparency  The bank pulled data from a number of its internal systems for the test, explaining in a press release:  “The trial combined synthesized data from multiple systems across Bank of Ireland’s Global Markets division and associated functions to form an immutable, distributed, searchable repository of information across the full trade cycle. Browser-based views were developed for clients, Relationship Managers, and Regulators, to provide enhanced views of trade position with the ability to conduct near real-time auditing.”  According to the Bank of Ireland, Deloitte was involved with the development and deployment of the test, which took place on an unnamed “fully open-source platform”.  “Bank of Ireland is constantly investigating how technology and innovation can improve the customer experience, while also ensuring that systems and procedures address changes in regulatory requirements being introduced across Europe,” the bank’s head of innovation, David Tighe, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/05/bank-of-ireland-conducts-blockchain-trial-for-trade-reporting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8103de2ab40baf8ed9a5e76729b6e163860d49ec-1500x1114.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwURh,1459861206,Open Source Giant Red Hat Launches First Blockchain Initiative,"Red Hat officially announced the OpenShift Blockchain Initiative today, a new development effort aimed at assisting financial firms as they embark on proofs-of-concept and other trials related to the emerging technology.  Under the OpenShift Blockchain Initiative, Red Hat customers can build hosted blockchain applications using tools provided by independent solutions vendors (ISVs) focused on the industry, while taking advantage of the company's managed support services.  In interview, Julio Tapia, director of the Red Hat OpenShift partnership ecosystem, sought to position the announcement as both the first way that the company is seeking to leverage its open-source experience in the blockchain market, and as a follow-on to the news that the company had joined the Hyperledger blockchain project in February.  Tapia told CoinDesk:  ""We want to position ourselves with not only customers and partners, but leverage solutions developed in the entire ecosystem, taking all the innovation going on in the industry, maturing it for an enterprise market and making sure all the solutions can be launched and supported.""  Through the new initiative, he said, clients will have access to the OpenShift Dedicated product alongside tools and training workshops, enablement materials and offerings from third-party solutions providers.  Tapia positioned the Red Hat offering as competitive in today's market, given that major financial services firms have voiced an interest in launching blockchain applications in the cloud.    ""A lot of folks in the market are looking to deploy on the big cloud providers, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. There are many companies offering cloud support,"" Tapia explained.      Tapia clarified that OpenShift Dedicated is available on Amazon and that Google and Microsoft Azure support is forthcoming. Should an enterprise business want to pursue the use of these cloud platforms, Tapia said, Red Hat will help manage it on behalf of clients.    Red Hat's formal entrance into the ecosystem comes at a time when a number of startups are seeking to provide similar enterprise-oriented services. For example, former Red Hat employee Jeff Garzik recently launched a startup called Bloq, which he dubbed the ""Red Hat for blockchain"" due to its use of a managed software services approach to the market.  The news further follows word that Red Hat, which is perhaps best known for its services centered on the open-source Linux operating system, is now earning more than $2bn in annual revenuehttps://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/biz-enterprise/894594-enterprise-revenues-power-red-hat-past-2bn-barrier, a feat it claimed in mid-March.  Increased attention  Tapia indicated that Red Hat is expanding OpenShift to feature blockchain capabilities due, in part, to the growing attention the technology has received.  ""[There are] lots of companies looking to deploy new solutions that will meet the needs of this space. There’s a lot of things we’re hearing about. We want to make sure we’re at the forefront of that effort,"" Tapia continued.  As for its predictions regarding the market, Tapia was perhaps short in his remarks, noting that he believes the industry is ""still evolving"".  “We’re starting to see interesting [use cases] under development, everything from title and registration to patent management,” he stated.  He went on to suggest that the company is preparing for more growth in this area, adding:  “This is how big markets start and we want to invest appropriately to be the default platform.”  No restrictions  The announcement follows the February news that Red Hat had added Ethereum development platform BlockApps, a product of Ethereum decentralized application studio ConsenSys, to its OpenShift product.  Tapia said that the inclusion of BlockApps in the announcement was due to the fact that ConsenSys, described as its seed investor and parent company, was one of the first teams to approach Red Hat about a potential collaboration. The firm is not the only company to be accepted into the program, Tapia said.  As for which other blockchain companies have so far signed on to the offering, however, Tapia did not provide additional details.  “It’s a little early, a lot of the partners are still creating product,” he said.  As for the level of scrutiny that will be applied to applications, Tapia declined to provide any specific criteria that participants will need to meet. As with Microsoft and its approach to expanding its Azure platform, Tapia said Red Hat is striving to be “open” and “all-inclusive”, noting that the firm would not seek to make it “difficult” to join.  ""We don’t have any specific hard requirements,"" he said, adding:  ""At this stage, it’s still too early.""
