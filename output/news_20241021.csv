34982543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649068,1729549823,"Stacks Activating Nakamoto Upgrade In 8 Days, Will STX Break $2?","Stacks Network, the Bitcoin layer-2, is one of the largest DeFi protocols on the world’s most secure platform. DeFiLlama says the platform manages over $109 million worth of assets. It continues to expand and improve as decentralized financial services find traction. Stacks Network Activating Nakamoto On October 29 Over five years after launching, the network is preparing for one of its most important upgrades: Nakamoto. Analysts and platform supporters claim this update would have far-reaching implications, especially for its ecosystem. Related Reading: Ripple At A Critical Juncture Like Amazon In 1997, Says Investment Pro The team said the latest update would go live on October 29. Most importantly, the transition will introduce features that boost throughput and security. On scalability, Stacks might be looking to march Ethereum layer-2s that currently process transactions cheaply and can host transaction-intensive dapps. Once the upgrade activates, Stacks will decouple from the Bitcoin block production speed of roughly 10 minutes. The decoupling will see the platform process transactions within seconds. The change means Stacks will handle more transactions, process them faster, and improve the user experience. However, the team said this decoupling won’t mean the end of the relationship between stackers and Bitcoin miners. In the team’s view, not only will the collaboration be enhanced, but Stacks as a layer-2 will be more decentralized and, therefore, robust. Since Stacks is a layer-2, relying on Bitcoin for security, all transactions would still have to be confirmed on the base layer. Accordingly, though its transaction mining will be decoupled from the layer-1, all transactions will be finalized on the Bitcoin mainnet. This confirmation will be irreversible, leading to better security without the risk of transaction reversals. STX Moving Inside A Mega Consolidation: Will Bulls Break $2? As bullish as the Nakamoto upgrade may be, STX, the native token, is flatlining. From the daily chart, the coin is stuck inside a mega consolidation from early July. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Push Past $164 Barrier, Momentum Signals More Gains STX prices are moving between $1.20 and $2. The token has steadily recovered after crashing in early August, adding nearly 60%. Nonetheless, for the uptrend to take shape and buyers to initiate steps of peeling back March to July losses, there must be a decisive breakout above $2. If this leg up is with rising volume, it could trigger a wave of higher highs, mirroring those from early Q4 2023 to mid-March. STX may soar to $4 in that event, nearly doubling from September highs.

34979966,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649045,1729544406,XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance,"The entire crypto market is enjoying a strong surge, yet XRP has been lagging, remaining stuck below the crucial $0.55 level since the start of October. Analysts and investors are closely watching for signs of strength and confirmation that XRP is poised for significant gains in this market cycle. Key data from Santiment offers a glimmer of optimism. It shows a notable spike in active wallets on the XRP Ledger, which could signal growing interest and accumulation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level – Time For DOGE To Catch Up? As the broader market continues to push higher, the coming days are pivotal for XRP. Investors hope for a breakout from the weeks of sideways consolidation that have kept its price action subdued. A decisive move above $0.55 could ignite bullish momentum and put XRP on track to catch up with the broader market rally. For now, the market eagerly awaits further developments, with many anticipating that XRP’s moment may finally be approaching. XRP Ledger Activity Signals A Shift XRP remains one of the most popular altcoins in the crypto market, yet many investors are increasingly concerned as the price has struggled to reclaim local highs around $0.65. Despite the lack of upward momentum, critical data from Santiment offers a glimmer of hope. The XRP Ledger recently experienced a significant spike in activity, with 35,799 unique wallets making at least one transfer daily, marking the highest activity level in over three months. In addition, 3,858 new wallets were created in a single day, the largest increase over seven months. This surge in network activity is a promising sign for XRP, as spikes in active wallets and new addresses often precede major price movements. The growing interest in XRP could be an early indicator of an impending shift in price action, especially as the broader market trends upwards. However, the price must still exceed the local highs of around $0.65 to confirm a bullish trend. While the network data points to potential growth, the coming weeks will be crucial for XRP’s price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales ‘Grew Substantially’ During Last Dip, Data Shows Large-Holder Accumulation If it can reclaim key resistance levels, XRP may finally align with the overall market’s bullish sentiment, providing a more optimistic outlook for its investors. Price Action: Technical Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $0.555 after three weeks of sideways movement. It remains below the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA), but it is now testing this key indicator as resistance. A successful breakout above the 200 EMA, followed by consolidation and holding it as support, would likely signal a surge to higher supply zones around $0.60 and potentially $0.65. This breakout would confirm renewed bullish momentum, encouraging investors to wait for a clear upward trend. However, if XRP fails to break above the 200 EMA and these critical resistance levels, a retrace to $0.52 or even lower could be imminent. Failing to breach this resistance would point to further consolidation or even a correction as the market seeks lower liquidity levels.

42373527,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnyOr,1729540789,Ripple Co-Founder Larsen Flooding Kamala Harris' Election Effort With XRP,"Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen said he amplified his support for Vice President Kamala Harris, adding $10 million worth of XRP to her election efforts.  Larsen, now the crypto sector's biggest individual Harris booster, said she'll bring a ""new approach to tech innovation.""  Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen said he'd added another $10 million in the Ripple-tied token {{XRP}} in an effort to boost Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrat faces off against former President Donald Trump in next month's election.  Larsen has become the crypto sector's leading supporter for Harris, saying Monday in a posting on X that he's pitching in with $10 million in XRP to the political action committee Future Forward.  ""It's time for the Democrats to have a new approach to tech innovation, including crypto,"" he wrote, adding that Harris ""will ensure that American technology dominates the world.""  Federal Election Commission records show Larsen had previously donated $1,750,000 to the PAC. He's also given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic congressional campaigns.  While significant, his millions are overshadowed by the overall crypto industry's campaign involvement, led by the super PAC Fairshake. That group's $169 million in donations – primarily from Coinbase Inc. (COIN), Ripple Labs and Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) – has not only dominated the crypto sector's election involvement but has put it among the biggest sources of campaign cash in the 2024 elections.  While Fairshake has made some clear efforts to divide its spending between the two major parties and to avoid taking a side in the presidential election, many of the industry's leaders have come out individually for their presidential favorites.  Read More: Crypto Insiders Courting Vice President Harris Chase Whispers of Her Openness  Countering Larsen, some pro-Trump crypto names have included Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell and also venture capital giant a16z's leaders, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. However, Horowitz declared early this month that he also intended ""a significant donation to entities who support the Harris Walz campaign,"" because of a longstanding friendship.  Most of the money given by crypto leaders such as Larsen are going into super PACs. Rather than giving directly to a candidate's own campaign, which is heavily limited for individuals, they can send as much as they like to the PACs, thanks to the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United opinion. Super PACs can make unlimited so-called ""independent expenditures"" on advertising that supports a candidate, as long as they don't coordinate with the campaign.  While Larsen was among 88 corporate leaders who signed a letter endorsing Harris last month, Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse have sometimes sought to derail Democrats in these elections. Ripple's giving leaned into the Republican side in one key situation: trying to defeat crypto critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) And Garlinghouse gave $50,000 to a super-PAC aimed at building a Republican majority in the Senate, according to FEC filings.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | XRP,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/21/ripple-co-founder-larsen-flooding-kamala-harris-election-effort-with-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd53125fd1be9f935c83b68078ef4dfef9b0dcf7-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34977480,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649065,1729539018,Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‘About To Get Interesting’,"The Ethereum price started the new week by extending last week’s gains, which kicked off after it bounced off support at $2,350. This run has seen the Ethereum price now pushing towards resistance at $2,800, which the bulls look forward to breaking before the week runs out. In light of the recent Ethereum price move, a crypto analyst has noted that the leading altcoin is gearing up for a massive move, and things are about to get interesting. Things Are About To Get Interesting With The Ethereum Price According to the analyst, known as @IamCryptoWolf on social media platform X, the current market conditions and technical setup suggest that Ethereum could be gearing up for a significant breakout, hinting that “things are about to get interesting. Related Reading: FLOKI Breaks Out Of Downtrend: Analyst Predicts 200% Rally To New All-Time High The prediction is based on an analysis of Ethereum’s price action against the US dollar (ETH/USD) on a 3-day candlestick timeframe, where the analyst has identified the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is considered a powerful reversal signal in technical analysis, indicating a transition from a downtrend to an uptrend. The pattern consists of three distinct lows: the left shoulder, the head, and the right shoulder. The head forms the deepest low, while the two shoulders are smaller lows. The neckline, connecting the peaks between the shoulders, acts as a critical resistance level. Once price action breaks above this neckline decisevely, it often sparks a surge in bullish momentum. In the case of Ethereum, the analyst identified this neckline at approximately $2,800. Ethereum has recently been trending upwards toward this level, suggesting that a breakout may be close. In terms of a breakout target, the analyst pointed to the $3,400 level as the first key price zone to watch. Breaking out of the $3,400 level would open up the path to Ethereum retesting its yearly high above $3,920 towards $4,000 and probably even creating a new one. The $3,400 and $3,920 price targets represent 25% and 45% increases, respectively, from the current price of Ethereum. Ethereum And The Broader Market Context The Ethereum price performance in 2024 has been closely tied to the overall market conditions, particularly Bitcoin’s movements. Many large market cap cryptocurrencies have started the week with gains, as many bullish traders look to continue on last week’s momentum. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sets 3 Major Targets For XRP Price, Going As High As 4,800% Return The Ethereum price broke above $2,700 for the first time in October during this weekend as many addresses crossed into the long-term holding cohort, further increasing the bullish sentiment. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,720 and is up by 2.83% in the past 24 hours. As things stand, the coming days could be pivotal for the rest of the year, with Ethereum potentially gearing up for a significant upward move above $2,800, making things ‘about to get interesting’ indeed.

Key participants included Euroclear (a major clearing and settlement firm in traditional finance), Swift (the messaging platform that connects banks around the world) and Franklin Templeton (the asset manager), while crypto projects Avalanche {{AVAX}}, ZKsync (ZK) and Hyperledger Besu also contribute.  The process can ""dramatically reduce the manual processes required, enabling significant potential operational efficiency and cost reduction,"" Wellington Management's digital asset and tokenization head said.  Data provider Chainlink {{LINK}}, with major financial market participants including Euroclear, Swift and Franklin Templeton, announced Monday that it started an initiative to make corporate actions data more accessible and standardized using artificial intelligence and blockchain tech. The project aims to address a long-standing challenge in the financial world: the lack of standardized and real-time data for corporate actions such as mergers, dividends and stock splits, which are notoriously fragmented in markets like Europe, Chainlink's report said.  Automating and standardizing this information could help significantly reduce operational inefficiencies that currently cost businesses millions of dollars every year due to errors and manual data processing, according to the report. The data is commonly used by investors.  ""Turning various pieces of disconnected corporate actions data into unified 'golden records' that can then be relied on by hundreds of market participants as a definitive, single source of truth is truly a huge step forward,"" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said. ""This will help financial markets synchronize faster, reduce errors and cut costs.""  The initiative's first phase focused on corporate actions data of equity and fixed-income securities across six European countries. Chainlink connected its decentralized oracles with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude to extract corporate actions data from various sources and transform it into a structured format called ""Golden Records"" that comply with global financial standards like the ISO 20022 and the Securities Market Practice Group (SMPG) guidelines. Then, it used Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to publish and distribute data across different blockchains.  Later stages, for example, will explore ways to integrate this framework with existing financial systems like Swift messaging standards for broader industry adoption, the report said.  Participants in the initiative include Euroclear, Swift, UBS, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, CACEIS, Vontobel and Sygnum Bank. Blockchain ecosystem partners Avalanche {{AVAX}}, ZKsync (ZK) and Hyperledger Besu networks also contributed.  ""By leveraging AI and Chainlink oracles to interpret, standardize, and deliver high-value unstructured data, we can dramatically reduce the manual processes required, enabling significant potential operational efficiency and cost reduction,"" said Mark Garabedian, Wellington Management's director of digital assets and tokenization strategy.",POSITIVE,AVAX | LINK,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | ZK,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/21/chainlink-partners-with-major-financial-players-to-improve-corporate-actions-data-reporting-using-ai-and-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1f6c29904a74a372570afea3afb24416279f386-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373543,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnzPx,1729536661,"Crypto ETFs Look Unlikely to Expand Beyond Bitcoin, Ether Under Kamala Harris, Experts Say","Crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH) are unlikely to be approved under a Kamala Harris presidency, two ETF experts say.  There are applications for ETFs tracking Ripple's XRP and Solana (SOL), and if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election, their approval odds could improve significantly, the analysts said.  Several firms recently began seeking approval to create U.S. exchange-traded funds that track cryptocurrencies beyond the already-approved bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} products. Those applications will probably go nowhere if Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris wins the election in November, according to two ETF experts.  The approval of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs earlier this year was seen as a huge win for the industry after issuers fought for years to introduce such funds. One issuer, Grayscale, even sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to overcome the regulator's rejection – and won. Billions of dollars have poured into the new ETFs.  Since then, issuers have been taking stabs at the next big crypto ETF launch, with applications currently in process for a fund tracking Ripple's XRP {{XRP}} token and the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, SOL {{SOL}}.  ""It won't happen if Harris wins, regardless of the issuer,"" said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  Some industry experts believed that when asset management giant BlackRock joined the race to list bitcoin and ether ETFs, that significantly improved the chances the SEC would approve them – though it's unclear how big a factor BlackRock actually played.  If former President Donald Trump wins the election, however, there'd be a ""decent chance"" for more crypto ETFs, regardless of whether BlackRock joins Bitwise, VanEck and others that want to expand crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and Ethereum's ether, according to Balchunas.  Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, echoes this outlook. ""It seems highly unlikely that a Harris administration would approve additional spot crypto ETFs, at least not anytime soon after the election,"" he said.  Seeing how current President Joe Biden's administration has approached crypto, which Geraci characterized as ""combative, overall,"" and taking into account Harris' powerful position in that administration, it is fair to assume that the status quo would continue under her leadership, according to Geraci.  Trump's odds of winning the election have surged to 62.4%, the highest in months, according to prices on the leading prediction market, Polymarket.  The former president has won support from the crypto community in recent months after taking a favorable stance toward the industry. He appeared at a prominent Bitcoin conference, endorsed a DeFi platform and visited a Bitcoin bar in New York ever since making crypto support a big part of his campaign.  Harris, on the other hand, has been much less vocal about the sector and has only recently unveiled plans to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and digital assets, which she aimed toward Black men, who her campaign noted are more likely to own crypto. However, details on how she'd support crypto are still scarce.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL | XRP,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | SOL | XRP,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/21/crypto-etfs-look-unlikely-to-expand-beyond-bitcoin-ether-under-kamala-harris-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fbe856743bc4268bdd7ca0acaa818d6359a0720-6356x3575.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373538,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnyzf,1729534238,"No, Polymarket Whales Aren't Evidence of Prediction Market Manipulation","It seems likely that a small group of traders (or possibly a lone individual) have pushed up former President Donald Trump’s odds on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market, by heavily betting on the Republican nominee.  There has been a good deal of handwringing about this, both from supporters of vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on X (formerly Twitter) who have an obvious incentive to call the markets manipulated, and from the mainstream press. “[T]he surge might be a mirage manufactured by a group of four Polymarket accounts that have collectively pumped about $30 million of crypto into bets that Trump will win,” The Wall Street Journal speculated.  Indeed, there may be a lone bettor who has gone very long on Trump. But that's not necessarily evidence of something sinister.  Aubrey Strobel is a communications partner at Bitcoin app developer Trust Machines and the host of The Aubservation podcast.  First, the obvious point: it’s not just Polymarket where Trump is rallying. Trump ""yes"" shares are trading at around 59.9 cents on Polymarket right now, indicating the market sees a 59.9% probability he will win. (Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.) Predictit – a U.S. platform with strict betting limits (which would in theory be immune to the Polymarket whale) – has Trump at 56%. Kalshi, a U.S.-based, regulated platform, has Trump at 58%. If you think this price action constitutes “manipulation,” you would have to wonder why Kalshi – a platform where manipulation would be reportable – is trading in line with Polymarket.  The online bookies also have Trump ahead: 59% at BetOnline, 55% at Betfair, and 60% at Bovada to name a few. And Trump is also trending up in the poll aggregates, so it’s not inconceivable that his true odds of winning are also increasing. Trump’s rally in the prediction markets coincides with Harris’ rough Fox News interview and new polls show Trump trudging upward.  Secondly, the fact that a single anonymous entity has made large bets is not by itself evidence of “manipulation,” as many Harris supporters are claiming. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine flatly says: “this does not look like market manipulation: Fredi9999 is not buying sloppily with the effect of pushing up the price, but rather buying carefully, in a manner that seems designed to get him a lot of Trump contracts for his money.” The simplest possible explanation is that a trader simply thinks Trump is underpriced and is willing to bet heavily on it.  The mere existence of a large buyer does not imply manipulation. The entire premise of markets is that prices compress available information by rewarding those who take risk to express their views. The identity of the traders or the distribution of trades is irrelevant; in theory, everyone has a motive to extract information from markets by betting when their belief about the fair value of an asset diverges from the market’s value. Markets don’t need to be democratic in order to be reliable. They just need the most informed participants to financially express a view. Individual traders having concentrated ownership of an asset doesn’t in any way delegitimize the price. No one questions the price of Apple stock because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a lot of it.  This is a long-winded way of saying the market is never “wrong.” It simply reflects all available information. If you correctly disagree with the market, you can be rewarded for that belief, by betting yourself. U.S. users have alternatives to Polymarket, which is barred from serving them under a regulatory settlement. If you believe the Polymarket whale a) has meaningfully pushed up the price of the Trump contract, and b) is wrong, you can simply bet against him or her or them by going long on Harris. Even though it’s not risk-free – Harris still needs to win for your bet to pay off – if you thought her “real” odds were 55%, you would be buying something worth 55 cents for 40 cents today. Even if you might not be willing to do that, other market participants will. So if the Polymarket whale is indeed misinformed, now that we know there’s a (potentially misinformed) whale, you would expect the odds to decline as traders incorporate this new information. Unless of course, the prediction markets are generally reliable and the whale hasn’t influenced them much.  But let’s assume the trader really was spending heavily to “paint the tape” and make a Trump victory appear more likely.  First, it’s not even clear this would benefit Trump. It might cause complacency among his voters, reducing their turnout on Election Day (or even galvanize Harris supporters to show up at the polls). Second, you could simply spend that $30 million on ads in battleground states and meaningfully influence the race. Polymarket remains as of yet a fairly obscure platform so any PR dividend from moving the odds slightly would be extremely hard to quantify.  Plus, as Polymarket itself noted in a detailed blog post Monday rebutting the manipulation claims, ""if any user has any reason to believe that trades are being made for anything other than financial reasons, it is easy to adjust the odds to account for this"" by excluding the whales' bets  Why pay attention to prediction markets? When it comes to elections, markets can deliver information faster than pundits, polls, or the press. This trend will continue through the November election, not just on the main presidential contract, but also the state-level contracts. Traders have a financial incentive to surface nonpublic information, so election watchers will be able to see victory probabilities updated in real time for all 50 states, rather than waiting for Fox or CNN to call them. By harnessing trader enthusiasm, markets can and do outperform designated experts.  Polymarket has been outpacing these trusted sources of electoral information for a while. Long before President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance, Polymarket traders were signaling nontrivial odds he would drop out while mainstream pundits dismissed the possibility.  Additionally, contracts like the election winner contract give us an arguably more useful informational output than mere poll aggregates. National polls showing Harris up 49% to Trump's 47% don’t tell you that much about her actual odds of victory: what matters is of course the electoral vote tally and specifically what happens in the battleground states. The highly liquid Polymarket election winner contract compresses all of that information and gives us a simple estimate of each candidate’s odds of winning.  It's also worth remembering that a 60% to 40% lead on a prediction market is not remotely comparable to a 60% to 40% polling lead. Prediction markets should be thought of as high-beta derivatives of the polls. If Trump were polling at 51% to Harris' 49% in the national polls, his actual odds of victory would be 90% or more. In prediction markets, 40% to 60%, 45% to 55%, or 60% to 40% odds are all coin-flip territory. So Trump’s rally on Polymarket does not reflect a massive revaluation in his odds of victory. Polymarket whale or not, it’s still an extremely close race.

This was a much-needed improvement in the token with regards to setting a new benchmark of token interoperability and increasing users’ appeal towards developers, while its excellent development process also smoothens asset transfer between networks. Native Yield Mechanism And Market Response A further aspect responsible for the recent increase in price of ApeCoin involves the implementation of a Native Yield mechanism co-developed with Decent.xyz.

The yields are credited to wallets at the end of each block with no hassle, thus leaving a highly rewarding proposition for the token holder.

42373545,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnzaT,1729530107,U.S. Election Betting: Kalshi's Polymarket Rival Quickly Gets Traction,"This week in prediction markets:  Presidential betting passes $30 million on Kalshi.  Trump name-drops Polymarket – or tried to, anyway.  Arb opportunity? There's a discrepancy between Polymarket's individual swing state markets and a contract about all of them.  This U.S. election cycle will be over in two weeks. For some, it will be a sigh of relief. But prediction market platforms are having the time of their lives.  Kalshi, which only launched election prediction market contracts in October after a favorable court ruling against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently passed $30 million in trading volume on its main election contract. It still trails Polymarket, which did about $40 million from early January to early February, its first month of presidential betting, and recently passed $2 billion. But as a regulated platform, Kalshi had to sit on the sidelines until it won in court.  The market gives Republican nominee Donald Trump a 14 percentage point lead over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. These odds must come solely from U.S. nationals (and permanent residents), because Kalshi's terms and conditions prohibit foreign nationals from trading on the platform.  By contrast, the industry leader Polymarket prohibits U.S traders from the platform but does not require a know-your-customer process to validate who is who. Polymarket's bets are denominated in cryptocurrency, whereas Kalshi's are settled in regular dollars.  Initially, some might have thought that Kalshi was coming to market with a handicap, because it's regulated. But this has allowed the platform to escape the allegations of market manipulation by shadowy, possibly foreign, dark money that have dogged Polymarket.  Instead, Kalshi created a rebuttal to such accusations for its much larger competitor.  In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), Tarek Mansour, Kalshi's co-founder, outlined how market manipulation falls flat on his platform, where, as on Polymarket, Trump leads with a commanding margin.  ""The median bet size on Harris is LARGER than the median bet size on Donald Trump,"" he wrote. ""Trump’s odds are not the result of a few people pushing the odds up. It’s the opposite.""  Looking through Dune, a crypto analytics portal (Kalshi wouldn't be on Dune as it's not a crypto platform), the bet size numbers aren't too far off on Polymarket.  Data shows that overall on the site the median betting size is between $10 and $50.  Now, for Polymarket's presidential election contract, median data isn't immediately available on Dune. The next best thing is the average bet size (remember the difference between average and median) which comes in at $210 for Trump and $113 for Harris.  Going back to the overall Polymarket platform, the number of users who have placed bets above $100,000 is only 27 – while there are over 220,000 users on the platform.  Some of those 27 users are placing $20 million-plus bets that are bound to put pressure on markets. But the fact that Polymarket's numbers are in line with Kalshi's on Trump suggests that these whales aren't having the effect that critics of prediction markets think they are.  'Polypoll' and swing states  Sometime between launching a crypto token that's off to a rocky start and working a shift at McDonald's (the employer of last resort for failed crypto bros) Trump name-dropped Polymarket at a rally, calling it ""Polypoll.""  This isn't the first time the Republican candidate has acknowledged Polymarket, as his team posted favorable odds on his Truth Social page during his first surge this summer.  While Polymarket's election contract has Trump well ahead of his Democratic rival at 62-37, some of the numbers aren't adding up.  Individual state-level contracts have Trump winning every swing state, even Nevada, with a healthy margin.  But a contract asking if he'll win every swing state is coming in at just 32% on the ”yes“ side.  The largest holder on the “no” side, who goes by the handle ""AntiMaga,"" has $5 million in positions, largely taking the “no” side on Trump or Republican-related contracts.  Meanwhile, the largest holder on the other side of the bet, Yeueu, is holding much less in terms of positions overall, but is up 88% on the swing state contract.  All of this is a reminder that markets aren't perfect, and inefficiencies exist – or arbitrage opportunities, depending on your perspective.",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/us-election-betting-kalshis-polymarket-rival-quickly-gets-traction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c9854cf3901755e07d6aa4282fc68fd1a7f10fc-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Marathon's Q3 2024 earnings preview shows growth in Bitcoin mining operations, but the company remains unprofitable on a gross income level. Key to profitability: reducing costs through vertical integration and exploring new revenue sources, including a potential pivot to AI data centers. Given the strides in cost management and AI opportunities, I am shifting to a speculative ""Buy"" rating for Marathon Digital. I’ve written previous articles on MARA Holdings ( MARA ) where I made the argument that direct Bitcoin ownership may be a better investment. This has panned well 2 out of the 3 times I have suggested it, making it a win in my book. However the fact of the matter is despite the drop in revenue due to the halving event, we have not seen a subsequent massive drop in MARA stock price. The company’s stock has held up way better than I expected causing me to have a second look. I believe the company has certain interesting pathways it can go from here. Articles (Seeking Alpha) Author's Calculations (Seeking Alpha) Q3 2024 Earnings Preview In the latest update on Marathon’s Bitcoin mining operations, the company has shown growth in its operations. Its energized hash rate, a number used to calculate a miner’s efficiency, has reached 36.9 EH/s. This was a 5% increase from the month of August and substantial growth from the 31.5 EH/s reported last Q2 2024. The company mined 705 Bitcoins in September, 673 Bitcoins in August, and 692 Bitcoin in July. This makes the rough total for Q3 2024 about 2070 Bitcoins mined. This was slightly higher than the 2058 Bitcoins mined in Q2 2024 . The summary of these monthly results reflects what mining activity would look like post the April 2024 halving event. In other words, this gives us investors the idea that Marathon should be minting roughly about 2000 Bitcoins growing at a steady rate as it continuous to expand its production capabilities. According to management, the company is on track to hit its target of 50 EH/s by the end of 2024. However, what is most concerning to me as an investor, is the fact that Marathon is not profitable on a Gross Income level for its Bitcoin operations. This was something I discussed in a lot of detail in my previous articles on the company. As a growth investor, I’ve become rather forgiving of technology companies reporting and sustaining negative Net Income for long periods of time. This is of course with the understanding that the company will eventually hit a certain scale, allowing profitability. This scaling could be challenging though for Marathon Digital which loses money for every Bitcoin mined. For this article, though, I would like to play “Devil’s Advocate” and highlight the path to profitability for the company. These are the things in particular I would take note of in the company’s upcoming Q3 2024 earnings. Marathon Financials (Investor Relations) Marathon’s Path to Profitability There are really only two ways for Marathon to reach profitability on a Gross Profit level, and that is either increase Revenue or/and decrease its costs. On the Revenue side, simply continuing to increase the company’s hash rate i.e. mining more Bitcoins would not lead it to profitability. This is because on the Gross Profit level, increasing Marathon’s hash rate without decreasing the cost per coin mined simply means that Marathon continues to lose every Bitcoin mined. Marathon Financials (Investor Relations) Marathon Financials (Investor Relations) In Q2 2024, the company reported a total cost of revenues of $181.7 million. Given that the company mined 2058 Bitcoins in Q2 2024, this implies a total cost per coin of $88,287 ($181.7 million divided by 2058 Bitcoin mined) in Q2 2024. This is a metric I would calculate when looking at Marathon’s upcoming Q3 2024 earnings. This high number is quite concerning as Bitcoin has not breached the $80,000 mark thus far this year. In Q2 2024, the company reported total revenues of $145.1 million. However, of the total amount of $78.6 million was mark-to-market revenue from the increase in the average price of bitcoin. Removing this amount and the small amount of revenue generated from providing hosting services gives us about $57.8 million in Revenue from direct mining. Dividing this amount by 2058 Bitcoins mined gives us a price of $28,104. Considering the massive Bitcoin rally since then, I would not be surprised to see Marathon report improved Revenues for the quarter. Note though that the current price of Bitcoin is roughly $68,000 which is still below the implied cost to mine, thus not ensuring the company’s profitability. Cost-Cutting Measures and Other Revenue Sources Marathon’s management seems to be aware of the issue and has begun vertically integrating its operations. Initially, the company pursued an asset-light strategy by relying on third parties in order to expand rapidly. Once acquired, these owned sites can be operated more efficiently using the company’s vertical stack. For instance, Marathon is in the process of converting its Granbury data center from air-cooled to MARA's immersion containers. Being majority vertically should reduce the company’s cost of Bitcoin mined. This is something we should look out for in the coming quarters. Investor Presentation (Marathon Digital) In terms of revenue, Marathon has been exploring alternative sources of Revenue to boost its profitability. Many of the proposals though are merely ancillary, and I don’t expect these to move the needle much. These proposals range from using the heat generated by Bitcoin mining to using the excess methane from landfills to power operations. Some of these projects are already ongoing. For example, the company is already re-selling recycled heat to 11,000 residents in a small town in Finland. These projects, though while good PR due to its environmental benefit, are simply too small to significantly impact Marathon’s top-line revenues. For example, the data center in Finland that sells recycled heat is only 2MW, while the landfill methane gas Bitcoin data center is only 280kW. This is but a tiny size of the company’s 760MW of mining capacity. The company has also started mining the cryptocurrency Kaspa which has a higher profit margin than Bitcoin. As well as leveraging its balance sheet to borrow $300 million in order to buy more Bitcoin. Investor Presentation (Marathon Digital) However, by far the most interesting avenue that Marathon could pursue is a pivot to AI. The demand for data centers is set to grow rapidly in the near future, driven primarily by AI computing. Estimates from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission indicate that data centers will need up to 35 GW of power as early as 2030, a significant portion of all power generated in the US. According to a Reuters article , due to a lack of supply of reliable electricity, technology companies have begun pursuing energy assets held by bitcoin miners. It wouldn’t be a surprise to me to see more collaboration or deals between Bitcoin miners and technology companies for data centers. Furthermore, Marathon has made specific moves towards this pivot. For instance, the company has recently appointed AI experts Janet George and Barbara Humpton to its board. The company’s technology and know-how in the field of power efficiency could provide a competitive advantage. Specifically, the company’s MARA 2PIC700 Two-Phase Immersion Cooling System can be used for AI data centers as well. Simply put, the technology allows up to 2-4x more power within the same space by rapidly cooling the hardware used in data centers. A lot of power is used to cool data systems, and “running too hot” creates inefficiencies. According to the company’s press release about this system; Compared to current alternatives, MARA 2PIC700 enables two to four times the power density and can reduce the space requirements for a data center by up to 75%. It can operate in temperatures ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius and is built for remote management. As a result, the system can enable data centers to be built and operated in remote or harsh climates that were previously inaccessible. For Bitcoin mining specifically, MARA 2PIC700 enables ASIC miners to be overclocked by 60-100% and can enable up to a 60% reduction in cooling costs, even under the most extreme conditions. Investor Presentation (Marathon Digital) It will be interesting to see in the coming quarters whether or not Marathon could make any inroads in the AI/High-performance computing industry. I would keep an eye out for any deals made by the company and other Bitcoin miners in this space. I believe, if successful, this could prove to be a real game-changer for the company. Conclusion In previous articles, I believed that investors were better off owning Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF over Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital. This was a theme that played out pretty well I think as mentioned above. However, I am changing my tune a bit as management seems to be making strides towards decreasing costs and increasing revenues. In particular, I am excited about the company’s foray into AI data centers using its cooling technology. Finally, the halving event that I first wrote about in October 2023 last year has already come and gone, so the decreased mining output is already “baked in” the current price of Marathon’s stock. In terms of valuation, based on the last 10-Q the company has roughly $375.3 million in long-term liabilities and about $256 million in Cash. The company also recently raised $300 million in Convertible Senior Notes, which it used to purchase $249 million worth of Bitcoin. Based on the latest September update, has about 26,842 BTC. At Bitcoin’s current price of $68,396, the company’s Bitcoin assets plus its cash minus its debt is $1.416 billion. At Marathon’s current stock price, its market cap is about $5.560 billion. In other words, you are paying about 3.9x asset value per share. This is a reasonable valuation compared to the 3.4x median Price to Book value. Note: that I’ve used this valuation method as Marathon is not profitable on a Gross Income level and a good chunk of its Revenue comes from mark-to-market gains on the increased price of Bitcoin. Also, the vast majority of its hardware assets on its books (i.e. mining rigs) have a very short useful life. I’ve been debating on whether to rate Marathon as a “Hold” or as a “Buy”. Ultimately, it comes down to what you believe about the future of the company. I am switching gears to a very speculative “Buy rating” as I think the company has many paths to be successful moving forward. I am particularly interested in the application of its technology to the AI industry.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4728055-mara-holdings-beyond-bitcoin-into-new-avenues?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34973217.jpeg

34972275,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649041,1729528220,Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin miners have been making an unusually high number of transactions to centralized exchanges recently. Bitcoin Miner To Exchange Transactions Metric Has Just Seen A Spike As pointed out by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in a new post on X, the Miner to Exchange Transactions indicator has been high recently. The “Miner to Exchange Transactions” keeps track of the total number of transfers that the miner-associated Bitcoin wallets are making to addresses connected with exchanges. When the value of this metric is high, it means the miners are making a large amount of moves to these platforms. As one of the main reasons why these chain validators would deposit to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish effect on the BTC price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Away With 9% Surge: Why This Could Trouble Bitcoin On the other hand, the indicator being low implies miners aren’t making inflows to exchanges, potentially because they plan to hold onto their coins for a while. Naturally, this HODLing from this cohort can be a positive sign for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Transactions over the last few days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Transactions has registered a large spike during the past day, suggesting that the miners have just made a large number of moves to these platforms. It’s possible that this is an indication of a selloff from these chain validators, but whether this potential selling would actually affect the cryptocurrency depends on the exact scale of coins that’s involved in the transactions. The analyst has also shared the data of an indicator that provides information related to it, called the Miner to Exchange Flow: From the chart, it’s visible that this metric’s value has also shot up alongside the spike in the Miner to Exchange Transactions. At its height, the metric touched 225 BTC, which is equivalent to a little under $15.4 million at the current price. This isn’t a small sum in itself, but when considering the scale of the total Bitcoin market cap, these exchange inflows hardly weigh to much. Thus, even if the miners plan to sell these coins, the market should be able to absorb the pressure just fine. Miners are entities that have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills, so they tend to be regular sellers. Most of the time, their selling remains limited, which would make the recent value of the Miner to Exchange Flow in line with the norm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders In Profit Hits 95%: Is BTC Overheating? The number of individual transfers to exchanges that the miners have made, however, is certainly unusual, so these indicators could be to keep an eye on in the coming days, in case more spikes pop up.

Recently, bitcoin's price was lower 2.3% over the past 24 hours, underperforming the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's 1% loss during the same period. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} was also down nearly 1%, while litecoin {{LTC}}, polkadot {{DOT}} and the internet Computer Protocol's token {{ICP}} led losses with 4%-5% declines.  A notable outperformer was Solana {{SOL}} with 2.4% gain to $163, though still down from its $170 weekend high.  Bitcoin mining stocks also suffered, but one outlier was TeraWulf (WULF), which recently pivoted to high-performance computing to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It's higher by 12% on Monday.  Checking possible catalysts for today's action, one need look no further than the recent price movement: bitcoin had risen in near-continuous fashion since dipping to just under $60,000 eleven days ago – a modest reversal was surely in the cards at some point. There's also been a sharp rise in interest rates across Western economies on Monday, among them 10 basis point gains in both the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield and the German 10-year Bund yield. Other things being equal, higher rates can often pressure prices of risk assets, bitcoin among them.  Zooming out a bit further, bitcoin – for the moment – remains in the same flat-to-down price channel its been in since recording a record high of $73,700 more than seven months ago. Prior to today, the most recent challenge of the $70,000 level was in late July. It too failed and bitcoin had sunk to under $52,000 days later.  ""Wouldn't be unreasonable to get another HL [higher low] potentially with a sweep of $66K, probably where the next opportunity is,"" well-followed analyst Skew said in an X post.

34969633,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649064,1729522817,"Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect","The XRP price is currently trading at $0.554, having increased by 3% in the past 24 hours. However, XRP largely remains in the red in a 30-day timeframe, having broken below the $0.6 threshold earlier in the month. At the time of writing, XRP is down by 5.3% in the past 30 days. According to CoinCodex, a machine learning algorithm, XRP should continue on a bullish trajectory this week. According to its latest forecast, XRP is on track for upward momentum this week and will maintain its strength throughout the week, with the price expected to surpass the $0.60 mark. CoinCodex Forecast: XRP Price Set For A Rally This Week CoinCodex’s machine learning algorithm paints a bullish picture for the XRP price journey this week. Its Fear & Greed Index, a popular tool that measures investor sentiment, currently reads 72 for XRP, indicating a state of “greed.” Furthermore, the sentiment has now flipped to neutral after spending earlier days in the bearish zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Sell Signal After 10% Jump, Is It Time To Get Out? According to CoinCodex’s algorithm, XRP’s technical indicators further back up the bullish case. Out of 29 key indicators used in the analysis, 20 are flashing bullish signals, while only nine are giving bearish signals. This overwhelming tilt towards positive momentum points to growing market confidence in XRP’s short-term prospects. Given these indicators, the algorithm predicts that XRP is primed to break above the $0.60 threshold again this week. More notably, CoinCodex anticipates that XRP could achieve double-digit gains by the end of the week. The algorithm sets a target for XRP to close the week at $0.635269, which represents a significant 16% increase from its current price levels. Such an outcome would mark a major milestone for XRP, as it would be the first time in quite some time that the cryptocurrency posts double-digit gains on a weekly timeframe. What To Expect For XRP This Week If the XRP price movement plays out as predicted, it could signal the beginning of an extended bullish trend for the cryptocurrency as momentum builds up and investors pile in. The combination of positive technical indicators and strong market sentiment makes this week a crucial period for XRP, as it suggests that the asset is positioned for further gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Sell Signal After 30% Rally – Time To Sell? According to CoinCodex’s analysis, XRP has support levels at $0.540343, $0.534077, and a stronger foundation at $0.530528. On the resistance side, key levels to watch include $0.550157, $0.553706, and $0.559972, which could present challenges on its upward path. The key XRP price target to watch will be the $0.60 level. If breached, the momentum could pave the way for XRP to test the projected $0.643268 mark by the end of the week.

42373537,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnyuP,1729522692,Crypto Employee's Use of Laptop Outside of Work Cited in Data Breach Affecting 93K Transak Users,"The attack is being categorized as ""mild or moderate"" since it didn't involve social-security numbers or credit-card details.  A ransomware group is making demands.  The employee reportedly responsible for the breach has been ""exited,"" Transak officials told CoinDesk.  A crypto-industry employee's use of a laptop for non-work purposes is reportedly at the heart of a data breach involving some 93,000 unique users – and now a ransomware group is attempting to negotiate with the company that was targeted.  Transak, an ""onramp"" used by a number of popular blockchain companies to allow customers to buy cryptocurrencies, disclosed in a blog post on Monday that it had fallen victim to a data breach. According to Transak, the leaked data was limited to ""names"" and ""basic identity information.""  In an interview with CoinDesk, Transak CEO Sami Start said that 93,000 people were impacted by the breach, which included passports, ID cards and selfies used by customers to verify their identities with crypto financial products.  The team is categorizing the incident as ""mild or moderate,"" Start said, since it did not involve more sensitive information that might bring greater risk. Additionally, according to the company, only 1.14% of the user base was affected.  ""There's no bank statements, there's no social security numbers, there's no credit card information, there's not even any emails or passwords that were accessed, which limits the severity of this incident significantly,"" he said.  Ransomware group claims responsibility  The CEO said Transak was reaching out to customers and had notified law enforcement as well as data regulators.  But the company is also in the position of being asked to negotiate for mitigation measures with a ransomware group that claimed responsibility for the attack, who has already ridiculed a purported $30,000 offer to delete the stolen data.  The ransomware group says the data came from a larger subset of Transak's customers and did include some financial data.  ""This breach has impacted all KYC [know your customer] DATA processed through Transak's infrastructure,"" the ransomware group claimed in a public Telegram group that it operates. ""We have extracted more than 300GB of data, which includes sensitive personal documents such as government-issued IDs, proof of address, financial statements, and user selfies.""  The ransomware group claims it has only released a subset of the stolen data it has on hand. If Transak fails to pay a ransom, the group threatened to ""leak the remaining data or sell it to the highest bidder.""  Popular onramp  Transak provides developers with tools to bridge users from fiat to crypto, such as by allowing them to purchase cryptocurrencies via credit card. According to its website, Transak has been integrated into major blockchain wallets like Metamask and Trust Wallet, among others. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US also use Transak's services.  Start told CoinDesk that Transak is not interested in negotiating with the ransomware group.  ""We don't know if they necessarily did this or if they're just claiming credit for it,"" said Start. ""They've released this evidence where they've shown some screenshots from our KYC vendor, but it's possible that someone else posted that somewhere else and they've just taken credit for it.""  According to Start, the data breach occurred because an employee ""used their laptop for things other than work.""  ""They've been exited from the company,"" said the Transak CEO. ""They did some non-work related activities on their laptop that caused them to run a script – a malicious script – that gave access to their system.""  The access enabled hackers to gain access to one of Transak's third-party user authentication, or KYC (know-your-customer), services. According to Start, this particular vendor had a ""vulnerability"" in its system, which enabled the attacker to download a subset of Transak's user data via the compromised device.  In his interview with CoinDesk, Start insisted that the data breach was limited exclusively to this KYC service.  ""Any rumors about accessing any other systems are not true,"" Start said. The attackers ""may have gotten some screenshots that were in the employee's download folder – maybe one or two screenshots of some other system – but they only accessed this one vendor, and they only accessed the users that I mentioned. I challenge anyone to show otherwise.""

For many, the investing thesis focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the biggest cryptos by market cap. Others value finding the next ‘meme coin’ ready for a bull run. But perhaps their most enduring strategy is to buy and hold, or ‘HODL.’ Related Reading: Ethereum Holders On The Rise: Accumulation Addresses Double Since January 2024—Report The investing thesis is straightforward—just buy and hold Bitcoin and wait for the crypto to appreciate. According to Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, Bitcoin has more holders than ever. The firm adds that Bitcoin’s illiquid supply has gradually increased in recent months, suggesting that more users are holding BTC than selling or trading it in the market. Metrics Suggest An Increasing Number Of BTC Holders Market data and holding signals suggest a growing number of investors, suggesting a bullish sentiment on the cryptocurrency. According to Crypto Banter, BTC’s stored supply has gradually increased over the past months.

Stored supply increasing for months = mega HODLing vibes pic.twitter.com/0Bl4WtP3Hy — Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) October 21, 2024 Glassnode data agrees, suggesting an increasing trend for stored supply and a declining trend for active supply. The firm’s stored supply metrics include long-term holder supply, BTC HODLed or missing coins, and the coin’s illiquid supply. On the other hand, exchange balances and short-term coin supply are considered active supply metrics. Exchanges Report Declining Reserves There has been a gradual but steady reduction in Bitcoin’s supply, confirming many analytics firms’ thesis. The decrease in highly liquid and liquid BTC supply started in 2024. According to Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin or lost BTCs has dipped compared to data at the start of the year. CryptoQuant adds that centralized exchange BTC reserves are falling. At 2.64 million BTC, exchanges keep the coin around its all-time low, after a November 2023 decline. Exchange reserves typically indicate selling pressure, lowering prices. According to CryptoQuant and Glassnode, investors now prefer to buy and hold rather than trade.

As it approaches the $70,000 mark, we will see the first real resistance test for BTC, a level last seen during the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July. A strong correlation between Bitcoin’s price action and Donald Trump’s election odds has been observed, with the cryptocurrency market showing increased sensitivity to political developments as investors gauge the potential impact of a Republican win on future crypto regulations. Open interest (OI) in Bitcoin perpetual and futures contracts surged to an all-time high of over $40 billion, reflecting heightened speculative activity. While this increase in OI can indicate strong market participation, there has been some concern about the disparity between rising OI and Bitcoin’s lower highs, suggesting that much of the current price movement is driven by leveraged futures positions rather than spot market demand. What is different this time, however, is that funding rates remain neutral , indicating that perpetual market longs are not excessively out of balance. While a pullback to reset OI may be possible, the broader outlook remains bullish , supported by macroeconomic factors such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, increased liquidity, and the potential for improved regulatory conditions for crypto in the US. As a result, Bitcoin could continue its upward trajectory, and if it convincingly passes the $70,000 resistance level and breaks out of its eight-month consolidation range, it could be on track to mirror the strong performance seen in October 2023, when BTC did not look back after passing $30,000. Supporting this viewpoint is the latest US consumer spending data , which was buoyed by lower gas prices, wage growth, and steady incomes, resulting in a 0.4 percent increase in retail sales in September. Despite inflation and a cooling job market, consumer spending remains robust , supported by low layoffs. This has led to an upward revision in Q3 GDP growth to 3.4 percent. We expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points next month to support continued growth. Meanwhile, the housing market cooled in September, with housing starts and building permits declining slightly after a strong August. Rising mortgage rates have dampened market activity, though builders remain cautiously optimistic. While the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts have eased mortgage costs, the recovery in the housing sector is expected to be gradual, with challenges like affordability and housing shortages likely to persist . A moderate rebound is anticipated as interest rates stabilise, but further rate reductions will be key to boosting market momentum. The cryptocurrency industry is experiencing both growth and challenges, with key developments shaping its landscape. Plasma Network has successfully raised $3.5 million , with Bitfinex leading the round, to enhance access to stablecoins like USDt on the Bitcoin network. By integrating compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts, the network aims to broaden Bitcoin’s utility, particularly for decentralised applications (dApps). This expansion marks a significant step in enhancing Bitcoin’s role in decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystems. In regulatory developments, the SEC has approved NYSE and Cboe to list and trade options on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This move ensures that these financial products meet regulatory standards to prevent fraud and protect investors, further legitimising and expanding the range of Bitcoin-related offerings in traditional financial markets. Meanwhile, the crypto industry has faced a setback with Radiant Capital’s loss of over $50 million in a cyberattack. An attacker gained control of three private keys, allowing them to exploit blockchain contracts and drain user funds. In response, Radiant has paused its operations on both Base and Mainnet.

Despite relatively high ""Greed"" levels, historical analogies suggest Bitcoin can rally significantly, similar to the 429% rally from September 2020. Technical indicators show Bitcoin has plenty of upside potential, with weekly and daily RSI levels indicating room for further growth. Short-term resistance may occur around $72k-$74k, but beyond that, Bitcoin has a clear path for a strong bullish advance. As I have been anticipating in recent articles , the next big bull run in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now in progress. New all-time weekly and monthly closing highs are a stone's throw away, and once those levels have been cracked, the new bull will be in the open field. My targets for this move are $180k-$300k. Some cite relatively high levels of ""Greed"" as measured by the Crypto Fear/Greed Index as a reason why BTC can't rally on from here. alternative.me While that can be the case under certain conditions, if we look back at the most analogous setup in the prior history of the Bitcoin market, we can see that the current situation of the peak of March 2021 and the breakout happening now is analogous to the period between the peak of December 2017 and the big breakout of September 2020. TheBullBear.com, TradingView If we overlay the Fear/Greed Index on the monthly chart, we find that the ""Greed"" level of today matches that which existed just as the 2020 rally was getting underway. It's worth noting that monthly RSI was also at the same level as today, back in 2020. TheBullBear.com The structures and durations of both setups are remarkably similar, so it is not an out of distribution possibility that the results could be similar. Greed could reach maximum levels and stay there for quite some time as Bitcoin rallies hard. In the prior instance, that resulted in a 429% rally from the breakout point. This situation is very similar in many respects to sentiment indicators such as the Bull/Bear ratio starting a bull run from a relatively high level, or technical indicators being already ""overbought"". Bears will often point out that a bull ""can't"" begin under such conditions...but this often turns out to be incorrect. Bullishness and ""overbought"" levels can persist for quite some time as a bull move continues unabated. In this particular case, however, the technical condition of the Bitcoin market has plenty of upside wiggle room. The weekly chart, for example: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Here we can see that price is breaking out above the upper rail of the red flag consolidation pattern. Weekly RSI has lots of upside before getting into its resistance zone. The lengthy consolidation in the area of the prior all-time highs is extremely bullish. Here's the daily: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Breaking out above the pattern. Daily RSI will reach resistance fast, but it can stay up there for a while, or even correct a bit, as the market continues to advance. Short term: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Breaking out. Could get a little sticky in the 72-74k area as the last of the bears sell out. But after that, there's no more resistance, and the bull has a clear field to charge ahead. No technical setup is completely unambiguous or a ""slam dunk"", but this one is among the stronger bull cases I have seen in almost 20 years of analyzing markets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4728005-big-bitcoin-bull-breakout-in-progress?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34965447.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,119.85 +1.91%  Bitcoin (BTC): $68,334.71 -0.07%  Ether (ETH): $2,708.13 +2.27%  S&P 500: 5,864.67 +0.4%  Gold: $2,735.45 +0.51%  Nikkei 225: 38,954.60 -0.07%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $69,000 at the start of the Asian morning before retreating slightly to trade around $68,350. BTC's jump led to higher prices throughout the rest of the crypto market, with SOL rising nearly 5% to $166.50. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20, is 1.9% higher in the last 24 hours. Traders' attention is increasingly turning to the U.S. election, now barely two weeks away, with the pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump heavily favored on predictions site Polymarket. Risk assets such as bitcoin are - expected to be aided by macroeconomic factors in Japan and China, according to Singapore-based QCP Capital.  ApeCoin (APE), the Bored Ape Yacht Club-affiliated ERC-20 cryptocurrency used for governance and transactions in the ApeCoin ecosystem, has doubled in value over the weekend, topping $1.5 for the first time since April, according to CoinDesk data. The rally comes as the ApeCoin team debuted the highly anticipated blockchain network ApeChain Sunday. The ApeChain bridges also went live on Sunday, allowing users to transfer their tokens to ApeChain and automatically earn a staking yield on APE, ETH and stablecoins. The decision to bring native staking yield to APE likely galvanized investor interest in the token, according to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research.  London-based pensions giant Legal & General is plotting a route into tokenization, which has become popular among traditional finance firms. The tokenization narrative accelerated after the arrival of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, on the scene with its BUIDL fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Others are available from Franklin Templeton, State Street and Abrdn. “We are evaluating ways to make the Legal & General Investment Management Liquidity funds available in tokenized format,” said Ed Wicks, global head of trading at Legal & General Investment Management. “Digitization of the funds industry is key to improving efficiency, reducing cost and making a broad range of investment solutions available to a wider range of investors. We look forward to continued progress in this space.""  Chart of the Day  Gold has set a new lifetime high of $2,736 per ounce, extending the four-day winning streak.  ""This move into gold (away from treasuries and bonds) may foreshadow a shift toward BTC, with investors looking for risk-on assets in a lower-yield environment,"" Mena Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash, said in an email.

34964450,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649051,1729512010,7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week,"In an analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Patric H. from CryptelligenceX outlines seven reasons why investors should be bullish about the Bitcoin price trajectory this week. “How can anyone be bearish here?! BTC broke the weekly downtrend, closing above key levels, and some people still call for sub-$40k?! Sorry, bears, you clearly missed the fundamental changes of the past two weeks,” he states. #1 Mt. Gox Bitcoin Repayment Deadline Extension The defunct exchange Mt. Gox has filed for a change in its repayment deadline, which has been approved by the court. The new deadline to refund the remaining creditors is now set for October 31, 2025, a full year later than the previously scheduled October 2024. This extension removes the immediate market selling pressure of approximately 44,905 BTC (around $2.9 billion), which was anticipated to flood the market. #2 China’s Economic Stimulus China is set to issue $325 billion in bonds to stimulate its economy. Concurrently, crypto exchange OKX has launched a fully licensed trading platform in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), offering a legal avenue for Chinese investors to engage in cryptocurrency trading under UAE jurisdiction. Patric H. predicts, “Chinese money is gonna enter crypto in Q4.” Related Reading: Substantially’ During Last Dip, Data Shows Large-Holder Accumulation #3 Declining Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Bitcoin exchange reserves continue to dwindle as institutional investors and whales accumulate the cryptocurrency at unprecedented rates. This trend indicates a supply shortage on exchanges, which, coupled with increasing demand, could lead to a supply shock. “Eventually, this will cause a supply shock, leading to higher prices in due time,” notes the analyst. #4 Surge In Bitcoin Whale Accumulation On-chain data reveals that new Bitcoin whales are accumulating assets like never before. Ki Young Ju, CEO and founder of CryptoQuant recently, commented, “The current market volatility is just a game in the futures market. Real whales move the market through spot trading and OTC markets. That’s why on-chain data is crucial.” Related Reading: Analyst Points To Key Bitcoin Metric Indicating A Strong Uptrend—$90K in Sight? He added that these new whales are unlikely to sell until substantial liquidity from retail investors enters the market. “Look at how fiercely the new whales are stacking Bitcoin; this market has never seen such accumulation,” he emphasized. Notably, the lack of correlation with the US spot ETF inflows suggests that these could be strategic institutional accumulations. #5 Trump Is Leading The Polls Political forecasts indicate that former US President Donald Trump is gaining favor in swing states ahead of the upcoming elections. According to Polymarket’s latest data, Trump is projected to win all seven key swing states. Patric H. reminds readers, “Trump is pro-crypto; Elon Musk will lead a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).” #6 S&P 500 As Trailblazer The S&P 500 index is trading at an all-time high, historically signaling positive momentum for Bitcoin and crypto. “There has not been a time in history when Bitcoin and the altcoins market did not catch up to the performance of the S&P 500,” Patric H. points out, dismissing skepticism with, “But ‘this time is different’… yeah, sure.” The correlation between traditional markets and cryptocurrencies suggests that bullish trends in equities could spill over into the Bitcoin and crypto sector. #7 Seasonality Historically, the fourth quarter (Q4) has been the most bullish period for Bitcoin, especially in halving years. “Bitcoin and the crypto market tend to outperform all asset classes in a halving year,” argues the analyst. Supporting these fundamental reasons, technical analysis also paints a positive picture for Bitcoin. Patric H. highlights that Bitcoin has closed above its weekly downtrend line, signaling a potential reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. Moreover, the cryptocurrency is holding firmly above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical support level. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has made a bullish cross for the first time since April, often interpreted as a buy signal. “Yes, there will be pullbacks every now and then. But from now on, dips are for buying as the market structure clearly shifted from a downtrend to an uptrend,” Patric concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $68,397.

42373526,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnyEL,1729509575,Sui Launches ‘Incubator’ Hub in Dubai for ‘On the Spot’ Solution Engineering,"Layer 1 blockchain Sui has launched a hub in Dubai, a first in a global series of hubs, to support blockchain developers and entrepreneurs.  ""The vision is to be the heart of hackathons and implementation even in Dubai,"" said Kostas Chalkias, co-founder and chief cryptographer at Mysten Labs, which developed the Sui network.  Dubai - The Sui blockchain has launched a hub in Dubai which will act as an incubator for blockchain developers and entrepreneurs, one of its founding developers told CoinDesk in an interview.  Kostas Chalkias, co-founder and chief cryptographer at Mysten Labs, which developed the Sui network, is originally from Greece and has moved to Dubai from California. He said his vision is to bring an army of solution engineers to Dubai.  ""Like Leonidas, the Greek war hero, we are bringing an army of developers and if it is super successful in the very first month we will probably make it like Leonidas' 300,"" said Chalkias. """"Initially, we are bringing a small army but with big brains.""  Chalkias painted a scenario where a government entity would want a blockchain based solution to a problem and instead of spending days to create the solution, this hub would have the capacity to build the solution as a smart contract more or less on the spot.  ""When you're preaching an idea we will be able to sit down for two hours and build the proof of concept there. No other blockchain can do a POC on the spot. This hasn't happened before,"" Chalkias said.  The hub is in collaboration with Ghaf Group, a blockchain firm in the region.  The Dubai hub will be first in a global series of hubs, the entity announced. Dubai has been attracting the Web3 community with reasonably clear regulations and licensing processes which has seen crypto exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com and OKX win approvals this year.  ""UAE is top for deals UAE but not the actual development,"" said Chalkias. ""The vision is to be the heart of hackathons and implementation even in Dubai."" Initially, the hub would be hoping to help the government with digitalization, he added.  The Sui network which was built by former Meta (META) employees, including Chalkias, overtook the likes of Cardano, Near and Aptos in terms of total value locked (TVL) in February this year. For some, Sui has emerged as the chosen blockchain over Solana.  ""We are building solution engineering here in Dubai,"" said Chalkias. ""We want to invest in the region. We want to bring engineering capacity. I am bringing solution engineers. I want to run hackathons every month in Dubai where we don't sleep for three days.

42373551,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnzkz,1729508747,Bitcoin Hashrate Hits All-Time High as Publicly-Listed Miners' Share of the Network Peaks,"The bitcoin hashrate has surpassed 700 EH/s for the first time, marking a 6% increase over the past seven days.  Bitcoin's hashprice briefly went above $50 PH/s, a two-month high, as mining profitability increased driven by a spike in transaction fees and a surge in bitcoin's price.  The seven day moving average of bitcoin's {{BTC}} hashrate has hit an all-time high of 703 exahashes per second (EH/s), the first time the network's hashrate has cracked 700 EH/s, according to Glassnode data.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as bitcoin. Bitcoin's hashrate has grown almost 13% since the halving event in April, when the total number of bitcoin produced per day was cut in half to 450 BTC.  Public bitcoin miners increase their hashrate share  Data from bitcoin mining analyst Sebastian Ski shows that 12 of the top publicly traded miners contributed 28.9% to the total hashrate in September, translating to over 200 EH/s. Their contribution to the hashrate continues to increase month-over-month and has jumped by almost 10% since October 2022.  Ski alludes to ""The public miners are taking market share away from other miners in the world.""  Ski also mentions that the biggest gainers in hashrate growth in the past 12 months are: CleanSpark (CLSK), MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and IREN. This also coincides with the top bitcoin miners seeing month-over-month production growth for September.  Bitcoin mining is one of the hardest industries to stay profitable, due to it's capital intensive nature, on top of block rewards getting cut in half every four years. As a result, the weaker miners will have to unplug from the network, as staying online is not financially viable. Therefore, miners with the lowest cost of energy or the strongest balance sheet will continue to increase network share.  Hashprice jumps to two-month high  Bitcoin's hashprice, which measures mining profitability, recently jumped to $50 per petahash per second (PH/s) for the first time since August, according to Glassnode data. The slight surge in hashprice was due to bitcoin's price climbing to $68,000 and an increase in transaction fees due to the on-chain minting of the runes protocol that made up over 50% of all transaction fees on Oct. 17.  As a result of the hashrate hitting all-time highs, the next difficulty adjustment is scheduled to increase by over 4% on Oct. 23. Bitcoin's difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks based on the hashrate, ensuring that blocks are consistently mined on an average every 10 minutes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/bitcoin-hashrate-hits-all-time-high-as-publicly-listed-miners-share-of-the-network-peaks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8925df326f60f0f7ea21a3a0d977df554408d76d-2116x1190.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34960960,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24351,1729504173,Ethereum: Giảm Ngưỡng Staking và Tương Lai Phi Tập Trung Hơn?,"Cộng đồng Ethereum đang xôn xao bàn tán về việc giảm ngưỡng staking từ 32 ETH xuống chỉ còn 1 ETH. Động thái này hứa hẹn mở ra cánh cửa cho nhiều người tham gia vào mạng lưới, trở thành validator và nhận thưởng staking. Liệu đây có phải là bước ngoặt lớn, mở ra kỷ nguyên mới cho mạng lưới blockchain lớn thứ hai thế giới? Staking: “Cổ Phần” Quyền Lực và Trách Nhiệm Trong thế giới tiền mã hóa, “staking” có thể được hiểu như việc bạn “gửi tiền” vào mạng lưới để tham gia vào quá trình xác thực giao dịch và bảo mật blockchain. Đổi lại, bạn sẽ nhận được phần thưởng. Tuy nhiên, với Ethereum, yêu cầu 32 ETH (tương đương khoảng 84,000 USD) đã tạo ra rào cản lớn cho nhiều người muốn tham gia. Giảm Ngưỡng – Mở Cửa Cho Mọi Người Đồng sáng lập Ethereum – Vitalik Buterin đã đề xuất giảm ngưỡng staking xuống chỉ còn 1 ETH. Động thái này được kỳ vọng sẽ “dân chủ hóa” quá trình staking, cho phép bất kỳ ai cũng có thể trở thành validator, góp phần vào sự an toàn và phi tập trung của mạng lưới. Những Lợi Ích Nổi Bật Mạng lưới vững mạnh hơn: Càng nhiều validator tham gia, Ethereum càng trở nên mạnh mẽ và an toàn hơn trước các cuộc tấn công. Phi tập trung hóa: Việc giảm ngưỡng staking sẽ khuyến khích sự tham gia của nhiều cá nhân hơn, tránh tình trạng quyền lực tập trung vào một số ít tổ chức lớn. Cải thiện trải nghiệm người dùng: “ Single-slot finality “, một đề xuất đi kèm với việc giảm ngưỡng staking, sẽ giúp tăng tốc độ xác nhận giao dịch, mang lại trải nghiệm mượt mà hơn cho người dùng. Thách Thức Cần Vượt Qua Mặc dù mang lại nhiều lợi ích, việc giảm ngưỡng staking cũng đặt ra một số thách thức: Quản lý quy mô: Xử lý lượng lớn chữ ký validator sẽ đòi hỏi những giải pháp kỹ thuật phức tạp. Cân bằng giữa tốc độ và bảo mật: Việc tăng tốc độ xác nhận giao dịch không được làm ảnh hưởng đến tính bảo mật của mạng lưới. Tương Lai Nào Cho Các Nền Tảng Staking Linh Hoạt? Lido và Rocket Pool là hai cái tên nổi bật trong lĩnh vực staking linh hoạt, cho phép người dùng góp ETH với số lượng nhỏ hơn 32 để tham gia staking. Tuy nhiên, khi ngưỡng staking giảm xuống 1 ETH, liệu các nền tảng này sẽ phải thay đổi chiến lược để thích nghi? Hành Trình Tiếp Theo Của Ethereum là? Việc giảm ngưỡng staking chỉ là một phần trong kế hoạch phát triển dài hạn của Ethereum. Mạng lưới này còn đang hướng tới những mục tiêu đầy tham vọng khác: Nâng cao khả năng mở rộng: Đáp ứng nhu cầu giao dịch ngày càng tăng. Khả năng chống lượng tử: Bảo vệ mạng lưới trước mối đe dọa từ công nghệ lượng tử. Cơ chế phục hồi sau tấn công 51%: Tăng cường khả năng tự phục hồi của mạng lưới. Tóm lại là: Việc giảm ngưỡng staking là một bước tiến quan trọng, thúc đẩy sự phi tập trung và khả năng tiếp cận của Ethereum. Tuy nhiên, cộng đồng Ethereum sẽ cần phải giải quyết những thách thức về khả năng mở rộng và bảo mật để đảm bảo sự phát triển bền vững của mạng lưới. Bạn nghĩ sao về những thay đổi này? Liệu chúng có tạo nên một bước ngoặt cho Ethereum? Hãy chia sẻ ý kiến cùng cộng đồng Bitfinex Vietnam tại Telegram , Twitter & Facebook nhé!

34959253,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649021,1729501242,"Ripple At A Critical Juncture Like Amazon In 1997, Says Investment Pro","Ripple Labs is approaching a pivotal turning point with a potential initial public offering (IPO), a development that has been speculated about for some time. An IPO could be a transformative moment reminiscent of Amazon.com Inc.’s initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Jake Claver, a Qualified Family Office Professional (QFOP), articulates this perspective in a thread on X, suggesting that Ripple’s strategic maneuvers could mirror the trajectory that propelled Amazon into a global tech behemoth. According to Claver, the company has cemented its position within the blockchain ecosystem through its robust cross-border payment solutions, currently supporting over 300 financial institutions worldwide. The company’s utilization of XRP, enables transactions that are markedly faster and more cost-effective compared to those processed via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network. Claver emphasizes, “This positions Ripple as a faster, more transparent SWIFT 2.0.” Despite these accomplishments, Ripple has navigated substantial challenges, most notably its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, recent court rulings have favored Ripple, potentially clearing the path for larger opportunities, including a public offering. Claver notes, “The recent court rulings in Ripple’s favor could open doors to bigger opportunities, like going public.” Why Ripple Is Like Amazon In 1997 Drawing a parallel to Amazon’s evolution, Claver observed, “Just as Amazon was known as an online bookstore before its IPO, Ripple is recognized for its blockchain solutions. But there’s potential for much more.” He further elaborated, “When Amazon went public, it raised $54 million, enabling expansion into new markets.” Ripple also stands to unlock potentially massive growth opportunities through a public listing. Related Reading: Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 Ripple’s strategic acquisitions, including that of Metaco—now rebranded as Ripple Custody—demonstrate its intent to broaden its market presence. Claver remarks, “With acquisitions like Metaco, now Ripple Custody, they’re already showing an interest in expanding their reach. This could be just the beginning.” The potential implications of Ripple opting for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a direct listing are multifaceted. Claver outlines that an IPO would provide Ripple with fresh capital, enabling rapid scaling and entry into new markets such as tokenized securities, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized finance (DeFi). He states, “An IPO would provide Ripple with fresh capital, enabling them to scale quickly and enter new markets like tokenized securities, RWAs, or DeFi.” Moreover, the influx of capital from an IPO could facilitate further acquisitions, allowing the company to expand its offerings and strengthen its portfolio. Claver draws a direct comparison to Amazon’s acquisitions, noting, “Ripple could use IPO funds to acquire other companies and expand its offerings. Similar to Amazon’s acquisitions of Whole Foods and Twitch, Ripple could break into new markets and strengthen its portfolio.” Enhanced financial resources would also empower Ripple to accelerate its research and development efforts. Claver explains, “More resources would allow Ripple to accelerate R&D, improve the XRP Ledger, and explore new applications like smart contracts, tokenized real-world assets, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).” Related Reading: Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen Sends $1 Million XRP Donation To Kamala Harris Claver differentiates between the two primary routes to going public: an IPO and a direct listing. He elaborated, “An IPO involves issuing new shares to raise capital, typically underwritten by investment banks, but comes with costs like underwriting fees and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a direct listing does not involve issuing new shares; instead, existing shareholders sell their shares on the market. This method is generally less costly and quicker than an IPO.” Given Ripple’s robust financial standing, with over $1.3 billion in cash reserves, Claver suggests that a direct listing might be a viable option. “Ripple could opt for a direct listing because it already has a strong balance sheet,” he states. “A direct listing provides transparency and avoids lockup periods that restrict insider sales in a traditional IPO.” Beyond the financial mechanics, Claver underscores that going public serves as a legitimizing force for Ripple. He draws a parallel to Amazon’s IPO, stating, “Amazon’s IPO legitimized e-commerce. For Ripple, a public listing would legitimize its role in global finance, signaling to banks and regulators that it’s here to stay.” The recent favorable legal rulings in Ripple’s case against the SEC have significantly bolstered its position, making the prospect of a public listing more feasible. Claver concludes, “Ripple is at a critical juncture, much like Amazon before its 1997 IPO. If Ripple follows a similar path, we could witness the rise of a new tech giant. Whether through an IPO or direct listing, this move could unlock significant growth for Ripple and the blockchain industry.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5478.

42373540,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnzAB,1729498850,Bitcoin Nears $70K Amid Record Open Interest at $40B as Trump-Harris Election Nears,"Bitcoin's price rose by 1.5% in 24 hours, with significant increases in futures open interest, indicating continued money flow into the market.  The crypto market saw broad gains with Solana (SOL) and other major cryptocurrencies rising, fueled by speculative trading and thematic investments like AI-themed memecoins.  Crypto traders are betting on a favorable outcome in the U.S. elections for cryptocurrency, with expectations of regulatory reforms if Donald Trump wins.  Bitcoin (BTC) neared $70,000 earlier Monday as bullish sentiment from the forthcoming U.S. elections gains more momentum among crypto traders.  BTC rose 1.5% in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows, steadily rising through Sunday. The notional open interest on USD-denominated bitcoin futures across all tracked major exchanges crossed $40.63 billion over the weekend, setting a lifetime first.  In token terms, open interest was 592,000 BTC, the highest since December 2022 when the cryptocurrency traded below $20,000 amid a peak bearish sentiment.  Cash-margin open interest reached a new all-time high last week, with futures offered on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) accounting for 40% of the total as it crossed $11 billion on the bourse.  Open interest refers to unsettled futures bets and indicates new money entering the market. A rise in the metric, alongside a price increase, confirms an uptrend.  “The recent break of 68k was accompanied by about $2.4B in new BTC inflows over the past 6 sessions, along with a corresponding spike in BTC futures OI, which is a constructive indicator for new longs being established,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at the DeFi infrastructure firm SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Monday.  Meanwhile, a critical open interest-based ratio tracked by CryptoQuant shows a sudden spike from 0.20 to 0.21 as BTC’s price rose by $2,000, indicative of increased leveraged bets on the asset.  A bump in leverage indicates increased risk tolerance, which may contribute to market volatility - and higher liquidations - in the coming weeks.  Broader market rally  A jump in bitcoin led to higher prices throughout the crypto market.  Solana’s SOL rose over 7% as a speculative frenzy of memecoins returned to the network, this time with an artificial intelligence theme. Ether (ETH), Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain (BNB) and XRP rose as much as 4%, while major memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) added 3%.  ApeCoin’s APE led market growth among mid-caps with a 21% jump in the past 24 hours, cheering the debut of its native blockchain network ApeChain. Expectations among traders is that APE could see boosted usage as tokens are issued on the new network - although steady long-term usage remains to be seen.  Focus on U.S. election  All eyes are on the upcoming presidential elections in the U.S. scheduled for November 5, with traders expecting a run-up in the days to come.  Polymarket bettors have placed odds at 60% on Republican Donald Trump, with Democrat Kamala Harris at 39% as of Monday morning.  “With the focus on the U.S. election results being front and center, the most positive outcome for crypto would be a Trump win along with a Republican sweep (of House & Senate), allowing the Trump/Vance endorsed digital asset reform plans to have a realistic chance of passing through congress,” SOFA’s Fan told CoinDesk.  Traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a weekend broadcast that macroeconomic factors in Japan and China, coupled with the U.S. elections, would boost BTC prices.  “In Japan, inflation remains weak with headline inflation at 2.5%, down from 3.0%,” QCP traders said in the broadcast. “Market expectations indicate that the BOJ is unlikely to raise interest rates soon, contributing to a rally in USD/JPY, which is currently below 150.  “Meanwhile, China cut its benchmark lending rates after the central bank lowered interest rates at the end of September as part of a series of measures aimed at reviving economic growth and halting a housing market crash,” they said.  “With US equities close to all-time highs and the Japanese yen on a fresh weakening trend, risk-on sentiment will only grow stronger as we approach the US election. This will propel risk assets higher and support our Uptober narrative,” the note ended, referring to bitcoin’s historically bullish October seasonality.",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/bitcoin-nears-70k-amid-record-open-interest-at-40b-as-trump-harris-election-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac2fe10f3475415836ac30def7147147eb284495-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373532,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnyjt,1729497928,ApeCoin Price Surges 100% as Yuga Labs Debuts ApeChain,"APE has hit the highest since April.  The much-awaited ApeChain went live Sunday, bringing native staking yield to APE holders.  ApeCoin (APE), the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)-affiliated ERC-20 cryptocurrency used for governance and transactions in the ApeCoin ecosystem, has doubled in value over the weekend, topping $1.5 for the first time since April, according to CoinDesk data.  The rally comes as the ApeCoin team, led by Yuga Labs, the company behind BAYC, debuted the highly anticipated blockchain network ApeChain Sunday. The ApeCoin DAO voted to build the same in January this year.  The new offering, a Layer 3 network developed on Arbitrum One, is fully compatible with the APE token and facilitates minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), trading, and decentralized applications while enhancing user experience, pseudonymous analyst Elena said on X.  The ApeChain bridges also went live on Sunday, allowing users to transfer their tokens to ApeChain and automatically earn a staking yield on APE, ETH and stablecoins. Staking refers to locking assets in a blockchain network in return for rewards. It's analogous to investing in a fixed-income instrument.  The decision to bring native staking yield to APE likely galvanized investor interest in the token, according to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research.  ""ApeCoin has introduced an automatic yield mode, allowing users to passively earn returns by staking their APE tokens. This new feature reinvests rewards automatically, maximizing yield over time,"" Thielen said in a report to clients, explaining the catalysts for the price rally.  ""The system is part of the broader ApeCoin ecosystem, which aims to enhance token utility by encouraging users to engage more actively with the token through games, staking pools, and other activities. The platform also plans to extend support to other yield-generating cryptocurrencies to attract a larger user base,"" Thielen added.  Another factor that may have helped the APE rally is LayerZero's launch on the ApeChain mainnet. LayerZero is an interoperability protocol that enables applications to move data across blockchains.  The APE token's integration with LayerZero's omnichain fungible token standard enables ""seamless cross-chain transfers, enhancing utility across multiple blockchains while ensuring scalable and efficient transactions,"" LayerZero said.",POSITIVE,APE,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | APE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/apecoin-surges-100-as-yuga-labs-debuts-apechain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/013d2f603765429a322f81e1ed44fc6a700bfd55-2880x1800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34957049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649025,1729495803,Ethereum Holders On The Rise: Accumulation Addresses Double Since January 2024—Report,"With an impressive increase in coin acquisition, Ethereum aficionados are causing waves in the crypto space. From January’s 11.5 million, the most recent statistics reveal a solid 19 million ETH now stashed in long-term holding addresses, almost doubled, data from CryptoQuant shows. With investors apparently increasing their bets, this huge surge points to a growing faith in Ethereum’s future. The crypto world is rife with conjecture since many estimate this count will reach 20 million by year’s end. Related Reading: XRP Could Skyrocket Over 4,000%, Analyst Forecasts Price Hitting $27 Clearly, there is a significant optimism in Ethereum’s long-term potential despite market swings, which leaves many wondering what is behind this increase in confidence and what this could mean for the scene of cryptocurrencies going forward. A number of factors are encouraging institutional and individual investors to increase their holdings. Notably, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has allowed new players to enter the market. Spot ETFs Push Demand More interest from mainstream investors has come from Ethereum spot ETF approval in great part. This indicates that both individual investors and institutions are getting ready for Ethereum’s long-term future. One researcher of cryptocurrencies even thinks that by the end of 2024, the ETH in accumulating addresses will equal the market value of the biggest companies worldwide. Furthermore, assuming Ethereum prices remain around $4,000, the analyst projects that if these patterns continue, the total value of ETH held in these addresses may reach $80 billion. At $2,737 right now, ETH has increased in value by over 3% over the last 24 hours and over 10% over the last week. Staking Secures More Ethereum The other main reason why less ETH is found in the market to trade is through the increase in Ethereum staking. According to Dune Analytics, staking contracts have locked up over 34.6 million ETH that equates to nearly 30% of the entire Ethereum supply, hence showing the statistics. This led to a lack of tokens for sale and therefore played a part in taming prices. More price growth for ETH may be possible if the amount staked keeps increasing. The Ethereum market may experience less volatility and more long-term growth potential if there are less sell-side pressures. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone The Price Outlook Is Good The current price swings of Ethereum are primarily upward. ETH is currently trading above $2,700—a crucial support level—thanks to the support of its 50-day moving average. The 200-day moving average, which is $3,022, remains a barrier, though. If Ethereum is to experience consistent price growth, it will be imperative to break over that obstacle. Ethereum’s long-term supporters are undoubtedly upbeat about the platform’s future, and the accumulating tendency along with staking and spot ETFs suggest that this confidence might not be unfounded. It will be interesting to see if Ethereum can overcome significant pricing obstacles, but one thing is certain: for the time being, the long-term picture looks promising.

The company's significant Bitcoin holdings and innovative debt-financed acquisition strategy have driven impressive stock performance, despite poor fundamentals. Inclusion in major indices like MSCI World and potential future inclusions could drive institutional interest and stock appreciation, enhancing MSTR's market presence. High short interest presents the possibility of a short squeeze, potentially fueling further stock gains if Bitcoin continues to perform well. Introduction MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has attracted considerable attention recently, especially with Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) up over 55% year-to-date. What sets MSTR apart is its bold, unconventional strategy, making it a unique proxy for Bitcoin’s performance. Given this unusual situation, we’ll deviate from our typical structured analysis. Instead of diving deep into industry and financial valuations, we'll focus on MSTR's distinctive approach to Bitcoin: how they acquire it, and whether this strategy can unlock further potential or expose the company to significant risks. After all, an abnormal situation necessitates abnormal actions, right? Just to be clear, we are bullish on Bitcoin , which directly influences our outlook on MSTR. As a major buyer of BTC, the company’s performance is closely tied to the asset’s performance. In this initiation, we’ll then explore Michael Saylor’s leadership and the company’s unique history, and how MSTR has evolved to become the biggest Bitcoin proxy. From there, we’ll evaluate the sustainability of their approach, identify key risks, and mention potential tailwinds that could support the stock. Captain Saylor At The Heart of The Dot Com Bubble Storm Michael Saylor is a remarkable figure in the tech industry. After graduating from MIT with dual degrees in “Aeronautics, Astronautics and Science,” “Technology, and Society” he founded MSTR at just 24 years old. Created in 1989, MSTR focuses on data exploration and management software, with Saylor serving as a CEO from its foundation until 2022 and now as the Executive Director. Often seen with a maquette of a naval ship behind him in his office, Saylor made in 1998 the pivotal decision to take the company public, raising nearly $40 million and holding 39,521 shares valued at $14,482,075, representing almost 36% ownership. Inspired by the booming tech sector, he wanted MSTR to capitalize on the public offerings trend of other software companies during the dotcom bubble. As speculation soared, MSTR's stock skyrocketed. In this period of exuberance, the company even purchased a Super Bowl ad spot in the year 2000. At its peak, Saylor briefly became the richest man in Washington, with a fortune of $7 billion. However, the tide turned dramatically when, in March 2000, the company was asked by the SEC to restate its financial statements for 1998 and 1999 due to accounting errors. This came during a time of widespread accounting scandals, such as those involving Enron and WorldCom. MSTR's stock, initially priced at $14 and soared to $333, plunged by around 91% in just two months after this scandal. First page of the Daily News Published the 21st March 2000 (Daily News) By December 2000, Saylor reached a settlement with the SEC , paying $11 million to resolve the charges. Within a matter of months, he transitioned from being one of America’s richest billionaires to a multi-millionaire. The Bitcoin Strategy - The Sun On The Horizon? On August 11, 2020, things took a massive turn for both Saylor and MSTR as the company bought for the first time 21 454 BTC for $250 million, at under $12,000 each. What could have been considered at that time as a strange anecdotal decision without consequences has turned into what Saylor calls today a “Bitcoin Strategy.” What's the logic behind it? With MSTR sitting on $500 million in cash and interest rates at rock-bottom levels during the pandemic, Saylor anticipated that this era of easy money would devalue the U.S. dollar, potentially sparking inflation. This led him to view Bitcoin’s “reserve of value” characteristics as highly compelling. Since adopting this strategy, MSTR has accumulated over 250,000 BTC, which represents 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Evolution (Bitbo) The company acquired these at an average of $39 292.18 per Bitcoin. As of today, Bitcoin trades around $68,000, representing a 73% gain on the company’s Bitcoin holdings. The impact on MSTR’s stock has been impressive, with the share price multiplying thirteenfold and outperforming Bitcoin itself by a factor of 3! Seeking Alpha Fundamentals - Is The Ship Taking on Water? We think that MSTR poor fundamentals characterized by very low top line growth is related to the firm's lack of innovation and its reliance on legacy products. Competitors in the business intelligence space have quickly embraced cloud and AI-driven technologies, while MSTR has been slower to adapt. Additionally, many of its customers still use older, on-premises software, which is less appealing as companies move to modern cloud-based solutions. This slow transition has hurt the firm competitiveness in the market. These difficulties are evident, as shown in the chart below, where revenues have declined over the past three years while the firm has been struggling to remain profitable. Seeking Alpha We don’t expect any substantial improvement in the near future as the management is now focusing only on making MSTR a “Bitcoin company,” making a transition towards BTC related activities. Despite all that, the group is performing well and continues to buy more Bitcoin. It even seems that the more it buys, the better the stock performs. How Is the Ship Not Sinking? By Raising More Debt! As noted earlier, MSTR appears to have steady revenues around $500 million. These revenues and the firm financial situation in 2019 were enough to support the firm first debt issuance. However, since 2019, the company’s long-term debt has increased from zero to $3.7 billion, all related to its Bitcoin-buying strategy. MSTR Long-Term Debt Evolution (Seeking Alpha) Here’s how it works. First, MSTR issues convertible debt. In a convertible debt agreement, a company borrows money, with the understanding that the loan will eventually be repaid by converting it into shares. Once the debt is issued, MSTR uses the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, an asset that has historically shown a long-term upward trend. As Bitcoin appreciates, the company’s intrinsic value and stock price also increase, enabling it to raise even more debt. This cycle continues, and in doing so, Saylor is making a bold move. He is indirectly betting against the U.S. dollars. Why? Because he believes the monetary system is broken that governments are issuing too much debt, and that central banks are flooding the market with liquidity, driving risky assets like Bitcoin higher while devaluating our currencies. It is hard to disagree with him when looking at this famous chart shared on Visual Capitalist . Visual Capitalist As global debt rises, economic growth slows, and central banks keep injecting liquidity, Saylor is taking advantage, and he is willing to pursue this strategy in the future. United Nations The irony? MSTR is only paying 0.625% on its latest $875 million convertible senior notes, due in 2028. The Premium Explained MSTR has been trading at a premium compared to its Bitcoin holdings. Nowadays, this premium is close to 3. It is justified in our view by several factors: First, it isn’t just a Bitcoin holding company, it has a core business in enterprise software which still generates revenues. Second, for many institutional investors, MSTR provides a convenient way to gain Bitcoin exposure on the stock market, especially for those unable to hold Bitcoin directly like many equity fund and portfolio managers. Also, unlike ETFs, which charge fees, a stock doesn’t. Finally, MSTR’s leveraged Bitcoin position enhances potential returns, making it an appealing option for those bullish on Bitcoin’s future. Will The Ship Stay Afloat For Long? We believe that as long as MSTR can borrow at low rates, it can. But there are drawbacks. The biggest one is shareholder dilution. When bondholders convert debt into shares, existing shareholders’ ownership is diluted. However, MSTR has emphasized that as Bitcoin holdings grow faster than the share count, Bitcoin per share is effectively increasing. This metric will be important to follow in the future. Company Presentation Another drawback is the company’s ability to repay its debt. With negative free cash flow, this debt may need to be rolled over with new convertible debt, further increasing leverage, or by issuing more equity, further diluting shareholders. Alternatively, MSTR could sell Bitcoin, which would directly impact both the stock price and the company’s borrowing capacity. It’s a very risky strategy, and MSTR may well be locked in a financial spiral. What If Bitcoin's Price goes down? When looking at MSTR principal debt maturities, the upcoming one will be in 2027. At that time, the company’s stock price would have to be under $143.2 (adjusted for stock split) to put the company in a difficult position. Company Presentation Tailwinds To Move The Boat Forward - Flows and Index Inclusions We believe that as the company’s market capitalization grows, it’s increasingly likely to be included in more equity indices. On May 31, 2024, MSCI, one of the leading index providers, added MSTR to the MSCI World Index , a widely used benchmark for fund managers focused on global funds. This kind of news is important, as fund managers now face the decision of whether to actively bet against the stock by not buying it, potentially risky if the stock were to skyrocket. Even those aiming to neutralize their MSTR exposure would need to buy the stock to match the benchmark exposure, creating positive buying pressure. Even though MSTR weight in this index is residual, it is in our view a first important step for further potential index inclusion and adoption. There have been rumors about MSTR potentially integrating into the S&P 500. In our view, this is unlikely, as the firm does not meet the Financial Viability criteria, which state that a company should have positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the four most recent quarters to be considered for inclusion in the index. However, we believe that the company meets all the criteria to be potentially listed on the Nasdaq 100 ( QQQM ), which is replicated by several ETFs representing together over $500 billion in AUM. … Despite C annonballs Coming From Short Sellers After the stock's recent rally, MSTR has been heavily shorted. MarketBeat The percentage of shares shorted now represents 17.31% of the free float and is in our view weighting on the stock performance. We have the conviction that should BTC continue to perform, shorts will be in difficult position and might be forced to close their position, leaving even more upward potential for the stock. Conclusion Michael Saylor, the visionary behind MSTR’s transformation, has redefined the company's trajectory through a Bitcoin-centric strategy. For investors like us, who share the conviction that Bitcoin's long-term potential is compelling, MSTR offers a leveraged and distinctive exposure to the asset. While the important debt level poses a risk, particularly if Bitcoin were to experience a sharp decline, we believe the upside remains significant for those prepared to face the volatility. One of the key catalysts for future stock appreciation could be MSTR’s growing presence in major indices. The recent inclusion in the MSCI World Index marks just the beginning of what, we believe, will be further index recognition, driving increased institutional interest. Additionally, the current high short interest presents the possibility of a short squeeze, which could fuel further gains if the stock continues to perform well. Taking these factors into consideration, we initiate on MSTR with a BUY rating.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4727942-microstrategy-navigating-the-bitcoin-wave-with-leverage-and-tailwinds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34952480.jpeg

This is based on historical price actions because XRP can be seen rallying within such a time frame. Though the targets appear quite ambitious, he uses previous performance as a sign for future gain and is setting up major growth opportunities for the owners of XRP. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone According to crypto expert Egrag Crypto, XRP, which is currently trading at $0.53, has experienced impressive surges of 3,300% and 700% at different times, suggesting that significant price movements could happen as we approach March 1, 2025, or even sooner in the first quarter. Crucially, these forecasts are backed by technical analysis, chart patterns, and liquidity assessments, rather than mere optimism. #XRP Bifrost Bridge ($6.4 & $27 Targets): I know 95% of the #XRPArmy is feeling exhausted from the ongoing #SEC manipulation and the appeals process, which has been overwhelming due to misleading submissions and numerous delays. 😩⚖️ But forget all of that noise! 🔇 The real… pic.twitter.com/FQ6mOe83ET — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 18, 2024 Technical Analysis And Market Sentiment The forecast is mostly on-chain metrics about Bifrost Bridge moving up, almost in the same direction with big stocks as that of FANGMAN. FANGMAN includes seven of the biggest tech companies or tech mega-caps of the world — Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. FANGMAN stocks are high alpha counters, which usually depend on growth and future guidance. This comparison says that even if it’s going through tough regulations and issues with the courts, XRP might be one of the biggest long-term benefits an investor could ever have by closing out the noise and just focusing on the data. This move will have the pending case in the SEC cast as a huge boulder for the investors in XRP, with constant appeals and delays testing the patience of many investors. However, Egrag urges the XRP Army to keep moving forward with undivided attention. Instead, it’s important to focus on these cycles and levels of liquidity since they are actually capable of providing various positive insights concerning long-term price trends. With this in mind, the wise investor would be able to determine the direction XRP’s price is headed. A Resilient XRP Community The litigation to be heard against the SEC will take time, but the battle will prove to be short-term when one weighs this against the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency. What is different about the XRP community, which calls itself the XRP Army, from many other crypto communities, is its strength and resilience. Where the crypto communities often flinch before a challenge, the XRP Army holds the line in arguing for the utility value of XRP in real-world applications. These analysts believe the community is flexible, emotionally supportive, and forward-looking, making them one of the most informed groups in the cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst The Campaign For Clarity In The Crypto World People are now calling for better cryptocurrency regulations that would push the XRP acceptance into the financial ecosystem, bring about higher community engagement, and prepare the cryptocurrency for practical adoption. The optimism toward the long-term future of the cryptocurrency is barely dented by the legal battles and market volatility since the XRP community believes in the projections by Egrag Crypto through optimistic price targets, which are based on past data and current trends.

A similar bullish flip happened at the onset of the late 2023 rally and in late 2022, marking the end of a brutal downtrend.  A bitcoin {{BTC}} indicator that warned of seller exhaustion in early September has flipped bullish, bolstering the case for a move above $70,000.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, a technical analysis indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes, has flipped positive on the weekly chart for the first time since April, according to charting platform TradingView. It signifies a renewed upward shift in momentum, implying a bullish resolution to bitcoin's prolonged back and forth trading between $50,000 and $70,000.  The positive technical outlook is consistent with consensus that the Fed's renewed bias for rate cuts, growing probability of supposedly pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump winning the Nov. 5 U.S. election, and weakness in the anti-risk Japanese yen, will likely power bitcoin to at least $100,000 by the end of December.  The MACD is calculated by subtracting bitcoin's average price level during the past 26 periods (weeks in this case) from the average over the past 12 weeks. The signal line is then calculated as a nine-week average of the MACD and the difference between the MACD and signal lines is plotted as a histogram.  It's one of the widely tracked indicators out there, and how it moved relative to the cryptocurrency's price in the first half of September signaled downtrend exhaustion.  Bitcoin has risen nearly 30% since hitting lows under $53,000 in early September. The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to $69,500 during Monday's Asian trading hours.  The MACD's latest bullish signal follows a similar flash from the ""line break chart"" last week and suggests that bulls might finally succeed in establishing a foothold above the $70,000 mark, having failed to do so several times since the first quarter.  A similar MACD bull cross happened in October last year as bitcoin moved past the long-held $30,000 resistance, eventually reaching a record high of over $73,000 in March this year. The bull cross seen in late 2022 marked the bear market bottom.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/bitcoin-gets-yet-another-bullish-signal-as-prices-near-70k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2623d391c438f1cec4f64a2df45f3481dd46d6e6-1280x837.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts have already predicted further upward potential for this meme coin. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone Analyst Predicts 200% Surge For Shiba Inu Crypto analyst MMBTtrader seems rather positive about the future prospects of Shiba Inu as he expects a 200% increase to $0.000038. As he says, the SHIB had already registered a 75% gain from the $0.000011 support level within the price chart. The altcoin had indeed rallied from the demand zone in the early periods of August and September, accelerated its pace, and settled at $0.000019. For SHIB, MMBTtrader predicts that it will not just consolidate to $0.00003852. As a matter of fact, he expects the higher highs and higher lows pattern where the initial push to May’s highs at $0.000028 will then be corrected to September’s highs at $0.000021. In case those levels hold, the meme coin could pull to the targeted $0.00003852. Conflicting Views: Bearish Outlook From SwallowPremium MMBTtrader still remains bullish about Shiba Inu, but SwallowPremium, on the other hand, is a little more conservative. He says that the cryptocurrency would continue to go up until it hits $0.0000216, and then correct 35% down to $0.000014075. His analysis reads that the downtrend would be triggered by a correction down to $0.0000195, which may be a good time to open a short position. However, Premium also cautions that if SHIB breaks over the price of $0.0000216, a bearish outlook could be invalidated, sending the price much higher than what it has already recorded. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth Shiba Inu’s Price Path Forward Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001925, close to 11% below the level of $0.0000216 resistance.

MMBTtrader projection for a possible 100% increase is based on an underlying conviction for perpetuation of an upward trend. SwallowPremium sounds a note of caution with a ‘critic’ view of correcting it. Shiba Inu’s future price action depends on breaking key resistance levels and maintaining momentum. As SHIB nears crucial price points, traders will watch for breakout signs. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether it can rise further or face another rejection.
