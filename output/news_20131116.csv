42376686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOGv,1384607383,Federal Agency Responses Reveal US Government Attitudes to Bitcoin,"The US Senate committee due to begin hearings into ‘virtual currencies’ on 18 November has released the responses it received to its August 2013 requests for information on the topic from a number of federal agencies.  Until the actual hearings begin, the letters provide one of the most detailed insights so far into how various US government authorities view bitcoin and its contemporaries.  The requests from the Senate’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) asked five agencies about their existing policies and procedures regarding virtual currencies, their level of coordination with other federal agencies or governments at all levels on the matter, plus any strategies or ongoing initiatives they had in place.  Responses to committee chair the Hon. Thomas R. Carper came from The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of the Treasury.  [post-quote]  We've learned that the five agencies have a keen interest in virtual currencies, and have money laundering and terrorist financing weighing on their minds. Nearly all agencies referenced Liberty Reserve, which offered anonymous payments backed by US dollars, euros and gold ounces and was shuttered by authorities just months earlier (May 2013). Some also mentioned Texan Trendon T. Shavers and his alleged bitcoin ponzi scheme which was making headlines at the time.  The crime-heavy spotlight of the responses might be an indication of the US government’s overall approach to digital currencies such as bitcoin, with only the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department commenting that such payment systems could provide benefit and increase efficiency. Throughout the responses, bitcoin was the only digital currency referred to by name.  DHS Response  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Department of Homeland Security was most likely to identify virtual currencies as a threat, recognizing the need for an “aggressive posture towards this evolving trend,” and a “multi-prong strategy” to target virtual currency platforms and virtual currency exchanges.  “The most critical capability for transnational organized crime is to quickly and quietly move large quantities of money across borders,” wrote the Department of Homeland Security. It continued:  ""The anonymity of cyberspace affords a unique opportunity for criminal organizations to launder huge sums of money undetected. With the advent of virtual currencies and the ease with which financial transactions can be exploited by criminal organizations, DHS has recognized the need for an aggressive posture toward this evolving trend.""  The response concluded with: “The Department is pleased that the Committee recognizes the magnitude of these issues and the evolving nature of these crimes.”  The DHS also referred to the many crimes committed in the operation of Silk Road, a “criminal eBay” whose “sole currency accepted and transacted… is Bitcoins.” As well as the familiar drugs and hitmen stories, they also revealed a vendor on Silk Road had sent the poison ricin to President Obama earlier in 2013.  DOJ Response  The DOJ’s response (through the FBI) recognized that both centralized and decentralized digital payment systems offer legitimate financial services, but pointed out that ‘malicious actors’ are attracted to systems with “lax money-laundering and know-your-customer” controls.  The FBI appears to be keeping a close watch on virtual currencies through its Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group (VCET) as well as a New Payment Methods Ad Hoc Working Group (a subgroup of the Terrorist Finance Working Group). The letter continues that the FBI has created “numerous intelligence products related to virtual currency,” and works closely with its regulatory partners in money laundering, computer crimes and intellectual property to address any threat posed by virtual currency.  Federal Reserve Response  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System acknowledged that virtual currencies “may pose risks related to law enforcement and supervisory matters,” but “there are also areas in which they may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.”  The Federal Reserve also pointed out it does not necessarily have any authority to regulate any currency not controlled by a banking organization it supervises, but is required to be consulted when any special measures (such as those concerning virtual currencies) are being considered.  SEC Response  The SEC mentioned its Investor Alert in the wake of Trendon Shavers’ ponzi scheme, and pointed out that “any interests issued by entities owning virtual currencies or providing returns based on assets such as virtual currencies” were considered securities and thus fell under its remit.  It also said the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets had held informational meetings with the Bitcoin Foundation and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) covering legal, policy, technology, and law enforcement issues from the Foundation’s perspective.  Treasury Response  “The Treasury Department is following the emergence of virtual currencies and their potential for licit and illicit use very closely.” Like the Federal Reserve, it acknowledged virtual currencies provided legitimate financial services that may be exploited by criminals (the usual money launderers and terrorists). Such illicit activity had been limited by virtual currencies’ “scope, liquidity and volatility,” though.  The Committee  will begin its hearings on 18 November. Appearing to promote digital currency interests will be Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jeremy Allaire of Circle Internet Financial Inc., and Jerry Brito of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

42376689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOFf,1384601433,US has Already Ceded Dominance in Bitcoin Trading,"Expertise and dominance in a particular industry sector doesn't come about by decree. It is achieved over years through repeated practice and creative experimentation.  During the first three-and-a-half years of bitcoin's development from 2009 to 2012, a large portion of that technological experimentation had been occurring in the US with multiple bitcoin trading exchanges and bitcoin-related businesses.  Now, there exists only one functioning exchange in the US with diminishing volume compared to its competitors. The Atlanta-based exchange, Camp BX, had reached such a low point of average daily trading volume that it was removed from the CoinDesk BPI earlier this month.  Although the future may not look bright for the US jurisdiction, it does not appear to be a conscious decision on the part of legislators and regulators. The evolving body of law known broadly as ""digital currency law"" applies at both the federal level and the state level creating overlapping licensing regimes and a considerable compliance investment for new startups.  Senate hearings  A pair of Senate hearings will take place next week in Washington, DC, with the first hearing being held by the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the second hearing being held jointly by the Banking Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance and the Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy.  These government hearings will be largely educational briefings focusing on law enforcement, regulatory environment, national security, and the possible opportunities for bitcoin in payments and global transactions. Several bitcoin-related companies will be testifying along with the Bitcoin Foundation.  Of course, there isn't a ban on bitcoin in the US. But there doesn't have to be an outright ban when there is a chilling effect on banking that translates into an unwillingness for banks and credit unions to engage with bitcoin-related companies.  Given the labyrinth and ambiguity of state-by-state compliance issues, financial institutions conclude that it's far safer and easier to ignore bitcoin-related opportunities. This is the largest single barrier to payments innovation in the US.  Adversely, the unintended consequence is that viable and innovative companies seek more hospitable locales in non-US jurisdictions. So, where is the bitcoin trading volume going? How does important price discovery occur for bitcoin?  Top exchanges  Currently, the top four bitcoin exchanges by volume are located outside of the US, with the world's leading exchange based in China.  Less than 2% of worldwide bitcoin trading and real-time market making occurs within the US jurisdiction. (Coinbase provides only fixed-rate conversion with the US dollar and they do not hold any customer funds in US dollars.)  All four of the world's leading exchanges have demonstrated a capacity for serious, engaged banking relationships that would have been unobtainable in the United States.  As of 14th November, here is the list in sequential order based on 30-day cumulative bitcoin trading volume (for single trading pair):  (1) BTC China traded $298.4m in XBT/CNY (based in China)  (2) Mt. Gox traded $232.8m in XBT/USD (based in Japan)  (3) BitStamp traded $200m in XBT/USD (based in Slovenia)  (4) btc-e traded $119.8m in XBT/USD (based in Bulgaria)  Separately, in terms of active bitcoin nodes on the network, the US ranks first, followed by Germany, China, the UK, and Russia. Representing 25.7% of all active nodes, the US can probably claim the largest number of worldwide bitcoin users as well.  However, this measure is severely disproportionate to its slice of worldwide trading volume. Trading volume and liquidity is ""sticky"" and the jurisdictions adopting the bitcoin exchanges will exert the most influence over the new bitcoin economy. They will become entrenched.  Strategic evaluation  We have arrived at the point where the US jurisdiction must strategically evaluate a path going forward. Either they enable a climate that appeals to bitcoin exchanges and businesses or they maintain barriers that silently drive innovation in the space overseas.  Delaying that moment serves only to increase the clout and power of the other jurisdictions competing for this lucrative business. A free and robust bitcoin economy drives growth and jobs, provides relief for the unbanked, and facilitates global financial inclusion.  Another interesting metric is the ranking of the Narrow Bitcoin Money Stock (M1) compared to the money stock of all separate nations (and the European Union). At approximately $5bn, bitcoin money stock currently ranks at 100 out of 191, recently surpassing Iceland and Lebanon.  In some ways, government hearings on the Bitcoin protocol are like studying gravity. It's useful information if you didn't already understand the properties, but it does not allow much latitude for alteration. A futuristic potential Govcoin would be merely one of many cryptographic monetary units.  At the end of the day, all this attention on anti-money laundering laws and financial crime may be misplaced, because the real show with bitcoin will be at the Federal Reserve and the potential impacts on administering monetary policy.
