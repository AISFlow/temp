On July 22, 2023, the address transferred its entire balance to a new address. Early BTC Address Comes Back To Life Bitcoin has been around since 2009, so there are dormant addresses that have been inactive for years that contain large amounts of BTC. Some of the early adopters of this cryptocurrency were able to buy in very cheap but the private keys to many of these addresses have been lost, locking them forever. Every now and then, however, some of these addresses suddenly come back to life as the owner regains asses to the funds. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap The address here was one of the earliest Bitcoin addresses. According to on-chain data, it received its first transaction of 1,037 BTC in November 2012. At the time, the price of each BTC sold for only $12.41. It then received regular small deposits of BTC over the years. With the price of Bitcoin now at $29,828, this sets the total price at just over $31 million. 💤 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 1,037 #BTC (31,080,234 USD) has just been activated after 11.3 years!https://t.co/6cW9vnTOhD — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 22, 2023 There are a few possibilities for what could have prompted the owner to suddenly move these funds after all this time, ranging from regaining control of the private keys to cashing out and taking a profit. Whatever the reason, the sudden reawakening of dormant Bitcoin addresses has the potential to cause a stir and spark interest in the Bitcoin community. BTC price remains below $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Implications For The Price Of Bitcoin When a large amount of BTC suddenly moves, it can cause temporary price fluctuations. An immediate selloff of the assets can lead to a drop in the market price of Bitcoin. However, these effects are often short-lived. Over the long run, an increase in circulating supply is unlikely to significantly impact Bitcoin’s price due to the rapid rate of adoption. Dormant BTC addresses have also been showing up in a flurry this year. Back in May, a similar address containing 1,000 BTC that was dormant for more than 11 years moved 400 BTC to a new wallet. In February, a BTC address that had been dormant for 11 years came back to life to move $9.6 million worth of BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue These examples show that even if an address has been dormant for a long time, there is always a possibility of the funds moving again. However, many of these addresses seem to be lost forever. According to IntoTheBlock, around 29% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply is now presumed lost forever after remaining stagnant for over five years.S Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dormant-address-moves-31-million-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

15211344,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/ripple-eyes-uk-expansion-following-recent-xrp-win,1690113660,Ripple Eyes UK Expansion Following Recent XRP Win,"After securing a partial win in its case involving the SEC, Ripple’s Managing Director for the UK and Europe revealed the firm recently applied for registration in the UK and Ireland. Ripple’s recent landmark victory in its case involving the SEC has spurred a renewed interest in the firm and its native token XRP. The firm is riding the wave of its current popularity and is setting its sights on expanding to the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Ripple Looks to Expand Operations to UK and Ireland Ripple’s European Managing Director, Sendi Young, told DL News in an interview the firm is in the process of obtaining approval in the UK and Ireland. While the company still sees the US as its global hub, Sendi said, “We are going to continue growing exponentially” in the UK and Europe. To that end, Young said Ripple “very recently” applied for crypto asset firm registration with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and a payment institution license in the Republic of Ireland. During the interview, Ms Young stated: “We are in the process of applying for our crypto asset registration in the UK and our payments licence in Ireland. These are all massive investments with a view that we are going to continue growing exponentially in this region.” She, however, declined to provide a numerical target for the company’s UK and European growth plans but confirmed the company is increasing hiring in the region. Court Ruling is a “Huge Win” for Ripple Ripple secured a partial win against the SEC when Judge Analise Torres ruled Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple has been engaged in a three-year battle with the SEC after the agency alleged the firm breached US securities laws. XRP is not a security.This victory for @Ripple is a win for the entire industry and a step toward regulatory clarity in the U.S.A huge thank you to @bgarlinghouse, @chrislarsensf, and @s_alderoty for their leadership and the #XRPCommunity for their continued support. — Ripple (@Ripple) July 13, 2023 Based on the SEC’s lawsuit, crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken were forced to delist XRP offerings but have since indicated they would relist the token. Young commented on Judge Torres’ decision and said it is a “huge win” and “positive for [the company’s] growth in the US.” She added the company’s position on the US as its global hub “has not changed” but noted since the lawsuit, the majority of Ripple’s expansion “has happened outside the US. I would only expect that the US will pick up and grow a lot more now. Having said that, we are global, we have over 15 offices around the world.” Ripple Secures an In-Principle MPI License in Singapore CNCB reported weeks before Judge Torres’ decision the firm received in-principle approval of a Major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the country’s central bank – the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). In a press release announcing MAS approval, Ripple said: “Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, today announced that its Singapore subsidiary Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd, has obtained In-Principle Approval of the Major Payments Institution License application from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This license will allow Ripple to offer regulated digital payment token products and services in the city-state, and further scale its customers’ use of its crypto-enabled On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service.” Ripple has long held a strong presence in Singapore since opening its Asia Pacific headquarters in 2017. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement released soon after announcing the company’s MPI approval: “Singapore is a leading global financial center, and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific. We’re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally.” Stu Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, also commented: “As more countries develop regulatory frameworks for crypto, many are looking to Singapore’s early leadership in developing a clear taxonomy and licensing framework. This in-principle regulatory approval from the MAS will enable us to better support our forward-looking customers looking to hone in on blockchain and crypto technologies to build a more inclusive and borderless financial system.” Ripple reportedly doubled its headcount in Singapore over the past year and continues to seize every advantage the city holds for it.

These coins represent promising projects in their respective niches, offering unique features and growth potential. Join us as we examine why these coins could be an excellent candidate for potential investment. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Summary Polygon (MATIC) proposes a token switch A New York prosecutor charges a Solana (SOL) hacker Tradecurve (TCRV) expected to surge by 40% next week What Is a Polygon (MATIC)? Polygon has emerged as a leading scaling solution for Ethereum, offering enhanced scalability and interoperability. The project aims to address the limitations of Ethereum's network, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. With its growing ecosystem of dApps and protocols, Polygon has gained traction among developers and users alike. As the demand for scalable blockchain solutions continues, investing in the Polygon crypto may offer significant profit potential. Recently, Polygon proposed a token switch from MATIC to POL which will serve as a multipurpose token. Following this announcement, the Polygon price soared. The token trades hands at $0.7675 with a market cap of $7.1B, up 3.69% overnight. Because of this, experts forecast that Polygon could rise to $0.96 by the end of 2023. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale How High Can Solana (SOL) Go? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform focusing on scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana can handle thousands of TPS through its Proof of History, making it an attractive choice for dApps.As the Solana platform expands its reach, the Solana crypto could also experience a rise. A New York prosecutor recently charged a hacker with stealing $9M from a Solana-based exchange. This news sparked a rally for the Solana coin, as it is the first-ever criminal case that encompasses a DEX. Solana trades hands at $22.34, a rise of 0.02% in the last 24 hours. Experts are bullish about its future, with its moving averages and technical indicators in the green. They forecast that Solana could reach $29.11 by December 2023. Tradecurve (TCRV): A Future Game-Changer While Polygon and Solana are soaring, one project currently in its presale has also gained worldwide attention. Tradecurve is a trading platform that could dominate the market as it incorporates the best features of CEX and DEX. Tradecurve users will be privy to fast order execution, deep liquidity, and anonymity through DeFi capabilities. A significant difference that separates Tradecurve is that traders can trade all derivatives on one account. Users can create this account using an email only, as no sign-up KYC checks are required. Tradecurve provides a fully anonymous trading environment where users divulge no personal information. Its decentralized nature will lower trading fees as all third-party mediators are gone. Tradecurve has also placed a particular focus on transparency by announcing the implementation of its Proof of Reserves. Over 15,000 registered users have welcomed this development. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with its native token, TCRV, worth $0.018. This is an 80% surge from its starting price, meaning those who bought it early are now reaping the benefits. However, Stage 5 will begin sometime next week - causing a 40% price surge. Not only that, Tradecurve has a connection to the forex market. This market has seen a turnover of $7.5T in April 2022, meaning its growth potential is immense. With this in mind, experts forecast a 100x rise when TCRV gets listed on a Tier-1 CEX.

These coins represent promising projects in their respective niches, offering unique features and growth potential. Join us as we examine why these coins could be an excellent candidate for potential investment. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Summary Polygon (MATIC) proposes a token switch A New York prosecutor charges a Solana (SOL) hacker Tradecurve (TCRV) expected to surge by 40% next week What Is a Polygon (MATIC)? Polygon has emerged as a leading scaling solution for Ethereum, offering enhanced scalability and interoperability. The project aims to address the limitations of Ethereum's network, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. With its growing ecosystem of dApps and protocols, Polygon has gained traction among developers and users alike. As the demand for scalable blockchain solutions continues, investing in the Polygon crypto may offer significant profit potential. Recently, Polygon proposed a token switch from MATIC to POL which will serve as a multipurpose token. Following this announcement, the Polygon price soared. The token trades hands at $0.7675 with a market cap of $7.1B, up 3.69% overnight. Because of this, experts forecast that Polygon could rise to $0.96 by the end of 2023. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale How High Can Solana (SOL) Go? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform focusing on scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana can handle thousands of TPS through its Proof of History, making it an attractive choice for dApps.As the Solana platform expands its reach, the Solana crypto could also experience a rise. A New York prosecutor recently charged a hacker with stealing $9M from a Solana-based exchange. This news sparked a rally for the Solana coin, as it is the first-ever criminal case that encompasses a DEX. Solana trades hands at $22.34, a rise of 0.02% in the last 24 hours. Experts are bullish about its future, with its moving averages and technical indicators in the green. They forecast that Solana could reach $29.11 by December 2023. Tradecurve (TCRV): A Future Game-Changer While Polygon and Solana are soaring, one project currently in its presale has also gained worldwide attention. Tradecurve is a trading platform that could dominate the market as it incorporates the best features of CEX and DEX. Tradecurve users will be privy to fast order execution, deep liquidity, and anonymity through DeFi capabilities. A significant difference that separates Tradecurve is that traders can trade all derivatives on one account. Users can create this account using an email only, as no sign-up KYC checks are required. Tradecurve provides a fully anonymous trading environment where users divulge no personal information. Its decentralized nature will lower trading fees as all third-party mediators are gone. Tradecurve has also placed a particular focus on transparency by announcing the implementation of its Proof of Reserves. Over 15,000 registered users have welcomed this development. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with its native token, TCRV, worth $0.018. This is an 80% surge from its starting price, meaning those who bought it early are now reaping the benefits. However, Stage 5 will begin sometime next week - causing a 40% price surge. Not only that, Tradecurve has a connection to the forex market. This market has seen a turnover of $7.5T in April 2022, meaning its growth potential is immense. With this in mind, experts forecast a 100x rise when TCRV gets listed on a Tier-1 CEX.

SEC case. This significant development sparked optimism among investors, leading to an upward swing in Bitcoin's price. However, despite the initial surge, Bitcoin continues to face resistance in its price movements as market dynamics fluctuate and investor sentiment remains cautious. The cryptocurrency's journey to establish a stable foothold above $31,000 has been met with constant fluctuations and varying selling pressure. Still, certain factors indicate bullish sentiment that could see BTC skyrocket in the coming months. Although Bitcoin is considerably down from its record high of approximately $69,000, which it achieved in 2021, on-chain data reveals that the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around the $30,000 level on significant exchanges, with a target of reaching $35,000. Its market cap is nearing an impressive $590 billion, accompanied by a robust trading volume about to surpass $7.6 billion. The recent Bitcoin rally has sparked speculation among experts, suggesting that the price could rise further with the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The arrival of ETFs, particularly those pushed by top-ranking companies like BlackRock, can boost Investors' confidence and trigger a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Industry analysts are closely monitoring potential bullish catalysts that could significantly impact the price of BTC. Their analysis highlights the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, the outcome of Ripple's lawsuit against the SEC, the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, and Binance's settlement with the Feds as crucial factors. These developments have caught the attention of famous investment analyst Callie Cox, who believes that the successful navigation of regulatory scrutiny by various cryptocurrency platforms indicates that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is only a matter of time. Cox further emphasizes that this development could open the floodgates for a more comprehensive fleet of institutional investors, potentially skyrocketing BTC to new highs. Adding to the bullish sentiment, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a widely-used technical analysis tool, indicates potential growth in the Bitcoin market. Financial analysts have recently observed an upside MACD cross on the BTC chart, suggesting the presence of bullish momentum. All the metrics mentioned above and the data point towards Bitcoin experiencing a significant bull run led by institutional investors. DigiToads (TOADS) Presale Milestone Highlights Growing Dominance Among Meme Coins The crypto markets have once again entered a phase of meme coin demand, and the recent success of DigiToads' (TOADS) presale is the best ICO that perfectly captures this trend. DigiToads has experienced a rapid 370% pump to $0.047 in the presale alone as meme coin investors relentlessly search for the best crypto investment. DigiToads dominates a market saturated with utility-lacking meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) amid this frenzy. The rapid adoption of DigiToads' presale indicates that many investors believe TOADS could be the next cryptocurrency to explode, outperforming leading crypto giants. DigiToads has witnessed overwhelming demand, rapidly selling TOADS, and achieving a fundraising milestone of over $6.2 million.

Deaton has downplayed the potential effects of an appeal by the United States Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) in its ongoing case against Ripple on the sale of the XRP token as an unregistered security. Related Reading: Why Ripple’s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert SEC Nudges At Possible Appeal Against Ripple Ruling On July 13, U.S. Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not violate U.S. securities law as the SEC cannot prove retail investors had expected profits from this investment based on the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” The decision was based on the Howey Test, which states that a contract, transaction, or scheme is an “investment contract” and, therefore, a security if it is (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profit (4) to be gained from the effort of others. For the first time since the ruling, the SEC hinted on July 21 it might appeal this judgment in one of its petitions in another ongoing case against Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon. The lawyers of these defendants had earlier filed a motion to dismiss the charges against their clients based on the recent Ripple ruling. However, the SEC responded by saying that the ruling which favored Ripple was “wrongly decided,” and the commission could soon explore ways to review this judgment. The filing read: Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, much of the Ripple ruling supports the SEC’s claims in this case and rejects arguments Defendants have raised here. However, with respect to the Programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny. Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review. Related Reading: How Did Shiba Inu Price React To 3 Trillion SHIB Investor Accumulation? SEC’s Potential Appeal To Be Likely Insignificant – John Deaton In response to if an appeal by the SEC in its case against Ripple would represent a setback for XRP, popular crypto lawyer and XRP supporter Deaton has provided a positive outlook implying that was far from being the case. According to a tweet on July 22, Deaton backed up this claim stating that an appeal by the SEC would first take two years to get a decision from the second circuit. In the U.S. legal system, the courts for the second circuit represent one of the 13 U.S. Courts of Appeal. Furthermore, the lawyer stated that assuming the second circuit did determine that application of the third Howey factor was wrong, U.S. Judge Torres would still apply the first two Howey factors and arrive at the same decision. Deaton also stated that Torres’s decision was obviously not final within the Southern District Court of New York, and there is the possibility of another district judge having another conclusion. However, he expressed that was unlikely, especially as Judge Torres had made this judgment citing the ruling in the popular SEC v. Telegram case in which the commission won an injunction to prevent Telegram from distributing GRAMS tokens on the allegations of it being unregistered security.

The regulator has indicated that it intends to appeal the judgment and continue its efforts to address the changing crypto landscape in an attempt to contest the ruling. XRP market cap currently at $38 million on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Market Sentiment Remains Upbeat Meanwhile, since the ruling, crypto exchanges have reintroduced XRP listings in the United States. The move could provide a price boost to the token. Despite the lack of significant developments since the ruling’s delivery a week ago, the market sentiment remains optimistic, with widespread speculation that Ripple is on the verge of announcing its initial public offering, further boosting optimism and interest in the cryptocurrency.
