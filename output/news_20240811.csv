There has been a continuous bounce between trend lines, forming what analysts call a symmetrical triangle pattern. As a result of a pattern traced as far back as 2018, this digital asset could be set for a big move ‚Äî but how? Related Reading: Solana Epic Bull Run Is Just Starting ‚Äì 10 Catalysts That Could Drive SOL To $1,000 From eagle-eyed market sentinels who predict that XRP may soon break out to those who are walking on eggshells, the crypto community is overrun with predictions. The pattern shows a fight between the buyers and sellers, which may suggest it is poised to explode up‚Äîor crash down‚Äîin value once that fight concludes. XRP Technical Indicators: A Mixed Bag The price of XRP has been steadily at the $0.57 mark, considered to be a key support level. Historically, this level has held pretty well and kept the coin from dipping too low. Recently, trading volume picked up, which is more often than not a sign that something big is brewing. If XRP breaks above the triangle‚Äôs upper trend line, then control might be taken over by the bulls, pushing up the price to new highs. #XRP Breakout Incomin XRP price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle since 2018 signaling a potential breakout With strong support around $0.38 and increasing volume 2024 could be the year for a significant upward move Keep an eye on XRP big things could be ahead pic.twitter.com/5MsehzASG6 ‚Äî xaif.03 üáÆüá≥ (@xaif_03) August 10, 2024 While some, like analyst Xaif.03, expect a rise to $100, that is a bit far-fetching at this point without more concrete evidence. But then, these people can see better than ordinary souls. Yet all isn‚Äôt rosy. The Relative Strength Index comes in at 54, right smack in the middle of the scale. This reading does indicate that neither an oversold nor overbought market condition exists, therefore keeping the door open to either a rally or more consolidation. The Bullish Case For XRP Notwithstanding some level of uncertainty involved, some analysts still stand on the bullish side. Noted crypto space figure Alan Santana believes that XRP is currently undergoing an accumulation phase. The token, according to him, follows a bear market with such a phase before drastically spiking in price exponentially. ‚ú¥Ô∏è XRP Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy My dear friends‚Ä¶ Accumulation for XRP, when considering the bigger picture, has been on-going since June 2022. The 2023 bullish wave was just a minor wave compared to bull-market proportions. ‚ÄúWave 1‚Äù of a much bigger‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/15LWLOxPcp ‚Äî Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 10, 2024 Based on his prognosis, if the XRP 2022 bear market is followed by its recovery year in 2023, it paves the way for accumulation in 2024. This happened once; thus, we might then expect a strong bull run for XRP in 2024, or the year after that. Of course, crypto markets are unpredictable, and past performance does not always warranty results in the future. Skeptics And The Path Forward Not everyone, however, is convinced that XRP is in the midst of a breakout. Some analysts have cautioned that while the symmetrical triangle pattern is powerful, it doesn‚Äôt always work. The market could easily move sideways for months, which could frustrate traders. XRP Technical Analysis on a 3-Day Timeframe In our previous analysis of XRP, we observed that the 50EMA and the 0.618 FIB levels were acting as resistance. The price eventually broke above these levels and reclaimed the resistance trendline at $0.63.

The A100 is one of NVIDIA‚Äôs top-of-the-line data-center GPUs specifically built for machine learning applications. With a market price of $10,000, small companies that are not heavily funded may have difficulties in obtaining this important piece of hardware for data-related needs. According to Osuri, the biggest selling point of Akash is its open access. ‚ÄúSo today, if you‚Äôre a company trying to get GPUs, it‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù Osuri said, highlighting the difficulty companies experience acquiring big assets like the A100 GPUs that are essential for data-heavy workloads. In this sense, Akash succeeded in providing access to high-density computing power to small enterprises. A quick look at Akash‚Äôs website reveals that A100 renting prices are only $2.08 per hour with the lowest being $0.75.

With Beam‚Äôs continuing innovation for its platform, it will disrupt the crypto-gaming space becoming one of the major players in the industry long-term. In terms of how it will affect BEAM‚Äôs price movement is still a mystery. BEAM Slightly Dims As Market Slows Down As of writing, the token is still on the green, attempting to break through the $0.01444 ceiling in the short term with a sharp uptick in price. This breakthrough might not happen today as the bulls lose steam. This won‚Äôt hurt gains in the past 24 hours, but it will affect long-term gains if the token loses its momentum. Two things can happen in the next couple of days: BEAM breaks through the $0.01444 ceiling flipping it to support, or the bulls fail to secure the latter price ceiling and then stabilizes on the $0.01273 and $0.01444 price range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals, Can Price Cross $0.5 If the breakthrough continues, investors and traders should aim to settle on $0.01685 for the long term, giving BEAM strong support for further upward movement. However, if the opposite happens, the token might dive below $0.01444, settling in the $0.1054-$0.01273 price range. However, investor confidence in the platform and token is high. With their attendance at Gamescom being the biggest driver of retail investor interest, we might expect more movement once we enter the next week. Investors and traders should keep an eye on BEAM as its mainstream entry will have a significant effect on retail perception on the crypto gaming scene.

32301086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634671,1723399241,Celsius Takes Legal Action Against Tether In $2.4 Bitcoin Collateral Controversy,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has initiated legal proceedings against Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin. The lawsuit, which was filed concerning a contract dispute dating back to 2022, alleges that Tether violated their agreement by unjustifiably liquidating 39,542.42 Bitcoins that were held as collateral for a loan issued in USDT. Celsius contends that Tether‚Äôs decision to sell the Bitcoin at that time was improper and a breach of the loan agreement. Celsius Files Lawsuit Against Tether Celsius Network‚Äôs disparity with Tether kicked off with a Bitcoin crash in 2022 and ultimately contributed to the crypto lender filing for bankruptcy in July 2022. The legal dispute centers around a revised agreement made in January 2022, which permitted Celsius to borrow USDT from Tether by securing the loan with collateral in Ether, Tether Gold, or Bitcoin. Related Reading: Cardano Eyes $0.3389: Can Bulls Sustain ADA Above This Critical Level? At the height of its borrowing, Celsius had secured nearly $2 billion in USDT from Tether, using tens of thousands of Bitcoins as collateral. As per the new agreement, Tether would be required to post a notice and wait for 10 hours if the value of the collateral were to fall below a specific threshold. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs crash in early 2022 meant the value of the Bitcoin collateral held by Tether tanked in tandem. As such, Tether required Celsius to post more collateral, a demand which it complied with by transferring 15,658.21 Bitcoin and another 2,228.01 Bitcoin of excess collateral for another loan. The complaint alleges that on June 13, 2022, Tether issued another demand for additional collateral. Contrary to the agreement‚Äôs requirement to wait for ten hours, Tether reportedly proceeded to liquidate the entire Bitcoin collateral without allowing Celsius the stipulated period to address the demand. ‚ÄúTether forged ahead with an improper application of 39,542.42 Bitcoin‚Äîthe entirety of collateral that Celsius had posted‚Äî‚Äîusing the pledged Bitcoin to cover its exposure in full, but destroying Celsius‚Äôs residual interest in the collateral,‚Äù the lawsuit read. Lawsuit Is Baseless, Tether Says Back then, the 39,542 BTC collateral for which Celsius is seeking a refund was worth around $800 million. However, the value of Bitcoin has grown since then, and the collateral is now worth more than $2 billion at today‚Äôs prices. In response, Tether addressed the lawsuit as baseless. The stablecoin company also confirmed Celsius Network‚Äôs $2.4 billion BTC claim, albeit while describing it as another ‚Äúshameless litigation money grab‚Äù to which it will never succumb. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Threatens To Trigger Crash If Price Does Not Hold $62,000 Moreover, the lawsuit also demands the return of an additional 15,658.21 Bitcoins and 2,228.01 Bitcoins from a top-up transfer, bringing the total claimed value to over $3.5 billion at today‚Äôs Bitcoin prices. In other news, Tether‚Äôs USDT recently crossed a new milestone of a $115 billion market cap.

These trends indicate a strong accumulation phase among large-scale investors, commonly known as whales, who have been capitalizing on the price dip to bolster their crypto holdings. Related Reading: Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals, Can Price Cross $0.5 As such, Bitcoin addresses have collectively withdrawn over $1.7 billion worth of Bitcoin from various exchanges, marking the largest weekly outflow in more than a year. Accumulation Trend Amongst Bitcoin Holders According to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin addresses have been steadily accumulating the coin in the past week. This data is highlighted through the analytic platform‚Äôs netflow data, which is crucial in forecasting an upcoming price uptick or downtrend for cryptocurrencies. The data highlights a significant shift, showing that outflows from exchanges have substantially outpaced inflows, with a staggering $1.7 billion more worth of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. BTC recorded a whopping $1.7B net outflows from exchanges in the past week, the largest amount in over one year. This points to large whales accumulating through the recent downturn pic.twitter.com/m4INbZmKmB ‚Äî IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) August 9, 2024 Such outflow is typically interpreted as a sign that investors are choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin for the long term, which in turn reduces the amount of BTC available for sale on exchanges. What Does This Mean For Price? Recent dynamics in the wider world of investments and increased volatility saw Bitcoin falling below $50,000 again last week. Interestingly, this drastic price drop marked the first time Bitcoin traded below $50,000 in six months. However, be that as it may, the price decline gave many crypto believers a chance to accumulate more BTC at a six-month low. This created buying pressure among some traders, which in turn helped to prop up the price of BTC and helped to prevent further declines. A reduction in Bitcoin available on exchanges can have significant implications for the market. With fewer coins available for sale, buying pressure may increase, potentially driving up prices as demand remains steady or grows. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,989, having established support at $60,000. Considering the prevailing bullish sentiment, this buying pressure may as well be the momentum that pushes the Bitcoin price to the challenging $70,000 price level. However, the journey to $70,000 presents four different resistance levels at $63,730, $65,510, $67,350, and $69,150. The buying pressure continues to linger on according to the total flow to and from exchanges. The total flow data shows a negative 61.9% and 12.27% in the past 24 hours and seven-day timeframes, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Penetrating Mainstream Macro Capital Markets ‚Äì What About Ethereum? However, Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet, as the exchange on-chain market depth shows there are still more sellers than buyers.

The expert, Alan Santana, believes that AVAX graphs look pretty much alike compared to Bitcoin before it surged in price. Now, can AVAX be about to replay this scenario? An in-depth analysis and further explanation are provided here. Related Reading: Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals, Can Price Cross $0.5 Drawing Parallels With Bitcoin Santana‚Äôs analysis hinged on the idea that Avalanche‚Äôs elongated consolidation phase throughout 2022 and 2023 is quite in resemblance with those phases in Bitcoin‚Äôs history. He had, in particular, mentioned that the plunge of Bitcoin from $70,000 to $49,000 was followed by a 4.5-month consolidation phase before the cryptocurrency began to recover. Similarly, Bitcoin‚Äôs resurgence above $20,000 in 2023 came after a seven-month accumulation period. ‚ú¥Ô∏è Avalanche Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy By now, you already know the theme‚Ä¶ Accumulation before bullish-wave. Bullish wave to end in a bullish-run. Avalanche vs Bitcoin: An Analogy The accumulation phase can be seen as the training phase, the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/bEsEAD1QJk ‚Äî Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 10, 2024 Santana believes these historical cases prove that AVAX might be gearing for a mammoth bull market as far ahead as 2025. According to him, this moderate wave of bullishness seen towards the tail end of 2023 and early 2024 is just a minor phase within the grand plan of the bigger market structure. It is an era of correction that has to happen, according to Santana, which would then give way to another accumulation period and is supposed to be paving the way for a substantial bullish breakout. New All-Time Highs Ahead? Santana believes AVAX could reach a new ATH of $382. He based his projection on the extension of Fibonacci levels from the low of the bear market to the previous ATH. According to Santana, two key levels in this analysis are 1.618 and 2.618, with respective price targets of $232 and $370 respectively. Under the assumption that everything unfolds as predicted, then, in this case, AVAX will become among the best performing cryptocurrencies within the next few years. While these figures may look optimistic, they are in direct adherence to the trend seen in other popular cryptocurrencies. As Santana points out, long-term predictions such as this should be taken very cautiously, but he exudes full confidence in AVAX. AVAX: The Case For A ‚ÄòBuy And Hold‚Äô Strategy Santana was advising a ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù approach for investors. He advised against perfect timing of the market, lest one is not investing at all while waiting for a possible price dip. Instead, Santana suggested establishing a price range within which AVAX could be gradually accumulated, especially below $20, and then just holding the tokens for the long term until the market turns bullish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Threatens To Trigger Crash If Price Does Not Hold $62,000 Market Sentiment & Technical Indicators Although the market sentiment at the moment would turn out to be more neutral, as reflected by a Fear & Greed Index score of 45, there are some rays of optimism. According to CoinCodex, the price prediction backing the strong bull run states that AVAX might rise to a value as high as $72.68, up by 230.17%, as soon as September 2024. If one had to view the recent performance of the asset, with its average volatility and changes of 12.42% over the past month, it would give the feeling that AVAX is trading cheap. On the other hand, considering that the Fear & Greed Index is relatively low, it underprices the potential of AVAX within the market correspondingly, making it an excellent opportunity for buying before a probable rally.

32292668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634634,1723377637,"Bitcoin To Rally To $250,000 If This Condition Is Met, Analyst Says","The price of Bitcoin has shown no significant movement in the last day rising by only 0.78% according to data from CoinMarketCap. Following a widescale crash in the global financial markets, the crypto market leader pulled off a strong recovery in the past week, gaining by 16% to reach a peak of $62,000. As Bitcoin currently retains a sideways movement, crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe has revealed a likely condition for the token‚Äôs next bullish run. Bitcoin Poised For Bullish Breakout If This Price Action Happens, Analyst Says In an X post on August 10, van de Poppe shared an interesting prediction on Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory stating that if the digital asset closed its monthly candle around the $60,000 price zone, it could indicate the asset is consolidating for a breakout. According to the crypto veteran, it is likely that such consolidation could finally propel Bitcoin to embark on a bullish run reaching a price target of $250,000, which represents a potential 350% gain on the token‚Äôs current price. Following the Bitcoin halving event in April, investors and market experts remain highly expectant of a bullish price run by the premier cryptocurrency as seen in previous years. However, Bitcoin has only shown a consistent range-bound movement moving between $55,000 to $70,000 over the last four months. Albeit, these price actions draw no cause for alarm as Bitcoin is known to historically commence its bullish run approximately six months after the halving event, which falls close to van de Poppe‚Äôs prediction. Interestingly, the current bull cycle is particularly surrounded by high levels of optimism as illustrated by multiple six-figure price predictions by top analysts. This is driven by many factors, most prominently the Bitcoin spot ETFs. Interestingly, these Bitcoin ETFs currently valued at $17 billion, may be set for monumental inflow levels after American banking giant Morgan Stanley sanctioned 15,000 advisers to officially offer these funds as portfolio additions.¬†Furthermore, the digital asset industry has recently made an unexpected foray into the US political scene as party and candidate opinions on crypto policy now look pivotal in upcoming elections in November. It appears this nascent industry may finally receive sufficient support from the US government in terms of regulations and legitimacy, which can boost the performance of various cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin over 12 ‚Äì 18 months. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $60,944 with a 0.44% increase in the last seven days. Meanwhile, the token‚Äôs daily trading volume is down by 52.88% and valued at $15.7 billion.

32288418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634628,1723366806,Bitcoin Penetrating Mainstream Macro Capital Markets ‚Äì What About Ethereum?,"Most large-cap cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have not exactly lived up to the hype and promise in the second half of 2024. Investors saw the general market experience a negative start to the past week, with most assets shedding a significant portion of their value. Interestingly, this recent price action has offered a unique insight into the current state of the crypto market and its relationship with the macro capital markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Vs. Ethereum ETFs ‚Äî Relative Impact? In a recent report, trading firm QCP Capital shared their observation on the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets following the significant drawdown on Monday, August 5. According to the firm, there has been a fundamental change in the liquidity profile of ETH relative to BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Latest Casualty: Miner Reserves Plunge to 3-Year Low, What‚Äôs Next For BTC? According to QCP Capital, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly incorporated into the mainstream capital markets, including the stock and bond markets. On the other hand, Ethereum ‚Äî the second-largest cryptocurrency ‚Äî is being pushed to the sidelines. This liquidity shift was further spotlighted in the broad market downturn experienced on Monday, where BTC fell by only 16% compared to ETH‚Äôs 22% price decline. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is almost around where it was a week ago ‚Äî closing in on $61,000, while ETH is still a little off pace. QCP Capital noted that this trend appears to result from the ‚Äúdistinct lack of interest‚Äù in the recently launched spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) relative to their BTC counterparts. ‚ÄúBTC as digital gold is a compelling narrative to investors while ETH is lacking one,‚Äù the firm said. This lack of a selling point for Ethereum ‚Äî especially amongst the older generations ‚Äî was one of the talking points following the ETH ETF approval. Interestingly, the slow start of these funds may give some credence to the early concerns. Liquidity Shift Not Necessarily A Bad Thing: QCP There is still some upside for Ethereum despite not penetrating the traditional markets as potently as Bitcoin, according to QCP Capital. The trading firm added: As a more speculative and more volatile asset, the propensity for exponential price gains comes along with the potential for larger drawdowns. QCP revealed that the difference in the implied volatility between BTC and ETH was closer to 5% prior to the launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs. However, this difference has now grown to more than 20% since the exchange-traded funds made their debut.

32284847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634404,1723357815,"Solana Epic Bull Run Is Just Starting ‚Äì 10 Catalysts That Could Drive SOL To $1,000","In a major turnaround, Solana (SOL) has managed to bounce from a 6-month low of $109 to consolidate above the $150 mark in the past 24 hours, solidifying its status as one of the best performers in the market year-to-date. The recent market rally has breathed new life into Solana, but according to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, this is just the beginning. In a detailed social media post, Deutscher revealed 10 reasons why he believes SOL is poised for a staggering 5x to 10x upside move, with the potential to reach the $1,000 price point. Reasons Why Deutscher Is Mega Bullish On Solana Deutscher‚Äôs first point centers on Solana‚Äôs consistent relative strength throughout the market cycle. The analyst contends that SOL has maintained its position and garnered significant mindshare, particularly within the meme coin sector. Deutscher also emphasizes the role of attention in driving price action, noting that Solana‚Äôs prominence was underscored during the recent Bitcoin conference, where it ranked second only to BTC regarding mindshare, creating a positive feedback loop, and fueling SOL‚Äôs ascent. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Soars Above $62,000 Again: Top 3 Reasons Deutscher also draws attention to Solana‚Äôs status as a ‚Äúthriving crypto hub,‚Äù likening it to a premier casino where meme coins‚Äîakin to games‚Äîflourish, with the SOL token serving as the exchange medium. This dynamic ecosystem, he suggests, contributes to the overall value accrued within the Solana network. Another key factor in SOL‚Äôs favor, according to Deutscher, is its market cap differential from that of Ethereum (ETH). With Ethereum having a significantly higher market cap valuation, SOL benefits from ‚Äúspeculation opportunities,‚Äù especially as its metrics continue to outperform Ethereum‚Äôs. Deutscher points out that a potential repricing of ETH could further boost SOL‚Äôs market cap, potentially leading to a valuation of $1,320 or $660 per SOL. In addition, the analyst noted that SOL is currently on the verge of breaking through SOL/ETH resistance on the weekly chart, which he believes ‚ÄúAfter that, it‚Äôs clear skies ahead. Booming DeFi, Revenue, And Institutional Adoption Delving deeper into Solana‚Äôs ecosystem metrics, Deutscher highlights its leading position in decentralized finance (DeFi) user growth, surpassing established chains like Bitcoin and Tron. The network‚Äôs Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to new highs, reaching $5.367 billion, while its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume has outpaced Ethereum on a rolling 30-day basis. Moreover, Solana‚Äôs revenue generation has surpassed that of major players in the crypto industry, like Ethereum, underscoring its prominence in the crypto sphere. Related Reading: Toncoin Rally Above 4-Hour 100-Day SMA Puts TON On The Path To $7.6 Deutscher also praised Solana‚Äôs latest upgrade, Firedancer, which aims to increase scalability, network efficiency, and institutional compatibility, as a major milestone for the blockchain and another reason to be bullish on the token‚Äôs prospects. The analyst also noted that asset management giant Hamilton Lane had launched a fund on the network, as NewsBTC reported in July, signaling growing institutional interest in the Solana ecosystem. Finally, the prospect of a spot Solana ETF, as proposed by VanEck, could potentially usher in a new wave of institutional capital, paving the way for further adoption and growth within the Solana ecosystem.

32281274,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634620,1723348844,"Bitcoin Death Cross Threatens To Trigger Crash If Price Does Not Hold $62,000","Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently discussed the impact of the death cross indicator, which has appeared again on Bitcoin‚Äôs chart. Thanks to this indicator, the $62,000 price level has become crucial to Bitcoin avoiding another price crash. Cowen noted in a video posted on his YouTube channel that Bitcoin is at risk of dropping lower if it fails to hold above $62,000 heading into the Death Cross. Bitcoin had rallied to as high as $62,000 after recovering from its price crash below $50,000 on August 5. The rise to $62,000 brought about the Death Cross, which now threatens lower prices for the flagship crypto. The Death Cross And Its Impact On Bitcoin‚Äôs Price The death cross indicator is usually considered bearish and suggests that a prolonged period of declining prices may be on the horizon for the asset in question. This death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average drops below its 200-day moving average. As Cowen revealed, Bitcoin‚Äôs 50-day moving average is currently at around $62,000. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Rally Or Ruin? This Key Price Point Could Decide As such, Bitcoin must reclaim and hold above the $62,000 price level soon enough, or it risks further price declines, with a drop below the psychological level of $60,000 already in sight. The crypto analyst specifically drew comparisons to the Death Cross, which occurred in 2019, to provide insights into what Bitcoin‚Äôs next move might be. He noted that the Death Cross in 2019 marked a local top for the flagship crypto, as it went on to record lower highs after then, and its price was bearish for about four months afterward. However, Cowen admitted that things could play out differently this time, noting that indicators like these tend to play out in a ‚Äúslightly different way‚Äù throughout different cycle phases. The timing of this Death Cross could also provide insight into what might happen next for Bitcoin. Cowen noted that September is, on average, the worst month for Bitcoin, suggesting that the flagship crypto could suffer a downtrend that could extend into September. It Boils Down To The Macro Side Cowen revealed that whatever happens next for Bitcoin will mainly depend on external factors rather than the prevailing conditions in the crypto market. This includes macroeconomic factors like inflation and the labor market. Indeed, the macro side is believed to be responsible for the crypto crash on August 5 as fears about a recession heightened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Sharp Recovery, But Watch Out For Resistance At $64,000 The US Federal Reserve has so far held off on cutting interest rates in a bid to bring inflation down to its desired 2%. However, their hesitation has led to projections that the US economy could soon enter a recession. The July US job reports also showed that market participants have cause to be worried as the unemployment rate was higher than expected. The macro side significantly impacts Bitcoin and the crypto market because it largely determines how much money investors are willing to invest in these risk assets.

32278372,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634623,1723341646,"Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals, Can Price Cross $0.5","Dogecoin has shown a remarkable recovery over the past five days after a significant downturn triggered by a broader market sell-off. During the first five days of August, the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline, plummeting by 38%, dropping from $0.1348 to a low of $0.0831. However, DOGE has demonstrated resilience in the face of these challenges. After hitting the $0.0831 mark, the cryptocurrency began to stage a notable comeback. Over the last five days, DOGE has rebounded by approximately 25%, a recovery that has lifted its price significantly from its recent lows. Although this upward movement has not yet been sufficient for holders to fully recoup the losses incurred earlier in the month, it shows the return of positive momentum for DOGE. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Soar 900%: Analyst Predicts What Needs To Happen This partial price recovery has been accompanied by a resurgence in key market metrics, suggesting that investor sentiment towards Dogecoin is beginning to turn bullish once again. Trading volumes have increased, indicating renewed interest and participation in the market. Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals According to data from IntoTheBlock, this recovery has been accompanied by a surge in daily trading volume, with majority of them being accumulations which have increased the buying pressure. At the time of writing, the volume of large transactions for DOGE in USD stands at an impressive $1.01 billion. This represents a substantial 54% increase from the seven-day low of $654.96 million recorded on August 3, right before it kickstarted its sharp decline. Interestingly, the large transaction trading volume reached a peak of $1.52 billion on August 5, coinciding with when the recovery began. This correlation strongly suggests that large holders, often referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù have been actively participating in the DOGE market during this recovery phase and are driving the upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Rapid Accumulation Amid Price Crash, Whale Transactions Soar Although the large transaction volume metric does not show whether they are accumulations or selloffs, the large holders netflow to exchange netflow ratio suggests the former is the case. This metric tracks the balance between large holder accumulation and inflows into exchanges, offering valuable insights into the behavior of both retail investors and whales. Currently, the ratio is tipping towards large holder accumulation, standing at 3.49%, compared to a negative 1.85% recorded on Monday, August 5. Still on whale activity, IntoTheBlock‚Äôs Bulls and Bears metric suggests the scale is starting to tip to the side of the bulls. This metric tracks addresses that have either bought or sold more than 1% of the total trading volume in the last 24 hours, classifying them as bulls or bears, respectively. Over the past two days, there has been a noticeable increase in bullish activity, with 14 bulls compared to 13 bears in the most recent 24-hour period. Although the margin might be narrow, the presence of more bulls than bears indicates that buying interest is starting to outweigh selling pressure. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1045. A successful breakout above $0.11 could reignite retail interest, which in turn could contribute to a surge toward the well-anticipated $0.5 price level.
