42429161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs2vh,1527798645,Mastercard Looks to Blockchain to Make Coupons Immutable,"A new patent application from Mastercard suggests that the payments giant is eyeing blockchain as part of a way to verify the authenticity of consumer coupons.  The application for a ""Method and System for Authentication of Coupons via Blockchain"" was published on May 31 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It envisions utilizing the tech ""specifically [for] the storage of coupon data in a blockchain to ensure redemption only by authorized individuals and immutability of coupon data.""  The idea is that blockchain can help reduce the risk of data manipulation that accompanies the use of certain types of systems for storing coupon data, including those that ""have been developed that directly associate a coupon with a transaction account, to ensure that only the specified transaction account is eligible to redeem the coupon.""  As Mastercard goes on to write:  ""However, this requires the entity to store data regarding coupons that are associated with transaction accounts, which can be resource-intensive and subject to data manipulation. In addition, the entity must offer a suitable interface for the consumers to access the data storage to identify what coupons have been associated with their transaction account.""  ""Thus, there is a need for a technological solution whereby coupons can be issued to an individual for redemption only by the individual, and where the system relies on a publicly accessible data source to enable implementation without the use of additional resources for the issuing entity,"" the company noted.  Whether an actual service offering comes out of the patent application remains to be seen – and Mastercard itself is no stranger to intellectual property bids related to the tech. That focus on authentication has been seen in other patent applications, including one focused on the prevention of fake identity use.  What is known, however, is that Mastercard has moved in recent months to beef up its internal blockchain-related development resources as part of a wider technology play.  ""We're driving projects that promote financial inclusion at home and abroad, and are working to provide consumers, businesses and governments with the most innovative, safe and secure ways to pay,"" Sonya Geelon, Mastercard Ireland's country manager, said in April.

42429159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs2xh,1527793504,IMF Official: Central Banks Need to Compete With Crypto,"A deputy director for the International Monetary Fund's Monetary and Capital Markets Department believes that central banks need to offer ""better"" fiat currencies in order to fend off any potential competition from cryptocurrencies.  The suggestions came in an article published Thursday, penned by deputy director Dong He. In that article – which boasts the tagline ""Crypto assets may one day reduce demand for central bank money"" – He argues that central banks may want to consider adopting some of the concepts in order to ""forestall the competitive pressure crypto assets may exert on fiat currencies.""  It's a notable statement and one that echoes past remarks from He as well as other IMF officials, including director Christine Lagarde. Indeed, Lagarde, back in March, said during an event that regulators should deploy some elements of the tech in order to ""fight fire with fire.""  He's argument in the latest piece is based on the possibility that, should cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets see wider adoption, there is a chance that central banks will lose their ability to influence the economy through tactics such as interest rate changes.  The deputy director suggested that tightening regulation could provide a boost for central banks.  ""Second, government authorities should regulate the use of crypto assets to prevent regulatory arbitrage and any unfair competitive advantage crypto assets may derive from lighter regulation,"" He wrote. ""That means rigorously applying measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, strengthening consumer protection, and effectively taxing crypto transactions.""  He also pointed to the idea of central banks creating their own digitized assets that could be exchanged in a peer-to-peer fashion  ""For example, they could make central bank money user-friendly in the digital world by issuing digital tokens of their own to supplement physical cash and bank reserves. Such central bank digital currency could be exchanged, peer to peer in a decentralized manner, much as crypto assets are,"" the article went on to say.  It's an idea that a number of central banks are researching, though opinions differ on the effectiveness of such proposals. Just this week, for example, an official for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the region's de facto central bank) said that it currently has no plans for a digital currency launch in spite of its research in the area.

CoinDesk reported in January that state lawmakers were weighing the measure, which at the time referred to ""digital currency limited liability companies"" and contained language indicating that such businesses – effectively running on a distributed blockchain network – would pay taxes to the state in crypto. According to the text, those businesses are described as ""limited liability compan[ies] organized pursuant to this title for the purpose of operating a business that utilizes blockchain technology for a material portion of its business activities.""  The most recent version of the text, according to LegiScan, shows that the language related to taxation has been stripped out, though it still contains sections regarding the limited liability companies as well as mandates for a ""Fintech Summit"" and a follow-up study of backing up public records using the tech (an earlier review ultimately deemed the use case too costly).  Among the requirements for setting up a blockchain-based company in Vermont: applicants must ""specify whether the decentralized consensus ledger or database utilized or enabled by the BBLLC will be fully decentralized or partially decentralized and whether such ledger or database will be fully or partially public or private, including the extent of participants' access to information and read and write permissions with respect to protocols.""  Vermont governor Phil Scott signed the bill on May 30, LegiScan reveals.  The newly-signed law also calls for a study – due before January 15 of next year – into the tech's use in insurance and banking and how state officials can clear the way for such applications within the state's economy.  ""The Department of Financial Regulation shall review the potential application of blockchain technology to the provision of insurance and banking and consider areas for potential adoption and any necessary regulatory changes in Vermont,"" the text states.

42429147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLryFh,1527768031,"Watch Out Crypto Exchanges, Decentralization Is Coming","Tom Goldenberg is a senior engineer at BCG Platinion | MAYA Design and founder of Blockchain Panel NYC. The views expressed here are his own.      Cryptocurrency exchanges operate in a fluctuating industry that is bracing for change.  With changes in regulation and customer sentiment rapidly shifting, it is anybody's guess what will happen in the next two to five years.  Notably, a few big players – both centralized and custodial in nature – handle the bulk of trading volume for the $381 billion-worth of the world's crypto assets.  In general, we can classify exchanges into three groups:  Custodial exchanges  Non-custodial exchanges  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)  Of these, both custodial and non-custodial exchanges are ""centralized."" This means that orders are routed and executed by a closed, internal system. This is different from a ""decentralized"" exchange. In a decentralized exchange, smart contracts match and execute orders.  An estimated 99 percent of trading volume flows through centralized exchanges. About 73 percent of these exchanges are custodial. Custodial exchanges act as managers of their customers' crypto wallets. The most popular crypto exchanges are all custodial — Coinbase, Bitfinex, Gemini, etc.  Custodial exchanges such as Coinbase manage user assets through an internal ledger. This ledger maps each customer with the coins he or she ""owns."" Customers do not have direct access to the wallets where the exchange stores their assets. Only upon selling or transferring the assets does a user have control over them.  Concerns over custody  The most notable advantage of custodial exchanges is ease of use. A user can access any of their wallets by authenticating with a username and password. There is no need (or possibility) of securing a private key, an exercise that can prove tedious.  Yet, the centralized nature of these exchanges, along with the immature state of regulation, has provoked concerns. An estimated one out of every 16 bitcoin has been stolen. Once an attacker breaches a system and obtains the private keys to the exchange, all is lost. (Or rather, all that is not stored in ""cold storage,"" without connection to the internet. More exchanges have been making sure that a bulk of their reserves are not connected to the internet, providing an extra layer of protection).  This, in a nutshell, is what happened in the infamous Mt. Gox hack ('14), the hack of Bitfinex ('15), and the recent hack on CoinCheck ('18). Besides the long history of hacks, all exchanges face concerns over price manipulation, reflected in the recent probe by the Department of Justice.  In summary, here are the arguments for and against custodial exchanges:  Pros: Familiar interface, easy fiat-to-crypto, and better customer support  Cons: Target for hackers, high fees, and lack of privacy  The concerns over custodial exchanges have prompted many to push for the use of decentralized exchanges. Take this tweet from Vinny Lingham:  ""I'm almost certain we will see a top 25 crypto exchange fail or be shut down in the coming months. This will be the catalyst for the emergence of decentralized exchanges and this is a key theme I'm expecting in 2018.""  Non-custodial exchanges  A non-custodial exchange is still centralized, but with a critical difference. It does not manage users' wallets. Instead, it matches orders through an internal order book and takes a fee off of the top.  One of the most popular non-custodial exchanges is ShapeShift, founded by Eric Voorhees. As per Voorhees, the company averages $10 to $15 million in transaction volume and roughly 15,000 orders daily.  Non-custodial exchanges like ShapeShift, Evercoin, and Changelly offer users more security and privacy. But, they do not offer conversion from fiat currency to crypto. This has prompted several efforts to peg a cryptocurrency to the dollar.  Because non-custodial exchanges are still centralized, their internal mechanics are not transparent. One could argue that there is still the possibility for foul play. Additionally, non-custodial exchanges suffer from low liquidity, scaring away sophisticated investors.  Decentralized exchanges  This takes us to the state of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Many in the crypto community are rooting for these to succeed.  ""99% of cryptocurrency transactions still go through centralized exchanges; this trend is expected to be reversed in the coming years."" — Nathan Sexter, Consensys  After all, part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies is the idea of a decentralized internet — a platform where no single party controls the data. In that case, why do centralized platforms control the exchange of crypto assets? This is often referred to as a ""dogfooding"" problem, or not practicing what you preach.  There are several operating DEXs matching and executing orders via smart contracts.  The Waves DEX, for example, is currently handling about $6 million of daily trading volume. Others are still in the development or testing phases.  The chart below tracks fundraising by some of the players in the space, including companies like 0x, which is building a protocol for DEXs:  On paper, DEXs are a perfect solution for the concerns raised by centralized exchanges. They are fee-light or fee-less; they are transparent since the code can be inspected; they are more secure since you control your wallets.    But there are downsides to DEXs in their current state as well. Several of these mirror the challenges of non-custodial exchanges:    Inability to convert between fiat currency and crypto  Low liquidity  Less interoperability than non-custodial exchanges. Inter-chain trading (i.e. BTC to ETH) makes up 98% of all cryptocurrency trading, as per coinmarketcap.com, 2018. This doesn't bode well for DEX's which depend on a single chain for trading.  Let's not forget that smart contracts are hackable, too. Take this quote from Jacob Woods:  ""Although trusting a third party isn't necessary, a lot of faith is put on the smart contract itself. Money can and has been stolen from decentralized exchanges despite the fact that many community members considered them unhackable.""  Hybrid exchanges  There is a general consensus in the crypto community that DEXs will take on a more prominent role. Even Coinbase's head of communications, Megan Hernbroth, has this to say:  ""Decentralized exchanges are complementary to and important for the development of the ecosystem by acting as a middle ground.""  It is also widely accepted that custodial exchanges have a role to play in crypto's future. Eric Voorhees contends that for many people, custodial firms are more convenient.  ""I expect the banks of the future to look a lot like Coinbase, and I say that as a compliment to Coinbase. Crypto gives everyone the option to hold their own money, which is great, but that doesn't mean everyone should, nor that everyone will want to.""  There are also those who believe that the future of crypto will contain a hybrid of centralized and decentralized services.  Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, argues that allowing centralized exchanges to do what they are good at — support, compliance, and banking — while moving private keys back into the hands of customers, would ""drive value for [the] entire industry.""  It seems inevitable that DEXs will continue to rise in popularity, but doubtful that they match the scale of custodial exchanges anytime soon. If customer awareness of privacy and security continues to grow, we may witness more custodial exchanges offering hybrid solutions as well.  With regulatory uncertainty looming over the industry, incumbents should not feel too comfortable at the top.

The repeated failure to beat the moving average hurdle ended in a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and led to a convincing move above the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over 24 hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance located at $7,870.  4-hour chart  The recovery from $7,270 to $7,570 has established a higher low (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence.  Hence, BTC could test supply around $7,870 – resistance of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high.  It also means the cryptocurrency will likely peep above the all-important 50-week MA, currently located at $7,711. However, only a weekly close (Sunday's close as per UTC) above that level would signal bearish invalidation.  Weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of the long-term bull run.  Despite the bullish set up, there is merit in being cautious as the major moving averages – 50, 100 and 200 – on the 4-hour chart are also biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA.  View  Bitcoin will likely soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) in the next 24 hours. A high-volume break above that level would allow a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently located at $8,522.  Bearish scenario: The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, so a drop to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the price drops below $7,270 in the next 24 hours.

42429140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLry7h,1527757257,Stock Trading App Removes Crypto Price Tracking After Debut,"A popular Chinese mobile stock trading app appears to have removed its cryptocurrency price tracking feature just two weeks after the new service went live – possibly due to regulatory rumblings in the country.  Reports first emerged on May 17 that the app – called Tong Huashun (or ""Straight Flush"" in literal translation) – had added the crypto-asset price tracking feature in its iOS version. The service offered a real-time price index for major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, XRP and litecoin, though did not provide in-app crypto trading.  According to the company's 2017 financial statement filed with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Tong Huashun reported 11 million daily active users on its free mobile stock trading app.  Currently, however, searching for the feature inside the application leads to a page that indicates the service does not exist.  Meanwhile it remains unclear what has led to the change. At press time, representatives from the company have yet to respond to CoinDesk's request for comment on the reasons for the change.  However, the news comes after municipal-level government mouthpiece Beijing News called the application's crypto tracking service ""questionable"" and ""walking a thin line.""  Citing a legal expert from the Bank of China, the report on May 17 said that, although the offering may not fall under the existing scope of China's ban on token trading, it should be noted that the ban is not exclusive and could be extended to China-based platforms that merely provide data on cryptocurrency prices.

42429131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrxth,1527753620,Disillusioned Token Investors Demand Real Talk About Risk,"ICOs, I don't see results.  That's the growing complaint among investors who are passionate about blockchain technology but frustrated with a lack of tangible progress on professional risk management strategies across major token projects.  ""A lot of the projects that raise money, they're not really reporting what they are spending it on,"" said Meltem Demirors, founder of Athena Capital and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares. ""I don't think you can responsibly talk about investing without talking about risk management.""  While Demirors might sound particularly critical, her thoughts align with other investors in the space who have been grumbling about the management of companies and teams that raise funds from initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Yet this disillusionment hasn't slowed the race to get involved, with more than $6.3 billion raised through ICOs during the first quarter of 2018 alone – a sum which already surpasses the total raised by token sales in 2017.  Against that backdrop, veteran cryptocurrency investors are questioning whether many of these tokens actually add value compared to, say, traditional venture capital.  ""What I worry about is, we still need to work out governance models with tokens,"" said Jalak Jobanputra, founder of Future\Perfect Ventures. When she can't tell what ownership, rights or utility the tokens represent, she would just rather stay safe with equity.  She said:  ""We know equity works. It's a proven model with governance.""  Progress reports  As Jobanputra pointed out, few projects that raised money in 2017 have proven the real value of their tokens by launching usable platforms. ""I want to see them [token sale projects] start shipping products,"" she said.  While that might sound like a big ask at this stage – after all, the industry is building infrastructure for a new digital economy, a long-term endeavor – investors like Jobanputra would at least like progress reports.  ""The projects we've invested in have reporting on par with startups I invest in, which [means] monthly updates on tech, team, [business development] and market progress,"" she said. ""Successful founders have found that it is also a great way to enlist the collective investor network for help.""  But this is all too rare, Jobanputra said.  ""I'd like to see more reports to follow up on who is building products,"" she said. ""How is this being applied to brick-and-mortar businesses?""  According to Demirors, self-reporting could help reduce trepidation and uncertainty among token holders. There are already standards for reporting and evaluating performance in the context of equity financing. The token economy needs similar processes to soothe not only investors, but also regulators who have been increasingly looking askance at the industry.  ""If you're exposed to these networks and assets, how are you tracking that? How are you putting those assets on your balance sheet? Do you mark to market, to cost? What are the implications for tax?"" Demirors asked. ""These things have profound implications for the success of these projects and also the way regulators view this space.""  Indeed, emerging platforms like the Brooklyn Project at ConsenSys and Messari, a startup founded by former CoinDesk CEO Ryan Selkis, are introducing much-desired crypto asset databases with information about token projects' resources and progress.  Risk management  Another source of investor frustration is issuers' fixation on raising capital, which is merely one small step on the road to launching a new blockchain network, product or service.  ""Everyone is so myopically focused on creating tokens and doing the ICO. They don't think about what happens post-ICO,"" said Demirors, who spearheads the new treasury management service at CoinShares. ""A developer or engineer is not a hedge fund manager. They are not thinking about how to manage that money.""  That's why Demirors, in her capacity as head of CoinShares unit CS Treasury, is working with startup clients, plus nonprofits like the Zcash Foundation that accept cryptocurrency donations, to manage budgets in a compliant manner while accounting for a decade or two of expenses on the horizon.  There's also a tricky balancing act. Investors want to make sure entrepreneurs are committed, so they may demand a lockup of tokens held in reserve.  But regardless of any single founder's personal holdings, token projects need to pay for salaries, taxes, legal fees, and a slew of other operating costs, so the funds need to have some liquidity. Knowing how to balance fiat funds with both long and short-term cryptocurrency holdings is crucial to the success of a company, Demirors said.  Because quite frankly, investors still want a payoff regardless of timeframe or philosophical alignment with the project.  Jobanputra said:  ""Whether it is a token or an equity deal, I look at what is the potential for that 10X return?""  If the tokens are basically reduced to a digitized equity club membership, with investors buying equity in order to get discounted tokens for a quick flip, that defeats the whole point. Tokens need to be valued for their own sake, like equity, according to Jobanputra.  When the music stops  In addition to greater transparency and discipline, investors want frank conversations about the fact that the current surge in cryptocurrency markets won't last forever.  ""It looks like there's growth, but it's really just a lot of fancy financial engineering,"" Demirors said, describing a recycling of capital throughout the community.  For example, she pointed to Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in the Silicon Valley fintech company Ripple, which owns vast amounts of the XRP cryptocurrency.  ""Ripple took some of that XRP and gave it back to Blockchain Capital. Blockchain Capital then turns around and invests it in Coinbase,"" Demirors said. ""Coinbase now created a venture fund investing in startups Blockchain Capital is also investing in, who are then turning around and investing in startups with ICOs.""  In Demirors' interpretation, such patterns suggest the industry isn't making as much money or attracting as much investment as the numbers might suggest. Rather, she said:  ""It's just a circular maelstrom of money.""  None of this is to say she's become bearish on tokens. Quite the opposite. Like many investors, Demirors demands high standards because she wants token projects to succeed.  ""I'm very optimistic and obviously I love this technology or I wouldn't spend all my time on it,"" Demirors said, concluding:  ""But I do think we have to be realistic and honest with ourselves if this is going to succeed. The way things are going now, I really worry about sustainability.""

During a council meeting with legislators in Hong Kong, Joseph Chan, acting secretary for financial services and the treasury, said the HKMA's research on the topic had led to a belief that a CBDC would be less useful in Hong Kong compared to other jurisdictions.  Chan told the legislators:  ""The HKMA has carried out research on CBDC. At the same time, the HKMA notes that the benefits of CBDC and its efficiency gains will depend on the actual circumstances of a jurisdiction. In the context of Hong Kong, the already efficient payment infrastructure and services make CBDC a less attractive proposition. The HKMA has no plan to issue CBDC at this stage but will continue to monitor the international development.""  A representative from the HKMA also confirmed the acting secretary's statement, but did not disclose further details on the agency's research on the issue.  Yet Chan's response marks a notable update on the HKMA's explorations of a CBDC prototype as part of its wider effort to gauge the potential of distributed ledger technology.  In April of last year, the HKMA first revealed, in a response to legislators, that the banking authority has started ""research and a proof-of-concept work on central bank digital currency.""  The HKMA said at the time that the first phase of the study would expect to be done by the end of 2017, based on which the authority would decide on the appropriate action forward.  The latest remarks came as a response to a question raised by legislator Denis Kwok on May 18.

42429137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLry1h,1527739259,Crypto's War On Miners? It Might Already Be Over,"Brick 'em? Maybe not anymore.  What was once a phrase that echoed across message boards, one that defined an aggressive shift in sentiment against the companies that today make hardware required to run cryptocurrency software, is falling out a fashion as the so-called 'War on Miners' enters a less decisive period.  Indeed, in the wake of new research and analysis, leading developers now appear to believe that standing in the way of a shifting mining landscape might be hopeless. At least, that was the testimony of many blockchain software developers at Consensus 2018, who indicated that hardware manufacturer Bitmain's recent distribution of high-performance ASIC miners is proof of their inevitability for all cryptocurrencies.  Still, controversy surrounding the idea optimized mining hardware will soon be available for previously ASIC-resistant cryptocurrencies (including ethereum, monero and zcash) has continued to escalate.  Because the chips force more general-purpose mining hardware, such as graphic cards or GPUs, out of the market, each cryptocurrency has witnessed efforts to enact software changes so the hardware can no longer operate. Monero, the 13th largest cryptocurrency, for example, has committed to changing its underlying algorithm.  Driving the defense is the ideological belief that lacking sufficient competitors, ASIC manufacturer Bitmain commands too substantial a portion of the network share, a market reality that threatens to undermine the open, decentralized participation that cryptocurrencies strive for.  ""You have centralization of manufacturers and you also have centralization of consumers. You have this sort of constant clustering,"" Riccardo ""fluffypony"" Spagni, a lead developer at monero, told CoinDesk.  For now, monero is willing to go it alone, with regular anti-ASIC updates that aim to keep ASIC hardware off the network until such time that ASICs become ubiquitous, like USB drives, so that they can be run by a wider pool of participants.  ""Ultimately ASIC resistance is futile but between now and then, before we capitulate to ASICs, let's resist it for as long as possible until ASICs are commoditized,"" Spagni told CoinDesk.  However, given the financial incentives at play – optimized hardware can quickly dominate a network, and swallow the rewards in exchange for the increased hashpower – others warned that ASIC manufacturers will always be a step ahead.  David Vorick, lead developer of siacoin and founder of ASIC manufacturer Obelisk, told CoinDesk:  ""I think any GPU-mined coin is going to become an ASIC-mined coin at some point. Bitmain has been pretty methodical about demonstrating this.""  The firehose of money  Put differently, this means that crypto developers believe that innovations in the development of mining chips will continue to increase at a comparable pace as decisions designed to mitigate them.  What's different now, though, is that there is new anecdotal and statistical evidence to back this up. According to Vorick's estimations, which have now been widely circulated, ASIC manufacturers move faster than anti-ASIC code.  On top of that, Vorick argues that software developers have underestimated the flexibility of hardware.  ""At this point there's no single ASIC resistance algorithm that our chip devs have looked at and said they couldn't do,"" Vorick said.  Written by a software developer who tried to start a mining business, these words carried weight.  Speaking to CoinDesk, founder of zcash and CEO of the Zcash Company Zooko Wilcox echoed these points, noting how the work has impacted his own thoughts on the subject. Ultimately, he now believes that ASICs will continue, simply because the economics of beating the competition in crypto mining are so favorable to those who do it.  ""Literally for zcash, I wouldn't be surprised if you can launch a project, take according to Vorick's estimates, three or four months to get it deployed and in 48 hours you would make more money than you spent,"" Wilcox told CoinDesk.  Although a significant portion of the zcash community have spoken out against the hardware, Wilcox has said he has no intention to disrupt the current development cycle in order to implement anti-ASIC code.  While Wilcox has several reasons for taking this stance – primarily so as not to interfere with an upcoming upgrade – he added that ASIC resistance is liable to manipulation, simply due to the high incentives at play.  ""It's kind of like you're holding a firehose of money and you're saying I'm just going to wiggle this around in random directions, spray money at random recipients, and it's enough money that this is going to focus all the attention on you, and people are going to try and influence and ask you to justify which direction you're pointing the firehose of money,"" Wilcox said.  He added:  ""I definitely don't want to be in that position.""  Two industries at odds  And even if software developers keep up the fight, Vorick warned of something he calls the ""secret ASIC.""  The idea is that savvy manufacturers might even build mining chip innovations in secret, and rather than release them to the market, keep them to themselves to game the rewards.  ""I think it's safe to assume that every proof-of-work coin with a block reward of more than $20 million in the past year has at least one group of secret ASICs currently mining on it, or will have secret ASICs mining on it within a few months,"" Vorick wrote in a blog post.  Bitmain itself was quick to dismiss Vorick's writings as ""conspiracy theory,"" but Vorick's position is reinforced by his own foray into ASIC manufacturing. Last year, Obelisk began building its own siacoin ASIC – one that contained a secret switch to force away any competitors – but was beaten to market by Bitmain.  According to Vorick, these kinds of tricks are typical.  ""It's because its a zero sum game. For mining in particular, if your proponent is better then you just naturally lose money,"" he told CoinDesk.  Wilcox echoed this, stating that the secrecy trickles down, such that mining pools refuse to share data, and the remaining community can no longer analyze the network.  ""It's an interesting juxtaposition in cryptocurrency world,"" Wilcox told CoinDesk, ""the development process and the developers social environment is maximally open, but the mining environment is very secretive.""  Going forward, Vorick said that software developers will try to control the mining landscape through strategically partnering with hardware suppliers in the early stages of development.  Projects could share their code with ASIC manufacturers from the beginning, in exchange for some promises in return, such that ASICs would be fairly distributed, and a cryptocurrency's community gets first pick.  He told CoinDesk:  ""So that takes Bitmain's big advantage, which is that they're always first to market with everything, and takes that away from them.""  Future facing  But there are signs that Bitmain is moving in a cooperative direction as well.  For example, Wilcox shared notes from a video call with CEO of the company, Jihan Wu, to discuss communication difficulties facing the respective groups. According to Wilcox, Wu said individuals had been exploiting the communication gap to foster mistrust surrounding the company.  ""We have never been doing a stealth mining strategy,"" Wu reportedly stated.  Following the meeting, Bitmain published a blog post published on Friday, stating it would be exploring an exercise in ""radical transparency"" when it came to the shipment of zcash ASICs.  In order for the zcash community to prepare for the increased hashrate, the company said, it would live-tweet when the hardware is being shipped, as well as the time of the purchases.  Speaking to CoinDesk, PR representative for Bitmain Nishant Sharma said the company is making an effort to interact with software communities. ""You may have noticed that our communications have steadily become more proactive and responsive over the last few months. We expect this to continue,"" Sharma said.  Further research from software developers into the hardware landscape might help the situation as well.  For example, while the zcash company has no intention to move away from the ASICs, the Zcash Foundation is embarking on anti-ASIC research, as well trying to better determine the breakdown of the mining network.  Going forward, Wilcox said it's possible the cryptocurrency will support both GPU and ASIC mining on separate networks.  Wilcox told CoinDesk:  ""There's no reason why a blockchain fork into two mutually incompatible technologies has to become a social schism into mutually antagonistic communities. Instead, you can have one community and the people in it use both technologies.""
