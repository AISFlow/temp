42411615,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4eN,1640044320,Inside the DeFi Vending Machine,"Imagine the public astonishment when, in the early 1920s, vending machines started dispensing soda into cups. Instead of going to the counter of a soda shop and ordering their favorite drink, thirsty customers could now use coins, push some buttons and, voilá, out came the beverage.  As Nick Szabo quipped almost 25 years ago, these revolutionary automated machines can be seen as the ancestors of the applications and smart contracts now running on the Ethereum blockchain and enabling the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi. In this sense, DeFi is like a full-line vending space where several automated machines, now digital, can be used to dispense not soda but financial services and products.  Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.  The automated machine interface, the display used to make choices and payments, appears in DeFi Land as applications that can be used from your phone or computer. Behind the scenes, smart contracts take the place of motors and mechanical arms, providing the protocols that make the applications work properly. To operate the DeFi automated machines you have to use stablecoins and cryptocurrencies as tokens, not dollar coins or bills, because traditional money only circulates off-chain (out of the blockchain).  Let’s say you want to buy a $5,000 non-fungible token (NFT) that you believe will increase in value, but you don’t have enough money now to make the purchase. You need three more weeks, when you’ll receive your salary. A three-week loan of a couple of thousand dollars isn’t something many banks would be willing to do because the transaction costs would be too high. You could get a cash advance from your credit card but, again, high costs could be a limitation since you’d be subject to a 25% APR.  Read more: The Real Trouble With Cross-Border Payments - Marcelo Prates  You could go instead to one of the vending machines in DeFi Land and use some of the stablecoins and NFTs you already have as collateral to choose a crypto loan that best fits your needs. The amount borrowed would then be immediately dispensed to your digital wallet and, in three weeks, automatically pulled out of the same digital wallet, plus interest, all set up by the digital vending machine of your choosing.  DeFi thus offers tailored solutions for financial needs through applications and smart contracts that are readily available 24/7 for anyone who holds stablecoins or crypto that can make them work. More than that, as these smart contracts are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain as open and decentralized protocols, they can be reorganized, repackaged and rebuilt as a new smart contract.  It would be similar to having free access to any vending machine placed in a large retail store. A person could come and add cereal and chocolate bars to some of the open slots of a soda vending machine. Another could make changes for the vending machine to take credit cards besides dollar coins and bills. All the people who invested in improving the original soda vending machine would receive some compensation as the added features lead to more sales.  And, to avoid someone taking advantage of the unlocked vending machine to steal all its products or the sale’ proceeds, the open vending machines would be placed in a public area with their inner parts protected by tamper-proof seals and tags. You could make changes to add features and improve functionalities but not to damage the machines or hamper their regular workings.  In the DeFi environment, the open and decentralized infrastructure provided by the Ethereum blockchain combined with its cryptographic protection makes it harder for bad actors to corrupt or hack the smart contracts that power the applications. The open-source governance allows all network participants to easily verify whether a smart contract is correctly functioning and executing its automated operations and agreements. Transparency, cryptography and broad collaboration are, thus, used to improve security and resilience.  In light of its features, DeFi creates a borderless financial system from the ground up. At the infrastructural level, old rails controlled by a singular institution are substituted by a decentralized ledger running on hundreds of thousands of computers. At the institutional level, banks, financial institutions and even fintech firms with strong national ties are replaced by automated machines widely accessible. At the transactional level, sovereign currencies are superseded by stablecoins and native cryptocurrencies.  DeFi opens up a world of financial possibilities for those with access to stablecoins and cryptocurrencies regardless of their identity, nationality or location. The downside, for now, is that DeFi can be expensive for retail users. The fees for using the Ethereum blockchain, aka “gas fees,” can exceed $300 per transaction, no matter if you’re a so-called whale making a million-dollar investment or just trying to convert $100 worth of stablecoins into ether or another cryptocurrency.  The problem happens because the Ethereum blockchain cannot keep up with the increased demand for block space. It’s as if the success of the full-line vending area became so overwhelming, with hordes of new vending machines and customers arriving each day, that it would suddenly be too small to accommodate everybody. Because the physical space cannot be easily or quickly expanded without compromising its security, the alternative is to increase the cost to use the machines.  DeFi also creates challenges for regulators, who have trouble dealing with anything that isn’t connected to a jurisdiction. Once sovereign money is exchanged for stablecoins or crypto, regulators lose much of their control over what happens next. They can still track the movements happening on the blockchain and the history of all transactions, although with no immediate access to the identities behind each digital wallet and public key.  And even when regulators can identify who is making the transaction, it may be hard to establish whether they can do something because the transaction happens in a depersonalized platform and involves entities and money from different jurisdictions. International collaboration may be easier to achieve when it comes to preventing criminal activities, like money laundering and terrorism financing. But for typical regulatory considerations, like licensing or supervision, cooperation and coordination among different jurisdictions may be more difficult to attain.  Should these DeFi limitations concern regulators? As long as fraudulent and criminal activities can be averted and prosecuted, regulators should let DeFi run its course. The degree of transparency and auditability afforded by the Ethereum blockchain and the high level of education and resources of its typical participants play against direct regulatory intervention in DeFi.  Self-regulation through smart contracts should be the first line of defense. The same ingenuity used to build the DeFi space could be devoted to spreading essential information, creating basic contractual protections, and curbing abusive behavior. The choices made by the DeFi community will, therefore, be crucial for its future. DeFi can either grow as a reliable financial alternative for all or crystalize into a casino for the rich.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | WALLET,Marcelo M.

42424026,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpBh,1640044125,"Do Kwon, Terra Claim SEC Violated Procedure in Ongoing Legal Fight","Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, are challenging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claiming the regulator improperly served Kwon subpoenas at Mainnet 2021 despite not having jurisdiction over Kwon or his company. They have asked a New York court to dismiss the subpoenas.  Terraform filed a motion last Friday opposing an SEC effort to compel Kwon and Terraform Labs to cooperate with subpoenas issued in the SEC’s ongoing investigation of Terra’s Mirror Protocol. The SEC filed its motion last month after Terraform and Kwon sued the agency on claims that it violated its own rules and the Due Process clause of the U.S. Constitution in serving Kwon in September.  Because the SEC’s lawyers did not get permission from the Commissioners to subpoena Kwon – which must be done in cases where the subpoenaed party is represented by lawyers – Kwon’s attorneys say he was improperly served, rendering the subpoenas invalid.  The Mirror Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to create and trade “mirrored assets,” or mAssets, that “mirror” the price of stocks – including major stocks traded on U.S. exchanges. It was launched last December.  On May 7, less than five months after the launch of the Mirror Protocol, the SEC opened an investigation to determine whether Terraform Labs was in violation of federal securities laws by allowing synthetic stocks to be minted and sold on its platform.  The SEC’s investigation of the Mirror Protocol is just one in a sea of similar investigations the U.S. regulator is conducting against crypto companies in an attempt to sniff out scams and regulate the booming crypto industry. The lack of regulatory clarity has been an issue for both crypto companies, which struggle to know what the rules are and what they can do legally, and regulators, such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that are in the midst of a power struggle for control over the regulation of the industry.  Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the SEC has expanded its crypto regulation efforts. But with thousands of projects, the regulatory body has focused its efforts on major players like Coinbase. The Mirror Protocol’s fast growth – documents filed by the SEC state the mAssets have a total value of $437 million and the protocol’s governance token has a market capitalization of $407 million – puts Terraform Labs squarely in the SEC’s crosshairs as a major crypto project.  But because Terraform Labs – which was incorporated in Singapore and has offices in both Singapore and South Korea – is not an American company and Do Kwon – a South Korean national who lives in Singapore – is not an American citizen, the SEC’s jurisdiction in its investigation was limited, according to Terraform’s filings.  In late May, two weeks after opening their investigation, lawyers for the SEC contacted Kwon via email to inform him of the investigation of Mirror Protocol and asked him for his voluntary cooperation. Kwon agreed and hired U.S-based lawyers with Denton LLC, a large global law firm, to represent him.  According to Kwon’s attorneys, between May and September Kwon and Terraform voluntarily cooperated with the SEC, including participating in a five-hour video interview on July 8 where Kwon was asked to provide details about the Mirror Protocol’s creation and structure, as well as his personal ownership of any mAssets or MIR tokens, the protocol’s governance token. Through his attorneys, Kwon also produced documents requested by the SEC.  On Sept. 15, Kwon’s lawyers say they were told by the SEC that, despite the SEC finding no conclusive evidence of any violations of U.S. securities laws, the investigation could only be resolved through an enforcement action.  On Sept. 17, lawyers for the SEC issued and signed two subpoenas – one for Kwon and one for Terraform Labs – which were then served to Kwon on September 20, as he was about to participate in a panel discussion at Messari’s Mainnet 2021 conference in New York.  Despite rampant speculation on crypto Twitter, Kwon told the Defiant that he had not been served by the SEC at Mainnet. He later told CoinDesk that the lie was unintentional, claiming that he didn’t know what had happened until later that day.  “Somebody handed me, like, a packet of paper right before I had to go on stage,” Kwon told CoinDesk. “After speaking at the conference … the stuff out on Twitter and people talking about people getting served – that’s when we realized the SEC gave us a packet of paper that was supposed to mean something.”  On Oct. 22, Kwon and Terraform Labs filed a civil lawsuit in New York against the SEC – a highly unusual move, as suits against the SEC are rare – alleging the SEC improperly served the two Sept. 20 subpoenas. It also claims that the SEC does not have proper jurisdiction over either Kwon or Terraform Labs, and asked the court to quash the subpoenas and end the investigation.  Read More: Terra’s Do Kwon Was Served by SEC, New Lawsuit Shows  In response, the SEC filed a separate application in the same court (the Southern District of New York) on Nov. 12, asking the court to compel Kwon and Terraform Labs to comply with the subpoenas, which demand the production of documents and Kwon’s appearance to testify in-person at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.  In its application, the SEC denied that it improperly served the subpoenas. It also claims that it has rightful jurisdiction to serve the subpoenas – jurisdiction over Kwon because he entered the United States and was served in person at Mainnet, and jurisdiction over Terraform Labs because it allows U.S-based customers to trade on its platform.  On Dec. 17, over a month after the SEC’s application was filed, Kwon and Terraform Labs’ lawyers responded, denying the SEC’s claims that the subpoenas were properly served and asking the court to dismiss them outright.  The SEC has until Friday, Dec. 24, to respond to Kwon’s motion of opposition. Separately, the SEC must respond to Kwon and Terraform Labs’ civil suit by Dec. 27",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/20/do-kwon-terra-claim-sec-violated-procedure-in-ongoing-legal-fight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66a065c348d0ed391405e8ff4b3cded139f35c36-1177x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424029,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpNh,1640043000,First Mover Asia: Cryptos Inch Downward in Light Trading,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin, ether moved little on Monday, as markets expect “very choppy” price moves towards the year end. Terra (LUNA) continued its impressive gains since last week.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a hiatus today. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing a column by Joon Ian Wong, the founding co-president of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers and a former CoinDesk reporter.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,838 -0.6%  Ether (ETH): $3,918 -1%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,568 -1.1%  DJIA: $34,932 -1.2%  Nasdaq: $14,980 -1.2%  Gold: $1,789 -0.6%  Market moves  The crypto market slowly recovered some losses from a dip that occurred during Asian hours, although at the time of publication, most of the leading cryptocurrencies were down over the past 24 hours. At the time of publication, bitcoin was changing hands under $47,000, down slightly. Ether was also in the red.  “Bitcoin has seen short-term momentum neutralize as it consolidates above initial support near $44,200,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, wrote in her weekly newsletter on Monday. “An improved daily MACD [moving average convergence divergence] and short-term oversold conditions suggest bitcoin could see stabilization around initial support in the days ahead.”  In her technical analysis, Stockton also highlighted that bitcoin still faces downside pressure in the intermediate term, as the charts suggested that the oldest cryptocurrency is “not yet oversold.”  At the same time, bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges remained low on Monday, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.  “Falling trading volumes could complicate what price action happens with Bitcoin,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, The Americas, wrote in his daily market update, noting bitcoin’s price could be “very choppy” in the next few weeks. “Many investors remain long-term bullish and the uncertainty over the potential short-term pain has many traders waiting until bitcoin dips towards the $40,000 level.”  On the alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin), LUNA, the native token of Terra blockchain, continued its rally since last week, logging a new all-time high at over $82, according to Messari. Data from Defi Llama showed that the total value locked, or the dollar value of all the tokens locked in the smart contract built on a blockchain, on Terra had surpassed that on Binance Smart Chain, as of Monday. Shiba inu was up over 5% over the past 24 hours.  Column  The Future of NFTs Is Fungible: The many NFT communities that have sprung up this year are finding that it’s not so easy to manage a community with unique tokens alone.(by Joon Ian Wong, the founding co-president of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers.)  “Wen token?”  It’s the refrain heard in Discord servers around the world. When is such-and-such project going to airdrop a token to its community members? This question is particularly urgent if a community happens to assemble around a $2 billion NFT project – one like Bored Ape Yacht Club. That’s why BAYC had an answer to the question in October:  As the Bored Ape holders have discovered, it’s super cool to launch a non-fungible token collection and see a community develop around it. But at some point it gets difficult to herd all the cats – especially if said cats are also very rich people. What if there were some way to coordinate them and align their interests? What if you could do all of this on-chain? With a cryptographic token perhaps?  This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  This is why the future of non-fungible tokens is fungible. The many NFT communities that have sprung up this year are finding that it’s not so easy to manage a community with unique tokens alone. Fungible tokens created by the community start to become very attractive in theory. Luckily for them, this concept already exists: it’s the world of social tokens – streams of community-centric tokens that are, yes, fungible.  The non-fungible argument  Social tokens have been ably covered in the pages of this fine website for some time. Here’s a great Jeff Wilser feature that dives deep into the genre. But here’s a quick summary of how they’re supposed to work: Suppose you spot a promising young artist from among the selection presented to you by Spotify’s algorithm. You stream their music thousands of times over the years, gradually attending concerts and buying merch. Eventually, the artist breaks through to the mainstream and is picking up Grammys left and right, and appearing on “Saturday Night Live.”  The above example might be called the “Taylor Swift Hypothesis” of social tokens. The way the hypothesis works is, imagine injecting a token into the scenario above. What if that artist is Taylor Swift, and what if she has issued $SWIFT in the earliest days of your fandom. You might have accumulated lots of $SWIFT, watching the stash grow in fiat money terms as Taylor ascended the heights of pop stardom. The Swift Hypothesis is described in the Index Ventures investor Rex Woodbury’s recent think piece on social tokens in The Atlantic.  But let’s look at why some NFT believers think fungible tokens for communities don’t work. Here’s GMoney, the cutesy, pixelated, half-man, half-monkey NFT collector making his argument: A stash of tokens is first held by a creator who distributes the tokens to fans. As the creator creates more valuable work, those tokens rise in price. But to realize those gains, the creator must continuously sell the tokens to fans. This leaves creators with a diminishing horde of tokens, thus disincentivizing them to increase the value of their work.  “Your incentives are misaligned,” GMoney says.  That’s the catch: Taylor would have been dumping $SWIFT on her fans all the way to the top. Her most loyal fans would have been her exit liquidity, to adopt the parlance of Crypto Twitter. The Swift Hypothesis would become the Swift Pump and Dump if that was the only way social tokens worked.  And GMoney isn’t alone among the cryptorati casting doubt on social tokens. Here’s Simon de la Rouviere, one of the authors of the ERC-721 standard, positing that NFTs are, in fact, better social tokens!  The social tokens rebuttal  This is as good a place as any to mention that I have a vested interest in social tokens working. I’m an adviser at Rally, which helps esports streamers, musicians and creators of all stripes issue their own tokens to fans. I’m also a contributor and investor in Seed Club, an accelerator for social token projects.  As we know in crypto, misaligned incentives is one of the most damning charges that can be leveled at a project. So I turned to Jess Sloss, the person who started Seed Club and who stays at the cutting edge of social tokens, for a robust rebuttal to GMoney’s monkey business.  “Social tokens are better equity,” Sloss tells me. Dear reader, before you start dialing the Securities and Exchange Commission hotline for unregistered securities offerings, this is what he really meant by that: Fungible tokens for a community are more expressive than NFTs. While NFTs might be good at capital raising and formation, they are less good at keeping a community going. This is where social tokens come in.  “What many of these communities haven’t thought through is how to sustain [them] into the future?” Sloss says. “Ultimately, we need to be able to reward more nuanced collaboration and represent that in the governance stack.”  For instance, a community might need to pay core members for development or editorial work. It might need to raise new funding without diluting existing creative work. It might also need a way to vote on stuff.  Here’s how Sloss frames it, using the startup as a metaphor: “If a creator has a community of fans looking to create something bigger and more broad than the work of that creator, then a fungible token makes a lot of sense.  See also: Missed the ENS Airdrop? | Opinion  “Essentially, you have a bank account and a cap table. The fungible token represents that cap table that you can use to pay people, sell for investment [and] reward people for the work they do in that community. All those things are very hard to do with an NFT unless you’re minting new NFTs and giving them away, or you’re holding bags of NFTs ... You’re going to get stuck at some point.”  Bored Apes could be a glimpse into the future of an NFT community that gets coordinated around a new, fungible, token. SquiggleDAO, which Sloss works on, is another example: a collector DAO for generative art and Chromie Squiggles in particular, its $SQUIG token lets holders vote on how they use the DAO’s resources, which includes $8 million in USDC it raised from selling $SQUIG to big investors.  The fun in fungible  What else can you do with a social token? Sloss corrects me: The term of art now is community tokens or community DAOs. He says he’s seeing a surge of interest in founders of Web 2 companies exploring how to disperse ownership of their firms to communities using a DAO as he sifts through applications for Seed Club’s fourth cohort (the third cohort had Pussy Riot and other notables). “They’re recognizing they’re building on a tech stack that will be quickly outdated and will have a tough time competing with a Web 3 version of their product,” he said. “There’s an explosion of DAOs being created right now.”  The hottest use cases, Sloss says, are DAOs that aid learning, particularly learning about Web 3. He name DAO Masters, Web3 baddies (“welcome to the hot girl metaverse”) and the Crypto, Culture and Society DAO as prime examples. He’s also bullish on a token from the industry newsletter Water and Music that incentivizes research on music and technology among its subscribers.  “I think longevity is going to come into the operations,” Sloss says. “It’s like, let’s go out and buy the Constitution … then what? The ‘then what’ is the exciting part.”  Important events  2 a.m. HGT/SGT (10 a.m. UTC): New Zealand credit card spending (Nov. YoY)  6 p.m. HGT/SGT (10 a.m. UTC): Italy Producer price index (Nov.

42424046,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jplh,1640034550,Market Wrap Year-End Review: Bitcoin Starts Off in a Frenzy,"Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In our first episode today, we show how, even as bitcoin’s price soared in the early days of the year, some savvy institutional investors were already growing cautious on cryptocurrencies after a wave of buying during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Bitcoin (BTC) started 2021 on a strong note, gaining nearly 40% during the first week of January and surging to a new all-time high around $40,000.  But not everyone was convinced the rally could be sustained.  Retail traders piled in, while some institutional investors started to raise concerns about rampant speculation.  As early as December, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm Arca, had told CoinDesk that “there is a good chance that actively managed hedge funds and passive indexes built around high allocations to bitcoin have a very short shelf life.”  Indeed, a few funds established bitcoin positions but did not ”hold on for dear life” – a commonly misconstrued back-formation of the crypto-jargon term “HODL,” which originally appeared as a fast-typing (or maybe drunk?) person’s attempt to type the world “hold.”  Bitcoin quickly advanced from $30,000 to $40,000 within the first five trading days of January – an impressive gain that fueled even more market excitement. The sharp price rise in BTC contributed to a $1.1 billion profit for Ruffer Investments, a U.K. based investment management firm, in just five months. By June, Ruffer stated that a “speculative frenzy” in cryptocurrencies forced the firm to exit its bets on further gains.  And Ruffer was not alone in its concern about market exuberance. Volatile price swings caused other institutional investors to doubt a prolonged crypto rally.  Sure enough, by the end of January, bitcoin had declined about 30% from a January high of near $40,000. Shortly after the price drop, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the Guggenheim global investment firm, said he didn’t believe bitcoin’s investor base was “big enough” or “deep enough” to keep prices at current levels.  “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there,” he said.  At the same time, a JPMorgan analyst said a bearish outlook could be triggered if bitcoin failed to claw its way back over $40,000, leading to steeper losses over the ensuing weeks.  Demand from institutional investors was said to have been the cause for the astronomical rise of the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2020, when Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and MicroStrategy said they had jumped into the market.  As coming installments of this series will show, the rest of 2021 would be defined by market-moving tweets from electric-vehicle billionaire Elon Musk, rapid price rallies in barely-heard-of alternative cryptocurrencies, a fresh wave of corporate buy-in to the legitimacy and potential of digital assets, plenty more moments of extreme volatility – and, eventually, a new all-time high of around $69,000.

42411620,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4rb,1640028854,NFT Forgeries Aren’t Going Away,"In a tweet thread last week, the digital artist Lois van Baarle said she’d discovered “132 instances” of her artwork being minted as NFTs on the marketplace OpenSea, all without her permission.  “NFTs are supposedly about authenticity, but these platforms … do less than the bare minimum when it comes to making sure that the images are being uploaded by their original creators,” she wrote. (NFTs are non-fungible tokens, unique digital assets on a blockchain).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Van Baarle, whose online moniker is “Loish,” makes highly stylized paintings and character designs with an eye toward the colorful and cartoonish. A simple search for the word “Loish” on OpenSea yields plenty of NFTs for these sorts of drawings, many of which have been delisted in the wake of last week’s tweets.  But van Baarle is hardly the first artist to have her work minted and sold on NFT platforms like OpenSea. Shepard Fairey, who rose to prominence as the artist behind former President Obama’s “Hope” campaign poster, and has since become a crypto believer, has complained publicly about his work being minted on Rarible (another NFT marketplace) in much the same way.  Moderation is definitely an issue, as van Baarle points out – it takes about two seconds to find a wealth of incredibly hateful and bigoted NFTs on OpenSea. But the larger problem has to do with the market dynamics underpinning the entire NFT ecosystem.  An NFT is just a token that links to a media file: Anyone can spin one up (OpenSea has a handy template for this, but Rarible and SuperRare and plenty of other platforms have similar systems), and anyone can sell one. There’s no mechanism in the underlying code – that is, the smart contract – for determining the authenticity of the image or video or song attached to the token.  With NFTs, authenticity is entirely extrinsic. Rarible might bestow a “verified” checkmark on the page of a creator whose works it has deemed authentic, but the vast majority of artists on these platforms are unverified. And there’s nothing really stopping anyone from right-clicking a work by a verified artist, downloading it and re-uploading it to the same platform as another NFT.  “Ownership,” in this context, is the process of recording addresses on the ledger. Through explorer websites like Etherscan, anyone can see who minted a token and who’s since paid for it. NFTs don’t come with a “bundle of rights,” since they involve no enforceable contracts. And while you can see the creator’s address, you’re always going to need external confirmation that X address actually belongs to Y creator.  In theory, this sense of authenticity is what imbues an NFT with value. Back in April, an NFT of the Nyan Cat meme (an old favorite of the early 2010s internet) sold for $600,000 because Foundation (the company behind the marketplace where the NFT was sold) organized a promotional campaign around the original artist’s involvement. Even if someone else minted another Nyan Cat NFT with that same image, it wouldn’t have the blessing of the original artist. It’s that blessing that’s created the most value, so far.  The sale was framed as an example of the ways in which NFTs supposedly offer increased autonomy for artists: a chance to recapture some of the value that’s been lost to the endless reproducibility of online images.  But just as often, NFTs are a vehicle for intellectual property theft. This morning I typed my own name into OpenSea and found a CoinDesk article by my colleague, Sam Ewen, minted as an NFT; my name was in the metadata.  Needless to say, neither of us sanctioned this listing.  OpenSea is far from the only platform with this issue. Decentralization has come to be synonymous with “censorship-resistance” – without moderators, spam, bigotry and theft are inevitable. A 2019 article in Verge detailed the ways in which the blockchain streaming service Audius relies on this sort of thing as a business model. And anyone can put graffiti directly on the blockchain.  See also: Why NFTs Are So Appealing  Blockchain filtering services may eventually do what the spam folder did for email, automatically separating out the junk and notifying artists when their images have been minted as NFTs. But it’s not reasonable to expect every single artist to file an individual claim for each stolen work. The extent of the infringement is already too broad.  Artists should stay keenly aware of the inherent dangers here. Even if you never touch an NFT, your work could be stolen by some enterprising scammer. In a way, it’s easier to steal work from artists outside of crypto; if you’re not monitoring the blockchain, as many NFT artists now are, you’re less likely to notice the theft.  Companies with the most to gain from promoting NFTs are the ones with the responsibility to rein this in. If OpenSea genuinely wants to share the wealth with creators, as opposed to the technologists and investors powering the NFT boom, it needs to protect their interests, too.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/20/nft-forgeries-arent-going-away,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4328b03238afbf12559abf43880edeb0fe8971b-2048x1199.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Historical Data May Tell Current Trend Is Bullish As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the Bitcoin exchange reserves seem to have sharply fallen in the past couple of weeks. The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is a BTC indicator that shows the total amount of coins currently stored in exchange wallets. When the value of this indicator moves up, it means investors are depositing their Bitcoin to exchanges. Holders usually transfer coins to exchanges either for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins with them. As such, this trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, when the reserve moves down, it implies holders are withdrawing their coins at the moment. Such a trend, if sustained, can prove to be bullish for BTC as it may mean that investors are currently in a state of accumulation.

The grant’s suspension followed blockchain startup ConsenSys’ removal of 50 Iranian students from its smart-contract programming course and developer Virgil Griffith’s guilty plea to a sanctions conspiracy charge for giving a talk in North Korea.  The fundraiser resumed on another platform, Barcelona, Spain-based Giveth, and ultimately raised over $7,558 for volunteers of Iranian origin who created the course and will publish it for anyone Farsi-speaking to take for free.  However, the volunteers remain bewildered: Despite blockchain technology’s promise of a borderless future without discrimination, real-world politics still rule.  “It was really a big shock,” one of the course’s creators, Sahar Rahbari, told CoinDesk.  Kyle Weiss, Gitcoin’s chief operating officer, said it shut down the campaign not just because it was somehow related to Iran (where Farsi is spoken), but that “the grant had in its description that it was financially supporting people in a sanctioned nation, which is an OFAC violation.”  A spokesperson for U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control referred CoinDesk to its webpage detailing Iran sanctions.  “There are other Farsi community grants on [the] platform that we are proud to see receive funding,” Weiss told CoinDesk by email. “In this case, the education they are providing was immaterial in our decision (we are unsure if they filed for an exemption to provide the education to individuals in a sanctioned nation). The problem was with them transferring funds to people located in a sanctioned nation.”  The grant proposal mentioned Farsi-speaking individuals “from Iran,” which gave Delaware-incorporated Gitcoin’s team pause, Weiss said.  “The grant’s details could be perceived a number of ways, but given our team’s ability to really discern the truth and the liability we assume as a U.S. entity, the decision was made to mark their grant inactive as there was too much doubt,” he said.  Even though U.S. sanctions on Iran do not forbid educational activities outright, there are some caveats, sanctions experts previously told CoinDesk.  Plus, the sanctions regulations haven’t been written with regard to online courses, so the interpretation of what is and is not allowed there might get tricky for U.S. companies.  Abundance of caution  Gitcoin grants work like this: First, the application receives contributions from the community to its Ethereum wallets. Then, Gitcoin matches the sum raised with the corresponding amount of DAI, the dollar-denominated stablecoin, from the project’s treasury.  Ann Brody, a PhD student focusing on Ethereum, told CoinDesk she helped to write the grant proposal and put it on Gitcoin on Dec. 7.  Brody’s application only lasted one day. The day after she published it she got an email from the Gitcoin team saying the grant “may violate U.S. law,” so the grant was rendered inactive “out of an abundance of caution.”  “Our North Star remains facilitating the buildout of the open web, and staying true to this goal sometimes requires erring on the side of caution to protect the greater mission,” read the email, shared by Brody on Twitter.  Gitcoin, in turn, explained the situation in a Twitter thread, saying that a journalist reached out to Gitcoin asking about the team’s attitude toward U.S. sanctions.  The reporter (not named in the thread) cited ConsenSys’ ban of Iranian students from its coding bootcamp and asked if Gitcoin “has less liability than ConsenSys Academy.”  That brought attention to the grant from the Gitcoin team, and after talking to legal counsel they decided to shut down the campaign: “If we had not taken action, then we could have jeopardized the entire network,” the thread said.  The team added that, although Gitcoin is working on making the funding process more decentralized, “our current cGrants platform is hosted by the U.S.-based entity which will continue to follow U.S. laws and regulations.”  Read more:ConsenSys Suddenly Bars Iranian Students From Ethereum Coding Class  Paying it forward  The grant, proposed by an informal group called Women in Blockchain Farsi, is supposed to fund the work of volunteers who put together an Ethereum mentorship program, one of the contributors, Sahar Rahbari, said.  The course will consist of video content and Q&A sessions. It will be available for free; to compensate the volunteers like Rahbari, the team aimed to raise $7,500 in ether and fiat currency.  The course essentially grew out of the initiative ConsenSys Academy, the Ethereum powerhouse’s educational branch, started last year and shut down this autumn.  Seven Iranian women attended the online coding bootcamp in 2020, funded by grants from the local non-profit CoinIran.  This summer, the program’s graduates decided to pass on their knowledge, developing an Ethereum coding course in Farsi for 35 selected students.  Then the crew decided to go further and publish the course content for free. This can help not only Iranians, the grant proposal underscores: Farsi-speaking people live also in the Asian nations of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The course is scheduled to go live this week.  Read more:ConsenSys Grants Help Iranian Women Learn Solidity  Giveth, the platform that took over the campaign from Gitcoin, did not comment by press time.  U.S. companies’ skittishness is unfortunate, but understandable even to those affected by the situation, said Aisha Amin, a ConsenSys Academy alumna and a course contributor.  “Even if there are no strict rules on some areas, when it comes to us [Iranians] there may be legal troubles. That’s why they prefer to keep us away,” she told CoinDesk.  Virgil Griffith’s shadow  The outcome of Griffith’s case definitely influenced Gitcoin’s decision, Weiss said. “Let’s not forget the Virgil Griffith story where, tragically, someone who gave a presentation has been charged with very severe crimes and is now in jail.”  Gitcoin co-founder Scott Moore echoed the sentiment, adding that Griffith’s case rattled the Ethereum community. Now, people who traveled to North Korea with the developer, even without giving speeches, “are worried about their safety,” he said.  “At the time, no one expected that his trip to North Korea, just to give a lecture, was going to result in one of the most serious cases the industry has seen. It was a massive tragedy both for him personally and for Web 3 and, to Kyle’s point, we have a responsibility to ensure that donors or others who have generously supported us in the past (including the Ethereum Foundation, which has similar restrictions related to OFAC rules) were not put at risk,” Moore said.  “We must always move carefully and live in the present to achieve the future we want to see,” he said.

Following a 17-week run of inflows, outflows from cryptocurrency funds totaled $142 million during the seven days through Dec. 17, according to CoinShares, a digital-asset manager that compiles the industry data. The largest previous outflow on record was in early June, when net redemptions surged to $97 million.  Investment funds focused on bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, had $89 million worth of outflows last week. That’s a reversal from the $145 million of inflows the prior week.  The report noted a number of factors contributing to the surge in outflows.  There have been considerable outflows from all risky assets, not just digital assets, said the report. One trigger may have been the recent signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it’s accelerating the withdrawal of monetary stimulus that helped to prop up asset prices over the past couple years.

A number of top executives of Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies also participated, including Polkadot founder Gavin Wood, who said in a statement that Gear’s infrastructure efforts “will benefit our entire ecosystem.”  The announcement comes quick on the heels of a major milestone for Polkadot. The network’s first parachains – basically, layer 1 blockchains running atop the layer 0 that is Polkadot – went live on Saturday.  Polkadot on its own doesn’t allow contract development as it’s not an application platform but more of a kind of meta-protocol, said Gear Technologies founder Nikolay Volf, who was previously a core developer at Parity working closely with Wood over a six-year period.  “The grand goal is to provide a fast track for smart-contract development in the Polkadot ecosystem,” Volf said in an interview. “In terms of the technology, our approach to how different contracts interact with each other is a highly parallelizable architecture.”  Gear’s next move is to launch a testnet in early 2022, and pass third-party security and financial audits. A go-live date is estimated in the second half of the year, Volf said.  “Gear is a key ingredient to simplifying building blockchain apps,” Blockchange CEO Ken Seiff said in a statement.

The system will be used to automatically transfer money (in U.S. dollars for the time being with euros to be supported next year) between Siemens’ own accounts.  The application would be geared toward the automation of the various actions required in the recording and verification of payments, the report added.  The infrastructure uses JPMorgan’s blockchain unit Onyx, of which Siemens is the first anchor client.  The U.S. banking giant has a pipeline of clients for the Onyx system, said Naveen Mallela, Onyx’s global head of coin systems. The infrastructure will take programmable payments beyond current uses like direct debits and standing orders, Mellela said.

Since it released its third-quarter results on Nov. 30, the Pennsylvania-based company has signed four separate deals for the rigs, according to the filing. It expects 4,800 rigs, which cost $35.7 million, to be delivered by the end of the year or in early January, it said.  Another 4,280 rigs were acquired under a profit share arrangement with Northern Data, under “highly favorable” conditions for Stronghold, it said. They will be delivered during the first half of 2022, Stronghold said.  The bitcoin miner said it also signed an equipment-financing agreement with investment firm NYDIG on Dec. 15 for up to $54 million. The deal is collateralized by the purchase of 12,000 S19j Pro Antminers from Bitmain, and Stronghold has already received a $18.6 million advance, it said.  The aggregate principal outstanding comes with a 9.85% interest rate and will be repaid over 24 months.  All of the 9,080 rigs will be installed in Stronghold’s own reclamation and power generation facilities, it said.  To date, Stronghold has either installed or committed to buy over 54,000 mining rigs, with a total hashrate of about 5.2 exahashes per second, according to the filing.

Other major deals inked by FTX and FTX.US in the past year include the naming rights to the arena of the NBA’s Miami Heat and partial naming rights to University of California, Berkeley’s football stadium; logo patches on the uniforms of MLB umpires; and a star-studded lineup of ambassadors including Tom Brady, Stephen Curry and Shohei Ohtani.

A recent survey carried out by Nataxis Investment Managers found that 28% of institutions had already invested in crypto, while nearly a third plan to increase their cryptocurrency allocations. The significance of this shift shouldn&apos;t be underestimated. After all, banks have had several years to prepare for the possibility that crypto could be the next big asset class, but few of them chose to take the bet. Why? Because the regulatory concerns were simply too great when weighed against the overall value proposition of crypto. So, it&apos;s telling that the trillion-dollar year for Bitcoin seems to have swung the pendulum in the other direction. The regulatory environment hasn&apos;t changed significantly, but the opportunity is now much greater than in previous years. It means that institutions are prepared to address regulatory challenges head-on, which explains why some of the biggest financial firms are investing so heavily in crypto compliance. News recently emerged that blockchain investigations firm TRM Labs raised $60 million in Series B funding, with American Express, Visa, Citi, and PayPal all participating.

42424043,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpjh,1639998854,Ether Call Demand Signals Anticipation of Year-End Rally,"Notably bullish flows hit ether’s options market early Monday, indicating budding hope for a recovery rally ahead of the year-end.  Institution-focused over-the-counter (OTC) desk Paradigm saw 18,500 contracts for the $4,400 call option and 14,000 contracts for the $4,200 call option change hands during Asian trading hours. These trades due for expiry on Dec. 31 were executed on Paradigm and booked on Deribit, the leading exchange for cryptocurrency options by volume and open interest.  A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the underlying asset.  While options’ primary use is to protect spot or futures market exposure from unexpected bullish or bearish moves, speculators sometimes bet on the underlying asset by simply buying calls or puts.  “The two trades were traded live and appear to be a large directional bet for a move higher into year-end,” Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Theoretically, the $4,400 call represents a bet that ether would settle above that level on Dec. 31. However, buyers can square off positions before the expiry if ether (ETH) chalks a quick move higher, boosting the value of bullish bets.  Note that out-of-the-money (OTM) calls at strikes higher than the underlying asset’s current market price (CMP) are relatively cheap compared with strikes at or below the CMP and tend to gain significant value on a sudden move higher. Thus, traders often snap up OTM calls in a bid to make outsized gains.  Despite sizeable buying activity in the $4,200 and $4,400 calls, the overall options market still signals caution.  According to data tracked by crypto derivatives research firm Skew, the one-week and the one-, three- and six-month put-call skews are positive, a sign of puts or downside bets drawing higher prices or demand than calls.  Ether is currently trading near $3,800, representing a 3% decline on the day. The token powering Ethereum’s blockchain seems to have found acceptance under a five-month bullish trendline.

As a default, blockchains secure transactions with a level of privacy exceeding that which is achievable through centralized payment networks. Consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) provide methods for decentralized consensus, allowing cryptocurrency networks to settle transactions without a centralized authority. However, experts amongst the cryptocurrency community are expressing concern over whether this level of privacy is enough given developments in modern anti-privacy technologies. Blockchain: Private or Not? Banks and centralized payment networks like Visa have no choice but to record personal transaction data - sender and receiver names, amounts, times, locations, and often the types of goods or services purchased - in order to facilitate the movement of money and protect users from fraud. While blockchains are advantaged in this regard, the privacy they provide is not perfect. Sender and receiver wallet addresses, as well as transaction amounts, are stored permanently on blockchains for all to see.

42424032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpHh,1639990661,Fantom DeFi Project Grim Finance Exploited for $30M,"Yield compounding tool Grim Finance had $30 million worth of fantom tokens stolen from its protocol after an exploit on Sunday. The project took preventive measures to stop further damage.  “We inform you that our platform was exploited today by an external attacker roughly 6 hours ago. The attackers address has been identified with over 30 million dollars worth of theft here,” the project’s developers tweeted on Sunday morning. “The exploit was found in the vault contract so all of the vaults and deposited funds are currently at risk,” they said in a separate tweet.  Built on the Fantom Opera network, Grim Finance allows users to stake their liquidity pool tokens in what it calls Grim Vaults, automatically harvesting yields and re-staking rewards using strategies for even higher yields.  Liquidity pool tokens are provided to decentralized exchange users who supply their own liquidity in return for a token reward from the platform. Such exchanges are a subset of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, which relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen for financial services such as lending, trading, and borrowing.  The ease of staking and harvesting increased yields on Grim Finance attracted over $100 million in user funds to the protocol, according to total value locked (TVL) metrics on analytics tool DeFi Llama. They remained safe until yesterday.  Attackers used a “reentrancy” exploit to steal funds from Grim Finance. Such an exploit is common on Solidityhttps://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/, the code behind the Ethereum and Fantom blockchains. It sees attackers manipulate data by interacting with the network and calling an untrusted contract, allowing them to gain control of the assets stored on whichever contact they exploited. This time, it was Grim Finance’s yield-compounding vaults.  The attackers took nearly $30 million in fantom tokens, data from Fantom blockchain explorers show. Much of that seems to have already been routed to other Fantom-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as AnySwap and SpookySwap, where the stolen tokens were exchanged for other tokens, such as USD coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, in one such instance.  Developers paused all vaults on Sunday to prevent further damages. They further informed USDC issuer Circle, AnySwap and Maker to freeze any assets related to the exploit.  The hack caused an exodus of total value locked on Grim Finance. Just $4.3 million remains in Grim Finance vaults, and TVL fell 84% in the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/20/fantom-defi-project-grim-finance-exploited-for-30m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60132411b327a4c9ce2b1833bccca5d556dd3f22-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jx5h,1639987539,"Bitcoin, Ether Dip in ‘Bearish Asia Session’ as China Rate Cut Fails to Inspire Risk Buying","Bitcoin and ether were again trading lower in Asian hours, continuing the year-long trend of losing ground mainly when America is asleep. The decline comes as traditional markets turn a blind eye to China’s interest rate cut and remain risk averse.  At press time, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, was trading near $46,600, representing a 0.5% drop on the day. Ether was changing hands near $3,850, down nearly 2% on the day.  Data provided by options trader Fredrick Collins shows that bitcoin and ether have consistently faced selling pressure during the Asian hours this year. Most of year-to-date gains made by bitcoin and ether, 60% and 420% respectively, have come during the American hours, represented by 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. New York time.  Both cryptocurrencies have taken a big hit in recent weeks, dragging the broader crypto market lower as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks began unwinding the liquidity-boosting stimulus to contain inflation.  Bitcoin has declined more than 30% since peaking near $69,000 on Nov. 10, with sellers dominating the market during the Asian hours – 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Beijing time.  The trend continued on Monday despite the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) taking steps to cushion the economy from the negative impact of property market woes and renewed coronavirus concerns.  The Chinese central bank announced a cut in its one-year loan prime rate, a de facto benchmark rate since 2019, from 3.85% to 3.8%, confirming the first reduction in nearly two years.  Interest rate cuts tend to inject liquidity into the economy. Thus, perceived inflation hedges like bitcoin, gold, and asset prices, in general, typically react positively to rate cuts.  However, Asian equities are currently flashing red alongside a 1.10% drop in the futures tied to the S&P 500. Oil prices are down more than 3% and the anti-risk currencies like the Japanese yen are drawing safe-haven bids.  The market action suggests China’s rate cut is perhaps too small compared to the impending tightening by the Fed and other central banks. Last week, the Fed signaled three rate hikes in 2022 and the Bank of England delivered a surprise interest rate hike.  Heightened fears of coronavirus lockdowns also appear to be overshadowing Beijing’s move to improve market sentiment. European nations are reimposing stricter measures to stem the Omicron wave and China’s COVID zero policy is threatening to disrupt the global supply chain.  Lockdowns and supply chain disruptions are inflationary, which are seen as a positive development for a perceived store of value assets. Lockdowns also weigh over economic growth.  However, with elevated global price pressures, central banks appear to have little room for higher liquidity injection to prioritize growth as they did after the first COVID wave in the first half of 2020. Back then, inflation in the U.S. stood well below the Fed’s 2% target. As of November, U.S inflation stood at a four-decade high of 6.8%.  Fed ChairmJerome Powell recently retired the word “transitory” from inflation discussions, signaling a shift in focus from employment (growth) to inflation control. The International Monetary Fund also urged the Fed to speed up policy tightening to contain inflation.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/20/bitcoin-ether-dip-in-bearish-asia-session-as-china-rate-cut-fails-to-inspire-risk-buying,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc42532e006b94afcf0d2a34babc493d7e8dcac2-1549x832.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices fell nearly $100 to $3,840, a 3% drop in 24 hours, following a muted weekend and a slight slide in top cryptocurrencies on Monday.  However, the relatively small price movements saw traders take on a big hit. Some $12.7 million worth of ether futures were liquidated on Monday morning alone, double the $6 million figure of bitcoin liquidations.  Coinglass analytics showed $11.9 million worth of liquidations originated from ‘long’ traders, or those borrowing from exchanges to bet on higher ether prices. Ninety-two percent of all traders were long ether Monday morning, and 50% of the liquidations took place on crypto exchange OKEx, which accounted for over $4.9 million in liquidations.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. These happen primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Elsewhere, prices of XRP jumped 10% from $0.82 to $0.91 during Asian hours. Traders took profits at those levels and prices then retracted to $0.87 in early European hours.  The volatility saw liquidations reach $2 million in Asian hours. No immediate fundamental updates for XRP were released on Sunday night or Monday morning that could have contributed to the move.  The Monday morning session saw $40 million in liquidations overall, contributing to over $152 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours.
