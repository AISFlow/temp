The cryptocurrency sector poses various risks to investors in the markets and challenges to the securities regulator, Gensler said in prepared testimony before the House Appropriations Committee. He pointed to volatility in the market and novel products as some examples of these issues.      ""Crypto lending platforms and so-called decentralized finance ('DeFi') platforms raise a number of challenges for investors and the SEC staff trying to protect them,"" Gensler said.      The crypto market had an overall market capitalization of $1.6 trillion on Monday after losing over one-third of its value in under two weeks, he said. While bitcoin grabs most headlines, he noted that more than 80 tokens have a $1 billion market cap, while more than 1,500 had a market cap of over $1 million.      Gensler previously told the House Financial Services Committee that stronger regulation around crypto exchanges could help protect investors. In particular, he suggested a dedicated market regulator for the crypto markets would provide some protection around fraud and manipulation, two concerns the SEC has often cited in rejecting bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.      The regulator repeated the concern on Wednesday.      ""Tokens currently on the market that are securities may be offered, sold, and traded in non-compliance with the federal securities laws. Furthermore, none of the exchanges trading crypto tokens has registered yet as an exchange with the SEC. Altogether, this has led to substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, and to correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation,"" he said.

""In recent weeks, the reported trading volume has ranged from $130 billion to $330 billion per day. These figures, however, are not audited or reported to regulatory authorities, as the tokens are traded on unregistered crypto exchanges. That is just one of many regulatory gaps in these crypto asset markets,"" Gensler said.      He also indicated that the SEC would be willing to bring enforcement actions against parties that don't comply with federal securities laws.      The regulatory agency has already brought 75 such actions, and ""has been consistent"" in how it describes its approach, he said.

42386873,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdPv,1622068788,Consensus 2021: 7 Questions for Bitcoin Anarchist Eric Voskuil,"Eric Voskuil is a veteran Bitcoin developer and one of the lead maintainers of Libbitcoin, the first implementation of the Bitcoin source code. He’s the author of “Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Principles of Bitcoin,” a deeply researched and reasoned take on Bitcoin’s core mechanics, Austrian economics and anarchy. He also founded the CryptoEcon professional conference, which took place in Hanoi, Vietnam, in early 2020.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The topic of funding Bitcoin development is important. Some companies will hire a Bitcoin dev, some won't. How do you incentivize firms to ""give back"" to the open source commons?      If they see an advantage to doing so, they will do it. The developer must be able to provide value that a company needs, like any other employee. Developers can’t support themselves on charity. The tragedy of the commons is often interpreted as a market failure, but this is not the case. A commons is property owned by the state, as in a “public” grazing land. People don’t pay for it and all must use it, or their competitors will do so and put them out of business.      So the commons either fails to be useful, either due to overuse and arbitrary constraint, or becomes private property again (paid for). The market determines the price that ensures supply and satisfies demand. If companies need it, they will pay for it. A lot of people work on open source because they want to and can afford to. Others get paid for it. I don’t see any reason or way to improve upon basic market rationality.    Read more: Code Is Speech: Amir Taaki on Crypto’s Debt to Phil Zimmerman    Are there any lessons or takeaways from the Taproot upgrade process?      I could see during the SegWit [Segregated Witness] activation process that a lot of people were drawing false conclusions. Those then predictably surfaced during the Taproot process. For some reason the developer community, which surely knows better, didn’t speak up when clear errors had become accepted truths. I can’t count the number of people who told me that they were surprised to hear that soft forks are not “backward compatible” unless enforced by majority hash power. A fork is a fork; if you change the rules, you are on a new coin. The only question becomes how many people will join you. Hash power enforcement is the only way to ensure that everyone comes along. Once people started to understand this, momentum shifted rapidly.    Bitcoin will only thrive to the extent that it can operate outside of what are ultimately political strictures. That is, after all, why it exists.    People had been led to believe it was just a choice, and that “user activation” had been done before BIP [bitcoin improvement proposal] 16, which is not the case. Core devs certainly understand this, but for some reason did not speak up – though they did show significant resistance to shipping code that they knew could easily cause a chain split. While the Bitcoin Core team is very diverse, there are real pressures. This is why Amir [Taaki] started Libbitcoin (and the BIP process). If anything, we should take away that it’s healthy to have truly independent developers, which necessarily means independent projects.      Is there anyone ""in charge"" of Bitcoin Core, considering only a handful have ""commit access"" to the GitHub?      There are way too many people who want to commit code – into what is in many ways a fragile codebase – for nobody to be in charge. There is necessarily a small group of people who ultimately decide what gets in and what doesn’t. This isn’t a problem, as there is nothing stopping someone from doing exactly what Amir [Taaki] and others have done. It’s only a matter of time before other implementations mature to the point where there will be a competitive market. The idea, heavily promoted by many Bitcoin Core devs, that consensus criticality precludes competition is self-serving and ultimately irrelevant. There are many versions of Bitcoin Core, some of which have shown themselves (even in a single version, as a result of platform dependencies) to not be consensus-consistent. Dave Collins wrote a good article about it back in 2015.      Edward Snowden, for one, has said on-chain privacy should be the biggest priority in Bitcoin development. There are more users than ever, a greater interest in bitcoin among regulators and law enforcement and an industry made out of on-chain surveillance. Why have Bitcoin developers shied from implementing privacy features at the protocol level?      I’m not aware that they have. It’s really the central aspect of core development.    Read more: CoinSwap and the Ongoing Effort to Make Bitcoin Privacy ‘Invisible’    The common view is that miners are Goliath to users' David. You said this morning it's more of a Goliath versus Goliath situation. Could you add a little more here?      The term “user” is ambiguous. The people who matter in the context of rule changes are miners (those who are presently confirming transactions) and merchants (those who are presently accepting bitcoin). The latter category is likely at least as centralized and state-regulated as mining. The sea of HODLers has no say whatsoever in such changes. If they aren’t accepting bitcoin (themselves, not via exchanges) they don’t have any ability to reject invalid coins. That is the purpose of validation and the essence of enforcement.      Will miner-enforced upgrades become the norm as the network gets bigger? Or will there be a place for user activated soft forks?      It’s already the norm. User activation does also happen, resulting in altcoins. The question is always how to get everyone to change their rules and at the same time. You can either get greater than 50% of hash power (miners) or 100% of the economy (merchants). A soft fork is a new coin. The benefit to using soft forks is that majority hash power can bring everyone else along. If they don’t, you have an altcoin. It’s certainly possible that the old coin could die out, or the new. But with hashpower signaling, a large part of the economy can start enforcing (or activate) at the same time and the rest of the economy can change the rules over time. Without hashpower enforcement, chain splits are practically inevitable.    Read more: Users Decide Bitcoin’s Consensus. But What Is a Bitcoin ‘User’?    Any thoughts on the Musk/Saylor Bitcoin Mining Council? Or on the larger conversation of Bitcoin's energy consumption?      I’ve written on energy waste theories. They really just don’t make any sense. There is a cost to securing all things, and that cost is what the threat must exceed to be successful. Those costs are all grounded in energy. Bitcoin suffers from a PR problem in that its costs are entirely visible.      As for councils, these things will happen. I don’t see them as relevant to Bitcoin. They can have an impact, but Bitcoin will only thrive to the extent that it can operate outside of what are ultimately political strictures.

42386853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVd5n,1622068571,US Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Require Digital Dollar Updates,"A pair of U.S. congressmen have introduced a bill that would require the Treasury Department to evaluate the digital yuan, digital dollar and the actual dollar's role in the global economy.      The bipartisan bill, introduced by Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.), seeks to ensure the U.S. dollar remains the world's reserve currency and directs the Treasury Department to publish a report that evaluates current policy and governance around the currency. This report would include details around central bank digital currencies (CBDC), among other issues.      Under the terms of the bill, dubbed the ""21st Century Dollar Act,"" the Treasury secretary (currently Janet Yellen) would submit a report to the Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees that includes ""a description of efforts by major foreign central banks, including the People’s Bank of China, to create an official digital currency, as well as any risks to the national interest of the United States posed by such efforts.""      The report would update these committees on the Federal Reserve's current status in researching a digital dollar. The bill would also require the Treasury Department to develop a strategy for boosting the dollar's reserve status.      The report would detail ""any implications for the strategy established by the secretary pursuant to subsection (a) arising from the relative state of development of an official digital currency by the United States and other nations, including the People’s Republic of China,"" the bill said.      Keeping the dollar as the world's reserve currency would be ""good for American companies and workers as well as U.S. global influence,"" Hill said in a statement.      ""Congress and policy makers need to understand the risks posed to the dollar, especially as it relates to China’s renminbi, to ensure the safety and preeminence of the dollar,"" he said.      Himes said in a statement that the dollar is ""an important geopolitical tool"" in the U.S. ""diplomatic toolbox.""      The dollar's status as a reserve currency allows the federal government to use it in its sanctions compliance program, letting it block alleged or convicted terrorists and other malicious actors it deems a threat to national security from the global payment system. Some government officials and private individuals believe that a digital yuan, which China has been working on, could help countries bypass the dollar-based financial system.      Notably, current Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler participated in a wargaming exercise in 2019 that simulated how North Korea might use a digital yuan to fund nuclear weapons. Other participants included former senior government officials, such as one-time Defense Secretary Ash Carter.

Hill previously sent a letter with Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) to the Federal Reserve, asking the U.S. central bank whether it was looking into creating a digital dollar. The Boston Fed has since begun researching the merits and possible technologies around a CBDC.

42386868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdKt,1622068056,"Consensus Day 3, Recapped: The Battle Over Electronic Money","There’s no question that money is going digital, but the form that “digital cash” will take for the majority of global users is still largely up in the air. There are rapid advancements being made in central bank digital currency (CBDC) research and development, as well as fiat-pegged stablecoin and untethered cryptocurrency adoption. All signs point to a future where there will be myriad competing forms of money that people can use to transact and save in.      Some of the world’s foremost digital currency experts appeared today at Consensus to give their take on the future of money. They offered a glimpse at the current state of payments evolution, as well as the many blockers in place to bring about a “Hayekian moment.”    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    According to the latest figures, nearly 80% of central banks are exploring CBDC use cases. Although major economies – like China, Japan, the European Union and the U.S. – are in various stages of research and development, it could be said most of the energy is concentrated in emerging markets, frequently cut off from the global financial system.      Perhaps in a sign of the times, this morning Bank of Mauritius Governor Harvesh Seegolam disclosed that the central bank is working to finalize details of a CBDCs pilot to launch by the end of the year. It would join Cambodia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among others, in active research. Last year, the Bahamas made history as the first nation with a functioning digital fiat system (pegged to the U.S. dollar).      Digital fiat could improve financial inclusion and “address gaps that the traditional monetary system is not able to fulfill,” Governor Seegolam said today.      By comparison, the U.S. is taking a cautious approach to CBDC development. While there are notable proponents for a digital dollar, such as former commodities regulators Chris Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine, there are as many detractors.      Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, for one, mentioned a number of policy considerations that still need to be wrinkled out. These include privacy concerns, the effect state money would have on banks, the impact on underserved communities and cross-border concerns, she said during a Monday Consensus keynote.      Brainard added that private alternatives, like stablecoins that “reference” fiats, come with their own destabilizing risks.      Brian Brooks, the CEO of Binance.US and former acting Comptroller of the Currency, offered his opinion: a CBDC will “never” be launched in the U.S. “That’s not what we do in this country,” he said, adding that monetary innovation is and must be led by privately issued stablecoins.      Asked whether CBDCs would compete with or complement crypto-asset networks like XRP, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a separate panel that it depends on what use cases are being targeted.      Consensus on where we go from here is anything but assured.    Regulation – boom or bust    In public comments today, Christian Catalini, chief economist at the Diem Association, the body behind the digital currency project, presented a denuded version of the dollar-backed diem stablecoin. Once promised to be an easy-to-use, mobile-first digital payments network that could stand apart from any local government’s monetary system, Diem (formerly Libra) now aims to stay firmly within the system.      The to-be-released digital asset, issued in conjunction with Silvergate Bank, will act as a placeholder for an official, state-backed digital dollar, Catalini said. “The design of our network is really meant to mitigate the risk of currency substitution,” he said.      It’s common knowledge that the original vision for a multi-asset-pegged global currency had been whittled down by regulatory concerns – a vision Catalini now admits was “naive.” He said the group has spent innumerable hours working with regulators to bolster consumer protections and mitigate potential fraud.      Morgan Beller, a former Libra employee and current venture capitalist, gave insight into that process today. Still rattled from the “PTSD” and “regulatory scars” of working on the Facebook-led initiative, Beller now takes a more pragmatic approach to disruption.      Fiat, she said, has network effects that act as a “moat” to prevent disruption. There may not be incentives to move to new rails, and for regulators any amount of change introduces risk. But the system can still be changed.      From the top down, fiat brokers might see the benefits of novel technologies that CBDCs (“watered-down stablecoins,” to steal her phrase) or stablecoins can bring. That explains the numerous countries and corporations, like PayPal, that are building new, more decentralized plumbing.      Then, Beller said, there are these bottom-up grown swells where people adopt tools because it solves a real issue. “There has been a lot of crypto for crypto’s sake,” Beller said. But in emerging markets, there are people who need services that traditional fiat cannot supply.      What’s more, once these truly decentralized systems – the “immaculate conception coins” like bitcoin and ethereum – take hold, they cannot be squashed. There was a confluence of forces that led to bitcoin and ethereum’s success – perhaps most notably that at launch, regulators were simply uninterested.    A melange    Can this be replicated? Could truly cryptographically secure sovereign assets take hold everywhere? Beller seemed skeptical that the majority of people would ever learn how blockchain or key management ever works. What’s needed, again, are useful products.      Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s blockchain lead, seemed to agree, but thought widespread adoption would happen selectively at first. He noted in speaking to his crypto clients that a number were performing the majority of their business deals in stablecoins like USDC.      “The first main use case for USDC is a settlement layer,” Sheffield said, meaning moving funds from wallets to Visa or for cross-border B2B payments. He said this is a trend that would continue, at the commercial level, before the company expects a mass amount of consumers to begin paying merchants directly in stablecoins.      But the world is a big place, populated with many different types of people. There can be a level of decentralization in products that different companies offer. Some people will always prefer custodial solutions, whereas others want to know their cryptographic keys.      For Sheffield, the future of money lies at the “intersection between fintech, crypto and banking.”    Other news    PayPal will enable withdrawal PayPal plans to let users withdraw cryptocurrency to third-party wallets, its blockchain lead said, a service that is currently unavailable. The payments giant has let people buy, sell and hold a few cryptocurrencies since October 2020. The company ships new developments every two months on average, he said, though it’s unclear when the withdrawal functionality is coming.      Ripple still plans to go public Ripple is waiting for an ongoing SEC lawsuit to end before it looks to go public, CEO Brad Garlinghouse disclosed today. “The likelihood that Ripple is a public company is very high at some point,” he said. The SEC launched an enforcement action in December 2020 that accused Ripple Labs of conducting ongoing and unregistered securities sales. Though still in discovery, the suit could be a landmark moment in U.S. securities law.      Question worth asking In a meeting of the minds this morning, Bitcoin Core leads discussed the meaning of network stewardship as well as the blockchain basics, such as, “What is a user?” Bitcoin devs Eric Voskuil, Adam Back and Rusty Russell all agreed that from a protocol consensus perspective, only those running and using a Bitcoin node to verify their economic activity are true users – though the conversation gets complicated when asking what a miner is, too. So who really “runs” Bitcoin: the miners, the nodes, the users or the core devs?      Big fan? Tom Brady will speak at the closing night of Consensus 2021, following a totally unplanned and completely spontaneous invitation from crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried.

42386862,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdFr,1622063705,Banning Crypto to Stop Hackers Is Like Banning Cheese to Stop Mice,"The disabling of the Colonial Pipeline after a reported ransomware attack early this month has renewed U.S. interest in cybersecurity – messing with Americans’ gasoline has quite a focusing effect. Unfortunately, the fact that cryptocurrency played a role in the hack has helped channel much of that interest in the wrong direction.      Yesterday we got a sterling example of this misdirection in the form of a Wall Street Journal editorial arguing that banning cryptocurrency is a reasonable step in the fight against cybercrime. The piece’s author, Duke University financial regulation researcher Lee Reiners, argues cryptocurrency has no real-world utility and that “ransomware can’t succeed without cryptocurrency,” so we should just get rid of crypto. If it’s too hard to ban outright, Reiners argues on-ramps such as exchanges should be outlawed as a proxy.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    There are many nuanced reasons to reject this argument. You could compare it to demanding a ban on cheese because your house is infested with rats. You could say that it is a massive category error that mistakes a tool for a cause. You could point out, as many have, that cryptocurrency should be a massive gift to law enforcement because it leaves a permanent and public record of criminal activity. You could make the point that even the most beneficial new technology always has unexpected negative side effects, and that dealing with them as they arise has always been a major element of modern societies (38,000 Americans, for example, are killed in motor accidents annually, more than a century after mass adoption of automobiles).      You could make those arguments, and more. But they can be left for another day. Because even on its own terms, the argument for banning cryptocurrency as a cybersecurity measure fails so pathetically it’s hard to imagine it’s intended seriously.      Why? Above all, because ransomware is not the only kind of hacking. And the same measures needed to protect against ransomware will still be needed to protect against other kinds of attacks, even if we ban cryptocurrency. Further, while banning cryptocurrency would likely put downward pressure on ransomware attacks, it wouldn’t stop them – we know because they predate the invention of crypto. So if the goal is to improve cybersecurity broadly (and we need to), banning crypto would be a massive effort with limited impact.    Read more: David Z. Morris: What If Somebody Hacks the Money Pipeline Next?    Most of the worst hacks of recent years haven’t involved cryptocurrency ransoms. In 2013, hackers stole credit card and other personal data of 40 million Target customers. In 2017 Equifax, which holds financial data on a huge proportion of American adults, was robbed of 147.9 million consumer records. The terrifying Solarwinds hack, in which allegedly Russia-backed hackers spied on dozens of U.S. entities, where they may still have footholds, was revealed just last year. None of these hacks involved cryptocurrency ransoms.      Solarwinds may be the most important example here because state-backed espionage has no strategic overlap with ransomware – the entire point is to remain undetected. The Target and Equifax breaches are also useful reference points because just like most ransomware attacks they were aimed at accessing data. But that data was ultimately most likely monetized via identity theft and loan or credit card fraud, not crypto ransom. Does that mean we should ban credit cards?    Simpler and more effective than, you know, actually improving cybersecurity.    Even ransomware is not, as the Journal piece argues, impossible without cryptocurrency. Ransomware schemes with names like Gpcode, Cryzip, and Krotten were all up and running before Bitcoin was invented, with ransoms paid through a variety of channels, including plain old money orders (hat tip to Dr. Vesselin Bontchev). Cryptocurrency certainly makes ransomware crimes safer and easier, but getting rid of it wouldn’t fix the problem.      Actual cybersecurity experts seem to agree. The Institute for Security + Technology, a cybersecurity coalition and think tank supported by companies such as Microsoft, has released a list of anti-ransomware recommendations that highlights the role of cryptocurrencies. But the report makes no suggestion that crypto should be banned, and emphasizes that blockchain can leave investigators more evidence to work with than traditional finance.      All in all, the incoherence of the “ban crypto” argument is so striking that it invites questions about the motives of those making it. It’s tempting, and in some cases certainly correct, to assume that it’s an appealing position for those who dislike cryptocurrency for unrelated reasons.      But a more generous explanation is that cybersecurity is a very scary and difficult challenge with no obvious solution in sight, so there’s a strong temptation to highlight seemingly simple answers – even if they’re misguided. It’s a bit like the joke about the old man looking for his glasses under a streetlamp: “I dropped them in the alley, but I’m looking here because the light is better.”    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    A more substantive suggestion to address ransomware is to make paying cyber-ransoms illegal, just as paying kidnapping ransoms or bribes is in some countries. This would reduce the motive for ransomware attacks by making them less profitable. It would also push more system administrators to set up robust backup and recovery plans, which they should have in place anyway, and which would mitigate against other types of cyberattacks, not just ransomware.      More broadly, cybersecurity experts are pursuing a vision of what they call “zero-trust architecture.” The basic approach of zero-trust cyberdefense is to assume that your system will be breached, and set it up in a way that limits the potential damage of a breach. (Though the term might sound familiar to cryptocurrency fans, the idea has little technical relationship to the “zero trust” principle of blockchains.)      At this point it’s unclear whether zero-trust will have a major impact on cybercrime, but it’s where experts are focused. Reiners, author of the Journal piece, lists two years as an Army communications specialist in the mid-2000s as his only obvious cybersecurity-adjacent experience. Yet, he dismisses efforts like zero-trust as “pro forma and inadequate,” saying banning cryptocurrency is “simpler and more effective” for stopping ransomware. Simpler and more effective than, you know, actually improving cybersecurity.      That’s ultimately why “ban crypto” is not just a misinformed or disingenuous argument, but a dangerous one. It’s a distraction from the real cybersecurity challenge facing the U.S. and the world, and from the solutions in which actual experts believe.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

42386867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVdJd,1622062800,DBS Bank CEO: We Have Twice as Many Engineers as Bankers,"We’re now in a reality where financial institutions have to be technology firms first, said Piyush Gupta, the CEO of Singapore’s DBS Bank.      In the modern world, both central and commercial banks will be in charge of facilitating the transition to the financial infrastructure of the future, which will be digitized and tokenized, Gupta said in a pre-recorded speech at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 virtual conference.      DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank by assets with a $55.4 billion market capitalization, took an active role in blockchain exploration by Singapore’s central bank.      The first result of that exploration became Project Ubin, a cross-border CBDC initiative by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, including commercial banks like Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan and started as early as 2016.      “We are now increasingly thinking of ourselves as a technology company offering financial services, rather than a traditional bank,” Gupta said. “The fact that we have twice as more engineers than bankers is perhaps a testimony to the shift in the nature of the company that we are.”    The power of tokenization    Out of all the emerging technologies DBS have been exploring over the past seven years, the most compelling one has been distributed ledger technology and especially tokenization. It’s a much broader conversation than just cryptocurrencies, Gupta said.      “Recently, the bulk of the hype has been around digital currencies, and while digital currencies are important, I think they don’t grasp the scale and size of the overall opportunity,” he said.      Gupta added that tokenization allows for efficiently fractionalizing ownership, providing real-time settlement and an opportunity to program the tokenized assets, adding various functionality and conditions of their use.      “This makes the idea of tokenization a lot more powerful that just the digitalization of money,” he said.      There are still challenges for tokenizing large swaths of property. These challenges are both legal and practical, like the lack of liquidity for asset-backed tokens, but “we’re already at the point when people understand the power of tokenization and how this can fundamentally transform the fabric of the financial system,” Gupta said.      In this transformation, both commercial and central banks should play a key role, Gupta said. “Central banks are not only thinking of central bank digital currencies but also facilitating this migration to the tokenization infrastructure in many other ways,” he said.    Projects under way    As for DBS’ own business, the company is actively expanding into the crypto universe: last year, it announced the launch of the DBS Digital Exchange, on which users can trade bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and XRP against four fiat currencies: the U.S. dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Hong Kong dollar and the Japanese yen.      The exchange will also become a tokenization platform for companies that want to do offerings similar to initial coin offerings and security token offerings, Gupta said. DBS, for one, is going to launch a ""fixed income token"" in the next several days, he added.      In April, DBS, JP Morgan and Temasek announced a blockchain-based settlement platform, named Partior. The aim of the project, Gupta said, is to “rethink the processes for cross-border transactions.” This also goes back to the idea of tokenization, which in this case is the tokenization of the money that banks hold.      The project will help to “create a network of players, each of which will seek to tokenize commercial banking money, so DBS will be tokenizing the Singapore dollar, JP Morgan will be tokenizing the U.S. dollar, and we are trying to bring in other partners that would be tokenizing other currencies, like euro, etc.,” Gupta said.      “We think that this platform could have one more important use case: we can send central bank digital currencies across countries and across central banks. We had conversations with this regard with a few central banks, and there have been some tests to see how this platform would work,” Gupta said.      And as recently as this past Friday, DBS also announced a new blockchain collaboration with the Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered bank and Temasek Holdings tech firm to launch a blockchain-based marketplace for carbon emissions credits, named Climate Impact X (CIX).      The project will help make the carbon credits market more transparent and liquid, and ensure trust in the quality of the tokenized carbon credit with due verification processes, Gupta said. He is ambitious about this particular project and expects a lot of demand for it.      “We think that during the next decade, there will be an explosion on the global carbon market, it will grow ten times, get to be worth $50 billion-$100 billion,” Gupta said. Many companies have made commitments to cut their carbon footprint, and a marketplace for carbon credits would “create transparency and integrity in the asset class and create a degree of trust in the marketplace,” Gupta said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/26/dbs-bank-ceo-we-have-twice-as-many-engineers-as-bankers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b4fc1ca382f93f83c4ad215c84ad3c8b71dfb38-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, market data continues to suggest more and more ether being deployed and traded on the spot market to rival BTC.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $38,224 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.

Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,542-$2,895 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin over $40K, then under    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday by 3.3% as of press time. BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish signal for market technicians.      BTC climbed from $37,600 at 20:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday to as high as $40,702 by 00:45 UTC Wednesday (8:45 p.m. ET Tuesday), an 8.2% increase based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has settled at $38,224 as of press time.      The announcement of a council to address problems associated with energy-intensive proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining led to a bounce in bitcoin’s price. However, the run-up couldn’t sustain itself.      “We expect the selling to resume as this bounce fades off and BTC will test recent lows again,” said Pankaj Balani, chief executive officer of crypto venue Delta Exchange. “BTC will find a lot of resistance above $50,000 anyway and it will take some doing for BTC to move above the previous high.”    Lack of bitcoin dry powder    The total daily flow of bitcoin to exchanges is dipping. “Dry powder” refers to liquid assets waiting to be deployed; in the case of crypto that’s a balance on a wallet somewhere, and the amount being piled into exchanges seems to be slackening. Flow into exchanges suggest holders are planning to do something with the asset, i.e., sell.      On Sunday, 52,895 transfers were made to exchanges, the lowest amount since January 24 according to data aggregator Glassnode. Tuesday was also quite low, with only 53,326 transfers. For comparison, the average daily number of BTC exchange deposits in the past six months was 72,361 transfers.      Over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg thinks new entrants into crypto might be losing interest in the up-and-down nature of BTC and that might be contributing to a slowdown in flow as selling has ensued.      “It’s the weak hands and newbie investors with little or no experience of the bitcoin roller coaster that panicked,” Kugelberg said.

The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether jumped from $2,542 at 20:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday to $2,895 at 00:45 UTC Wednesday (8:45 p.m. ET Tuesday), a 13.8% climb based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is at $2,733 as of press time.      The cryptocurrency market opened the week with bitcoin and ether volumes almost equal. Tuesday brought a major jump in ether volumes, much higher than BTC, according to CoinDesk Research data from major spot exchanges. For Tuesday, bitcoin volumes were at $49,553,564,503 versus ether’s $88,323,977,568 tally.      The reversal in volumes between the two assets, which are rare but becoming more common, just proves traders in the crypto market aren’t just focused on BTC since there are alternatives, according to Sarah Potter, president of crypto educational platform YouCanTrade.      “From a traders’ point of view, you have a lot of choices to find a cryptocurrency that works for you,” Potter said. “And ether has potential.”    Ether held in DeFi dumps    Since hitting an all-time high of 11.1 million ETH “locked” in decentralized finance (DeFi), on April 19, that number has steadily fallen, and was down more than 15% to 9.4 million ETH as of press time.      Investors “lock” crypto in DeFi to generate a return in exchange for liquidity across these platforms. And while the total value locked in DeFi, which includes bitcoin and stablecoins, is trending up, it seems ether holders have decided to deploy their balances elsewhere.      Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, suggests that some ether holders might have some trepidation about the process of locking, given crypto’s notorious price gyrations.      “I think the market is going to take some time to find the right balance given the violent drop last week,” Lau said.

42406442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYAB,1622061000,"Mastercard Exec Shares Thoughts on Crypto Rewards, Stablecoin and CBDC Plans","“An act of brilliance.”      That’s how Jessica Turner, Mastercard’s global head of new digital infrastructure and fintech, describes a forthcoming credit card that will reward customers in cryptocurrency rather than airline miles or hotel points.      While perhaps somewhat self-serving – the card, co-branded with the Gemini exchange, is to run on Mastercard’s payment network – her comment underscores the 55-year-old company’s growing enthusiasm for the nascent digital asset field.      In a pre-recorded conversation broadcast Wednesday at Consensus 2021, Turner and Noah Perlman, Gemini’s chief operating officer, reflected on mainstream crypto adoption, made palatable via things like the rewards program, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      To be clear, crypto still has far to go. According to Perlman, 250,000 people so far have joined the waiting list for the rewards card (to be formally issued by WebBank of Salt Lake City, Utah). That’s a modest start compared to fintech smash hits like the Apple Card, with an estimated 3 million users in the U.S. (especially considering that it's easier to get on a waitlist than qualify for credit).      The card, which is due this summer, will allow cardholders to spend fiat (U.S. dollars) and earn up to 3% back on purchases in bitcoin or any of the 30 or so cryptocurrencies available on Gemini, a Mastercard representative said via email.      According to Turner, there has been a shift in the way people want to be rewarded for purchasing things, especially in the last 12-18 months.      “Certainly three years ago, people probably weren’t as excited about earning crypto as they are now,” Turner said. “Understanding that, and using it as an opportunity to get more people involved in the cryptocurrency space in a safe way by offering rewards with something that people know how to use in their everyday life – which is Mastercard – is really an act of brilliance.”      Mastercard’s April announcement that it would be working with Gemini on a crypto rewards card was yet another boost in this year’s bull season for the cryptocurrency space. Following the payment card network’s dalliance with Facebook’s ambitious Diem project (then called Libra), Mastercard has continued to carefully wade into the digital asset space.    Volatility and taxes    Aligning itself with the concept of stablecoins is hardly surprising from Mastercard: The head-spinning volatility of cryptocurrencies presents an obvious obstacle to adoption for merchants.      “We announced recently that we will support stablecoins on our network, and that's because stablecoins don’t have volatility,” Turner said, adding that Mastercard aims to give consumers options, while essentially doing the type of things that they’re used to.      “It could be stablecoins today, it can be our normal card network other days, it can be an ACH for other things. We're a multi-rail organization,” she said.      Another stumbling block when considering a payments use case for cryptocurrency is the complex tax implications associated with using something classed as “property” rather than “currency,” as far as the U.S. government’s Internal Revenue Service is concerned.      The IRS treats credit card rewards as a rebate and, as such, considers them non-taxable, according to Gemini’s Pearlman.  “When you swipe your card and you get your 3% bitcoin back, we do not believe that that is a taxable event. However, subsequent transactions with those rewards could be considered a taxable event and may be subject to capital gains,” he said.    Sand Dollars and sandboxes    Mastercard has also been throwing its weight behind the concept of central bank digital currencies, which has led to sandbox explorations of how such digital currencies can solve specific problems from one country to the next, Turner said.      In particular, Mastercard has been public about a project linking its cards to the Bahamas sand dollar. (The sand dollar carries the same value as the Bahamian dollar, itself pegged to the U.S. greenback.)      Joining the Sand Dollar project in February 2020, meant Mastercard could push adoption of the CBDC, and financial inclusion across the 700 or so islands that make up the Bahamas, at a time when it was needed most, Turner said.      “I think the [coronavirus] pandemic has led people to be more digital, by force in some ways,” said Turner. “But in this case, it’s given the central bank a tool and the acceleration to reach people who may not have been digital in the past at a time that was needed.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/26/mastercard-exec-shares-thoughts-on-crypto-rewards-stablecoin-and-cbdc-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0bd8aa41617370523eaf29283307a77b8dd99ea-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYF6,1622058600,Lawrence Summers on Inflation: Fed ‘Will Only Remove the Punch Bowl After It Sees People Staggering Around Drunk’,"On the campaign trails in 2020, Joe Biden sought advice on the economy from neoliberal icon Lawrence Summers. Since he took office, the U.S. president is getting a lot more advice from Summers, albeit unsolicited and quite publicly.      Few of Biden’s most prominent supporters have been as openly critical of the administration and the Federal Reserve going full throttle on fiscal and monetary stimuli, respectively, as Summers.      The former Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and one-time director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama has been warning for several months that Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to stem a pandemic-caused slowdown could hurt the United States with inflation levels not seen in years.      “I think policy is rather overdoing it,” said Summers to CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, and Bloomberg host Joe Weisenthal in a pre-recorded interview broadcast Wednesday during Consensus 2021.      “Fundamentally, the magnitude of the policy changes now is rather greater than the magnitude of the policy changes that set off inflation between 1966 and 1969, where we went from the below-2% range to certainly the above-5% range in just a few years,” said Summers, who was also once chief economist at the World Bank and president of Harvard University. “We're taking very substantial risks on the inflation side, and we're taking them well after there was a need to hedge against the deflation possibility.”      While perhaps a throwback on some level to a bygone era of centrist consensus, Summers’ comments come as Biden tries to garner support for an additional $1.7 trillion in “infrastructure” spending on top of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress in March.      As a result, mainstream investors are seriously worrying about inflation for probably the first time since disco music ruled the airwaves. Inflation fears are thought to be a major catalyst for bitcoin’s run-up since October.      Among the reasons Summers cited was the high percentage of the fiscal stimulus (14% to 15%) relative to GDP at a time when the Federal Reserve is also buying bonds to the tune of about $120 billion per month to add dollars into the economy and to keep interest rates low.      “The sense of serenity and complacency being projected by the economic policymakers – that this is all something that can easily be managed – is misplaced,” he said.    Life of the party    Summers did not confine his criticism to Biden’s fiscal policy. Said to have been on Obama’s short list for Federal Reserve chair, Summers also had something to say about the central bank’s monetary policy.      The Fed has given up on ““preemption as a possibility” when it comes to inflation, he lamented. Trying to get things back on track down the road will ultimately be “uncontrolled, expensive and costly,” he warned      “We used to have a Fed that reassured people that it would prevent inflation,” Summers said. “Now we have a Fed that reassures people that it won't worry about inflation until it's staggeringly self-evident.”      To drive the point home, he used a Bacchanalian metaphor.      “The Fed’s idea used to be that it removed the punch bowl before the party got good. Now the Fed’s doctrine is that it will only remove the punch bowl after it sees some people staggering around drunk,” Summers added.    Threat of overheating    Summers also chided economists for not “changing its paradigm rather than reasserting the things they had been saying beforehand” when it appeared the economy was showing signs of bottlenecks in key parts such as housing and semiconductors as well as labor market shortages.      The Fed’s view that it should keep rates to near 0% through 2023 “seems to me at the edge of absurd,” he said.      “Nobody's suggesting that the Fed lurch into tightening,” he went on. “They're suggesting that the Fed recognize that the balance of risks has shifted towards overheating, a recognition they [the Fed] have not made. They're suggesting a recognition that some things might happen, that will necessitate, as the housing market goes up at 18% a year … [to] quickly stopping buying $40 billion of mortgage securities every month.”    Labor market paradox    While a supporter of higher minimum wages, Summers maintains that “an honest advocate of those policies has to recognize that they do have an inflationary tendency because they raise costs on employers directly and because they operate to make labor markets less flexible than they were previously. … I'm not a blind advocate of that reversal who fails to recognize that it's got some consequences.”      Those consequences are exacerbated by unexpected developments in the labor market.      “We are seeing something very powerful in the heat of the labor market. I would not have expected the pervasiveness of job shortages while we have unemployment at these levels,” he said. “I would not have expected that so many employers would be complaining that they're not able to find workers. I would have thought that the best argument for being relatively optimistic about this – that this was all going to work out okay – was the suggestion that when extraordinary unemployment insurance benefits ran out in September, people would go back to work in large quantities and then the labor market would be able to absorb it. But the Administration insists on denying that argument and insists on denying that unemployment insurance has an important impact.”      Summers had one more warning for those who, like him, support expansionary government policies on some level, arguing they have hurt his fellow Democrats politically in past decades:    “An Achilles heel of that Great Society-like view was its tendency to be inflationary. And I wish that the advocates of that view … should learn the lesson of the Johnson Administration's errors that elected Richard Nixon, and the Carter Administration's errors that elected Ronald Reagan, if their successes are to be enduring, and that's why I've been troubled by the policy posture.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/26/lawrence-summers-on-inflation-fed-will-only-remove-the-punch-bowl-after-it-sees-people-staggering-around-drunk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d4ba25bb7547032ae5307e4deae501f8a0ba55c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Formerly known as a crypto project, her project has devolved into a fintech play now known as diem.      Facebook met enormous resistance at home and from global regulators who believed its plan could significantly undermine the monetary system built by nation-states.      “You probably need to be a cowboy if you’re a startup – not coming from Facebook – to break down those barriers,” she said.

42406433,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuY1K,1622057911,Uniswap Holders Consider Arbitrum for Scaling DeFi's Top DEX,"With Ethereum layer 2 scaling project Arbitrum set to open to developers on Friday, decentralized finance (DeFi) behemoth Uniswap is taking notice.      That interest is evidenced by a community Snapshot poll “to gauge interest in deploying Uniswap v3 to Arbitrum.” The poll, deployed by Compound founder Robert Leshner, will last two days.      The move reflects a growing appetite for fee relief from the world’s leading blockchain for DeFi applications. As Ethereum’s native asset, ETH, has risen in price – and as DeFi on the network has swelled to a $62 billion concern – transaction fees on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap have become prohibitive for smaller users.      A number of scaling plays have emerged in recent months; some are clearly hitching their wagons to Arbitrum, which has yet to fully launch.      Arbitrum says it can offer drastically higher transaction throughput than Ethereum while slicing gas fees to near zero. The system uses rollup technology to batch transactions before slapping them on-chain.      Where DeFi projects such as Uniswap land will be an important factor in the ongoing “scaling wars,” with layer 2 solutions like Polygon, Optimism and Matter Labs’ zkSync vying to capture market share.    Read more: Ethereum Scaler Arbitrum Is Launching Friday With Developer Support From Alchemy    The Uniswap poll makes it clear this wouldn’t be a winner-take-all approach, but would increase the interconnectedness of the larger ecosystem. What Uniswap actually seems to be eyeing is other exchanges – be they DEXs or their centralized counterparts.      “In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot,” reads the post accompanying the poll. “This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.”      Leshner’s post also said the move could help to grow projects that can be built on Uniswap version 3.      “Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested,” it said.      One commenter on the forum said they did not think layer 2s like Arbitrum should be seen as competition, particularly as they don’t have tokens.      “In my opinion it would be good for Uniswap with regards to L2,” user Agusx1211 wrote. “Arbitrum is an alternative implementation of an optimistic rollup with different design principles and thus tradeoffs.”      Agusx1211 compared Arbitrum with another optimistic rollup project, Optimism. “Optimism can automatically follow Ethereum hardforks but Arbitrum has far less risk of reaching a non-deterministic state, and it can be used with the same contract bytecode as used for Ethereum L1 contracts,” they said.      At the time of publication, the poll showed 31.6 million UNI for the proposal and none against.      Uniswap governance is notoriously hard to execute. A contentious proposal to issue last summer’s UNI airdrop to those who interacted with the exchange via third-party interfaces saw overwhelming support from (potentially self-interested) voters but failed to reach a quorum for the vote to be executed.",POSITIVE,ETH | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | UNI | ARB | AIRDROP,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/26/uniswap-holders-consider-arbitrum-for-scaling-defis-top-dex,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42406453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYK1,1622055615,"Bitcoin ESG Concerns Might Slow Institutional Adoption, for Now","Bitcoin’s environmental concerns, pushed to the forefront by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, could slow big investors’ push into the cryptocurrency, but the market pause might be temporary, according to analysts and industry executives.      “Crypto needs to address renewable energy, and then it will be able to resume its bullish trend,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the brokerage firm Oanda, told CoinDesk in an interview.      Musk’s about-face earlier this month on letting electric-vehicle buyers pay in bitcoin – due to the potential adverse climate impact from energy-intensive crypto mining – has cast a pall over digital-asset markets.      That’s partly because investor demand for bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge was one of the biggest narratives contributing to the largest cryptocurrency’s price gains over the past year.      But now that trend has run headlong into another front-of-mind consideration for big investors: environmental, social and governance factors, known as ESG. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with $9 trillion of investor assets, wrote earlier this year in an annual shareholder letter that there’s a “sustainability premium” for investments with better ESG profiles.      It’s no secret that bitcoin mining takes a huge amount of electricity. A widely cited study by the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimated that the energy used by bitcoin mining exceeds the consumption of countries such as the Netherlands and UAE.      So Musk’s calling attention to the bitcoin ESG issue may force big investors to address the concerns before rushing in.      Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of the crypto fund firm Grayscale Investments, said Tuesday in a panel discussion at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference that he isn’t yet hearing from investors that environmental concerns have “somehow become a deterrent.” But he acknowledged that “it suddenly feels like more light is being shined on this one area.”      MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who has been one of the most vocal advocates for companies buying bitcoin for their corporate treasuries, noted at the CoinDesk conference that Musk’s tweets “caused bitcoin to dominate the news cycle all last week across mainstream media.”      “I think it became pretty clear that we have a good bitcoin story, but it's a very complicated story,” Saylor said.      Bitcoin prices have tumbled 34% in May to around $38,000, the biggest monthly drop since November 2018.            Saylor announced this week that he hosted a meeting between Musk and cryptocurrency miners to discuss the bitcoin ESG concern, and that the duo have created the Bitcoin Mining Council to produce data on miners’ energy consumption.      “That will give institutional investors comfort as they enter the space, and not cause them pause,” said Saylor. “I think the corporations would have the same thoughts that any other institutional investor has. They just want to be educated.”      A recent survey of 600 people in the fund management industry found that 96% expected their firms to increase the prioritization of ESG this year. John Reed Stark, former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Internet Enforcement, thinks that the bitcoin ESG concern will certainly dampen institutional investment in crypto.      ""There are very powerful reasons why the ESG argument could get enormous traction,"" said Stark, now an independent consultant specializing in digital compliance and a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University School of Law. ""If companies want to appeal to millennials, the best way to do it is to show how environmentally friendly they are.""      So far the signals are mixed.      BlackRock's Fink was asked Wednesday at the company's annual shareholder meeting whether the firm would invest in bitcoin, according to Reuters.      “The firm has monitored the evolution of crypto assets,"" Fink said. ""We are studying what it means, the infrastructure, the regulatory landscape.”      Jason Guthrie, head of digital assets at the exchange-traded fund specialist WisdomTree, says the bitcoin ESG concerns might still be too daunting for some would-be investors. Those who still want to get into digital assets might go straight to alternatives like ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, he said.      Ethereum’s blockchain currently runs on the same energy-intensive “proof-of-work” security system that bitcoin uses, but it’s planning to shift to an alternate known as “proof-of-stake” that requires substantially less electricity to operate.      “There’s definitely going to be a subsection of institutions that were on the sideline, looking to move in, and will make their first move into Ethereum for this reason,” Guthrie said.    'Stupid dialogue,' not stupid ESG    Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, said during CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" show Tuesday that “even within proof-of-work, it’s not prohibitively expensive to buy carbon offsets, and that’s something we’ve been looking into and pledged to start doing, to offset the energy usage that FTX has.”      “It’s a healthy occurrence in some ways because I think there was a lot of stupid dialogue going on about ESG, and stupid not in the sense that ESG was stupid, but that the dialogue was,” Bankman-Fried said.      Bankman-Fried tweeted last week he figures that for every $1 spent on blockchain fees a donation of $0.0026 would cover the needed carbon offsets.      Moya, the Oanda analyst, said that with the amount of institutional money backing crypto, the industry might be able to develop environmentally-friendly technological advancements or other ways of addressing investors’ concerns. That’s key partly because ESG concerns are so important to millennials. The pressure on the bitcoin industry to adapt was inevitable and might turn out to be a good thing.      “This is just a temporary slowdown,” Moya said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/26/bitcoin-esg-concerns-might-slow-institutional-adoption-for-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/775362f0a24af350e3739c0ddd7c66b6990133f7-1500x875.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking Wednesday at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference, Jose Fernandez da Ponte told moderator Jeff John Roberts that a withdrawal function is in the works. At present, PayPal does not let users move cryptocurrency holdings off-platform, though it has let customers buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since October 2020.      “We want to make it as open as possible, and we want to give choice to our consumers, something that will let them pay in any way they want to pay,” da Ponte said. “They want to bring their crypto to us so they can use it in commerce, and we want them to be able to take the crypto they acquired with us and take it to the destination of their choice.”      The company ships new developments every two months on average, he said, though it’s unclear when the withdrawal functionality is coming.    PayPalCoin?    On a rumor that PayPal plans to launch its own stablecoin, da Ponte was more downbeat. “This is way too early,” he said.      Roberts, executive editor of news site Decrypt, probed da Ponte about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), since the PayPal vice president said he has met with central bankers around the world.      “It absolutely makes sense that central banks will issue their own tokens,” he said. But he did not accept the common view that only one out of stablecoins or CBDCs would become dominant.      “Sometimes we position the debate as CBDCs versus stablecoins, but it’s a bit of a fake debate. There is no trade-off. We think they will co-exist.”      In da Ponte’s experience, central bankers have two priorities: financial stability and universal access. He could see plenty of ways to achieve stability with digital currencies, not only by backing a stablecoin with fiat currency but potentially by backing one with a CBDC.      And digital currencies could help expand access to the financial system, he said. He pointed out that one county in California, near where he lives, is a “banking desert”: there are no physical branches. That might not matter in a world where CBDCs have been rolled out across the country, he suggested.      But da Ponte was clear that there is a lot more work to be done. “On the subject of CBDCs, there are a lot of Powerpoints written, but not a lot of code written.”    Check's in the mail    He said he sees financial institutions like PayPal as the natural way to distribute CBDCs to the public when the time comes. The potential difficulty of this challenge was shown during the pandemic, when some people had to receive stimulus checks in the mail, requiring them to travel to a physical bank to cash them. “I think we can do better than that,” said da Ponte.      Digital currencies are not quite ready to offer serious payment cost reductions to people all over the world, in da Ponte’s view. His estimate of global adoption at 2% is simply not high enough. “But 10% adoption is where it gets really interesting, when it gets beyond the early adopters.”      PayPal opened trading on select cryptocurrencies to U.S. customers in November and began allowing users to pay for goods and services with crypto in March.      The company reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, with adjusted earnings of $1.22 billion, beating the average estimate from analysts of $1.01 billion. It was the second set of results to include PayPal’s crypto buying and selling service. The company has said customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as often as they were before they could buy crypto.

Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event Wednesday, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said plans first teased in early 2020 will have to wait until an enforcement action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is resolved.      “The likelihood that Ripple is a public company is very high at some point,” Garlinghouse told CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De, managing editor for global policy and regulation. “In the middle of an SEC lawsuit, you know, we need to get that closed out.”      The SEC alleged in December 2020 that Ripple Labs had conducted an ongoing and unregistered securities sale via the XRP token closely associated with its brand. The case is still in the process of discovery, with Ripple asking a U.S. judge to force the SEC to disclose why it came to the conclusion that bitcoin and ether were commodities, not securities like XRP.      “The good news was the court did grant Ripple’s motion,” Garlinghouse said. “All we've asked for, for two to three years, is that regulatory clarity, and so I think this is progress.”    XRP v. SEC    Garlinghouse said the specter of the SEC suit has not stopped Ripple Labs from working with partners overseas to fulfill its mission of enabling speedy, cross-border payments.      “In fact, the United States is the only country around the world that has XRP as a security, every other country in which we work, they view it as a currency,” Garlinghouse said.      He said Ripple has signed over 20 contracts this year, with Southeast Asia seeing strong growth.      However, Garlinghouse conceded the company suffered a major blow when it “paused” its relationship with U.S.-based money transfer giant MoneyGram this year.      “MoneyGram and Ripple had a consequential relationship which represented a couple billion dollars of ODL [On-Demand Liquidity] transactions,” he said. “We've paused that partnership in hopes of getting [regulatory] clarity.”      In characteristically smooth fashion, Garlinghouse also argued the SEC suit is likely to have broader repercussions, whichever way the court rules.      “This is about more than just Ripple. This is about more than just XRP. It really does have implications for all of crypto here in the United States,” he said.

42406440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuY9C,1622048738,Ethereum Scaler Arbitrum Is Launching Friday With Developer Support From Alchemy,"A new scaling project has entered the sidechain chat.      Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum rollup technology is set to launch on Friday, May 28 for developers, the firm told CoinDesk. The layer 2 solution offers drastically higher transaction throughput than Ethereum, and gas fees that are up to 270 times lower. It’s been live on testnet since 2020.      Arbitrum goes live in full as scaling platforms again surge in popularity. Projects like Polygon, Optimism and Matter Labs’ zkSync have either seen major funding rounds or their token prices soar in recent months. (Notably, Arbitrum has no token.)      In tandem with the launch, Offchain Labs is partnering with developer platform Alchemy to help devs more easily tap into the new network.      Alchemy, which is said to power 70% of the top Ethereum applications and over $30 billion in on-chain transactions, announced a similar partnership with Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain in March. Alchemy works with Dapper, OpenSea, Aave and many others.    Rollup ramp-up    Rollup technology is key to scaling Ethereum apps. A rollup is basically a sidechain aggregation of transactions in a smart contract that will settle to the mainchain at some future point. The “rollup” refers to the way the sidechain bundles many transactions to be committed to the mainchain.    Read more: Ethereum’s Top Dapps Are Increasingly Turning to ‘Rollups’: Here’s Why    Arbitrum is an “optimistic rollup”, meaning that state changes are first published with minimal inspection and fraud checking, allowing for additional speed. Any user, however, can flag invalid updates as fraudulent and the bad actors are punished by the protocol, while the updates are rolled back. The Arbitrum-Alchemy partnership drastically lowers the barriers to entry by meeting a large swath of developers where they already are.      “High gas fees and slow transaction mining times have been the biggest pain points for Ethereum developers and users for quite some time,” said Alchemy Product Manager Michael Garland. Arbitrum’s layer 2 technology provides a long-needed solution, he said.    Grabbing market share    In development since 2018, Arbitrum is the first general smart contract Ethereum layer 2 rollup solution to go live, according to Offchian Labs’ Director of Partnerships and Strategy A.J. Warner.      The success of any layer 2 rides on the adoption of both infrastructure projects and dapps, so given Alchemy’s reach in the blockchain developer community, native support is key, he said.      “Arbitrum, among other differentiating tech breakthroughs, is the only rollup that supports porting Ethereum contracts at the bytecode level (without making any code modifications),” Warner said via email.    Read more: Former Obama Tech Officer Raises $3.7 Million for Blockchain SaaS Startup    Arbitrum’s goal is to become the default layer 2 rollup for Ethereum users and developers. Crypto exchange OKEx recently announced it will support direct deposits and withdrawals into Arbitrum for its users to avoid expensive gas fees. According to Arbitrum, over 150 projects have requested launch-day access to Arbitrum.      “Alchemy’s developer platform and Offchain Labs’ layer 2 are two of the most critical tools available to blockchain developers,” said Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer at Pantera, which invested in Arbitrum, adding:    “Their partnership to push forward the Arbitrum ecosystem is truly game changing and would ensure Arbitrum developers have access to reliable, scalable infrastructure to build on.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | FLOW,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/26/ethereum-scaler-arbitrum-is-launching-friday-with-developer-support-from-alchemy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fccea315112266fe4352b7a8216ef10acacb1aff-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYD8,1622047593,"Users Decide Bitcoin's Consensus, but What Is a Bitcoin 'User'?","“If users decide Bitcoin’s consensus, what is a Bitcoin user?”      This was one of the principal questions that arose from the Bitcoin Core ""Foundations"" panel this Wednesday at Consensus 2021. Moderated by Bitcoin Magazine's technical editor Aaron Van Wirdum, veteran Bitcoin developers Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Rusty Russell and Eric Voskuil discussed the best ways to introduce and implement upgrades into Bitcoin.    Read more: Crypto Long & Short: How Bitcoin Development Is Evolving – And What’s Behind It    The topic is particularly salient given that Taproot, Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade since SegWit, is in the middle of activating right now.      As Van Wirdum put it on the livestream, “Taproot has broad consensus,” but there were months of controversy from Bitcoin stakeholders over how to bring the upgrade live. Unlike a centralized system, Bitcoin’s decentralized network requires communal cooperation to successfully activate an upgrade.      An upgrade is essentially a rule change, so it’s important to make sure everyone running Bitcoin’s code is using the same rules or else there may be a “chain split” that produces two incompatible transaction histories.      Bitcoin developers make upgrades “backwards compatible” to avoid this scenario (i.e., newer and older versions can still have enough of the same rules to not result in a split). Still, bitcoin is a roughly $1 trillion asset now, so Taproot’s activation discussion, which culminated in the Speedy Trial activation method underway now, was slow and steady.    Read more: Bitcoin Taproot Activation Has Begun; Miners Now Have 3 Months to Get on Board    Square Crypto Bitcoin Engineer Matt Corallo explained that, generally, there are two paths to upgrades: enforcing rules through node operators or enforcing rules through hashrate via miners. (In the case of Taproot, Speedy Trial is a crack at the latter.) The disagreement over how to activate Taproot was fought over whether or not it should be up to users to dictate upgrades or whether it’s all right to default to miner activation.    How do we define a Bitcoin user?    This dichotomy is complicated by the fact that, as Bitcoin developer and “Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Properties of Bitcoin” author Eric Voskuil put it, miners are users too.      Lightning Labs CTO Osuntokun highlighted the vagaries of the term “user” when using it to define consensus of Bitcoin’s community. Are users holders, spenders, code users?      “I think one critical thing is that people don't really define what you mean by user,” he mused.      Voskuil, Back and Russell all reinforced the points that, from a protocol consensus perspective, only those running and using a Bitcoin node to verify their economic activity are true users (so-called ""economic nodes""), given that they can choose which ruleset they choose to enforce. This voting power was crucial in tipping the scales in favor of SegWit, panelists said.    Read more: Hold the Fork: No 2x But Everything Else Goes at Scaling Bitcoin Event    “It's the people who are validating the bitcoin that they're receiving who are actually enforcing the rules,” Voskuil said.      Further, because it's users who enforce the rules, miners don't control Bitcoin, Back emphasized. ""There's quite a lot of confusion about miners deciding things and essentially miners have no say. They have a say in the sense of being a Bitcoin user or having usable Bitcoin protocols, but as a miner, they don't have any special say,"" Back said.      As such, Russell noted, “Miners also users. Miners are also very economic actors. Miners can also be developers,” a reminder that identifiers like “user” and “miner” are limiting and can ignore that oftentimes Bitcoin’s network participants wear many hats.      So it’s important to not paint “users” and “miners” with such a broad brush, Voskuil said at the end of the panel, less so to pit them against each other. After all, miners are often treated as having more authority than they do, while economic actors running nodes (those real “users” the panelists talked about) have more power than they are usually given credit for.      “I call this the kind of David and Goliath fallacy, said Voskuil. ""There are the users, or the little guy, and the miners are the big guy. I think it's not a good precedent, and it's not good thinking either. You've really got Goliath versus Goliath if you're going to pair those two off against each other.”      Updated (May 26, 2021 19:28 UTC): Article updated to clarify that the panelists said that only active node users, so-called ""economic nodes,"" have a say in protocol consensus.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/26/users-decide-bitcoins-consensus-but-what-is-a-bitcoin-user,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3aedb5211f84d9457c75f984f0fc2a44652cf7fd-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brooks expressed skepticism about the prospect of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) in an appearance on CoinDesk TV during the Consensus 2021 conference on Wednesday.      “I think in the U.S., it’s more a discussion than a reality,” Brooks said, adding he believes a CBDC will “never” be launched in the U.S. “That’s not what we do in this country: have the government build innovative structures.”      The private sector has already successfully occupied the digital currency niche, and there is no need for the government to jump in. Brooks continued:      “At the end of the day, if you look at the explosion of dollar-backed stablecoins even over the last couple of weeks, it shows me that in America, people still want innovative bespoke products, they want the kind of cool customer experience you get when technology is unleashed and offers you many options.”      There are several early-stage pilots underway to test the viability of a U.S. CBDC. The Digital Dollar project, led by ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo and Accenture’s David Treat, recently announced five.      Brooks believes the American public won’t like the government trying to control financial innovation in the vein of China, which is widely considered to have the most advanced CBDC project currently.      “The idea of funneling everybody into the [Federal Reserve] for a CBDC feels a lot like asking people to go back to the post office.

42406438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuY7E,1622047201,Nashville Couple Sues IRS Over Tezos Staking Rewards Tax,"A couple in Nashville, Tenn., has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over tax they paid on rewards for staking on the Tezos blockchain.      Joshua and Jessica Jarrett are requesting a refund of income tax paid in 2019 totaling $3,293 for the receipt of 8,876 tezos tokens, according to a legal complaint shared by a spokesperson for the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), an advocacy group aiming to bring legal and regulatory clarity to PoS technology. The Jarretts are also seeking a $500 increase in tax credits for lost income.      This is the first major suit filed against the IRS related to crypto staking rewards, the spokesperson told CoinDesk Wednesday.      The case has potentially far-reaching implications for how contributors to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains are taxed for the tokens they receive. The outcome could resonate with users of the much larger Ethereum blockchain once it switches to a PoS mechanism, expected later this year.      The Jarretts say they should not have been taxed on the tezos tokens until they were sold or exchanged. Federal income tax laws do not permit the taxation of tokens created through a staking enterprise, according to the document.      ""Like a baker who bakes a cake using ingredients and an oven, or a writer who writes a book using Microsoft Word and a computer, Mr. Jarrett created a property,"" the document says. (In the Tezos system, the equivalent of Bitcoin's miners are known as ""bakers."")      Just as pastry makers and writers are not taxed on the property they create, but on the income from sales, ""Mr. Jarrett will realize taxable income when he first sells or exchanges the new property he created,"" the complaint reads.      ""This is an issue of practical and economic importance,"" POSA founder Evan Weiss said. ""The wrong policy would drive innovation elsewhere ... Fortunately, the correct policy is set under existing laws.""      The IRS has yet to issue specific guidance on the taxation of crypto assets where staking is involved. Four lawmakers wrote to the agency in July 2020 asking for assurance that stakers would not face tax liabilities for receiving block rewards until those rewards are sold.

42406448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYG5,1622043104,Diem Co-Creator Says Original Plan for Stablecoin Was 'Naive',"The initial vision of libra – the controversial Facebook-led digital currency that since been renamed diem – was ""naive,"" the project's co-creator said at Consensus 2021 today.      But Christian Catalini, also the chief economist at the Diem Association, said the creators have learned their lesson and diem would be a success in the long term.      Diem went through multiple iterations since the initial publication of an ambitious white paper in 2019. Since then, the project got multiple slaps on the wrist from regulators worldwide, acquired and lost partners, scaled back its ambitions, moved to Switzerland, then returned to the U.S. earlier this May.      This May, Diem partnered with the U.S.-based Silvergate bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin.      Catalini explained the evolution of the project during his appearance on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" show on Wednesday, as a part of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference.      “We’ve been extensively engaging with the regulators across the globe, and as a part of that, our project has evolved in a number of dimensions. We’ve added additional controls to protect consumers, to combat financial crime on the network,” Catalini said.    Temporary exercise    Commenting on the keynote address of Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Consensus two days earlier, Catalini said he fully agreed with Brainard’s critical stance on CBDCs after the governor said they “may expose consumers and businesses to risk.”      “When you look at the stablecoin landscape today, many things are called stablecoins,” Catalini said, questioning the existing players’ stability and economic design.      Diem will be a totally different animal, Catalini said.      The project is willing to serve as a placeholder for the digital dollar, a U.S.-dollar backed CBDC (central bank digital currency) project that has been discussed over the recent months.      “What we’re really suggesting is more of a public-private partnership. We see this almost like a temporary exercise, where issuers like Silvergate in collaboration with Diem will be issuing a diem dollar, but the moment there is a CBDC … We are the only issuer of a stablecoin, to my knowledge, that committed publicly to phasing out our own token and replacing it with a CBDC token,” Catalini said.      He envisions the evolution of the U.S. financial system as a tech stack where a CBDC will serve as a base layer, and diem as “a payment network that enables new use cases and applications, on top of what the public sector will deploy,” Catalini said.    Back in the US    Because the regulatory environment in the U.S. has been evolving, Diem now feels more comfortable in the Western hemisphere, Catalini said of the organization's move from Switzerland to the U.S. And as the project moved from a currency basket to a single currency-backed token, namely, the U.S. dollar, it felt right to have a home base in the U.S.      “Under that regime, I think the FINMA license is not going to be required anymore, so we’re withdrawing our license applications,” he added.      When it comes to the world’s financial regulators, the Diem group is stepping very carefully: “We made it very clear that we wanna work together with central banks and find solutions that do not interfere with local rules and regulations,” Catalini said.      For that reason, people in countries with unstable currencies that might want to use a dollar-backed stablecoin as a store of value, just like they often use the U.S. dollar now, should not view diem as a solution: “The design of our network is really meant to mitigate the risk of currency substitution.”      Back in the summer of 2019, when the financial world was buzzing around Facebook’s token project, the company expressed great ambitions about libra (now diem), aiming to create “opportunities for the billions of people around the world that are excluded or are underserved by the incumbent financial players,” including banking services like lending.      The reality curbed those ambitions. However, Diem is still committed to serve the unbanked – just not that fast.      “We’ll have to work over time to develop better identity standards. It’s very difficult to differentiate a good user from a bad actor, so our work probably will take multiple years to unfold,” Catalini said.

42406445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuYC9,1622040546,Bank of Mauritius Plans CBDC Pilot in 2021,"The Bank of Mauritius is targeting a year-end rollout for the island nation’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot, the central bank’s governor said Wednesday.      Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021, Governor Harvesh Seegolam said the Republic of Mauritius is in the midst of finalizing its position papers on a CBDC and would publish “concrete examples” of its initiatives in the near future.      While discussions and initiatives surrounding CBDCs have been around for a while, China’s supercharged approach towards rolling out a national digital currency could end up accelerating the process worldwide, panelists said during the chat. The panel also included Greg Medcraft, director of the OECD’s directorate for financial and enterprise affairs and Loretta Joseph, a fintech adviser with the financial services commission of Mauritius.      “CBDCs will be here to complement, and to address gaps that the traditional monetary system is not able to fulfil,” Seegolam said.      Central banks worldwide have indicated that they might be examining the possibility of digitizing their fiat currencies, but concerns around compliance, security and privacy have also been on the minds of central bankers and digital currency proponents alike as they weigh the upsides and possible pitfalls of central banks entering a direct financial relationship with their citizens.      “I believe that in most countries, it will be optional whether a person chooses to actually use a CBDC,” Medcraft said. He added that it is possible stablecoins and state-issued CBDCs will co-exist in the future, giving the privacy conscious an alternative way to go digital with their fiat.      Seegolam added that the island nation has been consulting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on possible designs for its CBDC and that the global monetary body has been helping Mauritius with its tentative digital currency plans.      Noting that financial inclusion is also a priority when central banks consider issuing digital fiat, Seegolam added that that the trilemma between compliance, security and privacy occupies center-stage in the minds of central bankers when considering a CBDC rollout.      Medcraft said that core principles central banks would need to consider when thinking about their CBDC design would be “cross-border functionality, making sure that it supports the need of the economy and financial inclusion.”      Seegolam said that while CBDCs come with their advantages, they aren’t likely to replace cash but rather complement the existing monetary system.    CBDCs get serious    On a similar panel at the 2020 Consensus conference, Lord Meghnaud Desai, chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), noted that when issuing a CBDC, nations should consider whether poorer populations prefer using cash and how a digital currency could affect international remittances.      At the time, Seegolam said his central bank was moving closer to a CBDC pilot, though few details were available.      “We as central bankers, as governors, are speaking regularly on a bilateral basis to also see, what are the other use of collaboration policy that you know we need to work towards designing a lean system that would be able to speak with each other,” Seegolam said on Wednesday, adding that a shared standard for CBDCs worldwide will also be important as nations move forward in this journey.      “May CBDCs be with you soon,” said Medcraft, as the panel closed out, noting that the internet has taught us that the “walled garden” approach doesn’t necessarily work when it comes to technology.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/26/bank-of-mauritius-plans-cbdc-pilot-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ce8bcc1f83fbfa3f90005dd63c3129626bf7557-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXPX,1622032320,Tom Brady to Speak at Consensus 2021,"Football all-star and non-fungible token (NFT) entrepreneur Tom Brady has accepted a surprise invitation to speak at the closing night of Consensus 2021 with crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried.      Bankman-Fried, CEO of the popular crypto exchange FTX and liquidity provider Alameda, tweeted the invitation at Brady Wednesday morning – nodding to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team quarterback’s recent switch to a “laser eyes” profile picture.      Brady responded with a handshake emoji. He will join Bankman-Fried’s mainstage session Thursday at 8 p.m. ET, in the event’s closing keynote block.      Brady is among a recent wave of celebrity athletes to have endorsed open-source networks as a way to build and store wealth.    Tom Brady joins Sam Bankman-Fried in a keynote conversation on the closing night of Consensus 2021. Register here.    The trend began with National Basketball Association star Spencer Dinwiddie attempting to sell tokenized shares of his contract and offensive tackle Russell Okung’s crusade to get paid in bitcoin. It has since spread across leagues, sports and countries as dozens of athletes convert their salaries to BTC and embrace NFTs and social tokens.      But Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion who has earned the nickname the GOAT (greatest of all time), is arguably the biggest name ever to make this move.      Crypto offers a way for sports stars to potentially take greater ownership over their brands and reputations – considering their notoriously unstable contract agreements – by allowing them to monetize their own collectibles and interact with fans directly.      Okung has similarly praised bitcoin as a means to regaining financial independence.      Meanwhile, flush crypto firms are signaling the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies by inking deals with sports franchises.      Most notably, the NBA’s Miami Heat will now play at FTX Arena, after Bankman-Fried’s outfit purchased the stadium’s naming rights for $135 million. Grayscale Investments and Crypto.com are now also corporate sponsors of the New York Giants and Montreal Canadiens, respectively. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)

In early May, Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz tweeted a rumor that the seven-time Super Bowl champion was hoarding bitcoin and later challenged him to add laser eyes to his profile pic.

42386828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXED,1622028643,Fairlead's Stockton Plans to Add Bitcoin Exposure Only After Key Indicator Turns Higher,"Bitcoin has climbed 30% from its recent low. While the recovery looks impressive, one analyst, who predicted the recent price crash, intends to stay on the sidelines because technical charts have yet to show credible evidence of a reversal higher.      ""Once the weekly stochastics turn up, we would add exposure to bitcoin because it remains supported by positive long-term momentum despite its correction,"" Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published on Monday.      Bitcoin's weekly stochastic chart is trending south and displaying a value of less than 20, meaning the market is over-extended to the downside. A turn higher would confirm the bottom and open the doors for resumption of the broader bull run.      The stochastic oscillator compares the closing price of an asset with the range of its prices over a certain period to generate oversold and overbought signals that traders use as triggers for long and short trade entries. A reading below 20 implies oversold conditions, while an above-80 print indicates an overbought market.      The oscillator is one of the critical components of Dr. Alexander Elder's triple-screen trading system published by Futures magazine in 1986.      While the stochastic indicator is flashing an oversold signal for the first time since 2019, the MACD histogram continues to print deeper bars below the zero line in a sign of strengthening bearish momentum.      Thus, a V-shaped recovery to $50,000 and higher looks difficult. ""Resistance is now initially near $53,000, although it does not look in store for a near-term test,"" Stockton noted, adding that intermediate-term momentum is to the downside.      Other analysts hold a similar view. Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk on Friday that the recent price crash has eroded confidence, and bitcoin will take some time to regain upward momentum.      According to Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, bitcoin's immediate outlook remains bearish, as the lower-highs, lower-lows structure on the price chart remains intact despite the recovery to $40,000.      A move above the resistance band of $42,000-$43,000 would invalidate that bearish setup, although Kempenaer said he doesn't foresee that happening in the short term.      ""This rebound has potential towards the resistance area between $42k-43k, which will be hard to overcome straight out of the recent low,"" Kempenaer said in an email. ""Very likely more time is needed to build up a new base.""

42386845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXTJ,1622028600,Valid Points: The Risks and Rewards of Sharding,"Today is the third day of Consensus 2021, CoinDesk’s largest event of the year.      Complete with educational panels, workshops, keynotes, fireside chats, and networking experiences, Consensus assembles the best and brightest of the crypto industry to explore the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrencies around the world.      Like last year, Consensus is a fully virtual event. One of the perks from my experience of having everything online is being able to watch panels from the comfort of your own bed or listen to keynotes while cooking breakfast.      Even so, these types of events can get overwhelming with their jam-packed programming. So, take a break with me.      Whether you’re between panels at Consensus, getting started with your regular Wednesday workday or doing something else entirely, have a seat, take a breath and join me for a moment to explore what’s happening in the world of Ethereum 2.0.    Pulse check: Eth 2.0 Validator Gains  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Last week, I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations on just how much profit the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator has made since its activation on Feb. 17, 2021.      Factoring out the initial costs of purchasing the ether from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and transferring funds from a secure hardware wallet to the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, as well as the amount of ether lost due to technical difficulties experienced shortly after validator operations were activated, CoinDesk has increased its initial holdings of the crypto asset by 0.2 ETH.      Moreover, the price of ether has appreciated 450% since the ether was initially bought, which means CoinDesk’s total ether holdings of 32.7 ETH have risen in value from being worth around $15,000 to almost $85,000, at the time of writing.      It’s important to note that none of these funds are available to withdraw or transfer to any exchange from the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain due to the one-way bridge that only allows ether to move from the Ethereum blockchain to Eth 2.0 but not the other way around. This additional functionality will eventually be added to Eth 2.0 at some point after the Ethereum blockchain and the Beacon Chain are merged.      Once the merge is complete, CoinDesk plans to donate all profits to charity, just as it has from the beginning of this staking project. This is because CoinDesk’s mission in becoming a validator on the Eth 2.0 network at its most risky and nascent phase of development is not to make money but rather to report accurately about Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.      For more information about CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking operations, nicknamed “Zelda,” check out the official announcement post here.    Running costs    One factor that the costs and profit breakdown of Zelda (see above) does not show are the running costs associated with hosting operations on Amazon Web Services (AWS). At minimum, running costs should amount to $200/month (or roughly 0.077 ETH/month), according to CoinDesk Director of Engineering Spencer Beggs.      However, there are additional network charges that fluctuate daily, depending on how much data and bandwidth Zelda consumes. To track these running costs more accurately, Beggs has recently created a new tracking system within AWS that should be sending us more accurate numbers in a few weeks. (Stay tuned!)      But factoring in the minimum base cost of running Zelda on AWS, and estimating a monthly earning from validator rewards at 0.20841 ETH, CoinDesk still nets on average 0.1314 ETH or $344 in profit each month from staking operations.    New frontiers: An energy consumption comparison    Speaking of back-of-the-envelope calculations, Carl Beekhuizen also ran some numbers based on estimations of how much energy validators have been consuming on the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain.      Of the 140,000 or so active validators on Eth 2.0, Beekhuizen assumed roughly 87,897 were average at-home stakers and 52,695 were professional stakers, such as exchanges or staking-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses.      To make the math simple, he made additional assumptions that for every 5.4 validators an average at-home staker runs, their infrastructure would consume at maximum 100 watts of electricity.      For a professional staker, the assumption was similar: 100 watts of electricity for every 5.5 validators run. This, according to Beekhuizen, is “a gross over-estimate” of how much professional staking operations actually save in electricity costs through economies of scale. However, for the purposes of this quick and dirty calculation, the savings on electricity for a professional staker would only be slightly more optimized than for an at-home staker.    Doing the math    I will go one step further in simplifying by making the electricity costs of the at-home staker and professional staker equal, since they’re not all that different in Beekhuizen’s calculations. Thus, with these assumptions in mind, you get a total amount of energy consumed by validators to secure the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain of roughly 2.6 megawatts.      About the resulting total, Beekhuizen wrote:      “This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).”      He added that compared to the energy consumption of the Ethereum blockchain fueled by proof-of-work (PoW) mining, a PoS consensus protocol would ensure that Ethereum uses at least 99.95% less energy than it currently uses.      While these energy estimations are impressive and reinforce the core reason behind why Ethereum developers want to expedite the merge to Eth 2.0 as soon as possible, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.    Where PoS falls short    In a separate blog post published on Sunday, May 23, founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin explained that PoS, like PoW, still struggles with the same fundamental issue of limited transaction throughput. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum – even with PoS and greater energy efficiency – cannot easily scale up for millions and billions of users without sacrificing core principles of network decentralization and security.      To Buterin, this is why coupling PoS with a technology known as sharding is so important.      “Sharding fundamentally gets around the above limitations, because it decouples the data contained on a blockchain from the data that a single node needs to process and store,” writes Buterin.      As background, nodes are the computers that verify blockchain data and propagate it to the rest of the network. The more nodes there are, the more resilient and easily verifiable a blockchain is.      Traditionally, a node connected to a PoW blockchain will contain a full account of all on-chain transactions and addresses. However, a node connected to a sharded blockchain will only keep records of a fraction of on-chain data. To get a snapshot of a blockchain’s full transaction history and on-chain addresses, a user would need access to data maintained by multiple different nodes as opposed to just one.    Putting it all together    This is why for a sharded blockchain there is a minimum number of nodes required to reach a certain scale of transaction throughput. For example, for a sharded blockchain to process 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), and assuming each node can only process 50 TPS, then the network needs at least 200 nodes to function properly.      A sharded blockchain enables blockchain capacity and transaction throughput to increase along with the number of nodes, such that scalability does not sacrifice network decentralization.      There are risks to a sharded network. What if several nodes suddenly go offline? What if the network grows so large that a full copy of transaction history is no longer maintained by anyone in the network?      These risks are unlikely, according to Buterin, at least until Ethereum begins to break past a million TPS. To put that number into context, Ethereum currently averages around 12 TPS.      There will always be limits to blockchain capacity but the work to expand it by significant amounts without sacrificing network decentralization is a value and goal that Ethereum developers are working to crack.

Published Tuesday, the research report titled ""Shifting cross-asset correlations"" sets out to examine how different assets, including bonds, equities, bitcoin and gold, may influence each others' markets.  Looking at data from November 2020, when bitcoin experienced a major growth in market cap, DBS found that the top cryptocurrency has been positively correlated with S&P 500 futures in every month since.  The authors, Chief Economist Taimur Baig and credit and FX strategist Chang Wei Liang, said this means bitcoin can be considered a ""risky asset,"" though they add that the average correlation is ""relatively low"" at 0.20.  They also looked at whether extreme moves in bitcoin could have a knock-on effect on stock markets, finding that the correlation with S&P 500 futures rose to 0.26 during volatile events, from just 0.19 in normal conditions.  ""This suggests that broader equity sentiment could become more coupled with sentiment in bitcoin markets for a temporary period of time (60h), post an unusually large move,"" the authors wrote.  Other statistical tests backed up the data and showed that stock market volatility was ""markedly higher than normal"" after a big move in bitcoin.  As such, the authors concluded that ""bitcoin is no longer the fringe asset that it once was,"" and suggested market participants should monitor developments in the bitcoin market when conducting risk and sentiment monitoring.

Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, has said mining operations must cease until Sept. 22 due to the load they place on the national power grid, according to a report from Iran Front Page on Wednesday.  Rouhani said authorized miners use only 300 megawatts of electricity, while unauthorized operations use around 2,000 megawatts.  However, the temporary ban applies to all miners, he said.  The unusually dry spring has left Iran struggling with hydropower shortages that have already prompted clamp-downs on the local crypto mining industry.  Earlier this month, the energy ministry said miners using domestic power for their operations would face heavy fines and may have to pay damages.  It's also been reported that the country's intelligence agency has been recruited to track down illegal miners.  The need to halt all mining may come as a blow to Iran's coffers, since the state has been using locally mined cryptocurrency to bolster revenues amid tough international sanctions.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to $40,800 during the early European trading, a level last seen on May 21. Prices hit lows near $31,000 on May 23 and have been rising ever since.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $40,272, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency is yet to pass through the widely tracked 200-day simple moving average hurdle at $40,639.  Major alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are also gaining ground and flashing relatively bigger returns.  Names including MATIC, LINK and BNB have gained 10% to 14%, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading 6% higher.  Altcoins suffered sharp losses last week as bitcoin crashed. Ether fell by over 40%, registering its biggest weekly decline on record.  The latest uptick in bitcoin and other coins comes on the heels of the Bitcoin Mining Council's plans to address concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.

A representation of AP’s famous shot taken in 1945 of six U.S. soldiers raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima, Japan is the first NFT in the series titled “AP ARTiFACTS: The 175 Collection.”      For the sale, digital artist Marko Stanojevic has repurposed the 76-year-old Pulitzer-Prize-winning image taken by AP photographer Joe Rosenthal. The NFT also includes a musical score from violinist Nick Kennerly and rarely seen images from Rosenthal, as well as Iwo Jima film and audio from the agency's archives.      All images will feature artistic renditions rather than the original photo, according to a press release on Tuesday.

42386843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXQn,1621995982,Gov. Jared Polis Wants Colorado to Accept Crypto for State Taxes,"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he’s hopeful state residents can pay their taxes with crypto, and he wants it to happen soon.      “I’d be thrilled to be the first state to let you pay your taxes in a variety of cryptos,"" he said Tuesday at Consensus 2021.      As a congressman, Polis became the first politician to legally accept campaign donations in bitcoin after a favorable 2014 FEC ruling. In response to a U.S. senator who was more interested in banning bitcoin than building a federal structure to support cryptocurrencies, Polis satirically suggested a ban on U.S. dollars by replacing each instance of BTC in the Senator's letter with ""dollar bills.""      “The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity,"" he wrote.      Since he trolled legislators on Capitol Hill, Polis has become the Rocky Mountain State's chief executive, and on Tuesday he sounded excited to be at the forefront of accommodating legislation for crypto.      “Colorado is and will be the center for blockchain innovation in the United States, attracting investments and good jobs and innovators in infrastructure, digital identity, [and] individual data security in the private and public sector,” he said.      One huge step would be to allow Coloradoans to pay state taxes with digital assets. Pilots in other states haven’t gone so well.      In 2018, companies in Ohio were able to pay taxes through OhioCrypto.com, with processor BitPay converting the bitcoin payments to dollars for the treasurer's office. Arizona and Illinois considered accepting crypto for tax payments but advocates failed to push through legislation.      The Ohio program ended in 2019 under new treasurer Robert Sprague, who said that only 10 companies had used OhioCrypto.com to pay taxes.      A short-lived program in Seminole County, Fla., ended sometime after the county treasurer was arrested.      With far more infrastructure for crypto today, however, the adoption of state tax payments seems more plausible, and Polis sounded eager to be at the front of the pack. As a next step, he said he would speak to Colorado's director of revenue, Mark Ferrandino.      He also joked that “Colorado has better nightlife than Wyoming,” a neighboring crypto-friendly state, spurring a response from Wyoming's leading champion in the blockchain community, Caitlin Long.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cyrus Rothwell-Ferraris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/26/gov-jared-polis-wants-colorado-to-accept-crypto-for-state-taxes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98dbeff9bfbfedc6a132c7ed58d512a83eaf1630-1500x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386841,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXN1,1621994244,Chainlink's Founder Says DeFi and Oracles Can Help Fight Climate Change,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) could be crucial to combating climate change, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov argued at Consensus 2021 Tuesday.      Nazarov laid out two cases in particular where Chainlink 2.0's hybrid smart contract model, where blockchains provide security and decentralized oracle networks collect data off-chain, could help.      His comments come at a time when the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, especially those that use the computationally intensive mining system pioneered by Bitcoin, has become a hot-button issue. Most recently, Michael Saylor, CEO of software firm MicroStrategy, and Tesla chief Elon Musk convened a group of North American miners to promote energy-efficient practices and combat the public perception of crypto as a ""dirty"" industry.      Without mentioning that intensifying debate, Nazarov argued the transparency and economics of blockchains can steer human behavior in salutary ways.      ""Fundamentally, blockchains are very, very good at creating proof and creating incentives,"" Nazarov said.      First, he spoke about how oracle networks can help expand regenerative agriculture. This is a form of farming that leaves the land healthier as farming takes place, deepens the soil and captures more carbon in it for a longer time.      One challenge for expanding these practices globally is that agriculture is a high-risk field. Farmers in the developing world need help to protect against weather risks (such as droughts and flood).      ""I think what climate change will do is it will shift rain patterns and it will shift how rain patters will be utilized,"" Nazarov said, which will change weather risks, with more dramatic weather events.      But the analog world's insurance infrastructure often doesn't reach these places.      ""This is where I think decentralized crop insurance through insuretech protocols like Arbol that use things like Chainlink and Ethereum are truly amazing,"" Nazarov said.    See also: Bitcoiners’ Approach to the Climate Change Fight Isn’t Working – This Might    Chainlink is making its oracle network available to projects seeking to expand risk management beyond the typical reach of insurance companies.      Secoind, Nazarov said, oracle networks can help make carbon credit systems more reliable and trustworthy.      ""You're able to prove things that are meaningful about environmental outcomes,"" Nazarov said, tracking things like reforestation and carbon capture. This will make carbon taxing and credits something more reliable and trustworthy, he argued.      ""I think at the end of the day, you have a truly amazing ability to make DeFi as a market function,"" Nazarov said. ""More importantly, it actually creates a market for various societal outcomes.""      Nazarov also spoke to how the transparency of DeFi could over the long term make centralized financial products appear less appealing, reduce fraud across the global financial system and upgrade the atmosphere as it does so. All of this, he contended, is enabled by the ability to allow truly decentralized blockchains to access data from the real world.      ""The real fascinating thing for me is how people still have a question about whether things like DeFi or blockchain gaming will continue to grow,"" Nazarov said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | LINK | MARKET,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/26/chainlinks-founder-says-defi-and-oracles-can-help-fight-climate-change,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d57d09f05cbdfb2d4ee033b7c67c953df74bd8d3-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
