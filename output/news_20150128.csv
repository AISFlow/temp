42398174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjER,1422486939,BitFury Exploring Options in Bitcoin Cloud Mining Market,"Bitcoin mining company BitFury is looking to enter the cloud mining market.  BitFury has given no indication as to when its proposed cloud mining offering would launch. However, it outlined how it would provide hardware to partners, only adding supply based on demand, rather than selling hashing power without limit.  CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk:  “We are working on such a solution for the cloud market.""  The statements follow hints made by the BitFury CEO at the The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami earlier this month, when Vavilov discussed the ""opportunity"" he saw in the recently tumultuous space.  Eliminating risk  Vavilov explained how BitFury's involvement in the cloud mining market might work, which would see it establishing relationships with cloud providers and providing physical hashing power to then be sold to cloud customers.  ""Here is how it should work: cloud service enters business agreement with mining company; mining company approves cloud service and allocates certain amount of hash power for sale (wholesale); cloud service sells virtual GHs to its client,"" Vavilov said.  ""This way,"" he continued, ""the end client receives GHs straight from the mining company, so the deal is backed/guaranteed by the mining company through smart contract.""  Should something happen to the cloud service provider, he noted, the client would still have the hashing power from the mining company.  “This scheme eliminates maximum risks and is a win-win-win situation for all parties,” Vavilov added.  Changes in cloud mining  BitFury’s development comes under discouraging circumstances for cloud miners, owing to the recent drop int he price of bitcoin coupled with an elevated mining difficulty.  Earlier this month CEX.io announced it was suspended its cloud mining activities, saying it had become unprofitable following a drop in the bitcoin price that led to increasingly lower revenues. CEX previously relied on third-party mining partners to provide its hashing power.  However, BitFury isn't the only company that has voiced optimism amid a challenging environment, including firms from China's mining sector.  Bitmain  has continued to operate its cloud mining service after powering down less-efficient hardware, while ZeusHash, which earlier this month warned customers that it may have to suspend its bitcoin cloud contracts, began offering a new mining contract earlier this week. Other companies in the space have also expressed similar positivity about the model.  Stan Higginscontributed reporting.

42398176,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjIN,1422483316,BitGold Backed By Sprott in Public Stock Market Deal,"UPDATE 9th July 0:00 UTC: BitGold has indicated that while it uses blockchain technology, it has pivoted from a focus on bitcoin.      Toronto-based gold and bitcoin startup BitGold has gone public following a reverse merger with mineral exploration company Loma Vista Capital.  BitGold  will retain its name, but halt trading on the Canadian National Stock Exchange as it migrates to the Toronto Stock Exchange. As part of the deal, the company said it will raise C$6m in subscription receipt private placement, with an additional C$5m worth of warrants to be exercised later.  The pending C$6m subscription receipt sale includes commitments from Canaccord Genuity Corp, Clarus Securities, Dundee Securities and GMP Securities. However, perhaps most notably, the lead order on the round was completed by Sprott Inc and its individual directors, the $7bn asset management company formerly helmed by famed portfolio manager Eric Sprott.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Roy Sebag indicated that his primary motivation in taking the unlaunched company public was to build trust with its future customers. Sebag was also the founder and CEO of Loma Vista Capital, which went public in 2013.  Sebag said:  ”Why go public? In our case going public is like a quasi-bank license. We have corporate governance standards and an independent auditor, PriceWaterHouseCoopers, auditing or reviewing our financials four times a year under IFRS.”  The news follows the company’s $3.5m Series A round, finalized in December. Participants in that round included PowerOne Capital, PortVesta Holdings, Sandstorm Gold and Soros Brothers Investments, run by Alexander Soros, son of billionaire investor George Soros.  While public, Sebag indicated that the majority of shares are held by the company’s principal investors, himself and fellow co-founder Josh Crumb.  “We’re a public-private company,” Sebag added. “We own 60% of the company Josh and myself, and going public is more of a regulatory framework that will allow the company to establish more trust with its customers.”  Sebag has previously served as the founder and portfolio manager for Essentia Equity, while Crumb was a former senior metals strategist for Goldman Sachs.  Financial commitments  While still open, BitGold indicated that this new round of secured commitments will amount to a larger follow-up to its Series A, totaling C$11m at completion.  Despite the issues faced by other bitcoin companies that have gone public, though, Sebag positioned his platform as one that could expect different results given that it's not a traditional bitcoin company, but rather one that uses blockchains to tap into new efficiencies.  Sebag also stressed that he and Crumb are committed to the company financially as well, and that this should give users and the wider market increased confidence.  “There’s a for-purpose motive in this business,” he said. “Josh and I don’t take salaries, we really believe in this idea.”  Sebag elaborated on his vision for expanding access to gold with the help of blockchain technologies, stating that he intends BitGold to be a tool that allows those with a lower economic status to obtain the benefits of gold ownership.  Platform details scarce  Though it’s emerged as a newsmaker, BitGold remains tight-lipped about its forthcoming product, set to complete its beta launch in two weeks.  However, Sebag remained adamant that, when live, BitGold will improve on existing gold and bitcoin offerings.  “You can drop in a bitcoin and it turns into physical gold, and you can redeem the physical gold to bitcoin,” Sebag said in a more candid moment. “We’re fully compatible with blockchains like bitcoin and ripple, but the platform itself, a lot of it is built around security.”  Still, he rejected comparisons to other gold vendors and blockchain-based gold trading services, adding: ""It’s like saying that any company that’s trying to do payments is like a PayPal.""  Sebag did, however, suggest how he envisions the BitGold product to compete in the market, positioning it as a security and volatility solution for bitcoin holders, offering the same benefits of cold storage at a lower risk.  BitGold is expected to open to the public between 50 and 60 days after the beta launch.

42398177,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjMJ,1422465803,NYDFS: Coinbase Is Not Licensed in New York,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has issued a new statement indicating Coinbase has not yet secured a license to operate in New York.  The remarks, relayed by a spokesman to The New York Times, suggest that the department, which is currently working on a final version of its BitLicense regulation, is still in talks with Coinbase about its legal status in the state, but that no decisions have been finalized.  The NYDFS spokesman said:  “We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing and will continue to move forward expeditiously. That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms.”  The Times also received a statement from Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam in which he stated the company will “continue to work” with the NYDFS as it finalizes its BitLicense proposal.  Coinbase has indicated that it believes it is operating in a “gray area” in New York and California due to the fact that both states have yet to decide on how to move forward with bitcoin-specific regulation.  The publication went on to speculate that such actions, while not inconsistent with the development of tech companies, could set back efforts to improve bitcoin’s reputation with the public. The company is also not facing any monetary penalities at this time for its actions, the Times suggested.  The statements notably follow a consumer alert from California’s money transmitter regulator, the Department of Business Oversight (DBO), to the people of California, in which it said that Coinbase is not licensed or registered to serve state consumers.  A final version of the BitLicense is expected to be released in January.

42398180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjJM,1422463917,Manhattan DA: We’re Watching Regulated Exchanges With ‘Immense Interest’,"Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr has indicated that his department intends to watch developments in the bitcoin exchange sector with “immense interest”.  The remarks came during Vance’s keynote address at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists' (ACAMS) AML Risk Management Conference on Monday, and coincided with the news that the DA’s office had shut down more than 70 bitcoin scam sites originating in Southeast Asia.  A long-time advocate for more stringent regulations in the bitcoin space, Vance used his platform to decry the technology as one that makes criminal conduct “too easy and too untraceable”.  Perhaps most notably, however, his speech included veiled remarks seemingly aimed at bitcoin service provider Coinbase, which launched its exchange product on Monday.  Vance said:  “You may have seen news recently about an effort to ‘take bitcoin mainstream’ by creating the first regulated bitcoin exchange for American customers. We are watching efforts like these with intense interest.”  Boon for law enforcement  Vance went on to say that regulated exchanges would be beneficial for law enforcement, should these companies support its efforts.  “We believe a regulated exchange would provide opportunities for law enforcement and AML professionals to work together to discuss typologies, examine cash-ins and cash-outs, and keep our world safer from terror and financial crime,” he said.  Since Monday, Coinbase has clarified that it believes New York to be in a legal ""gray zone"" that allows it to service customers.  The high-profile launch of its latest service, widely billed in the media as the ‘first regulated bitcoin exchange’ in the US, has also attracted the attention of the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO), the state’s financial services regulator.  The DBO moved to deny perceived claims made by Coinbase that its product is regulated in its jurisdiction.

The month long 'Money and Society' MOOC (massive open online course) will be targeted at ""monetary innovators and activists from any political persuasion"", and look into ""the essence of money and how it has been interpreted and misinterpreted over the last three millennia"", according to the university.      Among other things, the course will seek to address the ""dangerous assumption, prevalent in the bitcoin community, that money is best understood as an asset with value in itself"".      Professor Jem Bendell, co-designer of the course, said:      ""Once we understand that a currency is a process, not a thing, we can explore and design the innovations that use currencies as tools in service of a productive community.""              More than one hundred students have already signed up to the course, which is due to start on 16th February. Notably, the British university also accepts bitcoin for tuition fees.

42398171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjDS,1422446009,Developer Proposes P2P Bitcoin Implementation for Reddit,"Reddit's cryptocurrency engineer, Ryan X Charles, has caused a stir with his proposal to implement bitcoin on the platform.  Under username 'ryancarnated', the developer revealed how he aims to enable peer-to-peer payments on Reddit, but for the time being he describes the service as a ""proof of concept"".  The implementation would allow users to register their bitcoin address and receive payment from other users.  “People already use Reddit for a bunch of commerce-related [things]. Making this easier and integrated could be really valuable,” said Charles.  The Reddit thread on which the proof of concept was announced has already attracted hundreds of comments, mostly positive, and offering suggestions for extra features such as escrow.  Users who frequent r/bitcoin are no strangers to experimentation. A couple of months ago, the subreddit experienced a ChangeTip tipping frenzy.  Charles says his bitcoin implementation still has some way to go before the community could use it, however.

42398169,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjCT,1422436235,'Bitcoin Funfair' Will Take Digital Currency to Stockholm's Consumers,"An event dubbed the Bitcoin Funfair will take place in Stockholm next month with the aim of encouraging use of the digital currency among consumers.  The event, organised by The Forumist, a group of creative Swedish individuals and bitcoin users, will host upcoming designers, entrepreneurs and vintage shops who will showcase and sell their products.  To encourage shopping, visitors will be asked to exchange a minimum of 100 Swedish krona (SEK) into bitcoin, which they will be able to spend, save or exchange back into fiat currency if unused.  When asked about the purpose of the event, Gustav Bagge, content creator at The Forumist, said:  ""We just want regular people to discover bitcoins, and help young upcoming artists, designers and innovators learn about the possibilities of permission-less innovation.""  The idea, he continued, was to demonstrate to people, business owners, innovators and emerging entrepreneurs that bitcoin is a fun, modern and simple tool for economic transactions.  Something for the kids  The Funfair, described as ""a flea market from the future with dazzling colours, delicious food, fascinating products, enchanting music and entertainment"", will take place on 14th and 15th February in Stockholm's Södra Theatre.  The organisers have also opened up the event to children. Kids Hack Day, a group which encourages technology-related play among children, will be present to supervise them as they swap, sell or buy items from each other using bitcoin.  Bagge said that ""there seems to be a great interest for something like this"", and confirmed plans for future events, citing Tokyo or Barcelona as possible destinations.  He added:  ""We are tired of reading about hacks and thefts in the mainstream media, when the reality is that bitcoin is an amazing new technology that empowers anyone to start a business.""

42398178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjNI,1422420114,BitFlyer Raises $1.1 Million from First-Time Japanese Bitcoin Investors,"BitFlyer has closed a fundraising round of 130m JPY ($1.1m), led by Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, Recruit Holdings Ltd. subsidiary RSP Fund No. 5 and GMO Venture Partners.  This is bitFlyer's third round of funding, bringing the Japan-based bitcoin services firm's total investment to $2.93m since it launched in early 2014.  In a statement, bitFlyer said it will use its new capital to set up overseas offices, improve security, recruit new talent, accelerate service development and carry out marketing and advertising campaigns to promote business growth.  When it announced its second funding round in October, CEO Yuzo Kano hinted Singapore may be bitFlyer's first overseas target thanks to its bitcoin-friendly regulatory environment.  Participating investors  The funding round included at least one familiar name to the bitcoin industry in Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.  Bitcoin Opportunity Corp invested in bitFlyer's previous round, and has been integral in funding numerous well-known digital currency startups around the world including BitPay, Coinbase, Ripple Labs and Xapo.  Recruit Strategic Partners  , a subsidiary of Japan-based company Recruit, is a Tokyo-based venture capital firm that funds tech startups around the world, mainly in the US and Japan. It also has an office in Silicon Valley, and lists crowdsourcing and financial technology as two of its primary investment targets.  GMO Venture Partners  is the VC arm of GMO Internet Group, which has invested over 5bn JPY ($42.3m) in 51 tech companies. It is located in Tokyo and Singapore.  This is the first investment in a bitcoin firm for both Recruit and GMO.  Leveraging relationships  BitFlyer also wants to use the new funding to expand its customer and revenue base by leveraging relationships with its investment partners, another factor it said will help its international operations.  One such relationship is with GMO parent and payments gateway GMO Holdings, through which bitFlyer has already gained access to over 48,000 online merchants and even started a bitcoin-based consumer rewards scheme through PointTown, owned by GMO Media.  A market-order style bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer charges 0.5% plus 0.0004 BTC on buys, and 0.01 BTC to sell. BitFlyer has also launched a mobile app for iOS devices and offers multiple tiers of accounts for personal and business customers.
