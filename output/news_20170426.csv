Outlets such as Times of India, The Hindu and Hindustan Times report that as many as 18 individuals have been arrested in connection with OneCoin events in the country. The arrests took place on Sunday, according to the outlets.  Police are also said to have confiscated funds from bank accounts associated with the individuals – believed to have been collected from would-be investors – totaling more than $2m. An official told The Hindu that authorities believe that additional accounts may exist, but due to the fact that those accounts weren’t explicitly connected to OneCoin companies, tracing them could prove difficult.  According to the reports, the arrests and subsequent account seizures came after Indian police went undercover during a recent OneCoin event. Attendees were allegedly promised big gains – a common refrain among OneCoin supporters – at the end of next year.  The news represents what is perhaps the most significant crackdown on OneCoin – accused of operating a Ponzi scheme under the guise of a digital currency investment program – to date.  Earlier this month, BaFin, Germany’s top finance regulator, shut down a Germany-based payment processor that was collecting payments on behalf of OneCoin. BaFin also seized €29m from accounts tied to the processor.  Central banks in areas believed to have been targeted by OneCoin promoters, such as Nigeria and Uganda, have issued warnings in recent months. Police in the City of London are also investigating the scheme, as previously reported.

42427500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnFh,1493238022,Former Coinbase Engineer Launches Ethereum Search Engine,"A former software engineer for cryptocurrency exchange startup Coinbase has launched a new search engine for ethereum, the second largest blockchain platform by market cap.  Created by Antonio Juliano, dubbed Weipoint and unveiled in a Medium post, the tool is designed to provide a means to search for, say, a smart contract underlying a particular project or token.  Though unrelated, the release comes days after Coinbase itself revealed that it is testing an app called Token, which will act as both wallet and browser for ethereum apps.  According to Juliano, Weipoint will eventually act as a decentralized application (or DApp) browser as well, with planned functionality for other ethereum-based resources.  Juliano wrote:  ""Weipoint can be used to search for and interact with ethereum smart contracts. We're planning to add search for entire dapps in the near future and eventually anything behind decentralized domain services such as ENS.""  The project is, according to Juliano, envisioned to go one step further, acting as a means to verify the code underlying smart contracts.  ""It's currently too hard for all but the most technical users to determine which dapps are trustworthy and secure. Similarly, it's also difficult for dapp creators to establish trust for their users,"" he wrote.  In this way, he said Weipoint will aim to verify reputation and ownership, while helping ensure their security.  It's a compelling pitch, given issues in the past with ethereum smart contract-based projects such as The DAO.  That initiative collapsed following the exploitation of a flaw in the code that resulted in the loss of tens of millions of dollars with of ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, last year.

42399783,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyieV,1493231814,Bitcoin Price Sets New Single Exchange All-Time High,"The price of bitcoin reached the highest level observed at any time, on any exchange today, reaching $1,411 on British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex.  However, far from a rallying cry for bitcoin enthusiasts, the bitcoin price has emerged as an outlier among those offered by its global peers. At this value, bitcoin on Bitfinex was trading more than $130 higher than it was on OKCoin, nearly $100 above its price on Kraken and roughly $90 higher than Coinbase's GDAX exchange.  Notably, the cryptocurrency's price on Bitfinex was also trading more than $100 above the price of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), an index from which it was recently suspended.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $1,299, just below its all-time high of $1,325.  At the time of report, the cryptocurrency’s price had pared these gains somewhat, trading at roughly $1,410.00. But, as for what to make of the increase, traders have been less clear.  On one hand, the cryptocurrency's price rallied in spite of the industry's ongoing scaling dilemma and continued banking challenges, while on the other, those very issues have stoked concerns across the ecosystem.  When asked about the sentiment among traders, BTC VIX, organizer of bitcoin trading community Whale Club, said there are now concerns Bitfinex ""may never have access to USD clearing again"", and that this was creating a ""Bitfinex premium"" in the market.  The result, he alleged, has been heightened bitcoin buying amid concerns that access to fiat funds at exchanges could decline.  Banking freeze  Indeed, spreads have widened as cryptocurrency exchanges – most notably Bitfinex – have struggled with ongoing banking challenges that are preventing customers from making formerly routine deposits and withdrawals.  However, the exchange is not alone, as OKCoin and BTC-e have also recently reported issues with US dollar transfers.  Earlier this month, Bitfinex announced that it was experiencing delays in its outbound wire transfers as a result of problems involving its Taiwan banks. Bitfinex cited the refusal of Wells Fargo, its correspondent bank-to process these transactions as causing the problem.  Only days after revealing this challenge, the exchange announced that it was refusing incoming wires. At the time, the spread between Bitfinex bitcoin prices and prices on other exchanges widened, rising to more than $90 in some cases.

As profiled by CoinDesk last year, Mediachain sought to develop a platform that would enable creators to attach information to projects and create a record on the bitcoin blockchain. That information would then be stored on the InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS.  While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, according to Spotify, the startup's team will be integrated into its New York offices where work could continue on similar initiatives.  Spotify said in a statement:  ""The Mediachain team will join our New York City offices and help further Spotify's journey towards a more fair, transparent and rewarding music industry for creators and rights owners.""  In a blog post announcing the move, the Mediachain team said that its Mediachain protocol will remain open-source.  ""As we sync up with Spotify, we will turn Mediachain over to the [open-source software] community — all source code and documentation will remain open source and openly licensed,"" they wrote.  The startup declined further comment when reached.  Mediachain previously attracted $1.5m in seed funding from a number of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.

42399775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiXc,1493222363,Ripple Adds 10 New Financial Firms to 'Blockchain Network',"Ripple is adding 10 new banks and financial services providers to what it's now calling its ""blockchain network"".  Founded in 2012, Ripple has raised nearly $100m for its distributed ledger tech and related payments products, but it has been increasingly active of late in seeking to formalize enterprise partnerships amid a wave of high-profile consortium efforts.  The new partnerships find Ripple showcasing its reach and influence. New members include MUFG (Japan), BBVA (Spain), SEB (Sweden), Akbank, Yes Bank (India), Axis Bank (India), SBI Remit (Japan), Star One Credit Union (US), EZ Forex (US) and Cambridge FX (Canada).  In an interview, Ripple VP of product, Asheesh Birla explained the company is beginning to define its offerings in more collaborative terms. While its product allows for faster cross-border payments, Ripple is also creating a set of standards for banks to follow while using its underlying tech, he said.  Birla told CoinDesk:  ""You need a whole ruleset, and that's why we call it a blockchain network and when we say that partners are joining, they’re actually agreeing to the standards and rules that accompany the technology as well.”  The new partner banks and companies are a mix of inbound and outbound services. As Birla explained, Indian banks Yes Bank and Axis Bank are receiving more cross-border payments rather than issuing payments out.  MUFG in Japan, on the other hand, manages both. ""They would be processing payments for a lot of Japanese that want to send money to other destinations like Turkey and India but then there’s a lot of demand for sending payments into Japan as well,"" he said.  Faster payments is one advantage, but members also cited other advantages.  Evan Shelan, chairman of EZ Forex said, ""The benefits [of the blockchain] are about adding the most advanced level of security to each payment through the distributive ledger for our financial institutions.""  Global reach  Of course, a global network is perhaps a natural fit given Ripple's recent focus on the cross-border DLT opportunity. According to Birla, many banks are feeling the need to process more international payments than ever before.  As such, Birla framed DLT as an advance that could help financial institutions with a broader set of problems. For instance, without a standardized procedure, he argued things gets messy when operating payments to several different countries.  ""[Banks are] looking at this as a new kind of service that they can offer that would compete with a lot of the startups in their space,"" he said.  Still, work needs to be done to boost the Ripple ecosystem, and Birla said that banks were chosen, in part, due to their expertise with their local regulatory environment.  Birla concluded:  ""The reason that we chose to work with banks is that they are experts in local regulation. A lot of them have that pull and understand the regulatory environment and we built our product in such a way that it fits within the different regulatory schemes around the world.""

42399778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiWd,1493220249,Nevada Senators Unanimously Advance Blockchain Tax Ban,"Senators in the state of Nevada have unanimously backed a proposal that would block local authorities from instituting taxes or fees on blockchain use.  According to public records, after just over a month of deliberation, the Senate advanced the measure following a 21-0 vote, with zero abstentions.  As CoinDesk reported last month, it’s the first measure of its kind that would prevent local officials from charging money to use a distributed ledger or a smart contract tied to one. Sen. Ben Kieckhefer initially submitted the measure on 20th March.  The bill stipulates:  ""A local governmental entity shall not: (a) Impose any tax or fee on the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity; (b) Require any person or entity to obtain from the local governmental entity any certificate, license or permit to use a blockchain or smart contract; or (c) Impose any other requirement relating to the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity.""  Other elements of the bill would clear the way for smart contracts and blockchain signatures to become acceptable records under state law, similar to a measure that was signed into law last month in neighboring Arizona.  The bill now moves to the Assembly – the lower chamber of Nevada’s bicameral legislature – for further consideration.

42399787,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiiR,1493215999,"Bitcoin's Price is Nearing All-Time Highs, But Market Confidence Isn't","While the price of bitcoin is within striking distance of all-time highs set in March, worries about the state of the network's infrastructure are combining to depress sentiment.  Chief among concerns are the ongoing issues at British Virgin Islands-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex, as the market's dominant US dollar exchange saw banking problems appear seemingly out of nowhere earlier this month.  To recap, it was revealed just weeks ago that Bitfinex has been unable to process outbound wire transfers from the banks it works with in Taiwan. The issue, the exchange said, was that Wells Fargo, acting as a correspondent bank for those Taiwanese institutions, had refused to handle those transactions.  However, the issues at hand go deeper than simply one exchange.  Complicating matters is that some fear Bitfinex's problems could prove systemic due to its ties to other exchanges. Further, with bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals still barred at major exchanges in China following a crackdown by the country's central bank, it's difficult to determine just how much of the market is functional at the moment.  Long-time bitcoin investor and blockchain startup founder Vinny Lingham went so far as to call the situation ""perplexing"", saying that he's unable to read the current situation. (And this statement comes from an investor nicknamed ""Bitcoin Oracle"" for his ability to predict price movements).  Lingham told CoinDesk he fears that investors may be at risk due to the banking issues observed at Bitfinex, describing this as the ""reality of the situation"" given current information.  Still, others went a step further. Nejc Kodric, CEO of digital currency exchange Bitstamp, called the situation ""similar to Mt Gox"", a reference to the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in customer losses.  Kodric further stated that he doesn't believe the current price reflects ""organic growth"", while worrying that issues could compound, creating a serious issue for the market as a whole.  ""There are three things that an exchange can have trouble with. The first is having a hack, the second thing is being shut down or warned, or anything around regulators, and the third is getting your accounts shut down,"" he said, adding:  ""You can survive the first two. But the third is a big one. That's a lethal injection for an exchange.""  Other commentators have largely brushed off these concerns, expressing optimism that the exchange – which paid back customers after a $65m loss in a matter of months last year – has shown the capacity to weather blows.  Already, the exchange is said to be looking for other banking options.  Domino fears  Other market observers have discussed fears that a domino effect could play out should Bitfinex's banking issues prove prolonged, or worse, fatal to the health of the exchange.  So far, it seems investors are taking precautions.  An address identified as a Bitfinex cold wallet (where it keeps user funds away from live internet connections) shows customers are withdrawing bitcoin holdings in the account steadily.  A lesser-publicized development is that Tether, a startup offering a digital asset tied to the US dollar (and that shares a common ownership with Bitfinex) has seen its offering lose its dollar peg. In short, the technology behind tether aims to tie cryptographic keys with real-world value, ensuring $1 is always worth one 'USDT'.  At press time, however, Tether has been trading below the $1-mark for over a week. It's currently trading at $0.91, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  But while the idea for a ""stable cryptocurrency"" or one pegged to fiat money isn’t new, research from the Cato Institute shows past attempts have largely failed, with projects such as CoinoUSD and NuBits experiencing notable issues.  Tether, however, has perhaps reached a scale beyond these projects, serving as one of the primary trading vehicles for Poloniex, a cryptocurrency-only exchange. (Poloniex has traded $5m in USDT over the last 24 hours, and has used the token since 2015 as a way to offer an alternative to fiat funding).  Shawn Wilkinson, CEO of Storj, a startup from the early crypto 2.0 scene that would spawn Tether and other early blockchain applications, lamented that the idea itself is perhaps flawed.  ""Basically it only takes one bank account frozen or some cash being seized and suddenly fractional reserve,"" Wilkinson said. ""And in crypto that's almost a 100% certainty.""  The more extreme doomsday theory goes something like this: Should USDT fail because of issues at Bitfinex, this could in turn impact Poloniex, thereby increasing the total market damage given that Poloniex is a leading exchange for both new and existing cryptocurrency listings.  Representatives from Tether declined to comment when reached, though the project's co-founder and former CEO, Reeve Collins, said he was optimistic about that the issues would be short-lived. (Collins is no longer involved in Tether and is working on his own blockchain stealth startup).  ""I'm sure they will pull through. The utility of that coin is too great to not overcome the bumps in the road,"" Collins said.  Opportunity calls  For now, however, active traders appear to be migrating to over-the-counter buy and sell options due to issues at major exchanges. What's more, overall exchange volume appears to have declined since the year began, according to available market data.  Bobby Cho, a trader at OTC firm Cumberland Mining, reported an increase in transactions and overall interest in its offering in recent weeks.  ""Since the announcement from Bitfinex and Tether about intermediary banking difficulties, we have seen firsthand that bitcoin trading volume is moving away from Bitfinex and Tether towards over-the-counter trading,"" he told CoinDesk.  Zhao Dong, a private OTC trader based in China, noted that participants in that market – long one of the more dominant for digital currency trading – share similar concerns.  ""Weird market now,"" he remarked. ""Chinese exchanges can't withdraw bitcoin, the biggest exchange Bitfinex can't withdraw US dollars.""  Still, he said any change in the market brings opportunities for savvy investors, and that well-connected network users are still easily able to ""cash out"" through the range of available global exchanges.  Same-old song  Yet for all the new drama, legal sources in the industry say these latest issues are part of a very old problem.  The tension between the banking industry and the nascent bitcoin startup space isn't exactly new, though it tends to rear its head periodically. Nor is Bitfinex the first exchange service to have problems with Wells Fargo, as CoinDesk reported back in 2014.  Back then, it had become increasingly clear that major banks weren't willing to accept the perceived risks. As a result, some institutions moved to close accounts held by bitcoin startups.  But the banks aren't just targeting bitcoin companies – financial institutions worldwide have been shuttering accounts held by companies that offer money services in a bid to trim the risk of potential laundering.  According to Carol Van Cleef, financial technology lead for law firm BakerHostetler, correspondent banks like Wells Fargo have been scrutinizing not only their customers, but also their customers' customers in recent years.  It's this state of affairs, she suggested, that may have ensnared Bitfinex. But it's unclear at this time what drove Wells Fargo to take the action it did – the bank has, to date, declined comment on the matter – or if it simply arose from the confusion banks have experienced in an era of growing regulation.  When it comes to policing activity, Van Cleef said simply:  ""There’s confusion about how far banks have to go.""  Stan Higgins contributed reporting.

The firm is opening the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust to investors beginning today. The vehicle was first unveiled earlier this year, and is modeled after other offerings by the company, which specializes in investment products centered around digital currencies.  According to Grayscale, the ETC trust has been seeded with $10m, with funding drawn from Digital Currency Group; its founder and CEO Barry Silbert; and Glenn Hutchins, a DCG board member and co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake.  The trust is being pitched to accredited investors, with a minimum investment of $10,000. It will charge a 3% sponsor's fee, with one-third of that amount being contributed to the development of ethereum classic during the first three years.  Ether classic is the cryptocurrency that underlies the ethereum classic network. Ethereum classic came into existence in mid-2016 following the collapse of The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle built on ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization.  The launch comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission begins to consider an investment vehicle for retail investors centered around ether, the cryptocurrency of ethereum. As reported by CoinDesk, the agency is weighing whether to approve the listing of an ether ETF first proposed last summer.  The market movements come amid a time of increasing diversification in the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, with investors seeking opportunities beyond the oldest, and more liquid bitcoin market.

42399779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiZa,1493209854,Blockchains and Personal Data Protection Regulations Explained,"Jacek Czarnecki is an attorney at Warsaw-based law firm Wardynski & Partners, where he specializes in areas including fintech, digital currencies and blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Czarnecki discusses data protection laws in the EU, outlining in an easy-to-read overview how they present both challenges and opportunities for industry innovators.  Not a day goes by when we don't hear about a new application for blockchain technology.  A cryptographically secure distributed ledger (secured by means of member consensus) is turning out to be the solution for many problems and inefficiencies in the world around us.  And this isn't just about technological improvements or the reconstruction of business models: different blockchain use cases will leave a mark on the economy, society and, perhaps, also on politics.  Blockchains – especially public ones such as bitcoin or ethereum – break many paradigms, including legal ones. We are thus entering an interesting transition period when successive applications of this technology will encounter legal norms not always adapted to the new reality.  One of the more interesting examples to look at is personal data protection.  Legal regulations protecting personal data are of great importance in many areas where blockchains already exist: finance, healthcare, electronic identification systems, etc. And while the application of existing data protection regulations in blockchain technology will cause issues, there are solutions.  Challenges and benefits of blockchains  First things first, why are blockchains a challenge for the protection of personal data? There are three main reasons:  Blockchains are decentralized and distributed. It is virtually impossible to identify the entity responsible for what is happening on the blockchain and for the processing of personal data.  Blockchains are public and transparent. As a rule, all information on a blockchain, which may include personal data, is accessible to everyone.  Blockchains are non-editable. It is impossible to change or delete information contained on a blockchain (eg personal data). Transactions are irreversible.    Why are blockchains an opportunity for personal data protection?  Blockchains are decentralized and distributed. Currently, various trusted third parties process our personal data. These entities are centralized and, therefore, often constitute single points of failure. Leaks of unimaginable amounts of data as a result of cybercrime often occur in the form of an attack on a single entity, such as a hospital, email service provider, etc.  Blockchains are public and transparent. We do not currently have any effective control over who processes our personal data and how. In fact, the data subject is in control of their personal data only to a restricted degree. Upon a transfer of that data, the subject loses control over how it is subsequently used.  Blockchains are very safe. Through the use of cryptography (digital signatures, encryption, time-stamping) and systemically embedded economic incentives for network maintaining entities, blockchains provide a fairly secure way of storing and managing information, including personal data.    What legislative problems are we facing?  The legislation that most governs the protection of personal data in the European Union is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Although the GDPR is said to have been designed to be technologically neutral and adapted to processing personal data in different contexts, structures and manners, in the case of blockchain technology, many questions are raised, nonetheless.  The answers will be different for different types of blockchains, but here are some issues that need to be addressed:  Who is the controller of personal data on a blockchain?The controller determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Does such an entity exist at all in the context of a distributed blockchain? We can potentially treat transaction-confirming miners as controllers (in the case of the proof-of-work consensus) – something that in the case of large public blockchains will be unfeasible in practice.  Which laws should be applied to blockchain technology?In situations where it is not possible to identify the personal data processing entity and the place where the data is processed (there are probably as many of these entities and places as there are network nodes), it is difficult to pinpoint the jurisdiction which will be appropriate for the legal assessment of data processing – in other words, the applicable national law.  What constitutes personal data in the blockchain context?The concept of personal data is becoming more and more broad. So can we treat public keys as personal data? After all, they do not have the features of anonymous data and they are often associated with specific natural persons, although their characteristics are similar to pseudonymized data.  Does the blockchain limit the purpose of collecting and processing data and its minimization?According to the GDPR, the specific purposes for which personal data is processed should be specified, explicit and legitimate (purpose limitation). The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimisation). These are just examples of principles set out by the GDPR. Meanwhile, in a public blockchain, data is maintained on every node of the network and is publicly accessible to anyone, regardless of the original purpose of their collection and processing.  Are blockchains compatible with the personal data protection system by design and by default?  How to realize the right to be forgotten?Blockchains are practically non-editable and data held therein is often impossible to update, delete, change or correct.  Who is liable for violations of the above requirements and obligations, since it is not possible to indicate the data controller?    What lies ahead?  A look at blockchains through the prism of data protection laws – especially laws as ambitious as the GDPR – is an interesting exercise, since it is not just a question of concluding that the application of this technology will generate legal problems.  This is only one side of the coin.  Blockchains may also become key components of future institutions, systems and mechanisms developed to cope with data protection regulations. For maximum efficiency, blockchain elements will likely combine with traditional solutions.  The advantages of this technology can be used to build a truly effective framework for the protection of personal data, in which the data subject will have actual power to control how their data is used.  Therefore, we are facing quite a challenge. We should interpret the laws, and design and build blockchain applications, in a manner that maximizes their synergy. Otherwise we will be stuck in a situation where the law will hold back the development of technology and innovation, while personal data will be protected less and less effectively.

Barring any unexpected hiccups, a highly anticipated code change is set to lock-in on the public litecoin blockchain today. With the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit), litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, should see a boost in the capacity of its currently limited transaction throughput, among other changes to its protocol.  Adding impact to the news is the context in which this upgrade takes place.  SegWit has been at the heart of bitcoin's scaling debate since it was first proposed at the end of 2015. On that network, miners have been hesitant to support the change for technical and political reasons, and as such, users have been calling to test the technology on litecoin as a way to determine whether concerns are valid.  Since SegWit could potentially pave the way for technologies that expand the value proposition of cryptocurrencies, the move toward accepting the upgrade has reignited excitement around the normally less-popular cryptocurrency. Litecoin's price has nearly tripled since the end of March as a result.  But, what's the big deal? Why are some in the community so eager to see the change?  Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards argued that the upgrade might pave the way for other technologies to be tested on a live platform, such as the long-proposed Lightning Network and sidechains – a sentiment echoed by mining pool F2Pool operator Wang Chun when contacted by CoinDesk.  And, oddly enough, some see it as a way to move forward bitcoin’s scaling debate, even if it's unclear exactly how that might happen.  Immediate impact  As the rules are coded into litecoin, the change will lock-in when 75% of blocks over a two-week period feature a snippet of code flagging support for SegWit.  If by a predetermined point (block 1193472), 75% are still flagging support, then the code change will activate, making SegWit a permanent piece of the litecoin network.  At press time, this decision was roughly 600 blocks away.  After that, there are two weeks or so to go before the change officially activates to give wallets and users sufficient time to adopt the change. This process was originally described in BIP 9, a specification that outlines the currently favored method of making consensus-level changes to bitcoin.  Further, it’s a backwards-compatible change, so litecoin services don’t need to upgrade to support the transactions if they don't want to. And, perhaps partially because litecoin transaction volume is still low, wallets don't seem to be in a rush to do so.  ""LiteVault may support creation of SegWit addresses in the future, if the demand for them exists. And at that time, LiteVault will be upgraded to be able to spend from those SegWit addresses,"" said a spokesperson for the popular litecoin wallet.  He added that, as far as he knows, no wallets currently support SegWit-style transactions.  Lightning Network too?  The bigger consequences of the change are a bit longer term.  For one, it seems likely that an up-and-running version of the Lightning Network will also be deployed on litecoin, meaning yet another scaling solution originally designed for bitcoin may see live testing on the smaller network.  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said that he’s working with Lightning Labs on the possibility.  Meanwhile, another Lightning Network startup ACINQ recently tested its version of the top-layer network on litecoin. It noted that, since the cryptocurrency is very similar on a technical level to bitcoin, it works nearly ""out of the box"".  These sorts of developments might breath new life into the cryptocurrency, since, despite being among the top five cryptocurrencies for a while, litecoin has been all but a barren field of innovation for some time. (F2pool's Chun, for instance, even went so far as to joke that litecoin doesn't have any developers.)  Community support  As for now, it seems last-minute foils to the plan are unlikely due to a consensus from miners. Even mining firms that staunchly oppose SegWit on bitcoin (ViaBTC and Bitmain) have indicated they plan to continue to support the plan.  The Litecoin Foundation's Richards argued that litecoin users “unanimously” support the code change, and that the ""politics really only exist on bitcoin"", stating:  “If there was any doubt this is what the users want, then it has been thoroughly stamped out as even anti-SegWit pools are upgrading to support SegWit under the pressure.”  Yet, SegWit was designed to help to expand transaction volume, and, while this might seem necessary for bitcoin right now (since blocks are filling up), ironically, it isn't exactly necessary for litecoin. At press time, the cryptocurrency has about a fifth of the transaction volume observed with bitcoin.  So, does it really need the transaction capacity boost? Some, including Charlie Lee, have framed it more as a step towards SegWit adoption on bitcoin.  Jack Liao, CEO of litecoin mining hardware developer LightningAsic, for instance, admitted to CoinDesk that he expects the upgrade to do ""nothing"" for the litecoin economy.  ""But it can push bitcoin community to active SegWit as soon as possible,"" he said.  Henry Brade, CEO of investment platform Prasos, added that it might mark the first time that another altcoin will work as a technical testbed for bitcoin changes.  He further suggested that, if SegWit proves to be safe, it will put more pressure on bitcoin mining pools to adopt the change.  He concluded:  ""At least, a lot of people are hoping it will. There’s a lot of frustration about the whole issue.""

42399776,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiYb,1493200787,Overstock Caps Series A for Bitcoin Startup Ripio With $400k Funding,"Ripio, the bitcoin startup formerly known as Bitpagos, has officially closed its Series A funding round with a $428,000 investment from Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Series A – led by China-based VC fund Huiyin Blockchain Venture – brought in a final total of $2.25m and is intended to fund the newly rebranded firm's plans for international expansion.  Further, the Medici investment marks a change to Ripio's original funding plans, which had been to close the Series A with smaller investors via the AngelVest platform.  In interview, Ripio senior vice president David Garcia said that, in addition to launching new features on its platform, his firm is seeking to expand to Mexico and Colombia in coming months.  Garcia said:  ""We are looking to use the funds to keep the leading positions in the countries where we have operations and also grow our operations to new countries.""  The Argentina-based firm, which now employs 25 people, has already expanded into Brazil and aims to establish itself in the new markets as early as the end of this quarter. The startup – which provides bitcoin exchange, payments and credit services – now claims 70,000 users, an increase of 10,000 since January.  Money in the unbanked  Medici president and Overstock chairman Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk that, when he heard of the opportunity to join the round, he was first attracted to the combination of the startup's peer-to-merchant services and its advances in cross-border remittance services.  However, it was the firm's location in Latin America that sealed the deal, he said.  An estimated 70% (about 400 million) of people in the region either do not have a bank account or are counted among the 'underbanked', meaning their access to financial services is not sufficient for basic requirements.  ""In the payments space,"" Johnson said, ""it feels like blockchain is very well positioned for the unbanked, which the current technology and systems are not.""  The Ripio funding, he continued, represents a deeper expansion of Medici's portfolio into the potentially valuable remittance use case, with the company already having invested in Peernova, Bitt, SettleMint, Factom and IdentityMind.  As part of the new investment, Johnson added, Medici is expected to take an ""observer"" seat on Ripio’s board of directors – a position he distinguished from more formal voting board members.  While the individual who takse up the role has yet to be determined, Johnson said ""it's likely to be a technologist"" with the expertise to help Ripio make business-critical decisions.  Garcia commented:  ""We will really take Medici Ventures as a strategic partner – not only for the funds, because of the experience they have at the whole company.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripio.

42399767,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiPk,1493197212,EU Report: DLT Could Increase Cyber Risks for Financial Institutions,"The proliferation of new technologies such as blockchain poses an increasing risk to Europe’s financial system, according to a new report.  The risk report, published by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities last week, examines the threats facing the EU's financial system from a number of factors including the ""increasing interconnectedness"" brought about by technology.  The Joint Committee, formed in early 2011, includes representatives from the bloc’s key regulators: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).  One area of concern cited in the report is the ever-growing cost burden of ensuring cybersecurity, while the growth of fintech – including distributed ledger tech – is considered a long-term risk for firms that provide financial infrastructure, such as central securities depositories.  From the report:  ""Finally, the intertwining of FinTech and [financial market infrastructures], for example through distributed ledger technology (DLT), anchors cyber threats as a long term but rapidly evolving risk for these companies.""  Though the report doesn’t specify what such ""cyber threats"" might be, a study published by ESMA in February points to some possibilities. According to the research, potential vulnerabilities include key management and access to hardware systems that might make up a future DLT system.  Despite the concerns, the authority said at the time it would be “premature” to explore regulations specific to the tech.  The latest report does, however, explain more generally that some of the risks stem from a lack of institutional knowledge and poor IT management, and it goes on to recommend that financial institutions move to address these concerns.  ""Inadequate IT governance can contribute to poor operational management practices and inadequate recovery and resilience solutions,"" the report argues. ""Supervisors should consider to further assess the resilience of financial institutions to cyber security and ICT risks.""
