Web3 is designed to operate through decentralized protocols, which are also the foundational blocks upon which cryptocurrency is built, and as time goes by, the two continue to synchronize. Web 3.0 has also been garnering people&apos;s attention on Wall Street in recent times due to its revolutionary potential over the internet, making it immersive for the masses; this has attracted more investors towards web 3.0 stocks such as AMD and Apple.

DeFi plays a role in bringing all the concepts together in a space where users can own and exchange value over blockchain ecosystems. But how exactly does DeFi stand out in the NFTs and metaverse story? The following pointers do tell. What is Decentralized Finance? DeFi is a phrase in many conversations involving blockchain and cryptocurrencies, yet it does not attract as much attention. So, what is DeFi? The term refers to a financial ecosystem without a regulatory body to oversee transactions or value transfers between users. It is a user-user interaction that involves value exchange in the form of crypto, NFTs, or other valuable assets. The takeaway in the meaning of DeFi is the absence of a third-party entity moderating the value exchange based on predetermined rules. DeFi projects are becoming popular with the establishment of web 3.0 facilities that will sustain the needs of the metaverse.

But, as the network grows, it has been facing challenges, with scalability and high gas charges topping the list. As there are thousands of Dapps using ETH, there lies a demand for more computing resources. The need for more resources led to the birth of Layer-2 solutions, which are basically networks that reduce transaction traffic from the main chain by providing alternative computation chains. This guide looks into the five best Ethereum layer 2 solutions. So, without any further ado, let&apos;s dive in. 1. Polygon Launched in 2017 as the Matic network, Polygon can expand Ethereum&apos;s TPS to just about 7000 TPS. CNBC recently reported that Polygon has managed over a billion transactions, with over 2.7 million monthly active users since launch. Due to the high TPS, Polygon has lower gas charges than ETH. Polygon has formed partnerships with many projects like Graphlink, Umbrella network, Kambria Open Innovation, and Mogul Productions to offer optimal services. Top projects like Sushiswap, Chain Games, Quickswap, and Aavegotchi leverage this layer-2 solution. The network&apos;s native token Matic is an excellent long-term investment option. In 2019, it was trading around $0.0035 and surged to $2.7 in 2021. Currently, the coin is trading at $0.5, but analysts predict that it could hit $10 by 2025.

31207,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238708,1655055350,Bridging The Gap Between Traditional And Crypto Markets With Bividends,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly developing. The launch of crypto-based services on decades-old traditional platforms is one method to promote awareness. Dividends in Bitcoin, popularly referred to as Bividends, are one such innovation that&apos;s drawing traditional players. One of the world&apos;s leading blockchain technology companies, BTCS, came up with the concept. The value of BTCS rose by as much as 67% after the company announced plans to pay a dividend in bitcoin to its shareholders. This was the first time ever, that a company had issued a bividend, or bitcoin dividend, to shareholders. BTCS thinks that by temporarily removing shares from its tradeable float, it would increase the usage of cryptocurrencies, develop its shareholder base, reward current owners and tighten its float. Before we delve further into Bividends, let&apos;s first see how bividends are different from dividends. What is a Dividend? Companies and investment funds regularly distribute dividends (a portion of profits or earnings) to shareholders.

One of the main factors contributing to their rapid emergence and growth is their ability to sidestep the traditional financial systems. This decentralization has allowed digital assets to reduce the cost of transactions and accelerate their transaction speeds. It also creates a parallel investment system that will enable investors and entrepreneurs to take advantage of the available opportunities in the market. Due to the complexity of the digital asset market, tax authorities are not able to come up with a common strategy to address the various tax issues related to its growth. The varying tax implications of ownership, purchase, and sale have created an environment of uncertainty for both individuals and corporate tax teams. However, some reasons highlight why it is illogical to tax cryptocurrencies.

42394207,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhaB,1655049000,Texas Feels Like Bitcoin Country (Maybe Because I Was There for a Bitcoin Conference),"Another week. Another conference. Another dose of “wow – Bitcoin sure is cool.” The end of this past week was dominated by CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival, where around 17,000 people descended on Austin, the world’s hottest city (as far as I’m concerned), to learn more about crypto.  But I came early to check out a far-less-attended Bitcoin developer conference hosted by Base58 called “bitcoin++” (a clever dedication to the purist computer scientist’s favorite computer language, C++). If you didn’t already know, I quite like developers. I wrote about them twice (here and here); here goes thrice.  This week, I want to lay out what I thought were the three most important things from the conference since I’m fairly certain you – dear reader – weren’t there. Based on the scheduled talks and ad hoc conversations I had during downtime, those important things were: 1) Lightning, 2) design and 3) education.  That (and maybe more) below …  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  I’d be remiss if I didn’t first give proper praise to the Base58 team for putting bitcoin++ together. Base58 is a Bitcoin education company headed up by Nifty Nei and Stakamoto. Their connections throughout the Bitcoin community, broad expertise and just plain, pure hustle allowed a non-developer like me to enjoy the conference. All said, I hope it happens again next year.  Anyway, so about those three things.  Lightning Network: Bitcoin can be peer-to-peer digital cash  I partially self-selected into these particular presentations, given where my interests lie, but many of the scheduled talks were about the Lightning Network. There were discussions about splicing (by @dusty_daemon), Amboss’ network explorer (by Thomas Jestopher), Lightning node implementation/development kits (by John Cantrell) and managing liquidity (by Nifty Nei, who so happens to be a Lightning developer by day for Blockstream). But at the periphery of these talks, I had conversations with conference attendees and they were all generally excited about Lightning.  I think there are two main reasons for that excitement. First, Lightning is trying to scale Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s inability to scale is a common (and viable) rallying cry against it. And second, it’s a fun technical problem for developers to work on in a world more willing to “move fast and break things,” a meaningful divergence from Bitcoin development, which moves at an intentionally and mind-numbingly slow pace.  Bitcoin design: Bitcoin literally has an image problem  Besides meeting Lightning developers at the conference, I also got to know an unexpected number of people who were there “exploring.” Also unexpectedly, many of them had marketing backgrounds. Expectedly, these were unexpected because I wasn’t thinking. Bitcoiners (like me) have long said that Bitcoin has a “marketing problem” because of its unapproachable user interface. The visual design of Bitcoin is generally not great.  Yes – purists love the idea of downloading beautiful code in a not-so-beautiful wrapper but, as Jarol Rodriguez called out in his aptly titled “Dark Mode” presentation at bitcoin++, uglier things are generally perceived as lower quality. Rodriguez drove that point home with screenshots of Bitcoin Core, the main software that connects machines to Bitcoin. While the code is (allegedly) beautiful, the interface is (decidedly) not.  Rodriguez thinks poor design hurts adoption, and has called for “designer-driven design, rather than developer-driven design.” While bad visual design doesn’t annoy the committed bitcoiner, it bothers the tangentially interested bitcoiner. I tend to agree. I have a sticker on my laptop that reads: “Design bitcoin for everyone” from Bitcoin Design, a free open-source community.  I tell you this not so that you think I'm cool, but rather because it’s important. If Bitcoin is supposed to be for everyone – for the 1.7 billion unbanked adults, for the 1.2 billion people living in countries with double-digit inflation, for the 13% of Americans who are underbanked – it should be designed for everyone.  Bitcoin education: The more you know, the more you don’t know  Last, and most obviously, education was an important theme at bitcoin++ (it is run by an education company, after all). Many people mentioned to me that their desire “to learn” was their main reason for attending. What’s more, a well-seasoned anonymous (only because I forgot his name – it wasn’t Socrates or Plato, though) attendee told me that “the more I learn, the more I learn that I don’t know.”  There is a lot of good and bad information about Bitcoin out there. While there are 100 million bitcoiners, only a subset of that 100 million understands Bitcoin. No, not everyone needs to understand the code behind Bitcoin (I know I don’t), but understanding what the technology is trying to achieve and how it’s working to achieve it is important. Finding good information is not yet easy. That’s why there is such an aggressive (sometimes too aggressive) push by bitcoiners to educate (and shill) anyone they can about Bitcoin.  Punctuating that, two developers in attendance mentioned they were writing books about Bitcoin. Nifty is penning one about transacting with bitcoin, and Alyssa Hertig (Voltage, and frequent CoinDesk contributor) is writing one about Bitcoin governance.  Is Bitcoin Southern?  But if you’re going to take something ideological away from the newsletter, I submit this: “Bitcoin is Southern.” Like American Southern. Nifty said this to me and it felt rather profound once I peeled back some of its unsavory layers (which I will do here, because words matter).  “Bitcoin is Southern” isn’t a literal statement. Yes, there are lots of Bitcoin companies in Texas, but it’s not that. Bitcoin is rebellious. No, not rebellious in an ugly, bad way, but rebellious in a good way. Rebellious in the way that more-sparsely populated regions prefer a smaller, less overreaching government structure. The ideal where “the government is going to ruin your money, and so you buy gold” feels Southern. I grew up in the American South, and so this tracks anecdotally. And Bitcoin fits that ideal.  So, yeah, Bitcoin is for all, but it feels Southern to me.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/12/texas-feels-like-bitcoin-country-maybe-because-i-was-there-for-a-bitcoin-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b336b72ec81c5bcfe19fbda0075df1ac911f37e-1069x802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bad news is that the Dogecoin price can still fall further down as the bears appear to have bypassed the triangular structure that has latched ferociously around it the previous month. With the structure breached, the bears could pump in more capital to earn more from the DOGE plunge. The bearish candle is now falling head-first which boosts the confidence of many traders to go all-in with the bearish stance. Suggested Reading | Dogecoin Market Cap Shed $6-B Last Month - Will Bearish Pressure Continue The Pulldown? DOGE&apos;s price currently sits at $0.075. And a pause is expected before it goes for a bull run at $0.072. However, the bearish outlook will remain until the liquidity at $0.068 is driven out. Another strong indicator of a bearish control is the DOGE price wasn&apos;t able to get through the Relative Strength Index 40 level. Dogecoin Mining Revenue Down Despite DOGE being down by 89.50% from its all-time high, it seems to have jumped up by 12.78% from the cycle low it has been lingering on at $0.07. Regardless of the little improvement, DOGE mining revenue is still down at 76.2% in the last year, making the popular meme coin one of the less profitable mining options around, according to crypto market data aggregation and analytics platform CryptoRank.

The coin saw a record of 9 weeks of unceasing losses. The drop in its value led to a decline in several digital assets, and the repercussions spread across the crypto world. Amidst all the uncertainty, the question that arises is- Why is crypto crashing? The start of the Bitcoin bearish plunge can be traced back to March of this year when the Terra announced its decision of buying $10 billion in BTC for its stablecoin reserves. Shortly after, the Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy and Terra collapsed completely. Terra and its sister token Luna together knocked more than $270 billion of the crypto market&apos;s trillion-dollar value. This led to heavy Bitcoin volatility, and the cryptocurrency fell by nearly 38%. What Specifically Triggered The Crypto Crash? UST lost its dollar &apos;peg&apos; (the policy of setting a fixed exchange rate for a currency against a foreign one or a basket of currencies) recently, the value sinking to as low as 12 cents. The stablecoin eventually collapsed as investors panicked and sold off their tokens. In addition to this, the general panic over inflation and fear of a potential recession have resulted in equity and crypto markets plunging considerably. Investors everywhere are treating Bitcoin as a &apos;risk-on&apos; asset, and thus amidst rising fear over inflation, many of them have ...",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LUNA,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/9-weeks-of-continuous-losses-what-spurred-bitcoin-volatility/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=9-weeks-of-continuous-losses-what-spurred-bitcoin-volatility,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
