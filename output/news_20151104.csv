42378328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hySV,1446678010,Accenture: Asia-Pacific Banks Should Develop Blockchain Strategies,"Asia-Pacific (APAC) banks, credit card firms and startups can be expected to increasingly focus on blockchain technology in the coming years, according to a new report by Accenture.  The management consulting services firm, which has recently been assertive in voicing its opinions on the emerging technology, stated that this trend would coincide with the need for FinTech firms to streamline operations and comply with regulations.  The prediction formed part of a new report that projects FinTech investments in the Asia-Pacific region will ""quadruple"" in 2015, rising to $3.5bn this year, up from $880m in 2014.  ""As a stand-alone technology, blockchain could help banks, credit card companies and clearinghouses collaborate to create safer, faster accounting and optimize capital use by reducing counterparty risk and transaction latency,"" the report reads.  Accenture  notes local blockchain services firms such as BitX and Bitspark, the latter of which was previously accepted into an Accenture accelerator, as examples of startups working to bring products and services based on the technology to APAC merchant services and remittance markets.  In particular, the firm notes that it believes future blockchain products and services can be expected focus on the securitization of physical assets as part of a migration of the technology to back-office use cases.  “Distributed ledger technologies might soon play a role in the entire lifecycle of a trade, including clearing and settlement, collateral management, payments and reconciliation,” the report continued, adding:  ”We also expect distributed ledger technologies to become a critical part of the backbone of future capital markets.”  In the face of this transition, Accenture ended the report by advising banks to develop strategies for the technology as it could be expected to create new opportunities for startups.

42413927,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnSi3,1446675081,Bitcoin ATM Thieves Strike Atlanta Smoke Shop,"A smoke shop in Atlanta, Georgia, was robbed of its bitcoin ATM during a brazen heist this week.  According to a report provided to CoinDesk by the Atlanta Police Department, the Village Smoke Shop on Juniper Street had its Lamassu bitcoin ATM stolen at approximately 10:45 PM EDT on Tuesday night.  Video surveillance of the incident was published earlier today.  The incident report notes:  ""When the suspects were confronted by employees, one of the suspects brandished a handgun and fired one into the floor of the business before fleeing with the machine. The suspects were observed entering a late 1980s model red Chevrolet Caviler [sic] with an unknown license plate.”  The video depicts an initial struggle to remove the ATM, which store manager Amanda McCollum says was bolted down to a table. The firearm’s discharge sparked a moment of panic in the store, as shown in the video.  McCollum – who confronted the robbers – said that she initially thought they were reacting to a problem with the machine itself. After the round was fired, McCollum said, those involved fled out and behind the building with the ATM, where a getaway vehicle was waiting. The Atlanta police incident report notes that two additional suspects were waiting in the car.  “[He] shoots the floor, and with the machine walks around back of the shop to the getaway vehicle that was parked behind our back alley and drives off with it,” she told CoinDesk.  Those behind the incident may have been planning the heist for some time. According to McCollum, two individuals came to the store last week and asked questions about the bitcoin ATM. The individuals later stole a wallet from the store’s office.  A representative for the Atlanta Police Department said that so far, there are no indications as to who was behind the robbery.  “Currently there are no leads in this case,” the department said in an email.

42378333,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyWH,1446670852,Wedbush Revises 12-Month Bitcoin Price Target to $600,"Wedbush Securities has revised its 12-month projections for the price of bitcoin, revealing it expects the price to rise to $600 over the next year.  The estimate represents a revision of a $400 price projection issued in June. At the time, the financial services firm indicated its belief the share price for the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, could rise to $40 over the next 12 months. This figure has been revised upwards to $60 in the latest report.  Report authors Gil Luria and Aaron Turner stated that they believe the sharp increase in bitcoin's value observed over the past week has been the result of ""broad, positive media coverage"" and the continued investment and interest from large financial institutions.  Luria and Turner further asserted that they believe the bitcoin blockchain will come to serve as an Internet for financial services, and that alternative distributed ledgers, such as those being developed by Chain, R3 and Ripple, will serve a more narrow set of use cases.  The report reads:  “We believe the reason financial institutions are insisting on ‘blockchain not bitcoin’ is for internal and regulatory compliance. We expect that even the narrow solutions leveraging only a distributed ledger will end up being anchored on the bitcoin blockchain sooner or later.”  Elsewhere, Wedbush left most of its more forward-looking projections on the share of the online payments, remittance, banking services and microtransactions markets it believes bitcoin services will capture unchanged.  However, there were signs that recent developments had influenced the firm's future outlooks.  For example, Wedbush increased its estimate for the ""total BTC monetary base"" required to support these uses cases by 2025, as well as the expected value of use cases for the bitcoin network outside what it expects to be its four core markets.

42378341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyf5,1446664558,Bitcoin 'B' Approved By Computer Text Standards Body,"A proposal to add the bitcoin “B” to the Unicode computing character standard was accepted this week.  Submitted by tech blogger and pencil-and-paper bitcoin miner Ken Shirriff, the proposal was approved during a quarterly meeting held by the Unicode Consortium, the organization backing the decades-old computing standard.  Members of the Consortium include Apple, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, Oracle and a variety of other institutional and individual contributors. The organization was not immediately available for comment when reached.  Shirriff’s 14-page proposal was the second to be considered by the Unicode Committee, and brings to a close a process that began in fits and starts as far back as 2011.  Submitted in March of that year, the first proposal, entered by Sander van Galoven of the Netherlands, was ultimately turned down by the committee.  According to committee minutes published at the time, the 2011 proposal was rejected on the grounds ""that the use of the bitcoin symbol in (running) text"" had not been demonstrated and because Bitcoin.org was using the symbol as a logo.  In 2014, the Bitcoin Foundation began putting together a working group to develop a Unicode proposal, though no submission developed as a result of that process. The Foundation would later endorse Shirriff’s proposal.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Shirriff said that he saw a need for a submission that drew from an understanding of how exactly the Unicode Consortium goes about approving proposals, explaining:  ""It seemed that nobody else in the bitcoin community really understood the Unicode process and because I had gone through it earlier with a totally unrelated character, I had some familiarity with how it worked. So I decided I should just do it myself.”  He cited contributions from volunteers on the bitcoin subreddit as well as the Bitcoin Talk forum for providing sufficient evidence to back the proposal, citing the need to establish its common use as a text icon. He also pointed to past experience with the Unicode Committee in getting a symbol from an obscure character set approved as a result of restoration work on a 1960s IBM mainframe.  From here, the approved proposal is set to be enshrined in a future Unicode standard release, meaning that eventually the symbol can be used on almost any computer.  The Consortium’s latest version, Unicode 9, is scheduled to be published sometime next year.
