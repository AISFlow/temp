42382186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qp9J,1561329010,TrendMicro Detects Crypto Mining Malware Affecting Android Devices,"A new cryptocurrency-mining botnet has been detected exploiting Android Debug Bridge ports, a system designed to resolve app defects installed on a majority of Android phones and tablets.  The botnet malware, as reported by Trend Micro, has been detected in 21 countries and is most prevalent in South Korea.  The attack takes advantage of the way open ADB ports don’t require authentication by default, and once installed is designed to spread to any system that has previously shared an SSH connection. SSH connections connect a wide range of devices – everything from mobile to Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets – meaning a lot of products are susceptible.  ""Being a known device means the two systems can communicate with each other without any further authentication after the initial key exchange, each system considers the other as safe,"" the researchers say. ""The presence of a spreading mechanism may mean that this malware can abuse the widely used process of making SSH connections.""  It begins with an IP address.  45[.]67[.]14[.]179 arrives through the ADB and uses the command shell to update the working directory to ""/data/local/tmp,” as .tmp files often have default permission to execute commands.  Once the bot determines its entered a honeypot, it uses the wget command to download the payload of three different miners, and curl if wget is not present in the infected system.  The malware determines which miner is best suited to exploit the victim depending on the system’s manufacturer, architecture, processor type, and hardware.  An additional command, chmod 777 a.sh, is then executed to change the permission settings of the malicious drop. Finally, the bot conceals itself from the host using another command, rm -rf a.sh*, to delete the downloaded file. This also hides the trail of where the bug originated from as it spreads to other victims.  Researchers examined the invading script and determined the three potential miners that can be used in the attack – all delivered by the same URL – are:  http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/x86/bash  http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/arm/bash  http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/aarch64/bash  They also found the script enhances the host’s memory by enabling HugePages, which enables memory pages that are greater than its default size, to optimize mining output.  If miners are already found using the system the botnet attempts to invalidate their URL and kill them by changing the host code.  Pernicious and malicious cryptomining drops are continually evolving new ways to exploit their victims. Last summer, Trend Micro observed another ADB-exploiting that they dubbed the Satoshi Variant.  Outlaw, was spotted in the past weeks spreading another Monero mining variant across China through brute-force attacks against servers. At the time researchers hadn’t determined whether the botnet had begun mining operations, but found an Android APK in the script, indicating Android devices may be targeted.

42382190,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qpD5,1561303825,Howey Schmowey – The Real Answer is to Update Securities Regulations,"David Weisberger is co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes and a veteran of building trading desks and financial technology businesses. The opinions expressed in this article are his own, and do not reflect CoinDesk’s position.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      This month there have been two SEC enforcement actions that made headlines in the crypto community. One was the case against messaging platform Kik and their Kin token sale; the other was the action against holding company Longfin. In the first case, while investors lost money, it is unclear that Kik misled them about the potential for the Kin token to be used or about its fundamental value proposition. In the second case, however, the allegations are that Longfin committed clear fraud by misrepresenting their crypto business.  There is no doubt the Longfin case was dealing with a security, since the company went public via the arduous and little-used provision of Reg A+. The problem is that the management allegedly made fraudulent claims about their crypto-oriented business. The SEC charged that investors lost money because they were misinformed about Longfin’s business prospects. The fact that they were a security provided almost no protection whatsoever. (Protection will be limited to potential restitution from enforcement or shareholder lawsuits, which will be small and take place well after the fact.)  In the Kik case, they issued a token that, based on the letter of the law, might well be a security, but they did not follow securities laws when selling the token. Purchasers of the Kin token also lost a lot of money, but most of that loss is related to the collapse of the token market at large, rather than issues with the token itself.  Juxtaposing these two cases makes one thing very clear:  Whether or not an asset is deemed a security or not has little to no relationship to the ability of regulators to protect investors against fraud.  The reality is that raising money based on either outright fabrication or by materially misrepresenting the business can be attacked both by criminal prosecution and civil litigation. Securities laws provide help in that regard in cases where the representations made by the issuer deviate from what is required, and those representations are material to the investment decision. When required disclosures are not relevant to the investment decision, those rules provide little help. This leads directly to the second point:  If tokens issued by corporate entities are to be deemed securities, required disclosures should be updated.  Current required financial disclosures are wholly inadequate to provide investors context for the value of tokens being used by emerging companies for financing. In this case, for example, it is unclear that Kik’s disclosures of the prospects of their token were problematic, but it is very clear that the required disclosures for securities, had they been followed, would have shed little to no light on the investment prospects for the token. Securities disclosures pertain exclusively to the issuer and their finances rather than clarifying the likelihood that the token being issued would gain acceptance. Unfortunately, Kik’s company finances would have provided limited information to the central question that Kin token holders needed to know: whether or not Kin would become highly used, either in their own network or on others.  Lastly, it should be pointed out that there is an inherent double standard in the US securities laws: If a company is already a security (whether OTC or listed), then non-accredited investors can be duped by inadequate disclosures and use of the same techniques that unscrupulous ICO promoters used. On the other hand, law-abiding founders of new companies are restricted from raising capital via tokens from those same investors.  To illustrate, consider the cases of Long Island Iced Tea (which became Long Island Blockchain) and Riot Blockchain (formerly Bioptix). In both cases, moribund public companies changed their name and announced business “pivots” to blockchain technology. In neither case was the future business direction spelled out in detail, nor were there anything resembling the type of disclosures regulators want to see from new companies. In both cases, the hype (in the short term) attracted large numbers of the investing public, propelling the stocks higher. In both cases, there was nothing resembling the sort of disclosures made by principled founders of blockchain products, yet the losses to investors were very real. The sole difference between these examples and the average ICO from 2017 is that both of those companies were already publicly traded.  Sadly, I don’t expect securities laws to undergo an overhaul in the U.S. anytime soon, so we are likely to see America fall behind the rest of the world in terms of capital markets innovation. If, however, U.S. regulators were to take action, a good start might be to create a subclass of securities for utility tokens issued to fund “for profit” enterprises. If such a designation (informally or formally) were established, the SEC could work with the industry to create appropriate disclosures and rules for those assets. I am sure that groups such as the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance or ADAM would be happy to help, as would firms such as Messari, which is building a private marketplace of project disclosures.  This approach would have another benefit, which would be to help ease the SEC into regulation of the exchanges and dealers that trade these tokens. Principles such as “Best Execution” which are sorely lacking in these markets could then be promoted, with the likely result of increased trust (and therefore volumes) in the crypto markets overall.

42382180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qp0V,1561282210,Why Ethereum's Privacy Matters and What's Being Built to Support It,"Mixers. Computational data layers. Zero-knowledge proofs: these are just a few of the technologies being leveraged to enhance privacy on the ethereum blockchain.  Privacy for a public blockchain network is a bit of an oxymoron, given that, by nature of the technology’s design, data must be shared and widely distributed on the network in order to be considered valid. What’s more, for a high-profile public blockchain network like ethereum, several blockchain analytics websites and data scraping services exist to proliferate this data beyond just the users of the network.  Itamar Lesuisse, the CEO and co-founder of crypto wallet tool Argent, describes the matter of privacy on the ethereum blockchain as an issue for even “the most simplest use case” on the platform.  “If you just look at the most simplest use case, if I say, ‘Hey Christine, can you send me ten dollars [worth of ether]? Here’s my wallet address.' Now, you know how much money I have.” Lesuisse said during an interview with CoinDesk.  By virtue of sharing one's public ethereum address, the amount of funds being held within that address is easily uncovered. Of course, a user could hold several cryptocurrency wallets with different amounts of ether held within them. However, disclosing the wallet address of one of them may jeopardize the identity of all wallets owned by a user especially if funds had previously been transferred between wallet addresses.  “I’m talking here about friends who I asked to send me some money. They would instantly know how much I have,” emphasized Lesuisse. ""It’s so transparent, which is a great picture of blockchain, but for some users, it might scare them away to use it at scale.”  This is why Lesuisse and others are working towards better tools for making private transactions and even private computations in general on the ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, the aim is to encourage greater adoption of the ethereum blockchain by larger groups of people such as enterprise corporations.  Speaking to enterprise use cases on the ethereum blockchain, EY global innovation leader for blockchain Paul Brody said in a past interview with CoinDesk:  “It’s fundamentally essential if you want corporations and large scale investors. If you want them to use public blockchains, you’ve got to provide them with privacy … We believe that without privacy you won’t have a lot of serious enterprise users.”  Getting serious about privacy  There are a number of privacy projects that have newly launched this year.  The blockchain team at EY released code dubbed ‘Nightfall’ last month on GitHub as an experimental solution to enable anonymous transactions on the ethereum blockchain.  It leverages a well-known technology in the crypto space known as zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) first conceived in the late 1980s by researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in a paper titled “The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems.” Later in 2016, privacy coin Zcash launched on mainnet and became the first widespread application of ZKPs used to send “shielded transactions” anonymizing users across a public blockchain network.  More recently, after the release of Nightfall in May, the developer team at blockchain startup 0xcerthttps://0xcert.org/news/0xcert-fork-of-ey-nightfall-with-added-features/ has started to iterate on the code release and add new features for its specific implementation with non-fungible ERC-721 tokens.  “An important thing we added to [Nightfall] is selective verification. I'm not going to expose everything if I don't want to,” explained 0xcert chief strategy officer Urban Osvald. ""Nightfall and all the tooling we provide combined really makes a combination of tools and features widely applicable not just for game items and collectibles...but they pave the pathway for large scale enterprise use case.""  Speaking to the motivations behind the initiative, Osvald remarked:  “The biggest goal for us is widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens and obviously blockchain in general ... Adoption is slow and we want to expedite it as fast as possible.""  The here and now  Apart from transactional privacy on the ethereum blockchain, another ethereum-based startup called Enigma is dedicated to creating an off-chain computational environment for any type of data privacy.  “When we talk about computational privacy, it’s going beyond the idea that you can protect the anonymity or the amount of a transaction and you’re actually able to do computations on encrypted data,“ said Tor Bair, head of growth and marketing for Enigma, in a past interview with CoinDesk.  Bair added:  “You could do decentralized credit scoring that protects data from specific users that’s trying to establish their creditworthiness … For gaming, data needs to remain private from certain individuals within the game or you may want to produce random numbers in a secure fashion. These are all potential applications in future for our protocol.”  On Tuesday  , Enigma released its second test network solidifying “the developer experience,” according to Bair, of using the protocol which has yet to see a mainnet launch.  In the meantime, Julien Niset, chief science officer at Argent, argues that a basic privacy tool on ethereum ready for deployment immediately is needed.  “There's need for a lot privacy solutions on Ethereum addressing different needs and different requirements,” said Niset. ""We really tackle the first one and the one needed most today which is how can I send funds from A to B privately.""  Hoping for a more private future  The tool being talked about by Niset is called Hopper. It is a open-source mixer for making private transactions on the ethereum blockchain using a mobile iOS device.  In essence, Hopper is a smart contract that users can deposit notes of 1 ETH to and withdraw funds from privately without revealing any public account addresses. It also leverages ZKPs in order to prove recipients of private transfers.  ""Users can deposit notes of 1 ETH into a mixer smart contract and withdraw them later to a different account by only providing a Zero-Knowledge proof (zkSNARK) that they previously deposited a note into the mixer, without revealing from which account that note was sent,"" the official GitHub page describes.  While immediately deployable, Niset warns that Hopper is by no means the ultimate privacy solution for ethereum.  “We don’t want to claim that we solved that problem for Ethereum. This is not what it is. This is an open source community,” said Niset. “The thing that is really important is that people collaborate. We used the development of some other people and saw we could make it a viable product for mobile wallet.”  As such, CEO of Argent Itamar Lesuisse emphasized that from his perspective, Hopper is a privacy product solution that ""can work today"" but will be just one of many in existence in the years to come.  Lesuisse concluded:  ""There are many solutions out there that are on the way and will become way more advanced in a few years...From a product perspective, we wanted to solve the problem today but there may be many more solutions in future.""
