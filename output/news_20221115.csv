Bitcoin's bullish case is likely strengthened with the developments this week, helping to reaffirm its role as digital gold. We expect Bitcoin to trend higher going forward as broader macro conditions improve. The collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) from one of the world's largest crypto exchanges into bankruptcy in just over a few days has been disturbing. Despite its air-of-secrecy as a private firm, FTX was seen as one of the few winners going back to the Q2 crash in crypto by making headlines capable of extending lines of credit to more troubled industry players. Indeed, the events of the past week turned out to be the proverbial latest shoe to drop in crypto, sending prices to a new cycle low. That said, we see a few positives emerging as it relates to the outlook for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which can consolidate its position as the ""gold standard of crypto"". The fall of FTX is more of a story based on possible misbehavior and lack of regulatory compliance than a critique of the potential of digital assets. By this measure, nothing has changed in the long-term bullish case for BTC. What may be getting lost in the discussion is that the decentralized public blockchain of Bitcoin remains as secure as ever, with the confidence of the protocol helping to affirm its role as a store of value and alternative asset. The setup here is that by getting past this near-term volatility, Bitcoin can emerge stronger into the next bull market. The Fall Of FTX With the details from the demise of FTX still playing out, the essence of the story has all the hallmarks of a classic bank run. Rumors floating around social media of a liquidity crunch drove a wave of withdrawals from the platform. FTX was forced to halt further transactions based on a lack of adequate capital reserves. The situation was exacerbated based on the group's dependency on the funding FTT token ( FTT-USD ), which faced an accelerated selloff, losing more than $7 billion in value over a week. Seeking Alpha Disgraced CEO Sam Bankman- Fried tweeted about his misunderstanding of some high-level risk metrics, apparently based on poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts, leaving a substantial deficit in the spread with user margins. The latest update is simply that FTX and its more than 130 affiliates have filed for bankruptcy. For us, the development came out of left field, in part, because the crypto sector had been building up a sense of stability over the last few months. There wasn't a market volatility event that triggered the company's apparent crisis. At the same time, one thought is that this was the final capitulation necessary for the sector to reset and move forward. Alts Are Bad The way we're looking at the situation is that the real losers in 2022 are the ecosystem of centralized players and a group of crypto ""alts"" that have failed to live up to their hype. FTX and its FTT token are the latest, but let's also remember some of the other failures this year like ""Celsius Network"" (CEL-USD) exposing the risk of ""stablecoins"" as the TerraUSD coin (UST-USD) and LUNA token ( LUNC-USD ) crashed. There was also the collapse of crypto lender Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ), which was curiously subsequently purchased by FTX in a firesale for $51 million, down from a peak valuation of $1.5 billion. The broader sector has also been plagued by hacks and marketing scams. Again, the important distinction is that these groups and related alternative cryptocurrencies are unrelated to Bitcoin where the confidence in the security of its peer-to-peer blockchain network underpins its value. There may be other firms to fall and centralized exchange security will always be a concern, but the setup here is that Bitcoin can remain the king of the hill. Even as Bitcoin bulls from the early run in 2020 , one of the knocks on the upside price potential was that even with its supply cap of 21 million, the universe of alternative cryptocurrencies was unlimited. The allure of alts has always been this underlying hope that ""maybe you missed out on Bitcoin's run from under $1.00 to $10,000"", but that type of return could be possible with the latest and greatest coin gimmick. That type of thinking will likely take a seat from going forward. While some top-tier alts like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Ripple ( XRP-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ) have their place with defined utility or unique applications, consider that there are over 9,000 other cryptocurrency examples with many questionable structures. In our view, the bubble in crypto that popped this year was in the atmosphere of tokens being created just for speculative purposes. While we can debate which cryptos are ""bad money driving out the good"", FTT and LUNA are just two examples everyone can agree should not have existed. Bullish On Bitcoin The way we see it playing out is that more regulation is coming to the sector with an effort of improving security and financial transparency in the name of investor protection. Much of that will likely be targeting crypto finance or DeFi, which often utilizes a related token as a critical piece of their blockchain infrastructure. The effect will likely be fewer initial coin offerings going forward with higher thresholds, allowing the current sector leaders to capture a larger share. All these changes can be positive for Bitcoin because it has already established itself as the most important asset in the public blockchain space. Investors recognizing this dynamic will continue to place BTC higher up on the sector hierarchy, as the target of institutional capital in the digital assets segment. In other words, an investment into BTC can be seen as having a better return to risk profile compared to any other crypto alt or especially over crypto finance startups. It's worth recapping some high-level secular trends that support both increasing adoption of Bitcoin and higher price long-term. First, the concept of BTC being digital gold is alive and well. Like any other asset class, there are risks, but Bitcoin can play an important role in the context of a diversified portfolio for all investors. The move by high-profile institutional asset managers to facilitate the adoption of crypto has moved forward. Everyone from JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM ), BlackRock Inc ( BLK) , to Goldman Sachs ( GS ) offer crypto- related products and have worked to facilitate investor access, making crypto more legitimate. An important milestone in the regulatory framework has already moved forward as an important foundation in the U.S. and globally. Second, adoption is increasing. The last few years have proven BTC as an effective form of decentralized non-state money. Reports of consumers utilizing bitcoin for international remittances in emerging markets highlight its global appeal. Its ability to transcend the traditional financial system is useful to a large number of potential users. The collapse of FTX or any token doesn't change that. The point we're getting at here is that Bitcoin is here to stay and its outlook is possibly stronger than ever. As bad as the correction and extreme volatility has been, keep in mind that BTC is still outperforming the S&P 500 ( SPY ) from levels before the pandemic nearly 3-years ago. The recent performance is all relative. There are several ""blue-chip"" stocks that have dropped farther in percentage terms from their 2021 highs. Data by YCharts BTC Price Forecast We mentioned being surprised by the FTX news and a case could be made that if there was ever a spot for the bottom to completely fall out, this was it. By this measure, it's encouraging that BTC currently trading around $17,000 is off by just a few points from its June low suggesting an underlying level of support, with long-term investors still holding on. source: finviz.com The next few weeks will be important regarding any immediate fallout from the FTX bankruptcy. We want to avoid any headlines of other major companies sinking on this matter, but recognizing the price action in the crypto sector will lead the story. Staying above last week's low of $15,632 in BTC is a good first step. The main risk right now is that an even bigger shoe drops, which would point to some sign of a more structural weakness in crypto. Fast forward, other macro indicators look more favorable. An outlook for declining inflation with stabilizing interest rates has already helped to kickstart a pullback in the U.S. Dollar that had been trading particularly strongly. A weaker USD by definition should be positive for all foreign currencies and crypto like Bitcoin. In a scenario where risk sentiment improves in financial markets through 2023, supported by better-than-expected macro data, we believe Bitcoin as a high-beta trade will outperform the upside. The first target here will be $20k as a critical technical level to cross.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558196-ftx-collapse-bullish-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4292580.jpeg

4291419,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508487,1668553259,TRX Surges Over 600% Following Justin Sun’s Deal With FTX,"Tron’s native token TRX has been seeing significant upside on the FTX exchange since the announcement of a potential deal that would allow users to withdraw funds. This deal is one of the only ones that have gone into effect since FTX began experiencing issues and it seems users are already taking advantage of it. However, it is not all rosy as users begin to notice the downside to this. TRX Price Explodes On FTX TRX token is already up more than 500% on the FTX crypto exchange over the last week on the FTX exchange. Tron founder Justin Sun had seemingly worked out an agreement with the troubled exchange to allow users to swap their crypto currently stuck on the platform for TRX tokens and then withdraw it. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies 15%, Why Ripple Could Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum This would obviously make it possible for users to swap digital assets such as bitcoin, ethereum, etc, to TRX, and then proceed to withdraw it, making it possible for them to withdraw previously stuck funds from FTX. It has naturally become a popular option for FTX users, causing the price of the digital asset to balloon on the exchange. In just 24 hours following the announcement, TRX’s price was already up significantly. While the token’s price remained relatively low on all other exchanges, it had traded to a high of $0.43 on the FTX exchange. Compared to the $0.05 price mark that is the case across all other exchanges, it is trading at a 600% premium on FTX. TRX price spikes on FTX | Source: TRXUSD on TradingView.com There has been some fluctuation in the price since the token hit this new high on the platform. However, the price still remains high at $0.43 at the time of writing, with trading volumes already exceeding $630 million in a 24-hour timeframe. Not A Good Deal At first, converting digital assets to TRX on the FTX exchange in order to withdraw looked like a good idea, but that only lasted as long as prices on the exchange correlated with the broader crypto market. As the price of TRX inflated on the FTX exchange, the value that users were getting when they swapped their tokens quickly plummeted. With TRX being 500% above market price on FTX, it means that the exchange’s users would only be getting about 20 cents on the dollar when they swap. This is because after withdrawing TRX from FTX, they would still have to swap the tokens at current market prices. To put this in perspective, say someone has $10,000 worth of bitcoin and swapped it to TRX at $0.43 (current prices), they would get around 38,570 TRX. When they withdraw and move to other exchanges for sale, taking the current price on Coinmarketcap of $0.05, they would have only $1,162 after selling. This translates to roughly 12 cents on the dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Strength As Price Holds Above $16,500; Is This A Bear Trap? Meanwhile, Tron is making bank buying these digital assets for cheap as they are the only ones allowed to transfer TRX into FTX. At the current rate, they will be seeing millions of dollars in profit, presumably giving FTX a healthy cut of the proceeds. What this shows is that it is the end users that always get screwed over in times like these. Even deals that seem to be “helpful” turns out just to be another way to exploit users who are already in a vulnerable position from the exchange’s collapse.

According to data analytics platform Nansen, most DeFi protocols have experienced double-digit percentage growth in users and transactions in the past seven days, a sign of vitality following the collapse of FTX.  For example, dYdX, a decentralized crypto exchange on the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, has seen users increase by 99% and transactions climb by 136%.  The growth is reflected in digital-asset markets: Despite 88% of digital assets in the DeFi sector declining in the week through Tuesday, amid the fallout from FTX's collapse, the price of the dYdX token (DYDX) is up 77%.  Within the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), the DYDX token is categorized as a member of the CLOB (central order limit book) industry – the only one among 36 industries with a positive week-over-week return, according to CoinDesk Indices.  Aave, a decentralized lender, grew users by 70% and transactions by 99%.  Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CoinDesk via Twitter, “As we are seeing the contagion from FTX unfold, users realize the importance of self-custody and transparency that DeFi protocols offer. As such, usage metrics across DeFi protocols have surged.”  Decentralized exchange Uniswap  Even though trust in centralized exchanges have fallen dramatically following the downfall of FTX, Uniswap, the largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, has experienced a 19% increase in users and 21% increase in transactions over the past 30 days, suggests Nansen data.  Uniswap’s 24-hour ether trading volume stands at $900 billion, at press time, which is more than Coinbase, OKX and Gate.io combined, according to CoinGecko.  Additionally, daily new transacting wallets of Uniswap’s Web App stands at 55,550, a 2022 high.  Uniswap Labs tweeted, “Self-custody and transparency are in demand and users are flocking to what they know and trust.”  Token flow value of centralized exchanges  Centralized exchanges have experienced a mass exodus of wealth as users are opting to store their cryptocurrencies elsewhere.  Among the centralized exchanges, Binance experienced the largest net outflow – outflows less inflows – of roughly $1.44 billion among exchanges in the past 7 days. This means that users on Binance have removed $1.44 billion more than they have deposited. (Nansen’s token flow value by exchange accounts for only ETH and Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens.)  OKX ranked second with a negative net flow of $1.24 billion. FTX has the third largest net outflow of $900 million, while Kraken suffered a net outflow of $586 million.  According to Nansen, in the past 7 days, Binance, OKX, FTX, Kraken, KuCoin, Coinbase, Huobi, Gate.io, Gemini, Paxos, FTX US and Crypto.com have experienced a combined net outflow of $6.33 billion; Users have deposited $42.03 billion into those exchanges but withdrew $48.35 billion.

42422027,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOhD,1668551441,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises on Encouraging Inflation News,"Price Action  The latest inflation data on Tuesday suggested that the U.S. central bank was winning its campaign against inflation, and crypto investors relished the news.  Bitcoin was recently trading above $16,700, up more than 2% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency has been inching up since Monday even as fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s liquidity crisis and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection widens. The Wall Street Journal reported that crypto lender BlockFi is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing because of its ""significant exposure"" to FTX.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “Bitcoin is showing resilience here but it is hard to imagine investors are ready to test the waters until we learn more of the full contagion risk associated with FTX,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda wrote, although he warned that “if more exchanges or crypto companies pause withdrawals or limit activity, that will likely bring back the pressure on cryptos.”  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,250, up more than 3% from Monday, same time. Other major altcoins spent much of Tuesday in the green with the SRM, CEL and FTT tokens of embattled ventures Serum, Celsius and FTX jumping by well into the double digits over the past 24 hours. FTT was, nevertheless, recently trading at $1.80, a fraction of its near $36 highs earlier this year.  SRM slumped more than 72% over the weekend after DeFi protocols across the Solanda ecosystem began unplugging from Serum’s onchain exchange for fear that they didn’t know who wielded control – a concern fueled by a Friday hack of FTX. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a major supporter of Serum.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was up about 1%.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Technical Take  Exchange Outflows May Not Mean What They Used To  By Glenn Williams Jr.  The FTX collapse marks a new starting point in how investors use exchange balances of BTC and ETH. Often, increases in the exchange balances for BTC and ETH implies bearish sentiment, as coins are sent to exchanges to ready them for sale.  But a comparison of current levels to levels prior to November 2022 may give investors a distorted view.  Now, the outflows might be signaling something very different: that users don’t want their coins sitting on the exchange – as a precaution against the risk of another deposit run similar to what just happened at FTX.

42422029,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOjH,1668551287,Are Your Bitcoin Trades Losing on Fed Day? Just Wait Till Tomorrow,"On five of six days this year following U.S. central bank interest rate decisions, bitcoin’s price has reversed course from its previous direction.  BTC’s price has fallen on three occasions after rising sharply on the day of Fed rate hikes, and it has risen on two other days after falling when the Fed also raised interest rates. On one occasion, BTC’s price rose on the day of a Fed rate hike and continued its upward momentum the next day.  Analysts say that the quick reversals underline investors desire to take profits quickly or extricate themselves from riskier assets amid a volatile macroeconomic environment. These investors have been trying to anticipate crypto markets' direction further afield following Fed decisions, which can have a deep impact on the economy.  “A lot of the times, the very first move is not the move that sustains because that’s the position adjusting mode,” Bob Iacchino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist, said. “In other words, people have positions based on what they think the result is going to be, and when they get the exact result, they exit positions.”  On May 4, for example, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would raise interest rates by 50 basis points, or a 0.5 percentage point, bitcoin jumped 5.2% as traders welcomed the Fed’s hawkishness in its ongoing attempt to tame inflation. However, the following day, bitcoin dropped 8%.  On June 15, bitcoin surged 2% after the Fed boosted rates by 75 basis points, escalating its inflation-fighting efforts. But on June 16, BTC dropped 9.7%.  Crypto markets’ reversals on days following Fed rate hikes have veered from equity markets’ performances on these days.  For example, on only two of the six Fed decision days this year, in June and July, did the S&P 500 reverse the next day. Otherwise, the S&P has followed its previous course.  “The S&P 500 is much more absorbed into day-to-day investing, so there’s a lot less volatility,” Iaccino said. Crypto traders, on the other hand, are “entrenched emotionally in what this asset is,” he said.  In general, volatility before and after Fed days has been more intense than typical for all asset classes, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said. “Normally, we see limited posturing before Fed decisions, but this year was different as everyone was trying to get ahead of when the Fed pivot will happen,” he said.  This will likely continue to be the case until the Fed is widely believed to be done tightening, Moya said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/15/are-your-bitcoin-trades-losing-on-fed-day-just-wait-till-tomorrow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac59ed983fd540f0d5a969b8896cbe796ff7df59-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411317,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzrI,1668550928,"Understanding the Tax Implications of NFTs, Staking and Yield Farming","Even in the depths of winter, crypto continues to make fundamental progress – especially in terms of adoption by the world’s top enterprises and institutions. Ethereum, the pioneering blockchain for innovative technologies such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, recently completed its much-anticipated Merge – sparking institutional interest and unlocking yield-generation opportunities via its proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain.  Miles Fuller is the head of government solutions at TaxBit. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  As an emerging asset class, crypto raises many perplexing questions for investors and regulators alike. At the same time, an October poll conducted by the Crypto Council for Innovation indicated that a majority of U.S. voters want more crypto regulation and believe that lawmakers should treat cryptocurrency as a serious and valid part of the economy. But the lack of regulatory clarity has been a significant barrier when it comes to crypto adoption for both individuals and institutions.  In order to address this problem, we should seek to better understand a key component of regulation: taxes. Especially as they relate to NFTs, staking and yield farming.  See also: The Key to Taxing Digital Assets Is Finding the Right Cubbyhole | Opinion  How are NFTs taxed?  In November, Meta announced that Instagram will soon allow creators to mint and sell non-fungible tokens directly on the social platform. Reddit is helping take NFTs mainstream as well. Since opening its NFT marketplace in July, over 2.5 million new wallets have been created, and cumulative Reddit NFT sales have surpassed $6.5 million. As NFT initiatives by the world’s top enterprises continue to take flight, users should carefully consider the key tax implications:  NFTs are not taxable upon creation but are taxable when sold according to the fair market value (FMV) of the cash or cryptocurrency received.  The value of assets received upon the sale of an NFT is considered gross income that then may be reduced by costs related to the creation and sale (such as gas fees) of the NFT.  The resulting net income from the sale of NFTs is characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes and may also be subject to self-employment tax if the NFT creation activity rises to the level of a ""trade or business."" However, there are currently no clear rules or guidance for when NFT activity rises to the level of a “trade or business.” Traditionally, an activity needs to be conducted with continuity, regularity and an intent to make a profit in order to be considered a trade or business for tax purposes.  Commissions or royalties received from downstream resales of an NFT are almost certainly income, but there’s no official guidance on this yet.  The resale of an NFT would be a taxable sale of property similar to other cryptocurrencies (which are considered to be property under the tax code).  It is possible some NFTs could also potentially constitute a ""collectible"" for tax purposes, and would thus be subject to a higher tax rate of 28%. But there is currently no clear guidance from the IRS on when an NFT is considered a collectible, and existing law likely limits it to NFTs that are works of art.  Read more: The Tax Impact of This Year's Platform and Protocol Failures | Opinion  How is staking taxed?  Given the historic upgrade of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, and that many leading exchanges offer custodial staking opportunities (such as ETH annual percent staking yields as high as 4-5%), questions about staking rewards are top of mind for many U.S. investors. There’s no official guidance on how staking should be taxed, but the Internal Revenue Service appears to view it as taxable according to the following points:  The initial act of staking crypto is likely not a taxable event in itself, although there is probably an exception with regard to ""liquid staking"" on Ethereum that gives you a fungible token in return for your staked ETH.  Delegation of units to a staker (such as staking via a pool versus solo staking) is also likely not taxable as long as only the staking rights are transferred by the delegator and not the actual units.  Units received from staking (via block rewards and transaction fees) are taxable upon receipt. In the case of Ethereum, staking rewards are currently locked and cannot be directly withdrawn, raising an open question as to whether the rewards should be taxed as income at fair market value (FMV) according to the moment of receipt or at fair market value only once they can be unlocked.  FMV is treated as the gross revenue from staking, and can also be reduced by costs of staking (such as the costs of running a dedicated node).  Net income is treated as ordinary income and may be subject to self-employment tax if the staking rises to the level of a “trade or business.” (Similar to what’s noted above for NFTs, this threshold is not yet officially defined.)  Often, units received will be treated as a capital asset in the hands of the recipient, meaning they will likely receive a favorable tax rate upon the latter-day sale.  Given the lack of official guidance, an alternative view has been posited that rewards received from staking are not taxable upon receipt. Instead, any rewards received from staking may not be taxable until the eventual sale. Upon eventual sale, the rewards would be taxable as ordinary income (rather than capital gains), so they will not receive a favorable tax rate.  This view was being litigated in federal court in Tennessee regarding Tezos staking rewards as part of a claim for a tax refund, but the government granted the refund and the case was dismissed. So, unless the IRS makes an express statement about the matter or it arises in litigation again, the issue will remain unresolved.  In the case of Ethereum staking rewards via a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the platform may issue a 1099-MISC to individuals and the IRS for users who earn at least $600 in “miscellaneous” income. Regardless of whether or not rewards can be unlocked, the safest path is likely to treat all rewards as income at fair market value according to the moment of receipt.  How is DeFi yield and liquidity farming taxed?  The 2022 U.S. individual income tax return prominently highlights “Digital Assets” for hundreds of millions of taxpayers to see. As part of the instructions, the 1040 Form says: “Check ‘Yes’ if at any time during 2022 you: Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar activities.”  As discussed above, this question reveals that the IRS likely views the receipt of staking rewards as a taxable event. Separately, the inclusion of “similar activities” also indicates that the IRS likely views any receipt of a digital asset that was not made through a purchase with cash or exchange of other property as a taxable event. The language appears to encompass a wide array of income-generating activities, including DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity farming.  While there is no official guidance on the tax treatment of DeFi activities such as yield farming, there are key points to consider:  Depositing funds into a liquidity pool is likely a taxable event if control over the units is surrendered in exchange for a token received in return from the pool, particularly where the contribution is tied to the value contributed rather than the number of units contributed, exposing the individual to impermanent loss.  If the deposit into the pool was a taxable event, any exit or withdrawal from the pool will also be a taxable disposition of the token that was received from the pool.  Units received as yield are likely treated as ordinary income according to the fair market value of the units at the moment of receipt. The moment of receipt may be difficult to track because the receipt of units by a user is often tracked inside the smart contracts controlling the DeFi protocol and is only visible through a user interface rather than on a public blockchain. The user’s receipt of units only appears on the blockchain when the user actually withdraws the units from the DeFi protocol.  The lack of explicit guidance and the disconnect between the actual receipt of yield in DeFi and data reflecting that receipt for record-keeping purposes makes DeFi currently one of the more difficult aspects of digital asset taxation.  See also: Why Selling Some Bitcoin at a Loss Can Maximize Your Holding Potential | Opinion  Although there are still many gray areas, crypto adoption is continuing at a remarkable pace. Individuals and institutions should carefully consider their tax obligations, and in the absence of official guidance, should consult tax professionals or take the most conservative approach so as to avoid costly audits in the future.  Some of this uncertainty should be resolved as the IRS continues to issue guidance. Proposed regulations implementing tax reporting rules for digital asset brokers will help clarify some of the tax rules and make things easier for taxpayers to report their taxes accurately.  The IRS recently identified tax guidance relating to digital asset transaction validation, including staking, as a priority during 2023. As the digital asset ecosystem continues to grow and the tokenized economy takes hold, it will be imperative for the IRS to, whenever possible, issue guidance clarifying the tax treatment of certain activities.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Miles Fuller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/15/key-tax-implications-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b62fb44b9724fb5c01cd3043b6743b604d2b17b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413672,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTak,1668550762,Serum’s SRM Tokens Double in Price After Emergency Fork in Wake of FTX Hack,"Serum, a decentralized exchange protocol on the Solana blockchain, saw its SRM tokens soar in digital-asset markets Tuesday, as key backers of the project rallied around an emergency fork in response to the recent hack of Sam Bankman-Fried’s ailing FTX exchange.  The community forked the project – blockchain–speak for essentially copying the underlying software code and starting afresh – after warnings that security may have been compromised by the Nov. 11 hack.  The alarms had sent the SRM price plummeting, ranking the token among the biggest losers in crypto markets. The rebound turned the token into one of the biggest winners overnight.  The serum (SRM) price started soaring around 23:30 UTC Monday, reaching a high of 32 cents Tuesday, up from a low of 12 cents on Sunday. As of press time, the token had settled back to 29 cents. It’s still down 95% in the past year.  Jupiter Aggregator, a key liquidity aggregator for Solana DeFi, which plugs into Serum, tweeted Tuesday that it was already testing an integration of the new version and “will announce it as soon as it’s ready.”  The price jump was likely due to the community “rallying behind a fork,” though it’s “unclear how the SRM token would fare if the fork gains traction,” Riyad Carey, an analyst with the crypto analysis firm Kaiko Research, told CoinDesk.  Kaiko had noted in a research report Monday that the SRM tokens had suffered a sharp drop in market depth on crypto exchanges last week triggered by the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including the FTX exchange and trading firm Alameda Research.  That dynamic appeared to shift Tuesday: Based on the total number of SRM tokens on the Serum order book, SRM’s liquidity on Binance is now higher than pre-crash, according to Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko.  Medalie told CoinDesk that market makers have been “building up support on Binance for SRM since the crash.”  “Market makers are moving funds to Binance to support price,” she said. “Liquidity evaporated on nearly every other exchange.”  Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko tweeted Nov. 12 that developers depending on Serum forked the program because “the upgrade key to the current one is compromised.” He said that “a ton of protocols depend on Serum markets for liquidity and liquidations.”  The effort to replace Serum with a community-led open-source version has renewed the market's interest, according to Brian Long, a prominent validator, in a tweet.  The FTX-Alameda fallout last week has pushed the Solana community to the edge. The Solana Foundation said Monday it held 134.54 million SRM tokens and 3.43 million FTT tokens on FTX when withdrawals went dark on Nov. 6.  Solana-based applications have also seen nearly $700 million in value wiped out, with a 70% drop from the $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Nov. 2 when CoinDesk first reported on Alameda’s troubling balance sheet.  Solana’s native token SOL saw a minor rebound on Tuesday, up 6% to around $14 Tuesday. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 2%.  Medalie said that a sudden price jump for SRM may not be a strong indicator in terms of future price movements because “there is still a large gap that Alameda left.”",POSITIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/15/serums-srm-tokens-double-in-price-after-emergency-fork-in-wake-of-ftx-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfd933aac6750a74aaacf635f1c3c2e5a5ce9a69-1276x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LINK’s price continues to show strength after a bearish downtrend with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. LINK’s price bounces from a low of $5.8 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a recovery toward the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) In the last few days, the crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Chainlink (LINK) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news broke that Binance would not be taking over FTX and the company had gone bankrupt. Previous weeks saw the price of Chainlink (LINK) perform well, rallying from a low of $6.3 to a high of $9, breaking out of its long-range price movement. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed.

Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX led to so much tension as the crypto space remains unsettled, leading to most altcoins suffering in price, including the price of LINK, after breaking out of its range movement of over 180 days. Still, the price suffered a setback to its range zone. LINK’s price declined to a weekly low of $6.3 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $6.4 as the price aims to break higher. The price of LINK needs to flip the region of $7.5-$8, acting as a resistance to support. Weekly resistance for the price of LINK – $8. Weekly support for the price of LINK – $6.3. Price Analysis Of LINK On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of LINK remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $6.3 support after bouncing off from the region of $5.8. If the price of LINK breaks above $8, we could see more rallies for LINK price; a break below a region of $5 would lead to more sell-offs for LINK. Daily resistance for the LINK price – $8. Daily support for the LINK price – $6.5.

42411321,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN01D,1668550221,Crypto Needs an FDIC-Like Protocol to Prevent Liquidity Crises,"There is no lack of talk on Twitter about the failure of FTX. Some are saying “I told you so” while others are asking “what the hell happened.” There are Tom Brady memes, tweets about Sam Bankman-Fried’s rise and fall as well as accounts of real financial pain. You’ll read about fear, depression and desperation. You’ll read about hurt. Confusion.  The fall of FTX, however much we boil it down, is clear. Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini has called crypto the “mother of all scams.” The truth is rarely so simple, but if we look back over the past century of economic history we’ll find that the events that just occurred are hardly new. And, we might even find a path forward.  Adam Hofmann is CEO and founder of Nimble, a decentralized insurance protocol. A version of this article was published originally on Medium.  While leverage and insolvency issues affect more than just centralized exchanges (CEXes), the biggest crypto failures this year have often happened after the blockchain equivalent of a “bank run” – or the mass withdrawal of crypto assets from those exchanges.  One step in the right direction would be to decentralize the storage of cryptocurrency, but that is not the only solution.  See also: 8 Days in November: What Led to FTX's Sudden Collapse  The Great Depression and bank runs  Banks can, and do, fail. Historically, they failed at greater numbers than they do at present. Prior to the Great Depression, the average number of bank failures was around 630 per year. And during the worst of the Depression Era, bank failures climbed steadily from 1,350 in 1930 to an overwhelming 4,000 in 1933.  TLDR of the Great Depression: Wall Street investors traded around 16 million shares on the NYSE on Oct. 29, 1929. Billions of dollars were lost, investors were cleaned out, followed by financial panic as the world spiraled into the longest economic downturn in history.  Bank failures often resemble crypto failures. Imagine this scenario:  Say 1,000 people deposit $1,000 in The National Bank for a total of $1,000,000. As cool as it is to imagine that $1,000,000 sitting in a bank vault just waiting for Jason Statham to break in and steal it.…that is not what happens.  Instead, in most economies, banks are allowed to keep “fractional reserves” of those deposits. In other words, banks keep a small percentage of deposits as collateral and lend out the rest. This allows economies to grow and currencies to circulate.  See also: Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers?  Let’s assume banks keep 30% of deposits as collateral. If $1,000,000 is deposited, $300,000 will be held in “the vault” and $700,000 will be invested and/or loaned. With proper risk management, that $700,000 is used conservatively in stable and tested ways, so it can be made liquid to cover the rare occurrence when all $1,000,000 is called to be withdrawn at once.  But, what if the bank decided to invest in Beachfront Property in Idaho [spoiler alert: there isn’t any beachfront property in Idaho]? Well, it’s safe to say they won’t be getting that $700,000 back. If the original 1,000 people head to The National Bank to withdraw their funds. Um – yeah, the bank will only have $300,000.  Now, let’s walk through bank failures after the Great Depression for more context:  Bank failures in 1930  Most bank failures in the 1930 looked something like this:  Economic pressure started a series of bank failures; the ripple effects crushing depositor confidence  Depositors ran to the banks to withdraw their funds causing 1,350 bank failures  The Federal Reserve didn’t step in to support liquidity solutions as most failures were to “non-member” banks  Even though they were “non-member banks”, depositors lost $237,359,000  Apply inflation to depositor losses in 1930, and what do you get? About $4 billion in lost deposits. For comparison, the “neobank” Celsius lost users about $4.7 billion.  In an echo of crypto today, people in the 1930s waited for regulation and federal guidance, which likely came slower than most at the time would have expected. Regulators today do feel investors should be protected, but like then, it isn’t fully in their wheelhouse…yet.  Bank failures 1931-1932  Continued economic pressure  Great Britain abandoned the gold standard; mass conversion of deposits to gold  More depositors ran to the bank to withdraw their funds  The result: 3,643 bank failures. $558,778,000 in depositor losses  People were still waiting on sound regulation and guidance in these years. We hear those same sentiments echoed now. Others are waiting for crypto to ”crash.” In the past and currently, the financial hurt falls on the people.  The economics here go deeper than the total amount of deposit lost. The volatility resulted in exponentially larger implications for the overall global markets.  Likewise, the implications of a crypto crash ripple across socioeconomics and global markets and cause reputational harm to this emergent technology. The immediate financial toll of a crypto failure is serious, and scares away users and investors that would otherwise benefit from a decentralized and inclusive financial system  1933 and beyond  Fiveyears after “Black Friday,” the day the markets crashed causing the depression, bank failures continued to cause spiraling confidence in the financial system, which led to even more bank failures. The largest of which was the Bank of the United States, an institution with over $200 million ($4 billion in today’s dollars) in deposits.  The future of the U.S. dollar? Not looking so good (sound familiar?). In March 1933 EVERY STATE IN THE U.S. declared a bank holiday. No, not just a day off for bank employees, but instead a nationwide closure of all bank transactions. No more withdrawals.  A key presidential adviser at the time is quoted as saying:  “We knew how much of banking depended upon make-believe or, stated more conservatively, the vital part that public confidence had in assuring solvency.”  Make believe? The same U.S. dollar that is touted as the be all end all today – the physical paper in our physical wallets or in our bank accounts – that U.S. dollar? Isn’t “make-believe” the term used to describe cryptocurrency?  The bank “holiday”* lasted from Mar. 6 to Mar. 14, 1933. 4,000 banks were unable to reopen.  Depositors lost $550,000,000 – almost $12 billion today. It had to stop. And it did. How?  Insurance to the rescue?  Skipping over the full politics of the situation, there was an obvious sentiment that confidence had to be restored in the financial system. In 1933 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was signed into law. It wasn’t simple: Big banks hated it, lobbyists fought against it, politicians clashed, but ultimately it was signed into law.  The implementation of a robust and industry-wide insurance system bolstered confidence in the banks and squashed increases in bank failures. This new secure and insured system of storing currency raised confidence by protecting depositor assets. Depositors didn’t have to opt-in for this coverage; banks were required to pay for this protection.  There is plenty of research you can do on the economic impacts of the FDIC. I believe, however, there is only one statistic necessary to focus on: In 1934, nine banks failed. Pre-FDIC 9,000+ banks failed. That’s it. Hard stop.  The question is whether something like the FDIC could be applied to crypto – giving investors the peace of mind that there is some protection in the event of a bank failure and promoting a more inclusive system. Sam Bankman-Fried had the industry’s trust, and yet everything evaporated in the blink of an eye once pulling your funds from the exchange became the most reasonable choice.  (It turns out that FTX was actually overleveraged, but before that information was released, the rational calculation would have been to keep your money on the exchange, because if everyone did that, by definition no bank run would happen.)  Current FDIC rates are 1.5 to 30 basis points per $100 of deposit. Apply this math to a bit of the crypto market:  TVL [total value locked] in CeFi exchanges and DEXes: $260 billion  2.5 basis points = $6 billion; less than 25% of total exchange revenue  In other words, that’s $6 billion used to provide user protection. Does this seem like a reasonable price to pay for a more stable system? Would this type of security increase user adoption of blockchain tech?  The numbers above don’t consider the revenue generated by other players in the blockchain economy – so it is safe to say that 25% is a high estimate, if there are other protocols or players that could help fund an insurance product.  Crypto technology can also support an FDIC-like system leveraging the permissionless nature of blockchain to create a system that protects not only the currently bankable (or those that have the privilege of using an insured bank) but anyone who enters into this ecosystem.

Nowhere is that truer than now, in the wake of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange – as the crypto industry faces a radical reckoning with concepts like risk and trust.  Recent on-chain data shows a change in custodial attitude by investors, while implying a continued interest in acquiring and holding digital assets.  As the fallout from the FTX collapse widens, trust in centralized exchanges has reached an all-time low. It’s not irrational, given recent events.  Bitcoin and Ether Supply  Glassnode data shows that bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges have sharply increased, with BTC balances on these platforms falling by 72.9K BTC ($1.2B) in just seven days.  The metric looks to capture the movement of coins from exchanges and on to self-custody wallets. It's a measure of movement, not liquidation. Investors are essentially saying, “I trust the asset, but no longer trust you.”  The same is evident for ether (ETH), as investors withdrew 1.01 million ETH from exchanges over the past seven days.  The FTX collapse marks a new starting point in how investors use exchange balances of BTC and ETH. Often, increases in the exchange balances for BTC and ETH implies bearish sentiment, as coins are sent to exchanges to ready them for sale.  But a comparison of current levels to levels prior to November 2022 may give investors a distorted view.  Now, the outflows might be signaling something very different: that users don’t want their coins sitting on the exchange – as a precaution against the risk of another deposit run similar to what just happened at FTX.  Stablecoin Supply  While the supply of BTC and ETH has declined on exchanges, the supply of stablecoins has increased. The significance of this is that stablecoins represent buying power. So as stablecoins move on to exchanges, investors are ensuring they have enough dry powder to be opportunistic.  Bitcoin and ether prices are under pressure as cryptocurrencies endure the current, harsh crypto winter.  BTC and ETH were trading sideways on Monday, albeit slightly more to the green. .  A key observation is that market correlations of cryptocurrency prices have shifted recently.  The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have been trading in lockstep as their correlation coefficient has increased to 0.99. Correlation coefficients range from 1 to -1, with the former indicating a perfectly direct relationship, and the latter implying a completely inverse one.  Since Nov. 7, the 30-DAY correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 has fallen from 0.79 to -0.44. For ETH, the shift was from .61 to -0.49.  Given the unique nature of the FTX collapse, it stands to reason that correlations will ultimately revert back to prior norms as the fallout subsides. As that occurs, digital asset markets could be poised to push higher.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/15/on-chain-data-shows-investors-waiting-changing-custody-behavior,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23b772f1b042553da8224d031a1337af94f7f3ca-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FTX Crisis Explained in Detail With the flood of details merging out of FTX's (FTT-USD) collapse, you may be asking ""what happened?"" Perhaps it would be best to start with a lengthy-but-necessary recap. The collapse of FTX may be a defining moment, creating a secular shift away from other centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase (COIN). Preceding FTX, Bankman-Fried founded founded crypto trading firm Alameda Research in 2017 , after a stint at HFT firm Jane Street Capital. Alameda had early success arbitraging geographical discrepancies in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019, with Caroline Ellison taking the helm of Alameda Research. Ellison also worked at Jane Street Capital, where she was a junior trader. It was an overnight success. FTX reaped the benefits of massive crypto trading volumes, funneling the profits into marketing efforts, such as a FTX Arena in Miami, and a $210M Esports naming rights deal . FTX attracted blockbuster backing from venture capitalists, raising $900M in July 2021 . FTX raised another $400M in a Series C in January of this year, valuing the company at $32B. FTX backers include SoftBank (SFTBY), Tiger Global, Thoma Bravo, Sequoia, BlackRock (BLK), Temasek, and Binance (BNB-USD). The FTX & Alameda Portfolio (The Block / Twitter) FTX launched its own token, FTT, which peaked at a $9.6B market cap. FTX launched a $2B venture capital fund and created a sprawling network of over 130 companies. FTX was an early investor in Solana (SOL-USD), one of the most promising crypto projects in recent years. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was featured on the cover of Forbes and hailed on the cover of Fortune as "" the next Warren Buffett "". As for Alameda, it "" was the recipient of nearly a third of all [Tether] USDT (USDT-USD) ever printed—and 86% of that was minted in the last year. "" Alameda was reported to have $14.6B in assets as recently as June 2022. FTX CEO Sam Blankmen-Fried sits on stage with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair (NY Post / Twitter) FTX was highly political right from the get go. FTX was launched, perhaps uncoincidentally, less than two weeks after the Biden presidential campaign was launched. Bankman-Fried's mother, a professor at Stanford, is the co-founder of a Super PAC for Democratic candidates . Bankman-Fried was the second largest donor to the Democratic Party last year , behind only George Soros. In May, Bankman-Fried stated publicly that he planned to spend as much as $1B in the 2024 election . Bankman-Fried's brother, Gabe, was and advisor to DNC PACs and founded the lobbying organization Guarding Against Pandemics . His aunt, Linda Friend (a professor of health policy), is co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on "" Human Enhancement "". FTX was featured prominently on the WEF website , and funded a study that found Ivermectin to be ineffective against COVID-19. Amy Wu, the head of FTX Ventures, worked briefly at the Clinton Foundation. Nishad Singh, director of engineering at FTX, was 4th largest donor to the Democratic Party in Oregon . Mark Wetjen, Head of Policy & Regulation at FTX, was head of the CFTC in the Obama administration . FTX donated money to Ukrainian citizens , and managed investments on behalf of the government Ukraine. You probably won't be surprised to learn that this has ignited rumors and conspiracies, that Ukraine used US aid to invest in FTX, which was then funneled it back into the DNC. These rumors have been denied by Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation. Rumors about FTX and Almeda's behavior have circulated on Twitter and other venues (Twitter / @hellspawncrypto) Throwing gasoline on the fire, FTX had a very close relationship with Alameda Research, both on a personal and professional level . FTX executives shared a $40M penthouse in the Bahamas known as "" the Orchid "", where they engaged in a type of group relationship known as a "" polycule "". Allegedly, the CEO of Alameda described this on what is widely believed to be her blog, likening it to an "" imperial Chinese harem "". ( The blog, which discusses the technical challenges of running a crypto exchange, has since been deleted. A full archived link can be found here. ) On Twitter, Ellison described her experience using ""amphetamines"": nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is - Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, 4/5/2021 Publicly, Ellison described Alameda and FTX as being separated by a "" Chinese wall "", but this was simply not the case. The Wall Street Journal reported that FTX executives lent client funds to Alameda in order to help Alameda meet liabilities stemming from the collapse of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in June. Reuters reported that Bankman-Fried implemented a ""backdoor"" allowing FTX to ""alter the company's financial records without alerting other people, including external auditors"". This allowed FTX to move $10B between FTX and Alameda, unnoticed. Some have speculated that Alameda even traded against FTX's clients , at the same time FTX client funds were being used to prop up Alameda. Binance, a rival firm known for its run-ins with US regulators, jumped ahead of the curve. An article by CoinDesk unveiled that the large holdings of FTX's FTT on Alameda's balance sheet 'blurred the lines' between FTX and Alameda, sparking rumors that FTX might be insolvent. Binance promptly and publicly announced that it would liquidate its entire FTT position ($529M). Binance had previously sold its equity investment in FTX in exchange for a mix of FTT and stablecoins. Twitter rumors have swirled up all sorts of possibilities (Twitter / Mario Nawfal) Binance then abruptly pivoted, signing a nonbinding agreement to buy FTX. Binance then backed out of the agreement , causing FTX to collapse. FTX's liabilities allegedly dwarf its liquid assets roughly 10:1, with some holdings as obscure as a coin called ""TRUMPLOSE"" . Alameda was allegedly shorting Tether , presumably hoping its own collapse would destroy crypto's most stable refuges. The collapse of FTX cascaded across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Crypto lender BlockFi, backed by FTX, halted withdrawals . FTX was then hacked, with ~$600M in client funds stolen , unlikely to be recovered. This prompted FTX to move assets into cold storage, taking advantage of the blockchain's security. Fueling the panic, news broke that the exchange Crypto.com (CRO-USD) had accidentally transferred 80% of their Ethereum balance to another exchange, Gate.io, in late October . FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was questioned by Bahamian police . He was rumored to be looking to flee to Dubai , then rumored to be en route to Argentina . Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison is thought to be in Hong Kong, also looking to flee to Dubai . Coinbase: The Potemkin Village I wanted to give a detailed explanation of what happened at FTX because it illustrates the issues in the cryptocurrency community, and should give an intuitive sense of where the industry is headed. After the collapse of FTX, the evolution towards trustless and decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges is likely to accelerate. People who have jumped into cryptocurrency without understanding blockchain technology are now learning a very important lesson, at the expense of FTX clients. It would be a mistake to suspect that Coinbase is a looming disaster ( one can only hope ). Coinbase is publicly traded, and thus under much more scrutiny. It does not offer or control its own token. In addition to being under US federal jurisdiction, it is under the watch of state regulators at NYDFS , like a bank. Coinbase does not offer or control its own ""native token"", though it has floated the possibility of launching one. Unstable? No. But the business model of Coinbase, much like FTX, Voyager (VYGVQ), Crypto.com, and even Binance... is a cancer in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. You may recall this article from April. The last thing that I'll say is that if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you saw a number of bilateral bespoke non-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties. Which then got repackaged and re-leveraged again and again and again... Such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happens on FTX--or other major cryptocurrency venues--today, there's complete transparency about the full open interest. There's complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust robust consistent risk framework applied. -Sam Bankmen-Fried testifying to Congress in 2021 These centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have effectively become the equivalent of the financial institutions that DeFi seeks to replace, complete with the issues that cryptocurrency is meant to solve. The model of a centralized exchange inverts the benefits of the blockchain, effectively undoing its key innovations. Coinbase may be financially robust compared to FTX, but it is inherently no different. The business model is akin to charging people to send emails. This was a profitable business for telecom company MCI in the 1980s, but it was short-lived. Once a P2P email system was viable, it became the standard, unleashing many new possibilities along the way. This is analogous to what is happening with the blockchain. Coinbase is making a huge spread by charging people to move data around the blockchain. With limited options, Coinbase is pursing a strategy that is reminiscent of AOL , attempting to create a walled garden that charges users for entry. Peer-to-peer decentralized exchanges that enable users to custody and manage their own assets will become increasingly easy and intuitive to use. This will unlock the true potential of the blockchain, through the many applications that will be developed from this. I expect that many of these innovative applications are far beyond our imagination today. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong poses with government officials. (Brian Armstrong / Previous SA article: Will Developers Burn Down Coinbase?) Centralized exchanges were necessary for cryptocurrency to become mainstream because they are bridges to the traditional banking system. However, they are unlikely to remain dominant. Perhaps they will simply become irrelevant, like many early internet companies. Lucent anyone? Coinbase is aware of this. So much like FTX, Coinbase has lobbied the government extensively as a result. Coinbase presumably hopes to shape the regulations in a way that advantages its business, keeping it relevant. Conclusion Peter Schiff / Twitter This is hardly ""the end of crypto."" The collapse of FTX is likely to drive revenue flows away from Coinbase, as development of on-chain self-custody facilities accelerates. As the costs of interacting with decentralized exchanges decreases, it will create a secular shift away from today's highly profitable centralized exchanges. Twitter Though Coinbase is aware of this and has occasionally touted new initiatives, it is totally unclear how a centralized entity can collect economic rents in a decentralized system designed to make collecting them as difficult as possible, if possible at all. My thesis is that Coinbase, among others, will become obsolete in the next cycle. That is to say, unless their lobbying efforts are able to create effective barriers that shield them from the innovations of decentralized finance.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558164-ftx-is-crypto-cancer-so-is-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4289058.jpeg

Bitcoin appears destined to fall closer to $3,000 in coming years, if it follows the traditional bust format of selling like previous manias lacking intrinsic value. Gold is uniquely undervalued in 2022, with a list of reasons to own it multiplying this year. A bullish forecast of US$2,500+ an ounce in 2023-24 is backed by historical arguments for a severe recession and another round of dollar devaluation. In the end, I expect both Bitcoin and gold prices to converge in the $3,000 to $4,000 area sooner than many think possible. I have only written one article on Seeking Alpha about cryptocurrencies, suggesting in August 2021 here investors should avoid Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), when its price was around $45,000. My story explained how Bitcoin was in a bubble that would eventually burst. I have never owned cryptos, because I have no clue how to value them without concrete, verifiable math. Bitcoin could be worth $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. Who knows, it’s all guesswork and hoping a “ greater fool ” will show up willing to pay more. Just like every other tulip craze , at some point you reach maximum ownership and speculators become net sellers, instead of buyers over time. Well, it appears we reached that balance in 2021, with a peak price above $65,000 achieved. Now price is around $16,000, while crypto exchanges are blowing up and exposing serious accounting and fiduciary issues underneath the surface of this go-go asset backed only by owner over-enthusiasm and excessive liquidity in the global financial system. An explanation of last week’s FTX (FTT-USD) saga and bankruptcy is linked here . Unfortunately, the U.S. Federal Reserve central bank has decided to mop up liquidity by raising interest rates and selling bonds on its balance sheet. This action has poked a whole in the higher “forever” hopes of crypto lovers. What if a lower forever trend is the new reality? Conversely, gold has been successfully used and valued as base money for thousands of years on every part of the globe. Paper currencies have always been tied to it, whether done officially with a gold standard or not. Trading precious metals since 1986 and engaging in all kinds of historical research, it remains fascinating to me that gold prices are clearly tethered to fiat money printing and sovereign debt issuance in every nation on earth, even in 2022. I have written many articles explaining how gold and silver prices are a function of paper monetary levels, alongside the relative pricing of alternative assets and commodities. One such effort in August on silver’s current undervaluation is linked here . My point is gold has been left for dead by Wall Street as “relic of the past” many times over my 36 years of trading experience. But, it has always come back into vogue when recession, economic uncertainty, and war show up. The exact rush of buying occurs when investors decide to turn truly fearful of the future. 2023 may provide another setup where investors, traders, institutions, and governments of all types decide they want to own it again. One bullish piece of data in November: foreign central banks have added to their gold positions in 2022 at the highest intake rate in 55 years! According to an OilPrice.com article : Central banks globally have been accumulating gold reserves at a furious pace last seen 55 years ago when the U.S. dollar was still backed by gold. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), central banks bought a record 399 tonnes of gold worth around $20 billion in the third quarter of 2022, with global demand for the precious metal back to pre-pandemic levels. Retail demand by jewelers and buyers of gold bars and coins was also strong, the WGC said in its latest quarterly report. WGC says that the world's gold demand amounted to 1,181 tonnes in the September quarter, good for 28% Y/Y growth. So, here’s my prediction: as cryptocurrencies continue to deflate in 2023, and the reasons to buy gold multiply in a deep global recession (forecast by October’s Treasury yield-curve inversion here ), gold priced in U.S. dollars per ounce will eventually converge with Bitcoin. Then, gold will surpass Bitcoin in price and reclaim its position as the leading base money to value everything else in our fractional reserve banking world. It could happen quickly, or it may take several years, but I am confident this convergence will be reality soon enough. My Specific Forecast What I am visualizing next year is a giant jump in gold prices above US$2,500 per ounce, with Bitcoin sliding well under $10,000. It is entirely logical investors and traders should prepare for both assets to converge in price between $3,000 and $4,000 at the end of 2023 or sometime in 2024. Below is a log-scale chart of pricing over the past decade for both assets, one physical, simple, understandable and accepted for thousands of years, the other a new-age computer code asset that has not been severely tested in a prolonged recession and liquidity crisis. The last time the two decentralized money ideas converged in price was early 2017. I have marked with a red box my “convergence” area to watch in 2023 or 2024. YCharts - Gold vs. Bitcoin, Price Changes with Author Convergence Point Estimate, 10 Years Since November 2021, the wicked -75% collapse in Bitcoin has done wonders to rapidly bring prices for both into closer proximity. Another -75% Bitcoin decline matched against a +70% to +120% increase in gold prices would get us to equal pricing in the $3,000 to $4,000 range. YCharts - Gold vs. Bitcoin, Percentage Price Changes, 1 Year On a 3-year chart, we can review how Bitcoin’s monster advance into last year’s peak is deflating at amazing speed. One more concentrated sell wave will put Bitcoin (and many other cryptocurrencies) back to 2019 pre-COVID levels. YCharts - Gold vs. Bitcoin, Percentage Price Changes, 3 Years How To Play The Convergence Avoiding or selling your Bitcoin now is the easiest way to sidestep the next wave of liquidation in cryptos. Pretty basic rationale. To prepare for a sizable gold advance, you can directly buy bullion and coins well above the spot pricing of COMEX futures or the official London fix. Honestly, something of a shortage globally in physical metals has existed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the best option for brokerage portfolios remains ETFs tied to bullion, if you are looking for easy low-cost ways to gain ownership and exposure. My two favorites are also the two largest in this space, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( GLD ) and iShares Gold Trust ETF ( IAU ). I own these names and others personally. On the 1-year graphs below you can review decent trends in the Accumulation/Distribution Line and On Balance Volume readings for both gold bullion ETFs. Also, I have drawn a comparison line vs. Bitcoin pricing. The two gold choices have “outperformed” Bitcoin by +267% over the last 12 months! StockCharts.com - GLD, Daily Changes in Price/Volume, Since November 2021 StockCharts.com - IAU, Daily Changes in Price/Volume, Since November 2021 Final Thoughts Could my forecast prove wrong? To a degree, it could. It’s possible neither Bitcoin nor gold declines/rises much in 2023, if a recession fails to materialize. In this case, the convergence in price may not take place for another two or three years. However, booms in things/assets with little underlying value or utility have inevitably busted all the way back closer to zero for price (after you turn your computer off, cryptos are degraded to an idea in your head). That’s the clear history of fads and manias throughout all of human time, regarding rampant speculation in beanie babies, or tulips, or dotcom stocks with no earnings/sales, or today's cryptocurrency experiments backed only by fantastical computer code and blind faith. I would rather go with a proven winner through history. Gold has been accepted as a form of wealth and currency long before Jesus or Muhammad or Buddha . You can use gold in jewelry. It's important for electronics and industrial applications. So, if track records and philosophical logic are important in your investment decision making, gold easily trounces Bitcoin for long-term holding value and worth. With a world awash in record debts and fiat money creations, gold should again stand out as a beacon of investment honesty. Gold/silver bullion are some of my biggest financial holdings as hedges against dollar devaluations in a severe recession scenario. Bankers and government officials seem OK with inflation creeping higher. What if stagflation morphs into hyperinflation? How do you prepare? I firmly believe $5,000 or even $10,000 gold quotes are a certainty over time. The only question is when will these numbers play out. Remember, gold traded at $50 an ounce in 1970 and $275 in 2001. $1759 gold today is just a temporary steppingstone to yet higher numbers in the not-too-distant future. My argument is to count on gold for future wealth hedging against dollar devaluations, not volatile/controversial Bitcoin or related crypto inventions. Food for thought anyway. Thanks for reading.

42413660,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTPW,1668545699,Online Investing Platform BnkToTheFuture Drops Plan to Acquire Crypto Lender Salt Lending Due to FTX Exposure,"The crypto contagion that was ignited by the collapse of FTX has claimed another victim: crypto lender Salt Lending. Online investing platform Bnk To The Future said it terminated its previously announced non-binding letter of intent to buy Salt Lending due to the latter's FTX exposure.  ""Bnk To The Future announces that its previously announced non-binding letter of intent with SALT Blockchain, Inc. (SALT) has terminated due to SALT’s position with FTX and for failing Bnk To The Future Due Diligence, and that the transactions contemplated thereby will not proceed,"" according to a statement. ""Bnk To The Future has no impact from neither Salt nor FTX as Bnk To The Future has no direct or indirect connection with SALT or FTX and all client funds are fully segregated and uninvested,"" the statement added.  On Sept. 2, Bnk To The Future said that it had agreed to buy Salt Lending for an undisclosed amount in order to give users the ability to borrow against their crypto holdings. The deal was contingent upon signing definitive agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals.  Salt is the latest crypto lender to get caught up in the FTX implosion that started with a CoinDesk report that raised questions about the balance sheet of trading firm Alameda Research, FTX's sister company. Most recently, crypto lender BlockFi said it had paused customer withdrawals and was reported to be preparing to file for bankruptcy.  Salt earlier had sent an email to its customers that it was pausing deposits and withdrawals on its platform due to the impact on its business from the collapse of FTX, according to a tweet by YouTuber Tiffany Fong. The memo didn't indicate how much exposure Salt had, but said that customers' loans will remain active and all loan monitoring systems will be fully operational.  In a separate tweet, Salt's CEO Shawn Owen replied to a thread stating that ""we are fully committed still to recover from the damages as [victims]."" Salt, founded in 2016 and based in Denver, was one of the first entrants into the crypto lending arena, predating companies such Celsius and BlockFi.

42413663,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTSK,1668545482,"Meaning of FTX Fall Depends on One’s Politics, US Senate Hearing Shows","The fallout of the FTX collapse has left U.S. lawmakers spinning two distinct narratives: Democrats hail their financial regulators as heroes whose caution saved the disaster from threatening the wider financial system, and Republicans argue it proves resistant agencies chased crypto firms away from the U.S. and into dangerous, unregulated territory.  Both positions were on display at a Tuesday hearing of the Senate Banking Committee, which opened with Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) recounting this year’s disintegration of much of the cryptocurrency industry and saying that the tokens themselves still don’t offer “anything useful or beneficial.” He thanked the officials testifying – including Democratic appointees from the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators – “for your skepticism about cryptocurrencies.”  Another Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), similarly praised the cautious watchdogs, saying if they’d given the industry more credibility, “We’d be cutting another check,” as the government did to bail out financial firms during the mortgage meltdown in 2008. “Thank you for what you’ve done,” Tester said.  Republicans were quick to separate the concept of crypto from the actions of FTX and its management, and to argue that if such firms weren’t pressured to operate outside the U.S., its regulators may have been able to prevent such misdeeds.  What happened had “nothing to do with the technology underpinning crypto itself,” said Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.)  And one of crypto’s most reliable Senate advocates, retiring Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) echoed that idea, saying “this is fundamentally not about the kind of assets that were held by FTX; it's about what individuals did with those assets.”  Toomey, who is leaving the Senate at the end of the year, blamed the ambivalence of regulators unwilling to provide clear guidance for how crypto could safely mesh with the existing banking system, saying it “has helped to push crypto activities into foreign jurisdictions with weaker or no regulatory regimes.”  Michael Hsu, the acting chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said he doesn’t want banks to take on any business they can’t prove will be safe, though Toomey argued that “some of the obligation” is on Hsu and others to clarify how banks can provide custody of digital assets like they do for other financial holdings.  Hsu maintained that “the custody of crypto is different.”  However, Michael Barr, the vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve, said he’s open to working on further crypto guidance for U.S. banks. So far, he said “few banks” are coming forward with plans to offer custody services.  Congressional inaction  For his part, Hagerty said some fault lies with a Congress that’s failed to come up with legislation to provide rules for crypto in the U.S.  ""We shouldn't take the wrong message from what happened last week,” Hagerty said. “No amount of poorly considered, knee-jerk overregulation here in the U.S. would have prevented a foreign-domiciled company like FTX from doing what it did.""  During his turn with Tuesday’s witnesses, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked the regulators whether any of them would – at this point – hire former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried “to manage a food truck.”  “Do you know who was watching these chuckleheads?” he asked the officials, adding that the company’s leaders seemed to have been ""engaged in stealing.""  “That's under investigation now, senator,"" replied Martin Gruenberg, the acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/meaning-of-ftx-fall-depends-on-ones-politics-us-senate-hearing-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de02595565b4d01ca6810682ba5cc1aea3d9692f-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411322,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN04W,1668544552,Common Tax and Compliance Challenges for Enterprises in Crypto,"Four years ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he “didn’t give a [damn] about bitcoin.” On Nov. 3, 2022, the investment bank and financial services holding company executed its first trade on Polygon and a modified version of Aave.  If you think the embrace of crypto from retail investors over the last 10 years was a whirlwind, wait for the tsunami coming over the horizon: Enterprise and institutional adoption of digital assets.  Pat White is the co-founder and CEO of Bitwave, a software platform that provides cryptocurrency accounting, tax tracking, bookkeeping, decentralized finance ROI monitoring and crypto AR/AP services for enterprise businesses. This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.  But just as enormous tailwinds have brought us to this point, a balanced set of regulatory, tax and compliance headwinds holds many enterprises at bay.  Let’s dig into the state of enterprise crypto adoption and explore three common tax and compliance challenges new enterprise blockchain adopters must address.  Progress is incremental until it isn’t  In 20 years, when we look back, the tail end of 2022 will go down as the most pivotal period for enterprise adoption of digital assets.  First, Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake made the network less energy intensive and, thus, friendlier to corporate environment and social governance (ESG) goals. Then, in a series of events, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed accounting rules that would lower the financial stigma associated with companies holding crypto, which was promptly followed by preliminary tax guidance from the Internal Revenue Service.  Read more: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto | Opinion  For chief financial officers at publicly traded companies or others who have to consider the financial, product-level and board-level impacts of digital asset adoption, these changes alleviate the blood-red hole in their profit and loss statements (P&L), further the board’s ESG goals and allow the product team to finally benefit from this transformative technology.  If anything, it’s already happening. Organizations including BNY Mellon, Nike, Roofstock, Gucci, Chipotle and Telefónica are using digital assets to:  Increase brand recognition and customer loyalty and reach tech-forward demographics  Improve internal business operations with practical use cases of blockchain  Accept or make payments  Access alternative investments not available through centralized finance (CeFi)  In the coming years we’ll see the blockchain applied to supply chain management, finance (asset tokenization) and energy (carbon tracking/credits). Despite these advancements, organizations will still need to address common tax and compliance challenges, regardless of where they fall in the digital asset maturity curve, including:  Getting transaction data  Understanding the data for accounting and tax purposes  Tracking holdings, which is more complex than organizations realize  The tax and compliance challenges every new adopter must address  The importance of accessing data cannot be understated. After all, it’s hard to account for transaction activity without hard data. And even though a lot of the accounting data needed for tax and compliance is on-chain, that doesn't mean it’s easy to work with. Of course, that’s ignoring the gigabytes of off-chain data sitting in exchanges, custodians and internal databases. Let’s just say a lot of data is required to get a complete picture of an organization's finances, and it doesn’t organize itself.  This brings us to the second area many organizations struggle with: understanding data.  One of the most significant issues in crypto accounting is the fallacy of network data. Many people assume that the blockchain is an all-seeing, all-documenting technology, and in some ways it is. But block explorers aren’t bank statements and can only get you so far. Copying and pasting data from Etherscan to a spreadsheet isn’t sufficient to understand what is happening from an accounting and tax perspective. You need to keep lookup tables of addresses for your customers and vendors, internal wallets and the smart contracts deployed.  See also: Why NFT Tax-Loss Harvesting Remains a Challenge for Investors | Opinion  There are also instances where the data collected is opaque. For example, interacting with a decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pool can pose challenges to even the most seasoned accountant, if for no other reason than no one in the industry can agree on how these transactions should be treated.  This brings us to the last challenge: tracking holdings.  Many organizations think you can track digital assets like forex using the average cost basis as the answer. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. At Bitwave, we like to say crypto is an unholy alliance of forex and inventory – it’s like a foreign currency you have to track at a lot level, or like inventory that you sometimes just decide to pay your employees and suppliers with.  That is to say, in order to complete a picture of the cost basis for tax purposes, you must track tokens lot by lot. This makes sense because ether (ETH) purchased in 2022 sure has a different value than ETH purchased in 2020.  Getting a headache reading this? I get it. Fortunately, many software programs can automate these processes for your organization. And while these kinds of things aren’t one-size-fits-all, there are a couple of best practices I recommend to help navigate tax season.  1. Maintain good wallet hygiene.  Good wallet hygiene is essential as organizations scale because it helps accountants understand transactions from a workflow perspective as they process them. Always keep transaction-specific wallets (e.g., investments, DeFi transactions, revenue, etc.), and use a consistent naming system. For example, if your client is a non-fungible token (NFT) creator, ensure it keeps a separate wallet for primary vs. secondary royalty payments.  2. Get help from a degen CPA.  In the normal fiat world you just need to find a knowledgeable certified public accountant (CPA). In crypto, everyone needs to be an expert in their field and the industry itself.  Get yourself a CPA who understands the complexities of accounting and knows the pain of paying 2 ETH in gas fees for a failed transaction during an NFT drop. It’s crucial that your CPA can play both sides, because even though regulators are finally starting to update guidance for crypto assets there is a lot of uncertainty.  And on this note, talk to your CPA early and often. We work with a lot of CPAs and I promise, they’re great people! But that’s not exactly why we recommend this – digital asset accounting isn’t something you can chuck over the fence once a month; your CPA is going to need your help. Trust me – it’ll save you from headaches and, it is hoped, an audit.  This wave of crypto adoption has created a new wave of tax and compliance challenges, so it's up to the crypto-natives to help Fortune 500s bridge the chasm to adoption.

42411668,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEYg,1668544230,What Is Counterparty Risk in Crypto?,"The collapse of the FTX empire easily stands out as one of the most gruesome events in the crypto world of all time. And although the dust is yet to settle, there is already a lot to unpack. For one, the ongoing crisis underscores the risks of participating in the crypto market. Specifically, it brings to the fore the prevalence of something known as counterparty risk in the crypto space and how there is little or no regulatory protection against it. In this article, we’ll explore counterparty risk in the digital asset space and why it remains one of the biggest threats to crypto holders.  Counterparty risk explained  Counterparty risk is the possibility that one of the parties involved in a transaction might fail to fulfill its end of the bargain, thereby causing the other party to incur losses. This type of risk is prevalent in credit, investment and trading-based transactions as they all require some level of trust that counterparties will fulfill their contractual obligation.  Simply, counterparty risk is a measure of how likely one of the parties is to default on their side of the bargain and how big the damage is if they do.  Does counterparty risk exist in crypto?  Interestingly, the concept that birthed Bitcoin stemmed from the need to eliminate counterparty risk when transacting.  Satoshi Nakamoto, in the Bitcoin whitepaper published 14 years ago, explained that eliminating intermediaries was the ideal solution to the weaknesses of trust-based payment models. To achieve this, Satoshi introduced a peer-to-peer network anchored by trustless cryptographic proof that entails users to transact directly without requiring third parties. Notably, this model eliminates the need for centralized entities. As such, the parties know for a certainty that transactions, thanks to the Bitcoin network, either finalize or never occur – there are no in-betweens. This model birthed the decentralization mantra that has since become one of the bedrocks of cryptocurrency.  However, the trust-based model has found its way into the heart of the crypto market. You could even argue that the present crypto realm was built on the back of centralized crypto companies. Notably, decentralized exchanges account for just 18.2% of all spot-trading volume, according to research carried out by Citigroup. This means that centralized exchanges, which operate intermediate processes for executing trades, storing coins and initiating transactions, account for the remaining 82.8% of spot-trading volume.  Apart from crypto exchanges, the other services that are susceptible to counterparty risks include crypto lending platforms, custodial wallet providers, crypto card services and centralized stablecoins.  In the case of centralized stablecoins, the issuer needs to collateralize stablecoins by holding the underlying asset. By holding sufficient collateral, the issuer is able to maintain price stability. For instance, companies issuing U.S. dollar-pegged coins need to hold an appropriate amount of US dollars to collateralize their digital assets.  See Also: What You Need to Know About Fiat-Backed Stablecoins  In essence, the crypto economy is not immune to the problems inherent in the trust-based transactional model Satoshi warned us about 14 years ago. For what it’s worth, the trust-based model remains central to the success of cryptocurrency and, judging by the events of the past few weeks, also its potential downfall. Having centralized entities control a significant share of the crypto market ultimately exposes crypto users to counterparty risks.  Why are crypto exchanges susceptible to counterparty risk?  Since exchanges are the major gateways to the crypto market, new and experienced crypto participants often deposit their funds with them. Users trust that these exchanges will have plenty of coins available whenever any user initiates a withdrawal. Unfortunately, as FTX's collapse has shown, this trust has cost many people their crypto wealth if the exchange misappropriates customer funds and cannot cover withdrawals. Another concern for customers of centralized exchanges face is a security hack that exposes users' coins to theft.  Whatever the reasons may be, the common denominator is that users are at risk of losing their funds permanently. If this proves to be the case, the affected exchange or service provider has defaulted in its contractual obligation to process withdrawals when due.  Unfortunately, there is little or no crypto regulatory framework designed to protect users from such risks. This has, in a way, emboldened unregulated exchanges, knowing fully well that they only need to locate their businesses in jurisdictions where the legal repercussions for losing users' funds are non-existent or lenient.  The Bahamian government has begun to investigate Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives of FTX and Alameda Research. That said, while it is possible the culprits are held accountable and face criminal charges, this does not guarantee that users will recover any missing funds.  How to avoid counterparty risk  Confirm the validity of the crypto exchange  If you would rather stick to your favorite centralized exchange then you ought to carry out due diligence. It is worth mentioning that the most important trait the ideal exchange has to offer is transparency. There has been a widespread call for exchanges to offer proof-of-reserves, which would show they have enough assets to offset any liabilities.  See Also: How to Get Your Wealth Off a Crypto Exchange  Opt for self custody  Although the recent FTX scandal has forced popular exchanges to take proactive steps to enable a more transparent ecosystem, the fact remains that users are still leaving a lot to chance as regards their safety. As such, the best bet for crypto participants is to opt for self custody – the act of utilizing non-custodial services and solutions such as a software wallet like MetaMask or a cold storage solution like Ledger or Trezor wallets.  Decentralized solutions are not as susceptible to counterparty risks as centralized alternatives, as they usually do not require users to deposit coins in third-party wallets.  Read More: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  Beware of defi solutions susceptible to counterparty risks  It is important to note, while decentralized finance limits counterparty risks to an extent, other elements within the DeFi space still expose risks that stem from the possibility of counterparties failing to fulfill their end of the deal. This is especially true for DeFi solutions that rely on oracles. These solutions include decentralized stablecoins (such as Magic Internet Money) and decentralized betting platforms. In both examples, the protocols require off-chain data to function optimally.  In a case where data providers erroneously or intentionally supply wrong information into the blockchain, users are bound to lose funds. And so, it is not just enough to opt for non-custodial solutions, users also have to ensure that the protocols they opt for are unsusceptible to oracle-based counterparty risks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | WALLET | RESEARCH,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-counterparty-risk-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e61567760017dab7c353b3cf145595e263dfc0fb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, its Subscription and Services revenue has increased by 42% quarter over quarter. Industry peer Crypto exchange FTX has recently filed for bankruptcy and was also hacked in a $650 million mega heist. Coinbase has grown the Intuitional Investor side of its business strong and has a partnership with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. Coinbase ( COIN ) was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong, as a safe and transparent way to trade cryptocurrencies, during a time that was like the ""wild wild west"". Since then the company has grown into the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.A and 2nd largest crypto exchange in the world, after Binance (BNB-USD). Coinbase benefited massively from the wild popularity of crypto and crypto trading during the pandemic. The ""Illusion of Control"" is a dangerous phenomenon that can occur in the mind when trading and especially with cryptocurrency. When you believe an asset will go up because it did the previous day, this can cause a dangerous cycle until it all comes crashing down like a house of cards. This is exactly what we are seeing now as we enter the depths of a harsh ""Crypto Winter"", with the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) down 70% from its all-time highs in November 2021. The recent collapse of the exchange FTX (FTT-USD) has rocked the crypto world even more. This has resulted in the young founder Sam Bankman-Fried seeing his net worth plummet from $26 billion to a mere $991 million. There are also a series of regulatory frameworks which are currently in the pipeline for development. I personally believe some regulation is a positive sign and it will actually cement Coinbase's leading position, as more regulation could deter new competitors from entering the market. The share price of Coinbase has plummeted by over 80% from its all-time highs in November 2021, despite its Subscription and Services revenue increasing by over 40% in the quarter. Thus in this post I'm going to breakdown the company's third-quarter results, give my thoughts on the FTX collapse, and reveal the company's valuation, let's dive in. Data by YCharts Third Quarter Results Users and Volume Coinbase generated mixed business and financial results for the third quarter of 2022. The company had 8.5 million Monthly Transacted Users [MTUs], which was lower than the 9 million MTUs in the second quarter of 2022. This has been driven by a prolonged ""Crypto Winter"", as asset prices have been butchered and users have become more fearful. From the chart below you can see that the total crypto market capitalization was $1.95 trillion in Q1,22 and this was sliced nearly in half to just $1.05 trillion by Q3,22. As a comparison, we could see is the entire crypto ecosystem worth similar to Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), which trades at a $1.25 trillion market cap. It is difficult to say, we do know the crypto ecosystem has captured the minds of many people and excited them but crypto-assets do not create cash flow directly. Crypto Winter (Q3 Report) There is a silver lining in the ""crypto winter"", Coinbase has noted that users are trading less, but still holding or ""hodl'ing"" assets on the platform (nice to see the company has kept its sense of humor). This is a similar pattern to the crypto crash of 2017, in which users saw assets crash. However, this time users can take advantage of staking savings products that didn't exist in 2017, now users can earn up to 5.75% which isn't bad. Coinbase has also grown the Institutional side of its platform as a portion of trading volume. In Q3,21, Institutional investors made up ~72% of trading volume, and by Q3,22 this figure has risen to ~84%. This has been driven by major partnerships such as the one with BlackRock the world's largest asset manager. The BlackRock (BLK) deal was huge for Coinbase and gave a seal of approval to its technology and regulatory compliance status. In the third quarter, Coinbase built on this momentum and added popular U.K.-based brokerage platform Trading 212, The Chicago Bulls, Banque Syz (Switzerland), and Koch Disruptive Industries (KDT) to its platform. Institutional volume is likely to be more consistent and less volatile. From my experience interviewing asset managers, I discovered many are open to carving out at least a 5% stake of their portfolio for a speculative hedge asset like Crypto. Given many institutional investors have billions of dollars in assets under management, this can add up to considerable sums. Rather than just relying on your average Joe trader to trade $500 per month. Trading Volume (Q3,22) Coinbase is well diversified across crypto asset classes with it split by approximately one-third across Bitcoin (31%), Ethereum (ETH-USD) (33%), and then Other Crypto assets at 36%. FTX Collapse - Lehman Brothers Moment? In Q3,22 Total Assets on the Coinbase Platform were $101 billion which surprisingly increased by 5% year over year from $96 billion in Q2,22. These surprise inflows came as crypto prices had a slight boost at the end of the quarter. However, with the collapse of rival exchange services provider FTX in mid-November, Crypto prices took a major hammering as shockwaves were sent through the market. If this is a ""Lehman Brothers"" moment, then it could mean a further cascade of collapses across the crypto ecosystem. Now although we aren't seeing signs of this yet it is still early days. FTX was also hacked in a $650 million mega heist on Friday the 11th of November, as the company was on its knees. The good news is Coinbase is a much more established firm than FTX, founded in 2012 vs 2019. It is also backed by some large institutional investors, such as Vanguard (6% of stock), BlackRock (3.33%), and Morgan Stanley (MS) (3.11%). Coinbase also has a simpler business model as a traditional crypto exchange, whereas FTX was more of a complex technology service provider exchange. Therefore those who are bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto and Coinbase could see this moment as an opportunity. This would be akin to investing into a bank like JPMorgan upon the collapse of Lehman brothers in 2008. Not every investor likes this style of ""contrarian investing"" and it requires a strong stomach with a long-term vision. Revenue Review In Q3,22 Coinbase generated net revenue was $576 million, which was down an eye-watering 53% year over year. This was driven by the aforementioned slowdown in trading and the ""crypto winter"". However, as mentioned prior it good to remember that the majority of users still have accounts and are holding their crypto currency. Therefore if crypto starts to rise in popularity again, Coinbase will be poised to capture economic rents. $366 million of its revenue is attributed to transaction revenue. Net Revenue (Q3,22) A silver lining for Coinbase was its strong boost in Subscription and Services revenue which increased by 42% quarter over quarter, to $210.5 million, which was fantastic. Adjusted for the average price in Q3, Subscription and services revenue increased by a blistering 148% year over year. This growth was driven by a 1,111% increase in Interest income. This was driven by the rising interest rate environment which benefits Coinbase in a couple of ways. The first is because the company is part of the USD Coin [USDC] ecosystem, which is the leading US dollar stablecoin and has a market cap of ~$49 billion. The company also earns interest on its customer account money which is held in fiat currency, which equated to a staggering $6.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Its ""Other"" subscription and services revenue also increased by 29% quarter over quarter which was solid. This was driven by Coinbase One , a premium membership product, and Coinbase Cloud which could become the backbone infrastructure of Web3 and the Metaverse. Subscription and Services Revenue (Q3,22) Profitability and Expenses Coinbase generated earnings per share of negative $2.43 which missed analyst expectations by $0.05. Its net loss ballooned to $545 million and Adjusted EBITDA was negative $116 million. The good news is Transaction expenses actually declined by 39% Q/Q to $102 million, mainly thanks to lower trading volume. The shift in income derived from interest payments has also helped to generate operating leverage, as transaction expenses made up 18% of net revenue vs 21% in Q2,22. Sales and Marketing expenses were reduced by 46% Q/Q as Coinbase scaled back its marketing spend, as consumers will be less inclined to get involved in crypto which resulted in lower efficiency on advertising spending. Technology and Development expenses also decreased by 9% year over year to $556 million, as the company is driving greater efficiencies in its software. Expenses (Q3,22) Coinbase has a solid balance sheet with $5.6 billion in U.S dollar liquidity. In addition, the company has $3.64 billion in total debt. Balance Sheet (Q3,22) Advanced Valuation In order to value Coinbase I have plugged the latest financials into my advanced valuation model which uses the discounted cash flow method of valuation. I have forecasted a continual decline in revenue of 5% for next year, driven by the prolonged ""Crypto Winter"". However, in years 2 to 5, I have forecasted revenue growth of 10% per year. I expect this to be driven by continual growth in subscription revenue and favorable comparisons to the prior year. Coinbase stock valuation 1 (created by author Ben at Motivation 2 Invest) Optimistically, I am forecasting Coinbase to increase its pre-tax operating margin to 20% over the next 6 years. 23% is the average margin for the software industry, I have used this margin as the company provides a software-based finance product. The company is already managing to improve the efficiency of its platform, so I believe this is achievable if a crypto tailwind gives the stock a boost. Coinbase stock valuation 2 (created by author Ben at Motivation 2 Invest) As an extra datapoint Coinbase trades at a Price to Sales ratio = 4.1 which is significantly cheaper than historic levels of over 10. Data by YCharts Risks Recession/Crypto Winter Crypto prices had a huge boost in 2020, as a cash-rich consumer with plenty of time of their hands ""dabbled"" in crypto trading and a huge amount of speculation. But now the environment is very different, as high inflation and interest rates rate, the consumer has been squeezed and crypto has been put on hold or ""Hodl"" for many. Therefore I do expect short-term volatility in this market and a continued lack of trading/engagement. The collapse of FTX could be a Lehman brothers moment but also an opportunity for long term investors. Final Thoughts A bet on Coinbase is really a bet on the future of the cryptocurrency market. If you are a ""believer"" that decentralized finance will disrupt incumbents and a series of Web3 applications will take over the world, then Coinbase is the ideal way to play this trend. However, it should be noted that there is no guarantee crypto will bounce back, its future is based partly on a ""killer application"" and also on the excitement of the individual trader.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558078-coinbase-ftx-collapse-could-be-lehman-brothers-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4286851.jpeg

That money – part of which is represented in locked SRM tokens held as collateral – is now likely wrapped up in Alameda’s own bankruptcy proceedings, adding another obstacle for Celsius’ creditors. It and some 130-odd other entities tied to Bankman-Fried filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week after a bank run exposed a multi-billion-dollar hole in FTX’s reserves.

In January 2020, for example, Celsius had $3.6 billion in total exposure to FTX Group. But it whittled down its exposure to $354 million immediately prior to its own bankruptcy filing earlier this year.  Celsius is the latest crypto company to disclose its exposure to crypto exchange FTX and trader and market maker Alameda Research.  Ferraro told the court that Celsius’ outstanding loans were part of its revenue generation, post-bankruptcy, though he admitted that the bankrupt crypto lender’s revenue is currently “obviously at a much lower clip, than it was pre-filing, pre-pause.”  Ferraro also said Celsius is generating a “moderate amount of top-line revenue” across staking deployments and its mining business.

Celsius has reportedly defaulted on payments to Core Scientific, which is facing its own financial trouble. Core Scientific has claimed that Celsius owes it over $5 million in unpaid bills.  Despite Celsius’ seeming inability to pay Core Scientific, Ferraro told the court that it was “incredibly strategic and important” that Celsius continue to build out a mining facility in Midland, Texas. The Midland site currently has 3,000 mining rigs, according to Ferraro.  The judge asked Ferraro if the recent price drop in bitcoin meant Celsius’ nascent mining operation was now losing money.  “From an operational perspective, we are cash flow positive,” Ferraro told the judge. “The margins are compressed – it’s probably around 20%, where we sit today, but you know, we have the ability to shut off the machines if they cost more to produce a bitcoin than the amount that we can mint it for.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Cheyenne Ligon, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/celsius-is-owed-12m-by-alameda-research-newest-member-of-bankrupt-crypto-club,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e51ae7eb62a69b087893c6b225fac088ea8e11e7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411320,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzxu,1668541310,What's the Matter With Delaware? How Joe Biden's Home State Became a Global Tax Avoidance Hub,"In the recent comedy of errors surrounding Elon Musk and Twitter, the state of Delaware played a crucial role in checking the bumbling billionaire’s freewheeling approach to contract law. After Musk, the CEO of Tesla, spent months ineffectually trying to weasel out of an April offer to buy the social media platform, it was a judge in Delaware’s so-called Chancery Court who ordered Musk to follow through on his $44 billion weed joke.  That trial took place in Delaware because Twitter, Inc. has its corporate registration there. So do Amazon, Google, Walmart and Meta (formerly Facebook). In fact, companies responsible for an incredible 45% of U.S. GDP [gross domestic product], and making up two-thirds of the Fortune 500, are registered in Delaware. So are innumerable shell companies, foreign subsidiaries and limited liability companies (aka LLCs) controlled by wealthy individuals.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Those big U.S. corporations register in Delaware because of the state’s extremely generous state tax rates and rules. They collectively save billions of dollars in corporate income taxes compared to registering in the states where they’re actually based – money that would otherwise go to services from health care to highways across the U.S.  At the same time, Delaware offers a slightly different benefit for entities and individuals around the world: effectively anonymous registration for shell companies that can be used to hide investment holdings from real estate to equities to, at least in theory, crypto. While the recent blowup of FTX highlights the extreme risk of largely unregulated “off shore” entities, the fact of the matter is that Delaware’s anti-transparency policies could enable the same kind of frauds right here in the U.S. In the world of traditional equities, they already have – again and again.  These various allowances are often collectively referred to by tax and fraud experts as “the Delaware loophole.” The most authoritative estimate available found that the Delaware loophole cost other U.S. states somewhere between $6.6 billion and $9.5 billion in lost revenues between 1995-2009. But that’s just an estimate: we can’t fully measure the impact of Delaware’s lax policies, because they also include measures making such oversight impossible.  “It’s hard to estimate [the impact], because we don’t know who’s behind these companies,” said author and former Financial Times reporter Hal Weitzman. “A lot of what we don’t know is hidden behind anonymous LLCs, and Delaware has been very vigilant about making sure anonymity persists.”  Read more: Phil Gaudiano - The Tax Impact of This Year’s Platform and Protocol Failures  Combined with the big tax advantages, this veil of corporate secrecy has turned America’s second-smallest state into a vital nexus point in the same global tax avoidance, fraud and money-laundering network that includes sketchy little outposts like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Weitzman details the whole sordid mess in his new book, “What’s the Matter With Delaware?: How the First State Has Favored the Rich, Powerful and Criminal – and How It Costs Us All.”  While defenders will argue that Delaware is simply offering a preferential business environment, it’s stunning how much overt fraud has flowed through its systems. Delaware entities were used by the corrupt lobbyists Jack Abramoff and Paul Manafort, more than a decade apart. Enron, the paradigmatic modern fraud, involved two thousand corporate subsidiaries that stretched across 23 states – but 685 of those, nearly one-third, were registered in Delaware.  And Delaware’s impact stretches well beyond U.S. borders: the perpetrators of Malaysia’s 1MDB mega-heist used eight Delaware companies to steal billions including funds used to finance 2013’s “The Wolf of Wall Street.”  Delaware is also, of course, the home of American President Joe Biden. Biden was for many years derisively known as “the Senator from MBNA,” the credit-card issuer, because he was a dogged supporter of Delaware’s lax rules. Among many others, that included rules allowing far higher credit card interest rates than other states do – which is why four out of five major credit card issuers are now registered in Delaware.  The story of Elon Musk and Twitter represents a putative upside to Delaware’s dominance of corporate registration. As defenders of the system often argue, Delaware offers a robust corporate legal setting, rich in precedent and expertise. But Delaware’s Court of Chancery is also deeply undemocratic: its cases are not heard by juries. So while the chancery system may occasionally produce a gratifying comeuppance for those who try to ignore the rules, their main role is creating rules none of us have any input into in the first place.  These are the (tax) breaks  Delaware offers the tax-avoidance equivalent of a Chinese buffet – you can have damn near anything you want, in prodigious quantities.  The most visible and perhaps largest element of the Delaware loophole is the state’s exemption of revenue from “intangible assets” from state corporate income tax. Intangible corporate assets most obviously include intellectual property like patents, brands, and logos – but creative accounting can stretch the designation beyond the point of absurdity.  Read more: David Kammerer - The Silver Lining of a Crypto Market Decline: Tax Savings  Weitzman tells the eye-popping story of Home Depot, which made a representative use of the intangible revenue loophole. In the early 1990s, Home Depot introduced its now well-known mascot “Homer.” The company simultaneously created a Delaware subsidiary called Homer TLC, Inc. to house its mascot, branding, and other intellectual property.  Home Depot then “negotiated” a royalty payment for using that IP that reached 4% of gross sales in 1999. Of course, that’s a negotiation in name only, because two related entities can’t be trusted to realistically price the exchange of assets. Because Homer TLC’s revenues were entirely from intellectual property, and Delaware has no tax on IP income, this in effect meant Home Depot payed no tax on 4% of its gross revenue.  And viola, huge tax savings. Homer TLC had just four employees but $2 billion in annual revenue funneled through Delaware by the early 2000s – all of it derived from intellectual property, making it tax free. Given the U.S. average effective corporate tax rate of 23.4%, Home Depot was using the Delaware loophole to legally steal around $468 million dollars per year. Above all, the victims were residents of Georgia, the state where the company was founded and headquartered, and where that $2 billion would have been taxed – if it weren’t for Delaware.  And that’s just using the loophole as its drafters intended. Once corporate lawyers get creative, all bets are off. Weitzman cites the incredible example of now-fallen telecommunications giant Worldcom. For a time, Worldcom effectively classified its own executives under a Delaware-registered entity, which charged the parent corporation for “management expertise.” Because that’s an intangible asset, that segment of revenue was suddenly free of state corporate tax.  “What that means,” Weitzman summarized, “is you can pay yourself to do anything, tax free.” Not coincidentally, Worldcom was later revealed to be engaged in much broader criminal accounting and tax fraud.  The intangible assets loophole is Delaware’s most broadly appealing menu item, but it also has offerings for more niche tax-avoidance tastes. For instance, the combination of anonymous shell corporations with a zero sales tax has turned Delaware into a hub for fine art sales and storage – which itself remains perhaps the largest completely unregulated asset market worldwide.  Art buyers may for that reason particularly benefit from Delaware’s completely anonymous corporate registration. The state doesn’t just protect information about the identities of the beneficial (that is, real) owners of a company – it doesn’t collect the information in the first place, stymying financial fraud investigations worldwide. That has made it a haven not just for corporate tax avoidance, but for the kind of tiny shell companies that can be used to hide all sorts of financial shenanigans.  A race to the bottom  Finally, why exactly has Delaware created a massive tax loophole at the expense (literally) of the other 49 states? What does Delaware get out of the deal?  The answer is: both a great deal, and embarrassingly little.  Corporate fees make up a whopping 40% of Delaware's state revenues. A local legal industry has also grown up around the loophole, made up of the lawyers and affiliates who help companies through the system – but also, incredibly, everyday folks who get paid simply to put their names on corporate registrations. But that adds up to a relative pittance compared to the billions in taxes avoided in other states – to say nothing of the nebulous social costs of enabling corporate anonymity.  This has persisted in part because Delaware’s industrial and jobs base has been brutalized over the past three decades – in part thanks to free-trade policies championed by Joe Biden and fellow corporate neoliberal Democrats. The decline of manufacturing in favor of services (including legal and financial services) is “more pronounced in Delaware than anywhere else in the Union,” Weitzman said. At this point, providing tax avoidance is a sizable part of the Delaware economy and tax base, increasing resistance to reform even as it impoverishes the neighbors.  This exemplifies a broader “race to the bottom” in recent decades, as states have increasingly competed to provide tax incentives to attract corporate jobs. These are often disastrous for states, such as in the case of Wisconsin’s catastrophic $2.85 billion in incentives for a Foxconn factory that was never built.  Those incentives almost always amount to a transfer from individuals and small businesses to large corporations who know how to work the system. The same can be said for the Delaware loophole specifically: a small organic farmer in Idaho might not have the time or know-how to benefit from registering a shell company in Delaware. But huge agribusinesses like Monsanto or Conagra know every detail, helping make their (often inferior) products cheaper. Over time, such imbalances create an uneven playing field that helps crush small business and buttress socially-damaging monopolies.  Heads we win, tails you lose  There have been significant recent efforts to close the Delaware loophole. Late in the Trump administration, the Corporate Transparency Act nominally implemented requirements for transparency around beneficial ownership of both corporations and LLCs, starting in 2024. That is, it would require disclosure of the named human beings currently able to hide behind anonymous shell companies, undermining some key aspects of the Delaware loophole.  But Weitzman is not optimistic about the measure, citing a myriad of issues including a built- in two-week reporting delay, a carveout for trusts, and the fact that the registry itself will be entirely private, only accessible to government officials and law enforcement. In this it could replicate the flaws of the U.K.’s Companies House, a public registry that, thanks to a lack of oversight funding, often includes clearly fake beneficial ownership information.  “The fact that you set up a registry doesn’t mean that you’ve solved the problem,” Weitzman said. “Somebody has to police that.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

As the crypto industry is largely unregulated, there is a strong possibility that other platforms like FTX have been using customer deposits for speculative trading or lending. Regulation is a double-edged sword for cryptocurrencies as it will help to restore trust, but at the same time, cryptocurrencies will lose their essence. Overview ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) (""the fund"") is the first U.S. Bitcoin (BTC-USD)-linked ETF which offers investors exposure to Bitcoin. The fund does not buy Bitcoin directly, but instead, gets exposure to Bitcoin via futures contracts. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.95% per annum (10th cheapest among similar ETFs ). VanEck and Global X provide similar ETFs with lower expense ratios. Performance The fund's performance has not been great. An investment of $10,000 at inception would be worth approximately $2,700 today, representing a capital loss of more than 70% on paper. ProShares Portfolio The fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin. There are currently no ETFs that offer direct exposure to Bitcoin. Instead, BITO seeks to provide exposure to Bitcoin via futures contracts. ProShares This week's news of the collapse of FTX has drawn parallels with the 2008 financial crisis and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. What does this mean for BITO and Bitcoin? We will look at this in more detail in the next section. Is the FTX collapse a potential Lehman moment for Bitcoin? Yes potentially. FTX has filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection due to a liquidity crunch during the week, and it is impossible not to draw similarities with the 2008 financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis has taught us a few things. First, the inter-connectedness of the financial industry makes the FTX collapse a potential Lehman moment for the crypto industry due to the possible risk of contagion. FTX customers were stopped from withdrawing their deposits, which raised a lot of questions from regulators globally. It was reported that FTX had been using customer deposits to fund risky bets, which eventually led to its downfall. As the crypto industry is largely unregulated, there is a strong possibility that other platforms like FTX have been using customer deposits for speculative trading or lending, which could lead to contagion and the eventual collapse of the crypto industry. Like the banking system, trust is key for cryptocurrency exchange platforms to operate. The collapse of FTX will be a massive breach of trust for the public, and it will take time to come back. FTX customer deposits are not insured by any public or private deposit insurance agency, which means that people will be losing their money. Following the financial crisis, the banking industry became under increased scrutiny and regulation by the U.S. regulators. For example, the banking industry was required to comply with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to avoid liquidity crunches. I believe that the cryptocurrency industry will have to become more regulated as it will help to restore trust in the system. Outlook for Bitcoin The price of Bitcoin has fallen below the $20,000 mark, below its 2017/18 peak. It has been an absolute rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin holders. Coindesk With inflation out of control and uncertainty over how high interest rates need to rise, I believe Bitcoin will stay in a bear market until everything is sorted out. I believe that institutional investors will reconsider their position on Bitcoin following the collapse of FTX. Until cryptocurrencies become fully regulated, the risk of fraud will be too high. Institutional investors might have to sell their crypto assets to de-risk their portfolios, which will put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. For retail investors, I believe that inflation and high borrowing costs will eventually start to hit their income and ability to save and invest. This will reduce the ability of retail investors to keep on buying Bitcoin. Additionally, better savings rates are increasing the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin. All of these factors will put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. Conclusion Only time will tell what happens next. The inter-connectedness of the crypto industry and the risk of contagion will be tested in the next few weeks. The collapse of FTX and its impact on customer deposits has provided regulators with sufficient ammunition to start regulating the crypto industry stringently. Regulation is a double-edged sword for cryptocurrencies as it will help to restore trust, but at the same time, cryptocurrencies will lose their essence. BITO is definitely a sell in the current environment. A combination of new regulation, inflation, and interest rates will continue to put downward pressure on Bitcoin and BITO.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558055-bito-ftx-collapse-potential-lehman-moment-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4285839.jpeg
42411319,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzhN,1668540839,Let’s Talk About the New York Times' ‘Puff Piece’ on Sam Bankman-Fried,"Sam Bankman-Fried has been typing out a cryptic message in the days since his crypto empire, composed primarily of the FTX exchange and Alameda Research hedge fund, bottomed out. “What,” the thread began, followed by single tweets containing single letters spelling out “H A P P E N E D.”  Indeed, what happened? A lot of information has come to light in the days since crypto poster boy Bankman-Fried has become a subject of criminal investigations the world over, including on-chain evidence suggesting FTX customer funds were used to backstop losses at the market making trading shop Alameda.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are conspiracies regarding Bankman-Fried’s donations and familial ties to political leaders, suggesting he was prepaying for amnesty or favorable regulatory treatment, and screenshots of Bankman-Fried’s open-office desk, with what appear to be prescription stimulants and off-brand nootropics on view.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Can't Stay Off of Twitter  There's been sleuthing into the romantic ties between Bankman-Fried and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and reblogs of her very strange “California rationalist”-tinged writings about race science and polycules.  There are leaks of private messages and transcripts from supposed internal meetings where Bankman-Fried and Ellison at times ask employees to lie publicly about their businesses’ solvency and also seemingly admit guilt about abusing funds.  In short, there is no lack of suspicion about what happened at FTX and Alameda. For many, Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace is bigger than the suspected $10 billion dollar hole he burned into his companies’ balance sheets. In just three years, SBF had built a reputation as the people’s billionaire, someone who wanted to bring crypto mainstream and donate his fortune.  “It feels like when Sam wins, we all win,” I remember a crypto trader saying in a since-deleted tweet responding to the accusation that SBF was like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who apparently traded against users of his derivatives exchange. Bankman-Fried, who was suspected of doing the same thing on his platform “built by traders, for traders,” could be forgiven, due to his charitable persona, tireless work ethic and off-the-chart intelligence.  Open secrets were seemingly pushed under the rug. In retrospect, it’s suspicious just how many media projects Bankman-Fried bankrolled – from the industry’s most influential podcast “Up Only,” co-hosted by the influencer Cobie, to a popular show at CoinDesk and upstart media company Semafor (co-founded by former Bloomberg CEO Justin Smith and industry legend Ben Smith). He was someone not just building a reputation, but an aura.  We watched Bankman-Fried, often dressed in shorts and unbecoming garb, grow fat and slovenly under the stress of the bull and bear markets. We saw him make a mockery of Congress, entering the chamber with untied shoes. He was “one of us,” many have said. The pain of FTX’s downfall is more than financial – it’s a personal betrayal.  And so, on Monday, after the New York Times published the first interview with Bankman-Fried since his public fall from grace, it wasn’t surprising there would be angry readers and commenters. The article, written by Times crypto beat reporter David Yaffe-Bellany (with contributions by industry legends including Erin Griffith and Ephrat Livni), has been widely slammed as a “puff piece.”  “At the same time they were pumping the FTX scam, they were writing defamatory gossip pieces about industry stalwarts, driving their audiences away from safe, reliable and proven venues,” Kraken ex-CEO Jesse Powell said, presumably referring to his exchange and Coinbase, which have been center to a few media storms.  “Disgusting complicity on the part of the New York Times. He has ruined countless people's lives by theft and fraud, and NYT is now helping him to delay or evade justice by whitewashing him in their prestigious, influential newspaper. I doubt this is just a mistake on their part,” Zcash co-creator Zooko Wilcox said.  At risk of sounding complicit in an effort to launder Bankman-Fried’s reputation, I want to say simply that the Times article is … fine. In about 1,500 words, Yale-grad Yaffe-Bellany tries to distill a narrative that really requires a book. In a story where so much is still speculation, there is little that writers on deadline can do.  Was the interview a missed opportunity? Probably, for both sides of the call. Yaffe-Bellany says Bankman-Fried stayed on the line for over an hour – and yet there are no direct quotes concerning the conflict of interest between FTX and Alameda, neither a confirmation or denial that SBF illegally commingled funds between the two or further admissions of guilt. There's little sense SBF, who stepped down from the exchange, is taking responsibility for the situation.  But, what, you want SBF to perjure himself? It’s a shame that Yaffe-Bellany wrote about Bankman-Fried’s cryptic Twitter thread, rather than the tweets he has been deleting. It sucks we know nothing more about the Bahamian withdrawals FTX opened, claiming it was at the behest of the island nation’s securities regulator – which the agency debunked. It is also regrettable that the Times failed to note the eccentric former billionaire had invested in the video game he said he was playing.  However, it seems clear enough that questions were asked of SBF and dodged. And there’s reason to doubt everything he says regardless, considering how he lied to users to get them to keep funds on FTX. The truth will come to light – former insiders will continue to speak out and criminal investigations will go deep. We can assume the worst of SBF, but he also deserves a fair trial rooted in facts.  The media, perhaps especially crypto-native publications, is complicit in the rise of Bankman-Fried. However, it was CoinDesk’s Ian Allison that knocked over the first domino, and several publications (alongside citizen journalists) continue to break news regarding SBF’s house of cards. But there are things that can be suspected, and things that are known.  We don’t know if Bankman-Fried was committed to the philosophy of “effective altruism” (EA), driven by greed or possibly suffering side effects of Emsam (which includes compulsive gambling). Perhaps, EA itself is always flawed – a useful cover to excuse any bad deed in service of some poorly defined goal of “the good” – as flawed as the idea of a “centralized” exchange for decentralized assets.  See also: The Downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX  In a real sense, Bankman-Fried never represented crypto. People first realized this after getting wind of his regulatory agenda, which would have eliminated financial privacy, tanked decentralized finance (DeFi) and built a moat around FTX. And so, even if the New York Times wants to write a softball story about a billionaire who (inexplicably) is finally getting some sleep – does it matter? It speaks volumes.

4284746,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508537,1668538835,This Indicator Hints US Investors Sold Bitcoin Harder Than Others During Crash,"The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index suggests US investors have been selling more heavily than others during the latest crash in the crypto. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Turned Deep Red Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whales on Coinbase Pro seem to have been behind the latest dump. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that measures the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase Pro (USD Pair) and the one listed on Binance (USDT pair). Coinbase Pro is popularly known to be used by investors based in the US (especially large institutionals), while Binance gets a more global traffic. Therefore, the price gaps listed on these two crypto exchanges can hint at which investors are selling or buying more. When the metric has a positive value, it means the value of BTC on Coinbase is higher than on Binance right now, suggesting that US investors have provided more buying pressure recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moves Differently From US Stock Market, Correlation Weakening? On the other hand, negative values of the premium suggest American holders are dumping more than global investors at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been red in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has plunged into negative values recently along with the crash. This means that US investors have been dumping more aggressively than investors from the rest of the world in the past week. Related Reading: Quant Points Out Striking Resemblance Between 2017 And 2021 Bitcoin Cycles Also, as is clearly visible in the chart, a similar trend was also seen back in early May, when BTC’s price crashed from $40k to $30k. The quant notes that while Coinbase observed this selling, the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index showed an interesting behavior. The below chart highlights this trend. Looks like this metric had a green value recently | Source: CryptoQuant The Korea Premium Index measures the gap between the prices listed on South Korean crypto exchanges, and that on other exchanges. From the graph, it’s apparent that during both the current crash as well as the one in May, the indicator showed positive spikes. This implies that while the US investors were dumping, the Korean investors were focusing on “buying the dip.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.8k, down 15% in the last week.

And yet Sokolin told CoinDesk TV's “First Mover” on Tuesday that ""prices are not the end goal” and crypto’s future shouldn’t depend on the market’s immediate place today.  “They might be a reflection of value … but they’re not the thing that you’re trying to optimize,” Sokolin said. “What you’re trying to actually optimize is people building things that are novel, useful and that anchor in new technology.”  Read more: Solana Foundation Invested in FTX, Held Millions in Sam Bankman-Fried-Linked Cryptos on Exchange  He added that crypto’s long-term trajectory depends on the new technology pushing “the frontier of what’s possible.”  At the same time, Sokolin said he’s worried that people will stop seeing “crypto economics as a legitimate field” and begin to “lose confidence,"" giving the example of Solana.  On Monday, the Solana Foundation said that it had upward of $135 million worth of SRM tokens and about $3.4 million FTT tokens stuck on the FTX exchange. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a vocal supporter of Solana and Serum, a decentralized exchange built on the blockchain. Both were hurt by Bankman-Fried's fall from grace.  “I’m worried that a lack of trust in the Solana ecosystem will spread to a lack of trust in the model,” Sokolin said.  Despite the turmoil caused by FTX, a Bahamas-based exchange that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week and that faces prosecution, Sokolin said it’s important to consider the “organic entrepreneurship” in crypto, pointing out that blockchains such as Ethereum are continuing to “build collaboratively.”  Read more: Solana DeFi Sees Almost $700M in Value Wiped Out on FTX Fallout",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | FTT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/15/consensys-economist-still-has-hope-for-crypto-after-ftxs-fall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42fefc539f068e4b8ea8b57024a8c81268f44207-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413673,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTZo,1668536872,"Crypto’s Political Cash Backs Winners, But New Lawmakers Will Arrive Under FTX Cloud","All 19 of the congressional candidates backed by the crypto industry’s most widely supported political action committee, GMI PAC Inc., won their races last week, sending 16 new members to the House and Senate.  The millions in campaign spending from this group is at least partially responsible for a large number of relatively young and crypto-friendly additions to Congress. But that positive performance is also at least somewhat eclipsed by the FTX meltdown. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a top contributor to GMI.  “Bankman-Fried contributed $2 million in January, and GMI's relationship with him was limited to his interest in GMI's mission at the time of his contribution,” the organization said in a statement to CoinDesk. The early GMI money was quickly channeled into two other political action committees that supported crypto-friendly candidates from both of the major U.S. political parties.  “As with all contributors, Bankman-Fried had no involvement in decision making about the PAC’s activities or which candidates the PAC supported,"" the statement read.  The implosion of his crypto empire and the devastation wrought on other companies and the real-people users of FTX will likely shape how Congress views digital assets in the coming session. Whether crypto goodwill will remain for those GMI and its affiliated PACs helped into office will immediately be tested.  The PAC’s success rate can be credited to a strategy that supported candidates in districts or states in which their party is dominant. The 16 new members of the House and Senate “span the ideological spectrum,” according to GMI, and have skills “to secure America’s role in the development of the next generation of the internet.”  Apart from favoring a few crypto-supporting incumbents such as Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) who may become chairman of the House Financial Services Committee if Republicans win the House majority, the industry channeled money to winning congressional candidates such as Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett and Maryland Democrat Glenn Ivey. GMI also boosted future senators such as Eric Schmitt, a Republican who has served as Missouri’s attorney general.  Still, the events of this month, where one of crypto world’s pillar companies is under investigation as an epic fraud, will play a part. Congressional hearings will likely question what happened with FTX, and the new lawmakers will have to consider appropriate legislation in what could be the most important year yet for the industry on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, they will represent – to some degree – a legacy of Bankman-Fried’s big year as a political patron.  FTX has quickly become a political talking point in Congress. At a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) opened his questioning of U.S. financial regulators by lamenting the industry’s dangers, thanking the officials “for your skepticism about cryptocurrencies.”  Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the panel’s senior Republican, defended crypto, arguing that the FTX damage ""is fundamentally not about the kind of assets that were held by FTX; it's about what individuals did with those assets.""  Crypto was already a difficult political topic, with one of GMI’s winners – incoming Congressman Jonathan Jackson from Chicago – seeking to distance himself from industry support during his campaign, well before FTX self-destructed.  Even if the candidates who received Bankman-Fried’s help wanted to give back his money, much of it could be impossible to return, because the outside spending on help such as television ads – known as “independent expenditures” in the rules of U.S. campaign finance – doesn’t count as a direct campaign contribution. GMI, for instance, spent all of its money in this way.  Another PAC that Bankman-Fried funded with $27 million in donations, the Protect Our Future PAC, was meant to support candidates – primarily Democrats – who would push for protections against future pandemics. His giving halted in June, though some of his favored candidates went on to win in the general election last week.

The move comes as many central banks explore the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital currency, a digital representation of fiat currency issued by a central bank.

42411327,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN0L3,1668533400,The Long Arm of FTX,"Two weeks ago, I thought the biggest story for the week of Nov. 8 would be the U.S. midterm election. Control of both the House and the Senate were up for grabs, with the future of crypto legislation at stake. All of that’s still true, but FTX collapsed in incredible and rapid fashion, with the effects reverberating throughout the world, and that’s really taken precedence in both crypto interest and national attention right now.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  FTX Went Mainstream  The narrative  FTX filed for bankruptcy last week, in what appears to be the most chaotic way possible.  Why it matters  The vibe has shifted. When Terra collapsed it was because it was a quirky crypto experiment that was obviously not going to succeed and thank goodness its effects were just limited to other crypto companies. Celsius and Voyager filed for bankruptcy and, wow wait, what were these companies doing with customer funds? Three Arrows fell apart – but again, hey it's a crypto hedge fund or something, the broader world isn't going to care.  FTX is something new. Partly because of how ridiculously this whole thing fell apart, partly because of just how insane some of what's been reported seems and largely because of how much FTX tried to become a part of the broader world, everyone is paying attention. That's going to lead to some interesting outcomes in the fallout.  Breaking it down  I’m going to quickly recap what happened. For those of you who have not closed Twitter in the last 170 hours or so, feel free to jump down to the next subheading.  On Nov. 2, my colleague Ian Allison published a report revealing that much of the balance sheet for Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm, was composed of a large amount of the FTT token, which is issued by the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Alameda and FTX share the same founder and ownership, so this immediately raised some questions about the figures these companies were reporting and in particular, whether this meant that either company had all the funds they claimed.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder in question, took to Twitter to reassure investors that everything was fine. A few days later, he and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao announced Binance would acquire FTX. Then CZ pulled out. But FTX US was still fine, Bankman-Fried said.  And then on Friday, FTX Group filed for bankruptcy, including FTX US, Alameda Research and, bizarrely, a bunch of companies that weren’t actually under the FTX umbrella and were quite surprised to discover they were listed. A leaked Excel spreadsheet reported by the Financial Times suggested FTX had less than $1 billion in assets, against around $9 billion in liabilities (and was written in such a way that Bloomberg’s Matt Levine possibly went insane).  The bankruptcy filing was chaotic, to say the least. At the time of writing, we still don’t even have a full bankruptcy document. We just have the top sheet where FTX says loosely how many creditors it has (over 100,000) and checks off ranges for its assets and liabilities ($10-$50 billion for both).  *Editor’s note: FTX, Alameda and the various companies finally began filing more information late Monday night. Click here for more.  The sheer insanity of what happened was perhaps driven home late Friday night, when after everything else, the exchange was hacked (or “hacked”).  This story has naturally drawn mainstream attention from around the world. My friends have asked about it. My parents have asked about it. My parents' friends have asked about it.  And that is just one of the reasons why it's worth exploring just how deeply entrenched FTX became over the past two years or so.  Sheer scale  It would be difficult to overstate the reach FTX had. Bankman-Fried was a major political donor over the past two years. He donated millions to the winning campaign of now-President Joe Biden in 2020. He donated to primary candidates and lawmakers from both parties this year.  Some of these lawmakers are already starting to announce they'll donate the funds tied to Bankman-Fried. CoinDesk continues to reach out to the rest.  GMI PAC, a political group backed by Bankman-Fried, saw 19 candidates it backed win.  Within the ordinary course of business, Bankman-Fried was testifying on crypto legislation before Congress and proposing novel ways of settling derivatives trades to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The chair of the CFTC expressed on multiple occasions how interesting the proposal was.  Bankman-Fried took photos with lawmakers and regulators.  There's also a conspiracy theory that FTX was a Democratic Party psyop designed to funnel crypto investors' money to the party as part of a broader push to kill crypto, or that Ukraine funneled money to the Democratic Party by way of FTX. Sometimes this theory also trades in antisemitic tropes. This is very dumb.  For one thing, Bankman-Fried didn't only donate to Democrats, though he was a major party donor. For another, he donated a lot to primary candidates who didn't win. Also, it’s probably worth noting that FTX Digital Markets Co-CEO Ryan Salame donated heavily to Republicans.  I'll trust that if you're reading this newsletter, I won't need to explain that antisemitism is bad (and also, for what it's worth, not even accurate).  Beyond that, though, FTX really did sponsor or partner with all sorts of things. There was FTX Arena, the home of the Miami HEAT basketball team. There was Major League Baseball, where every referee had an FTX patch on their jerseys. There was the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, which FTX helped funnel donations to. A Formula 1 team. The Golden State Warriors. The World Economic Forum. The University of California – Berkeley’s entire athletic department. Not one, but two different esports organizations. If you went to Boston, you saw FTX signs on the street. If you went to the Bahamas, you could attend multiple conferences with FTX branding. The company really was everywhere. That's a lot of normies who saw the name or logo somewhere, even if they didn't follow the crypto sector all that closely.  FTX worked with companies to issue Visa debit cards, Bankman-Fried had a sizeable stake in Robinhood and former world leaders and luminaries took the stage with him.  And this doesn’t even get into all the venture capital firms and others who invested in FTX.  A lot of these groups are now starting to cut ties with FTX. Unlike the Nationals’ Terra deal, it does not appear that many of these sponsorships were prepaid, meaning those groups now have to find new sponsors. And as for the rest of these companies or groups, I'd imagine they're going to be cutting ties and and the non-crypto folks are going to be asking a) how did a company with apparently no internal controls come to occupy such a large space in the world and b) what will regulators do to prevent this from happening again.  The backlash is going to be severe.  I spoke to several lawyers and D.C. insiders about the situation last week as things unfolded. One thing that’s clear: lawmakers are paying attention. There's talk of hearings, potentially before the end of this year, according to Ron Hammond at the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbyist group.  I wrote a bit about the different ways that backlash could evolve for CoinDesk on Monday.  One possible reaction is that regulators will become more proactive about how they oversee crypto, rather than reactive. This is the fourth major failure this year – Luna, Celsius, Three Arrows and now FTX. Is this going to spur actual global coordination around crypto regulation? Or even just unilateral action from entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission?  It’s not immediately clear to me what U.S. regulators could have done about FTX specifically, given it headquartered in the Bahamas.  We haven't heard anything specific on this yet, and I suspect it may take a while before we will. But the amount of attention FTX is getting makes me suspect that there will be pressure from lawmakers to act swiftly, rather than wait for the next shoe to drop.  And as Ken White, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at the Brown White & Osborn law firm, told me, this is the kind of “splashy” case that investigators would want to prosecute.  “There's tons of fraud and securities fraud out there and the Feds can't go after it all. The things they go after tend to be big in numbers or splashy or somehow sexy and high profile,” he said. “This is all those things. A huge amount of money, it's very public … it involves exciting new technology and new ideas and all that. It's exactly the type of case that the Feds would invest resources into going after.”  On the other hand, the financial shock appears to so far be contained within the crypto ecosystem. One issue several regulators had warned about pre-FTX was the possible contagion risk posed by crypto becoming a part of the broader financial system. So far, that hasn’t happened yet. That could blunt the regulatory response somewhat.  On another note, there is no way to succinctly sum up the sheer amount of coverage CoinDesk has published over the past week and change. Click here for a list of all our recent stories.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Fresh off the news that Democrats would retain control of the Senate for the next two years, U.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Acting Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg to a full term helming the agency. Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) praised the move. House Financial Services Ranking Member Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called it a partisan section. And the Conference for State Bank Supervisors lamented the lack of state bank supervisors on the FDIC.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The New York Times) Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is still giving interviews. He spoke to the Times about recent events.  (The Washington Post) There was a tweet last week from a verified account claiming to be pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. The tweet said that insulin would now be free. The actual Eli Lilly was surprised and unamused. It’s now canceling its Twitter ad buys.  (HSE University) Longtime readers will know I’m a nut for all things LEGO.

The digital asset had hit a low of $15,500 before bouncing back up, all of this happening in response to the decline of FTX, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume. The price of bitcoin had altered and recovered above $17,000, dragging the market back into the green, but this could only be a short-lived recovery. A Bull Trap In The Making With the decline that was seen in bitcoin and the general crypto market on Wednesday, it was expected that there would be some kind of recovery. This was further propelled forward by the positive CPI data release on Thursday, triggering a good bounce in the price of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Strength As Price Holds Above $16,500; Is This A Bear Trap? However, it is not exactly a completely positive return given how much of its value was recovered and the time frame in between. More often than not, recoveries like these are a bull trap intended to pull more liquidity into the market. Even with the recovery in price, the sell-offs have not subsided, which puts investors coming into the market at these prices at a disadvantage. A retracement from this level will likely lead to lower lows and a new cycle low. BTC price remains volatile | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com There is also no significant support for bitcoin above $17,000. Everything from the current price down to $16,500 hangs by a thread. This means that bitcoin will not be able to withstand another downtrend and will see it establishing support just above $16,000. Bitcoin Still Not Bottomed For many, it is easy to believe that the bottom is in for the digital asset simply because it has fallen below its previous cycle low, but historical trends show there is still more decline to come. It was the case with bitcoin back in 2018 when the price had finally hit $10,000 and it seemed there was nowhere left to go. In the end, BTC would bottom out just above $3,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies 15%, Why Ripple Could Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum With bitcoin sitting well below its 50-day moving average, the sell-off trend remains strong. Too much supply is being dumped in the market with not enough demand to soak it up. Add in the fact that the FTX case is still unraveling and will do so for the next few months, and more downside is expected for bitcoin. A likely bottom point for bitcoin during this cycle would be the $13,000-$14,000 level with some wiggle room.

Current Bitcoin holding value significantly below debt used to buy coin. MicroStrategy's core business is not healthy. High Likelihood of total shareholder impairment. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) reported a typically mediocre operating quarter at the beginning of November and a catastrophically bad investment quarter. The bad news for MSTR shareholders (and some bondholders) is that the core operating business does not matter much at this point. The crypto market bloodbath has overwhelmed everything else tied to this company. If the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) does not improve markedly over the next few years, shareholders (and some bondholders) will likely be impaired. As a brief reminder, MSTR has a moribund software business that has not shown much if any growth for years. The company likes to tout its conversion to a subscription model but you can see from the numbers below, they barely matter in the grand scheme of overall revenues. MicroStrategy Revenue Breakdown (Q3 MicroStrategy Earnings Presentation) Moreover, since it is subscale with anemic growth, its margins are weak for a software company, where healthy operating margins are normally well north of 20%. Even using non-GAAP numbers, MSTR operating results stink versus scaled software providers. MicroStrategy GAAP and non-GAAP Profit Breakdown (Q3 MicroStrategy Earnings Presentation) The Bitcoin Bet As I wrote previously about this company , Chairman Michael Saylor (with the approval of a Board of Directors with a high risk-tolerance) has made an enormous leveraged bet on Bitcoin--$4 billion worth using $2.4 billion of debt, including $500 million of first lien secured bonds and another $205 million of secured loans. This debt, particularly the secured debt has quickly become a major problem for MSTR shareholders. For starters, at a Bitcoin price of $16,500, the 130,000 Bitcoin the company bought at an average price of about $31,000 are worth only about $2.14 billion, so less than the company's debt load. Remember from my last write up, the company's enterprise value before the Bitcoin purchases was only $600 million. With ~$250 million of debt net of the Bitcoin , this company would only have a market cap of about $370 million if we're just valuing the software business, which I showed above is likely not more valuable now. Market Cap (9.7mm shares at $118) $1.150 billion Debt $0 Cash and Short-Term Investments $532 million Enterprise Value $618 million EV/TTM EBITDA ($119 million) 5.19x EV/Sales ($475 million) 1.3x But the company has more shares now after the equity issued to purchase the Bitcoin. 11.3 million instead of 9.7 million. So going back to a $370 million market cap would mean a value of ~$32/share, down over 80%. Unfortunately, that's not even the worst news for shareholders. The secured bonds are issued by MicroStrategy Inc. They were issued after the company had already issued $1.7 billion of convertible bonds (unsecured) and were specifically used to buy Bitcoin. Since the company already had a sizeable debt load, these bonds had to be backed by all of the operating assets of MicroStrategy in addition to a specific claim on 14,800 Bitcoin. Therefore, in a distressed scenario, these secured bonds would lay claim to those Bitcoin and if that did not satisfy them, they would get first dibs on the operating business. The loans were issued earlier this year by an entity called MacroStrategy LLC, with a specific claim on $30,051 Bitcoin. The rub is that the MacroStrategy loan is effectively a margin loan, one that can only be about 50% of the value of the Bitcoin pledged to it. Right now, at a Bitcoin price of $16,500, that loan is collateralized. Should the price drop below $13,600, more Bitcoin would have to be pledged. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings by Claim (Q3 presentation) What I find particularly galling is that Michael Saylor had a huge, if improbable win on his hands for a little while. It should be fairly obvious to everyone, including Saylor, that the core software business is unlikely to ever garner much value. So Saylor threw what I believe is a hail Mary pass with the Bitcoin bet and it worked! He had billions in gains with Bitcoin at over $60,000. He could have monetized them, paid off his debts and walked away with a huge cash cushion that he could have distributed to shareholders. Instead, he kept pressing the bet. Now, not only are shareholders massively underwater unless Bitcoin recovers, he will struggle to refinance his debts as they come due. Worse yet, if Bitcoin keeps falling, all shareholders (and some bondholders) will be wiped out or impaired. In my opinion, the taking on of leverage for a risky bet and then not monetizing the win is horrendous risk-taking with shareholder money. The Only Good News From MicroStrategy The only credit I give this management team is they issued convertible bonds with low coupons. The interest costs on that debt are not horrible and first bonds don't mature until 2025. The market is not too sanguine on ultimate recovery as the 2025 convertible bonds are trading at $63, which is about a 16.5% yield to workout. The 2026 convertible bonds are in the 30's. A lot can happen in three years. Maybe some miracle comes along and Bitcoin gets back to breakeven. I wouldn't count on it, but what do I know. Conclusion As far as I can tell, the only thing holding up this stock price is short covering and some investors who still believe that Michael Saylor will somehow create value for them with his leveraged bet on Bitcoin. I really don't understand the latter. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, there are many other avenues to do so without the leveraged risk and currently underwater nature of the bet embedded in MSTR. Then again, given the awful headlines at FTX, one should be VERY careful where you deposit any hard cash to invest in this asset class.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558000-microstrategy-crypto-losses-wiping-out-equity-value?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4281201.jpeg

The grouping was a follow-up to an emergency meeting held to protect investors after the collapse of Terraform Labs in May, the report said.  “As the market fell due to global austerity, Terra-Luna, Celsius and FTX failed one after another, making it a year of declining trust,” Lee Myung-soon, senior vice president of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), said at the meeting.  Kim So-young, vice chair at the Financial Services Commission (FSC) added that considering the urgency of protecting users, it was better to have minimum necessary regulatory standards in place and add to them, rather than waiting for international standards.  The FSS is responsible for examining and supervising financial institutions, under the broad oversight of the FSC which makes financial policy.  Kim said that the FTX crisis revealed the need to have regulatory mechanisms to prevent unfair trade and ensure virtual asset service providers fulfil obligations to protect user assets, and to forbid service providers from issuing tokens.  South Korea’s government officials are currently drawing up a comprehensive regulatory framework, the Digital Asset Basic Act, expected to be finalized next year. The act will be formed from 13 crypto legislative proposals currently before the National Assembly.  “Considering the rapid change in the digital asset market, the Financial Supervisory Service will actively support legislation through monitoring, so that overall regulations such as digital asset disclosure can be prepared,” Lee said.

42411698,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEbz,1668528861,What Are DeFi Tokens?,"DeFi tokens represent a diverse set of cryptocurrencies native to automated, decentralized platforms that operate using smart contracts. These provide users’ access to a suite of financial applications and services built on the blockchain.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens command a $45 billion market cap, a relatively small proportion of the overall cryptocurrency market. That being said, it has become one of the fastest-growing sectors in the industry.  What are some top DeFi tokens?  Decentralized finance is an interconnected ecosystem of non-custodial financial protocols, platforms and services.  In first place is lido staked ether (SETH), which represents Ethereum that has been staked within staking protocol Lido, according to Coin Gecko’s list of DeFi tokens.  DAI, a USD-pegged stablecoin minted by MarkerDAO, is the second-largest DeFi token by market cap.  In third place is UNI, the native token of UniSwap, a decentralized exchange that runs on Ethereum.  It’s followed by Chainlink's LINK, the native token of the decentralized oracle network that feeds smart contracts with accurate, real-world data such as weather reports or price information.  Although cryptocurrency market trackers like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko group all DeFi-related projects under the same category, they can be further differentiated based on the governance tokens some DeFi protocols offer.  What are governance tokens?  Most DeFi tokens are linked to DeFi protocols, which, in some instances, are governed almost entirely by their community of users.  To participate in the future decision-making processes of these types of DeFi platforms, users are required to purchase and hold what’s known as “governance tokens.” These tokens possess special rights and allow holders to vote on proposed changes to the platform. These votes are nominally binding on the developer team and their values are often proxies for confidence in the project.  Decentralized exchange Uniswap’s native token UNI is the largest governance token of its kind. Uniswap launched UNI in September 2020, airdropping 400 UNI tokens to each wallet address that had interacted with the protocol at least once before September 1 of that year.  As a general rule, users who hold more of a particular governance token have greater voting powers over those with fewer tokens. This is done under the assumption that those who are willing to invest more in a particular project are more likely to want it to succeed, and will therefore vote on the most appropriate proposals to achieve that goal.  Since Uniswap’s airdrop, many other protocols have also airdropped governance tokens to early adopters to encourage participation in the voting process. Governance tokens can also be earned through active contribution to the protocols, for example by providing liquidity to a protocol’s asset pools.  Other major governance tokens include:  PancakeSwap (CAKE)  Aave (AAVE)  Maker (MKR)  Governance tokens are also speculative assets, just like most other cryptocurrencies. You can trade them on centralized or decentralized exchanges without partaking in any governance decisions, and their prices typically fluctuate like any other volatile asset.  Some newly issued governance tokens may be non-tradable until the token holders decide they can be transferred between wallets.  Where to buy DeFi tokens?  DeFi tokens might sound like tokens you can only buy on DeFi protocols, but that’s not the case at all. Most centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance list major DeFi tokens. These can be traded or invested in just asd you would any other type of cryptocurrency.  In order to participate in protocol governance, you will need to hold the tokens in a DeFi wallet and connect the wallet to the governance platform used by that particular protocol, such as Snapshot. It’s worth noting, participation in governance does not incur any gas fees.  Read more: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  What are the risks of DeFi tokens?  Even if you buy DeFi tokens through platforms that aren’t DeFi-based, such as centralized exchanges like Coinbase, you’ll still be exposed to DeFi risks associated with the protocols those tokens represent.  DeFi tokens may suffer significant losses when the underlying protocol suffers a critical vulnerability. In October 2021, the price of COMP, lending protocol Compound’s governance token, plunged when millions of dollars were drained from its treasury after a fault in the code was exploited by a hacker.  Read more: The Big 5 Risk Vectors of DeFi  Like other cryptocurrencies, changes in the project or the team may also shift market sentiments. In March 2022, DeFi tokens associated with Andre Cronje’s project fell sharply when he and a colleague announced their departure from the industry.  Is there a way to gain exposure to all major DeFi tokens?  If you want to invest in DeFi and but you’re not sure in which token to invest, you might want to consider a DeFi token index fund, such as The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) offered by Index Coop. The token tracks the performance of DeFi tokens in its basket, such as UNI, AAVE and MKR.  However, remember that neither The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) nor individual DeFi tokens will necessarily track the long-term success of DeFi – just as shares on the stock market can take a life on their own independent from a company’s success.  Moreover, the risks of investing in DeFi also apply to index funds. Indexed Finance, another index fund protocol, suffered a $16 million exploit in October 2021.

42411709,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJwd,1668528738,Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What’s the Difference?,"If you are considering buying or selling crypto, your first port of call will probably be an exchange. Most commonly, the first point of entry to trading cryptocurrency is a centralized exchange (CEX), a digital marketplace where crypto trading takes place. You have probably heard of a few: Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and so on. In Nov. 2022, a CoinDesk scoop led to a stunning turn of events that led to formerly popular exchange FTX collapsing and filing for bankruptcy.  This has led a lot of crypto investors to look for alternatives to centralized exchanges. The obvious alternative are a newer type of exchange that is decentralized such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap. These decentralized exchanges radically rethink how exchanges can work.  See Also: What Is an Exchange Token?  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have been emerging over the last five years to challenge incumbent CEXs. In brief, DEXs aim to offer lower transaction fees, let users directly hold their own assets and avoid some regulatory burdens. On the other hand, they face the cost of compensating their liquidity providers for a special kind of risk called “impermanent loss.”  CEXs offer advantages too. Most centralized exchanges use a business model similar to traditional institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, which is a structure traditional investors understand and may feel more comfortable with. Their interfaces and apps tend to be more beginner and user-friendly and generally offer more liquidity and stronger regulatory assurances, which can be especially important for institutional clients. But it also means the central company running the exchange has a lot of power and responsibility for the financial stability and health of the exchange.  See Also: How to Get Your Wealth Off an Exchange  If the recent drama around FTX has you considering moving to a DEX, here's what you need to know.  How do DEXs work?  DEXs aim to complete transactions more quickly and cheaply than their centralized counterparts. They do this by cutting out the intermediary entities that take a cut of transaction fees on CEXs. The 2018 whitepaper of the world’s largest DEX, Uniswap, proclaims ""zero rent extraction."" It aims to protect its users from the additional costs entailed in generating profit for the intermediaries that run CEXs. Bancor, which launched in 2017 and describes itself as the first DEX, advocates for the decentralized approach like this:  “Liquidity on traditional asset exchanges has historically been provided by a small handful of professional trading firms with permissioned access and specialized tools. This concentrates liquidity in the hands of a few actors who can withdraw their assets during periods of volatility and restrict trading of an asset when users need it the most.”  In late 2021, the leading DEX Uniswap was charging a 0.05% transaction fee on the $100,000 trade sampled by global accountancy KPMG. CEXs Binance, Coinbase and Kraken were charging 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively.  DEXs use “automated market maker” protocols to determine the prices of assets without a centralized body orchestrating trades. A common approach is the “constant product” mechanism, which determines prices offered as a function of the ratio of the DEX’s total reserves of each of the assets involved. This has the advantage of tending to keep reserves in relative balance: If any asset became scarce, it would become extremely expensive.  Nevertheless, DEXs still tend to offer roughly the same prices for assets as CEXs. This is because attentive traders or bots can quickly profit from any discrepancy in prices through arbitrage. If a certain pool contained very little ETH, it would have to let traders sell ETH into the pool at a higher price than the wider market indicated. Traders could easily profit by buying it in the wider market and selling it into the pool. As they did so, the volume in the pool would rise, reducing its offered price until it matched the wider market.  Read More: Understanding the Technology Behind Decentralized Exchanges  Impermanent loss: A big problem for DEXs  As neat as this system is, it does introduce a risk for the liquidity providers behind the pool. The risk is called impermanent loss. Liquidity providers are entitled to withdraw the portion of the value of the pool they contributed, not the exact number of tokens they put in. It could not promise all providers their exact tokens, because the ratio of different tokens held in the pool changes as trades occur. But as the ratio adjusts to reflect current wider market prices, the pool is going to progressively contain more of whatever token is losing value, and vice versa.  This means that a liquidity provider will tend to end up withdrawing more of the token that lost value and less of the one that gained value, compared with their starting assets. Therefore, they will end up poorer than if they had just held onto their assets privately. In practice, DEXs generally compensate liquidity providers through transaction fees. But that means charging higher fees than they would otherwise need.  Custodial vs. non-custodial  Another part of the trade-off between DEXs and CEXs comes down to whether users would rather hold their own crypto directly or entrust it to the exchange. CEXs typically require that users place assets in their custody before trading.  Holding your assets yourself keeps to the ideal of self-reliance that permeates the crypto sector. You have full and exclusive control over them. But on the other hand, without due care, private keys can get lost or destroyed, rendering the associated assets irretrievable. Welshman James Howells mistakenly threw away a hard drive in 2013 and lost access to 7,500 bitcoins that would be worth well over $100 million as of Nov. 2022. He has repeatedly and unsuccessfully appealed to the local council to let him excavate its landfill site.  Regulations, regulations, regulations  The growing popularity of DEXs may in part reflect their success in dodging some regulatory hurdles. The company that builds a DEX avoids acting as a financial intermediary or counterparty and does not have to meet know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) standards because it operates autonomously. ShapeShift used to be a CEX until its CEO said the company lost 95% of its users as a result of KYC measures it was forced to implement in 2018. In 2021, Shapeshift decidedly pivoted and became a DEX to shrug off this problem.  Liquidity  DEXs may struggle more than CEXs when working with larger investors. At this time, they cannot yet compete with the largest CEXs in size so they cannot offer as much liquidity. When they meet with insufficient liquidity, large orders can face unplanned additional costs called “slippage.” Furthermore, institutional investors face AML and other regulatory hurdles of their own and may struggle to deal with exchanges that do not submit to similar requirements.  Sergej Kunz, the co-founder of liquidity aggregator DEX 1inch Network, noted last year that banks and hedge funds had been slow to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) because of their own regulatory hurdles. Although it is a DEX, his company now plans to launch a compliant product called 1inch Pro, specifically to cater to these clients.  New aggregator protocols like 1inch have emerged specifically to help larger investors avoid liquidity problems when using DEXs. 1inch raised $12 million in 2020 in a funding round led by Pantera Capital.  The rise of aggregators actually means that users can access liquidity from DEXs and CEXs at the same time. The protocol DiversiFi, which is itself a DEX, aggregates liquidity from both kinds of exchanges in order to help its users conclude larger trades more efficiently. This helps investors to avoid the costs that come with an exchange’s liquidity proving too small for their order.  When it comes to deciding which type of exchange to use, it boils down to two things: If you are you primarily interested in ease of use and are uncomfortable with being in total control of your own wallet then a CEX is probably the best option for you. If lower fees and more control over your own funds are most important to you, then a DEX is the way to go. Whichever way you go, make sure you know how to get your crypto off an exchange and into cold storage to keep your wealth safe in the long term.

42411324,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN0B8,1668528591,The Tax Impact of This Year’s Platform and Protocol Failures,"Throughout 2022, the crypto economy has been in the throes of a bear market, which has taken a heavy toll on investors, platforms and protocols. While investors have watched the value of their holdings drop, there has been an uptick in failures at the platform and protocol levels, which has added fuel to the fire of investment losses and caused many questions for taxpayers caught in the middle.  Let’s examine two of the larger events to occur this year: the Celsius Network bankruptcy and the failure of Terra and its cryptocurrency LUNA, and discuss the potential tax implications of each.  Phil Gaudiano is the co-founder and CFO of Polygon Advisory Group. This article is part of Tax Week.  Celsius  Celsius was a crypto lending platform that advertised very high interest rates on various cryptocurrencies that its 1.7 million users transferred to the platform. At its peak, the company held almost $12 billion worth of customer deposits under management. Then, on June 12 of this year, facing a liquidity crisis, Celsius posted a memo online informing its users that all withdrawal, swap and transfer functionality would be temporarily paused. A month later, on July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  For customers of Celsius, there are many questions related to the failure of the platform. One that we often hear in our tax practice is, “Can I deduct my Celsius losses?”  The deductibility of Celsius losses hinges on the concept of bad debt, which is outlined in Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. Since most Celsius customers are individual investors, we will look specifically at Section 166(d), which deals with nonbusiness bad debts, defined as any debt not related to the taxpayer’s trade or business. Generally, a nonbusiness bad debt is recognized as a short-term capital loss on a taxpayer’s return.  Two requirements need to be met to recognize a loss from a nonbusiness bad debt on a tax return:  There must be a bona fide debt  The debt must be completely worthless  Under Regulation Section 1-1.66-1(c), a bona fide debt is based on “a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money” at some point. The determinable sum of money involved here would be the value of crypto deposited into Celsius.  For the debt to be completely worthless, it must be considered wholly uncollectible. It is important to note that under the regulations there is no mechanism for partial deductibility of nonbusiness bad debts. Instead, the entire debt must be worthless to deduct the bad debt as a capital loss.  Many taxpayers believe that Celsius’ bankruptcy filing is grounds to consider its underlying debts worthless; however, Regulation Section 1.166-2(c) holds that bankruptcy only indicates the worthlessness of “at least part of” a debt. Remember from above that the debt must be completely worthless to recognize a capital loss, so the regulations are reasonably clear here that bankruptcy proceedings don’t guarantee complete worthlessness.  So, what is a person who has crypto locked inside Celsius to do? The short answer is to wait and see. Once bankruptcy proceedings are finalized, some or all of the funds owed by Celsius to its customers may be paid back. But until we know for certain how much, if any, will be returned to customers there is no allowable tax loss. The entire tax code revolves around realization events – the consummation of transactions that have an economic effect – which trigger recognition of income, deductions, gains and losses. In this situation, there has been no realization event yet. In short, nothing has happened from a tax perspective.  Terra  The Terra ecosystem was a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that provided high yields to investors. During 2022 the yields offered on staked deposits of its native stablecoin terraUSD (UST) were nearly 20% per year.  TerraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin that used its sister cryptocurrency, LUNA, to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar. In May, over $2 billion worth of terraUSD was unstaked and began to be liquidated. As a result, terraUSD lost its peg to the dollar. More LUNA was minted in an effort to reclaim the peg, thereby flooding the market with LUNA tokens and diluting the value of each LUNA token in circulation. In a matter of a few days, LUNA had gone from a market price of over $120 to less than 1 cent.  Many investors saw the value of their LUNA and UST holdings fall precipitously during the crash. While it is unlikely that LUNA and terraUSD will recover their values (both are currently trading more than 95% below all-time highs), there is some relief available to investors who choose to sell their holdings and recognize a capital loss.  As mentioned previously, realization events form the backbone of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). IRC Section1222 discusses various types of capital gains and losses, all stemming from the “sale or exchange” of a capital asset. In short, in order for a capital loss to be recognized an investor must first sell the asset at a loss. Continuing to hold LUNA (now trading as LUNC) or UST precludes loss recognition because no sale has occurred. The silver lining here is that both UST and LUNC are still available to trade on many exchanges, so selling the assets at a loss is possible.  Celsius and Terra are not the only major failures we have seen. Numerous other platforms and protocols have succumbed to the bear market over the course of 2022. For taxpayers caught in the middle there is some relief available through deductible losses – as either bad debts or capital losses, depending on the situation – but not until there is some triggering event that causes realization of those losses. If you are a taxpayer with exposure to a failed crypto project, consult your tax adviser to determine the best course of action in your case.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Phil Gaudiano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/15/celsius-terra-tax-implications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d431fb7f8c1f2f0378b7a1558e5f5bbc0cd5546-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A great retreat of institutional investors and a prolongation of crypto winter will be the immediate first-order consequences. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin purchasing model will survive any further fallout from FTX. The collapse of the crypto exchange platform FTX (FTT-USD) came unexpectedly, unfolded in a few days, and has rocked the crypto industry to its core. FTX was the third-largest exchange in the world and one of the most visible crypto companies on the back of a rapid rise to prominence during the pandemic as the company splurged on celebrity sponsorships and a Super Bowl commercial. Fundamentally, the FTX bankruptcy will come to become a watershed moment for the beleaguered industry still reeling from a year that saw the collapse of the Terra/Luna currency (LUNC-USD), the bankruptcy of Voyager Digital Ltd. (VYGVQ) and BlockFi, the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, and the implosion of market maker Alameda Research. 2022 was when crypto dreams died. There is likely more pain to come. Indeed, Core Scientific ( CORZ ), the largest Bitcoin miner in North America, has indicated that it might file for chapter 11 bankruptcy after running into financial difficulties. The core risk for Tyson, Virginia-based MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) will come from the global regulatory response to the 2022 crypto crisis. The company is split in two between a conventional enterprise analytics business providing business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services to its customers. The other part functions as a direct Bitcoin holding company. This dual business model has seen MicroStrategy garner a significant retail investor base as the options for stock market exposure to Bitcoin as an asset class remain quite limited. Whilst there are a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs, the SEC has for years rebuffed spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The most recent attempt is the spot ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF , which the SEC is still seeking market feedback on. Critically, the collapse of FTX makes any such approval and the subsequent flood of capital into Bitcoin even more unlikely. Hence, retail stock market investors have a limited pool of options. This has historically driven MicroStrategy to trade at a substantial premium to its net asset value. A New Regulatory Landscape And Stunted Bitcoin Adoption Saylor's MicroStrategy is a Bitcoin maximalist. This describes a stance that believes Bitcoin is the only true digital asset and that all other cryptocurrencies are not useful. Hence, the company only invests in Bitcoin and recently purchased an additional 301 Bitcoins for $6 million at an average price of $19,851 per Bitcoin to increase its total Bitcoin holding to 130,000 bitcoins. This total was acquired for $3.98 billion at an average price of $30,639 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy The company recently reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 third quarter, which saw the business pull in revenue of $125.4 million , a 2.1% decrease over the year-ago quarter and a miss of $445,000 on consensus estimates. This decline was set against cash burn from operations of $1.5 million, a significant deterioration from a positive cash flow of $14 million in the year-ago quarter. Management flagged their hybrid approach of running a mature yet cash-generative enterprise analytics business together with acquiring and holding Bitcoin as a treasury reserve for the long term. But the underlying analytics business has now had two quarters of negative operational cash flows, with rising interest expenses being a core factor in this. MicroStrategy MicroStrategy has historically been dependent on debt and aggressive share dilution to purchase Bitcoin rather than only using positive cash flow from its operations. The company has a total debt balance of $2.4 billion but at an extremely low blended annual interest rate of 2.01%. This is positive as it's essentially half the current Federal funds rate of 4%. The bulk of the balance is in the form of convertible senior notes, and the option to convert them to equity will likely be chosen when the first note comes due in December 2025. The most near-term debt coming due is a $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan in March 2025. This provides material leeway. FTX Failure Caps A Bleak Year For Cryptos MicroStrategy has recorded a cumulative impairment loss of $1.99 billion since it commenced its Bitcoin purchases and the company will have to record even higher impairment charges with Bitcoin currently trading at $16,260 , down significantly from just two weeks ago when the earnings report was released. Saylor has gone on the defensive post-FTX collapse. He believes Bitcoin to be in a dysfunctional relationship with other cryptocurrencies that he wants out of. He also appealed to regulators to set out a clear roadmap for legitimate cryptos to register to become digital securities or digital commodities. The future of the industry post-FTX should be one of registered digital assets trading on regulated exchanges, where everyone has the type of investor protection they'd be accustomed to on the NASDAQ or NYSE. The company also recently filed to sell up to $500 million of its common shares, a move that should see them raise more cash to potentially take advantage of any further pullback in Bitcoin prices. Overall, there are likely going to be substantial chances to acquire Bitcoin in the weeks ahead as the full impact of the FTX implosion continues to reverberate across the industry and the crypto winter enters a new year. MicroStrategy should be fine with its leverage being extremely cheap and unlikely to pose a problem even with Bitcoin collapsing below $10,000. Longs are more likely to be worried about the company's total equity slipping further into the negative. This was at negative $200 million as at the end of its third quarter and renders the stock as an avoid.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4557963-microstrategy-isnt-collapsing-ftx-contagion-saylor-goes-defense?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4279710.jpeg

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Has Declined By 61.5k BTC Since 6 Nov According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC long-term holder supply has observed a notable decrease recently. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) make up a cohort that includes all Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. Holders belonging to this group are statistically the least likely to sell at any point, so movements from them can have noticeable implications for the market. The “long-term holder supply” is an indicator that measures the total number of coins currently stored in the wallets of these resolute investors. Changes in the value of this metric can tell us whether the LTHs are accumulating or selling at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH supply over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has decreased in the last few days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 46, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply had been riding a constant uptrend for many months before last week, and set new all-time highs. This means that the market had been continuously accumulating the crypto as the bear market went on. Related Reading: Quant Points Out Striking Resemblance Between 2017 And 2021 Bitcoin Cycles However, since the 6th of November (when the crash triggered by the FTX collapse began), the indicator has sharply declined, suggesting that LTHs have participated in some selling. In total, the decline has amounted to around 61.5k BTC exiting the wallets of the LTHs in this period so far. The chart also includes the data for the 7-day changes in this Bitcoin indicator, and it seems like the metric has a negative value of 48.1k right now.

Nonetheless, it remains to be seen where the metric goes from here. “Should this develop into a sustained LTH-supply decline however, it may suggest otherwise,” cautions Glassnode.

42413675,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTbg,1668527750,Analysis: FTX’s TRUMPLOSE Token Isn’t Proof of an FTX-Democrat-Ukraine Conspiracy,"As Sam Bankman-Fried has fallen from grace to become crypto’s latest and greatest villain, Crypto Twitter and the conspiracy theory industrial complex is focusing on the presence of a token called TRUMPLOSE which still sits on the balance sheet of the company he once ran.  For those looking for a shadowy tale that involves crypto in the halls of power in D.C., TRUMPLOSE is going to disappoint. It’s not a new world order talisman that shows FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried are complicit in laundering money to the Democratic party through Ukraine donations. Rather, it’s one part of FTX’s prediction market it ran during the 2020 U.S. election.  During the U.S. election, FTX ran a series of prediction markets where traders could purchase TRUMPWIN or TRUMPLOSE tokens that would resolve to $1 should Trump have won or lost, or resolve to $0 if the opposite should occur.  Pollsters got the 2016 election dead wrong, and many thought that prediction markets would be a better source of alpha for the 2020 election.  “There are 25 or more years of data that show prediction markets do a better job predicting outcomes than polls,” Dr. Emile Servan-Schreiber, founder and CEO of Lumenogic and an expert in prediction markets, told Politico in 2014.  There was also a general TRUMP perpetual contract, which had the shape and feel of a crypto perpetual that FTX was famous for. Like the tokens, should Trump have won, it would have risen to $1, and when he lost, it fell to $0.  With such a turbulent election, the token moved fast and hard. Performance at the debates moved its price in real-time, as did announcements like Trump’s COVID diagnosis.  At the time, FTX said that $2 million in total trading volume in its TRUMP contract followed the COVID announcement.  Although some bought the WIN/LOSE token, or took a position in the contract out of partisan conviction, many treated the outcome of such a pivotal election as they would with any other cryptocurrency: as degenerate positions with the extreme leverage one could only enjoy during the prelapsarian days of the 2020 bull market.  While it’s strange that this token turned up on FTX’s balance sheet – especially now that it's illiquid as the election is long over – to the disappointment of those wearing the tinfoil hats, the explanation for it is much more mundane: TRUMPLOSE is just a hangover from a prediction market the exchange ran in 2020.

42413668,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTX0,1668524711,The ‘SBF Bill’: What’s in the Crypto Legislation Backed by FTX's Founder,"The swift and surprising collapse of crypto exchange FTX last week continues to send shock waves across the crypto industry and beyond – and Capitol Hill isn't immune.  Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was, until last week, a major political donor – he gave $5.2 million to U.S. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and spent another $40 million supporting mainly Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections – and an influential figure in Washington.  Bankman-Fried regularly met with regulators and lawmakers, weighing in on how the crypto industry should be regulated. He was a vocal supporter of one bill, in particular: the bipartisan Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), a still-in-progress bill backed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and ranking member, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.).  This year, Bankman-Fried has donated at least $26,600 to Stabenow and $8,700 to Boozman. In June, he donated $16,600 to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who signed onto the bill in September, and in 2021, he donated $5,700 to Sen. Cory Booker (D- N.J.), another co-sponsor of the bill.  That bill sits at the intersection of the existential question now facing the crypto industry: Why did FTX collapse and how can repeats be prevented? FTX was a centralized exchange, a single point of failure – that did indeed fail, seemingly because of choices made by Bankman-Fried – in the crypto ecosystem.  Many crypto purists, on the other hand, argue this is a moment to double down on crypto’s origin story, which critics of the DCCPA argue the bill would undermine. Born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin was proposed as a decentralized way of running a financial system. Today, that idea lives on in decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap and the rest of decentralized finance (DeFi).  Effects on DeFi  DCCPA’s detractors say it would effectively kill DeFi in the U.S. by making it impossible for large players like Uniswap to comply, which would entrench centralized exchanges. The argument is basically that the regulatory requirements outlined in the latest draft of the bill (posted to GitHub by Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro) amount to a de-facto ban on DeFi.  In the wake of FTX’s collapse and Bankman-Fried’s subsequent fall from grace, opponents of the bill have proclaimed the DCCPA to be “dead,” a supposition that lawmakers, including the bill’s sponsors, have pushed back on.  In a statement issued on Nov. 10, Boozman said the collapse of FTX only reinforced the need for more federal oversight of the crypto industry.  “Chairwoman [Stabenow] and I remain committed to advancing a final version of the DCCPA that creates a regulatory framework that allows for international cooperation and gives consumers greater confidence that their investments are safe,” Boozman said.  With his statement, Boozman joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who have expressed concern about the collapse of FTX and the need for crypto regulation.  As one of the most fully formed pieces of potential crypto legislation, it seems the DCCPA is not, in fact, dead, despite the shadow cast over it by Bankman-Fried’s ruined legacy.  Regulating crypto  The DCCPA aims to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of the crypto spot market. Under the DCCPA, crypto broker-dealers would be required to register with the CFTC and submit to oversight from the federal regulator.  The bill can be roughly divided into two sections: requirements for “crypto commodity platforms,” which includes brokers, dealers, custodians and exchanges, and requirements for the CFTC.  Crypto commodity platforms would be required to maintain a relationship with the CFTC similar to other commodity dealers. For example, they would need to keep good records for at least five years, share information with the CFTC upon request, appoint a chief compliance officer and submit to provisions that protect against “fraud, deceit and manipulation.”  The DCCPA also requires that crypto commodity platforms have adequate financial resources to hold customer funds “in a manner that minimizes the risk of loss or of unreasonable delay in access to the customer property.” Commingling of customer funds with the broker-dealer’s assets is strictly prohibited (something Bankman-Fried has been accused of), as is investing customer funds in anything other than U.S. Treasurys or other “high-quality liquid assets that the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe.”  Unlike several of its predecessors, the DCCPA also has a lengthy definitions section that carves out exemptions to the rules for non-commodity platform entities, including software developers and validators. The CFTC is also not given jurisdiction over any crypto transactions used in the purchase of a good or service.  The DCCPA also requires the CFTC to produce several reports within 180 days of the bill’s passing – including one on “historically underserved customers” that will examine the racial, ethnic and gender demographics of crypto users and another on the energy consumption of mining cryptocurrencies. If the DCCPA becomes law, both reports will be periodically updated and used to inform future legislation.  The DCCPA also states that the CFTC will be tasked with “international harmonization,” which means working with foreign regulators to create consistent international standards for crypto regulation.  A de-facto ban on DeFi?  The potential impact on decentralized exchanges – seen by many as an attempt by Bankman-Fried to use regulation to push users away from DEXs and toward centralized exchanges including what was his own – has been made only more galling for many DeFi supporters after Bankman-Fried’s alleged fraud was exposed.  The leaked version of the draft, however, contains changes that imply that Stabenow and Boozman are sensitive to concerns that the bill could be interpreted as a blanket ban on DeFi.  In October, Shapiro, the Delphi Labs lawyer, tweeted that the leaked version contains a limited exception to the term “digital commodity trading facility” that removes the word “person” from the definition and adds a line that exempts a person who “develops or publishes software” from the definition – adding that he thought the wording could be a “boon to DeFi/crypto.”",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/the-sbf-bill-whats-in-the-crypto-legislation-backed-by-ftx-founder,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f43fbb327226a77ed4ae5e1430d3a21e83602f7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411309,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzKE,1668524462,Why NFT Tax-Loss Harvesting Remains a Challenge for Investors,"It’s been a rough year for NFT (non-fungible token) investors. Between market constrictions, rug pulls and failed projects, many buyers are left holding assets that represent a considerable unrealized loss.  As the 2022 tax year comes to a close, NFT traders may hope to tax-loss harvest, or sell their assets at a loss in order to offset current or future capital gains. That, however, is easier said than done.  Zac McClure is the co-founder of TokenTax. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  There are many reasons NFT tax-loss harvesting is a challenge. One is financial: Because each token is a unique asset, it is difficult to estimate what an NFT’s fair market value might be. This makes it hard to pinpoint which assets are the best opportunities for harvesting.  Crypto tax platforms, portfolio trackers and NFT valuators are rising to meet the challenge, allowing investors to get a better idea of the losses they could expect to lock in from the sale of underwater tokens.  A more intractable problem stems from market illiquidity, or in plainer terms from an asset being worthless. Many traders are holding NFTs for which there is no (or little to no) market. This could be the result of an NFT rug pull (like Frosties) or a project that simply didn’t make it (like Loot).  So how do you legally realize a loss on a worthless NFT? The Internal Revenue Service says one must sell an asset in an “arm’s length transaction.” This means a trade in which both parties are acting independently, in their own best interest and without any pressure from one another. Typically, this would mean that the involved parties have no prior relationship. Selling a token on an exchange is an example of an arm’s length transaction.  When an NFT has little to no value, finding an independently motivated buyer is difficult. Why would anyone pay you for something with no value? Some investors have tried to skirt the issue by burning worthless tokens, but there’s no guidance from the IRS to suggest the agency would consider this a valid way to realize losses; the asset didn’t transfer into someone else’s custody.  Other would-be tax-loss harvesters have set up reciprocal services. While the details of these arrangements vary, the basic idea is “you pay me 0.001 ETH for my worthless NFT and I’ll pay you 0.001 ETH for yours.”  Tax professionals warn that this kind of agreement doesn’t meet the criteria for being an arm’s length transaction – the parties established a prior relationship before conducting the trade.  See also: IRS Expands Key US Tax Language to Include NFTs  So, what’s a trader with an illiquid NFT to do? Unfortunately, there aren’t many answers. At this time, the best that crypto tax accountants can advise is to do all you can to sell the asset for a nominal sum on an exchange or in arm’s length transaction on a marketplace.  All in all, this is another example of the need for further federal guidance and regulation on digital assets. Until clarity is provided on if and how the IRS expects traders to realize losses on illiquid tokens, NFT tax-loss harvesting will remain one of the many murky gray areas of crypto tax.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Zac McClure,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/15/nft-tax-loss-harvesting,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42411310,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzNX,1668522923,The Silver Lining of a Crypto Market Decline: Tax Savings,"Cryptocurrency and digital-asset markets have seen extreme drawdowns throughout 2022. With bitcoin (BTC) alone down over 50% this year, the portfolios of many investors are in the red this year.  While investors are feeling the pain from the market downturn, it’s important to remember that crypto losses come with a silver lining: the opportunity for tax savings.  David Kemmerer is a software entrepreneur and the co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency tax software company CoinLedger. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  Cryptocurrencies as an asset class possess unique characteristics that make them especially good candidates for tax-loss harvesting. Let’s break down why it’s a good idea to take advantage of your crypto losses before the end of 2022.  How losses affect taxable income  In the U.S. and many other developed nations, capital losses fully deduct against other capital gains when they occur within the same tax year.  What does that mean?  If you will have capital gains from the sales of any capital asset in 2022 – whether that be stocks, real estate or cryptocurrencies – you can offset those gains by realizing your cryptocurrency losses. That can lead to huge tax savings.  Surprisingly, there is a lot of confusion among everyday investors with regard to this fact. Many investors don’t realize that their capital losses can deduct against an unlimited amount of capital gains.  Consider the following example: Imagine Cory sells Apple (AAPL) stock in 2022 and realizes $50,000 of capital gains in doing so. If Cory is a high earner, he could face a 37% tax on that $50,000 gain, or $18,500 owed to Uncle Sam. Ouch!  Read more: David Kemmerer - Form 1099-B Is Not the Solution to Your Cryptocurrency Tax Problems  Now, let’s say Cory is also holding onto 30 NFTs that he paid a total of $35,000 for in 2022. Today, the value of those non-fungible tokens is only $1,000.  If Cory harvests, or realizes, the capital losses from his NFTs by selling them for $1,000, he would reduce his taxable income by $34,000. As a result, Cory’s NFT losses would fully deduct against his Apple stock gains.  In this scenario, Cory’s taxable gains fall to $16,000 ($50,000 minus $34,000). At a 37% tax bracket, Cory would now owe just $5,920 in taxes for his capital gains.  By strategically leveraging his capital losses, Cory reduced the amount of money he will have to pay the tax man by over $12,000.  If you have offset all of your capital gains for the year and wind up with a net capital loss, that capital loss can offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income (like the income from your job). Any remainder can carry forward to offset gains in future years.  Tax-loss harvesting in crypto  Tax-loss harvesting is by no means a new strategy. However, cryptocurrency’s unique properties make it well-suited for tax-loss harvesting compared to other assets.  Hyper-volatility: Because cryptocurrency is more volatile than other assets, it’s likely that investors will have multiple opportunities to harvest their losses during the tax year.  The wash sale rule: The wash sale rule states that you cannot claim a capital loss on a security if you buy the same asset within 30 days of a sale. Many tax professionals, however, take the position that because cryptocurrency is considered property by the Internal Revenue Service and not a security, it is not currently subject to the wash-sale rule.  Read more: Jackson Wood - How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto  To take full advantage of your tax-savings opportunities, you should analyze your portfolio prior to the end of 2022 to assess which assets present significant loss-harvesting opportunities. Software tools can be used to automate this process for you.  Remember, if you don’t realize or lock in your losses before Dec 31, you will lose the opportunity to reduce your taxable income for 2022.  Significant tax-savings opportunities should be on the table for the majority of crypto investors in 2022. Taking a moment to employ the right tax-reduction tactics could wind up saving you thousands on your tax bill.

""If we are able to inject additional capital by the end of this week, AAX should be able to resume services as usual,"" the exchange said.

""Our initial notification on the AAX app that linked the suspension to 'issues with a third party' would have been better expressed as us facing issues with malicious actors,"" the exchange said, noting that engineers had spotted abnormalities that suggested hackers were targeting AAX's sensitive data.

TWT saw an impressive rise of over 97% on its week-on-week chart. Most of the price rally happened in the last three days, with the coin marking a new all-time high yesterday. TWT’s surge also has something to do with the FTX’s crisis and CZ, the CEO of Binance. Recall that FTX, the former second-largest exchange, faced a liquidity crisis last week, which brought the crypto market to its knees. At the time, only PAX Gold kept substantial gains while others tanked. Related Reading: Following FTX’s Collapse, These Exchanges Are Rumored To Be In Trouble However, TWT regained momentum after top crypto players like CZ called for self-custody. Shortly after mentioning Trust Wallet in a Tweet, TWT got listed on Binance, and its trading volume skyrocketed. TWT Trading Volume Surges After CZ Tweets About Self Custody In the last two days, the value of Trust Wallet Token (TWT) has increased by more than fifty percent. This comes after the recommendation made by CZ, the CEO of Binance, that investors utilize decentralized exchanges. CZ made this remark as it became evident that crypto investors wanted to find an alternative to centralized exchanges. After the FTX disaster sparked a wave of responses, CZ stated that self-custody was an option. Binance’s CEO has spearheaded the campaign for exchange openness after the event and has advocated self-custody before. After this, TWT began trading on Binance Chain and experienced a dramatic spike in volume. According to CoinMarketCap statistics, TWT had a 24-hour trading volume of $432.24 million, though it dropped 39% at press time. Recall that in July 2018, Binance purchased Trust Wallet in an effort to add on-chain mobile wallet capabilities to the company’s offerings. The Trust Wallet Token (TWT) is a BEP-20 utility token that is exclusive to the wallet. It gives token holders a voice in the decision-making process for new app functions, upgrades, and in-app purchase discounts. Can TWT Continue The Bullish Rally? For almost a year, TWT, or the trust wallet token, oscillated in a symmetrical triangular pattern. This pattern of continuous movement is prevalent in established markets, giving speculative buyers on the sidelines an entry point. There’s one possible target for this pattern. This is usually the distance between the breakout price and the high and low of the earliest price spread inside the pattern. Thus, the TWT price delivered a positive breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline near the end of October’s strong surge.

4274985,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508550,1668519188,Chainlink Suffers 40% Loss In Last 7 Days – Can LINK Regain $9 Mark This Week?,"Chainlink (LINK) managed to trim its losses after it made a bounce back despite the continuing uncertainty in the crypto market caused by Bitcoin and Ethereum’s recent respective declines. According to data from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, the crypto asset is changing hands at $6.48 and has been up by 3% for the past 24 hours. Here’s a quick glance at how LINK has been performing this month: Chainlink relinquished the $9 territory following the recent collapse of the crypto market LINK made a small recovery that pushed its trading price above the $6 marker Technical indicators point towards another bearish momentum for LINK As it reclaimed the $6 marker, LINK was able to cut its seven day – deficit, from 40% last week to just 26.9% over the last seven days. It can be recalled that after climbing all the way to $9.47 on November 8, the altcoin, along with its fellow digital currencies, suffered and plummeted all the way down to $5.69. Currently, Chainlink ranks 23rd in terms of market capitalization, with an overall valuation of $3.17 billion. It is one of the few crypto assets that have tallied increase in its spot trading price. Technical Indicators Point To Further Bearish Trend For LINK As of this time, analysis points for LINK price leans towards the suggestion of another challenging run for the digital asset. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) settled below the 50-neutral zone, indicating that Chainlink is once again caught in a downward trend. Source: TradingView Moreover, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) fell below the 0.05 value, suggesting that there was significant capital outflow in LINK’s market performance. Meanwhile, the crypto asset’s OBV indicated that there is a notable level of accumulation of the token during the period when it was trading at a narrow range since the month of May. Over the last six months, Chainlink was able to establish $6.3 as a steady support level. However, if the broader crypto market fails to make a bounce back soon, the asset could be looking at a decline below the $5.9 marker. Traders who are looking to take advantage of the current dip could test to buy between the $6.3 and $5.9 levels and try to make profit via the mid-range and high-range highs. Chainlink Holders Sustain Heavy Losses It turned out that Chainlink holders got worried when the asset experienced severe price correction as it abandoned the $9 marker. As evidenced by the 365-Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) that was also in an uncontrollable freefall, LINK token owners cashed out their holdings due to fear of tallying even bigger losses. One good thing though for the crypto asset is its network growth metric which recorded a huge spike that surpassed the levels it set in September and October last year. Still, investors must keep in mind that if Bitcoin continues to falter and thus fails to push its price to higher levels, there’s a big chance that LINK and other altcoins will keep on struggling.

42413671,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBTYs,1668519164,First Mover Americas: FTX's Hacked Funds Are on the Move,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 855.31 +5.2 ▲ 0.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,776 +105.3 ▲ 0.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,261 +14.5 ▲ 1.2% S&P 500 futures  3,993.50 +27.5 ▲ 0.7% FTSE 100  7,382.87 −2.3 ▼ 0.0% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.87% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Top Stories  The FTX hacker who drained $600 million from the crypto exchange began moving the stolen funds Tuesday. Having siphoned funds from FTX’s wallets on Friday, the attacker then amassed $48 million of the stablecoin DAI, before swapping it all for 37,000 ETH. The address now holds more than 288,000 ETH, making it the 35th-largest owner of the cryptocurrency, according to data by security firm PeckShield. FTX announced on Friday that it had been hacked only hours after it had filed for bankruptcy.  Solana DeFi applications have lost more than $700 million in value since the FTX debacle took hold at the start of this month. DeFi (decentralized-finance) applications in the ecosystem grew to $10 billion last November, with FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried among Solana’s chief proponents. That figure diminished with the broader crypto market contraction to sit at $1 billion on Nov. 2 this year, before shrinking dramatically to around $300 million with the FTX fallout. The more than 50% drop in the price of SOL, the network’s native token, has contributed to the fall. At the time of writing, SOL was priced at $14.64, compared with $32.64 at the start of this month.  FTX may have more than 1 million creditors, according to a court document that helps to explain the crypto exchange’s sudden descent into bankruptcy. FTX filed a motion to handle its overall group of entities rather than treating its various subsidiaries and arms as individual cases. The firm filed for bankruptcy on Friday, saying it had between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets and liabilities.  Chart of the Day  This chart shows bitcoin's liquidity on major exchanges, measured by market depth within 2% of the average price (the average of the current bid and ask prices being quoted) since January.  Liquidity has deteriorated significantly in the wake of FTX's collapse, with market depth falling from 11,800 BTC to a five-month low of 7,000 BTC.  Market depth refers to the degree of an asset's resilience to large buy and sell orders. The greater the depth, the more liquid the market is and vice versa.

According to current knowledge, it must have been an inexperienced insider who gained access to FTX’s wallets. Hacken CEO and co-founder Dyma Budorin stated that the hacker was able to steal more than $450 million from FTX hot wallets. However, he made a fatal mistake by using his verified personal account on crypto exchange Kraken to send some of the stolen funds in Tether (USDT) on the Tron blockchain. Kraken has already traced the person’s identity, after which Tether and Paxos blacklisted some of the assets. “We know the identity of the user,” Kraken CSO Nick Percoco said on Friday. Related Reading: Following FTX’s Collapse, These Exchanges Are Rumored To Be In Trouble Ryne Miller, general counsel for FTX’s U.S. subsidiary, confirmed Saturday on Twitter that FTX US and FTX.com had moved all of their digital assets to cold storage, where they are better protected from attack, following Friday’s bankruptcy. “Process was expedited this evening – to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions,” Miller said. In a statement, FTX Chief Restructuring Officer and CEO John Ray said that in response to the hack, “an active fact review and mitigation exercise was initiated immediately in response. We have been in contact with, and are coordinating with law enforcement and relevant regulators.” FTX Hacker Becomes A Ethereum Whale While prosecutions have already been initiated, the hacker nevertheless began swapping large amounts of his stolen crypto in the European morning hours today. As reported by the security company PeckShield Alert, several addresses associated with the hacker have made massive movements today. Thus, the hacker made the following transactions: Swapped 7,420 BNB on BSC into 1,500 ETH. Converted $48 million in DAI into 37,000 ETH Exchanged 3,500 BNB for 962,071.43 BSC USD Exchanged 3,500 BNB for 958,560.13 BSC-USD Traded 15,000 BNB for 3,899,020.38 BSC-USD Subsequently, the hacker bridged around 3.9 million exchanged BSC-USD to Ethereum via the Celer Network, to cBridge and Stargate Finance, and exchanged them for 5,564.83 ETH.

ETH’s price bounces from a low of $1,100 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a recovery toward the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) In the last few days, the crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Ethereum (ETH) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Ethereum (ETH) perform well, rallying from a low of $1,300 to a high of $1,680. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: PAX Gold (PAXG) Leads Weekly Gainers Among Top Coins Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX led to so much tension as the crypto space remains unsettled, leading to most altcoins suffering in price, including the price of ETH. The price of ETH saw its price decline to a weekly low of $1,100 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $1,300 as the price aims to break higher. The price of ETH needs to rally to a region of $1,450, acting as a demand zone to remain safe from sell-off. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,500. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,100. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $1,200 support after bouncing off from the region of $1,100, which saw ETH losing its demand zone to the bears. If the price of ETH breaks above $1,500, we could see more rallies for ETH price; a break below a region of $1,100 would lead to more sell-offs for ETH. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,500.

Furthermore, its network has experienced rapid growth during the past several months. In particular, over 2,600 additional wallet addresses have been introduced to the network during the previous three months. The numbers came from the cryptocurrency market statistics platform CoinMarketCap. This was a considerable increase from May, when there were just 18,000 distinct wallet addresses on the PAX Gold ecosystem. It had around 13,000 unique addresses at the start of the year. As shown by the data, the gold-backed cryptocurrency saw growth of over 13% during that period. What The Charts Say About PAX Gold Although the short-term price action for PAX GOLD – PAXG/USD is corrective, the underlying trend is positive. The underlying trend remains unaffected for the time being; this is only a technical correction. Any reversal would be validated if prices dropped below $1,676.61, which served as support earlier. Then, the next support would be at $1,658.52, where selling would be encouraged. If the bears manage to get beyond it, they might aim for $1,618.80. But as of writing, bullish momentum is still strong as the coin trades above $1,740. The subsequent targets for the bulls are $1,790.27 and, farther out, $1,804.42. The 1H chart for PAX GOLD/USD reveals a positive technical outlook. The bullish indications from moving averages make up 67.86% of all signals. This bullish trend may lose speed as short-term moving averages flash somewhat negative indications. Neither the price nor any of the moving averages cross over each other or any of the other moving averages. Given the current trajectory of the technical indicators, additional price growth is likely but still needs to be determined.

42388650,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ1Tj,1668516149,Collapse of Crypto Exchange FTX Sees Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Shift to Distribution,"Long-term bitcoin (BTC) holders' resolve to keep building their coin stashes has weakened amid fears that the implosion of crypto exchange FTX will prolong the crypto winter. The exchange, founded by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried and formerly the third largest in the world, filed for bankruptcy last week.  The change in stance is notable because the investors weren't fazed in the third quarter even as macro traders left the market, keeping bitcoin resilient to the macroeconomy-induced turmoil in traditional assets. Their shift now to distribution from accumulation perhaps represents concern about the strength of the market following FTX's collapse.  ""There has certainly been a degree of immediate panic within the HODLer cohort,"" analytics firm Glassnode said in a weekly report published Monday, referring to the decline in the supply owned by long-term holders and the movement of inactive coins.  The total amount of circulating supply owned by long-term holders has declined by 61,500 BTC ($1.03 billion) since Nov. 6, marking a shift away from accumulation observed between the end of June and early November, data published by Glassnode shows.  Another metric, the long-term holder net position change, shows more than 48,000 BTC were spent in the week ended Sunday. Glassnode defines long-term holder supply as the one that is statistically the least likely to be spent. In addition, more than 97,000 BTC that were inactive or dormant for over a year moved last week and possibly returned to the cryptocurrency's circulating supply.  According to digital assets data provider Amberdata, FTX's implosion will have many consequences, including the ""potential demonization of crypto space politically and a daisy chain of balance sheet capital short-falls for various institutions."" Some analysts studying chart patterns see bitcoin falling to $13,000 in the near term.  While long-term holders have begun distributing coins, it's still too early to call a long-lasting bearish shift in sentiment, according to Glassnode.  ""A sustained push higher in older coins being spent, and a decline in LTH supply would be clear warning signs that a more widespread loss of conviction and concern may be in play,"" Glassnode noted, using an acronym for long-term holders.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/15/ftxs-collapse-sees-long-term-bitcoin-holders-shift-to-distribution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81e70ab82781b09a952604a4356c4ff5e32c6d32-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Last Thursday, while the exchange was still unraveling, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas suspended FTX’s registration and froze assets tied to the enterprise. It also appointed attorney Brian Simms as a court-supervised provisional liquidator.  The Commission, which announced the appointment of PwC's Kevin Cambridge and Peter Greaves as joint provisional liquidators on Monday, said it was taking swift enforcement action ""to further protect the interests of clients, creditors and other stakeholders globally of FTX Digital Markets Ltd.""

42388626,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ0CD,1668511311,Privacy-Enhancing Crypto Coins Could Be Banned Under Leaked EU Plans,"The European Union could ban banks and crypto providers from dealing in privacy-enhancing coins such as zcash, monero and dash under a leaked draft of a money laundering bill obtained by CoinDesk.  The plans from Czech officials, who are chairing talks among EU governments on the proposed law, would represent the latest nail in the coffin for anonymous means of payment following tough new rules agreed over the summer.  “Credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto-asset service providers shall be prohibited from keeping …anonymity-enhancing coins,” said a legislative draft seen by CoinDesk, dated Nov. 9, which has been circulated to the bloc's other 26 member states for comment.  An EU diplomat told CoinDesk that the measure was intended to avoid the risk stemming from crypto assets that are specifically designed to avoid traceability. The ban on privacy coins, which prevent snooping into blockchain activity, is intended to mirror one on anonymous instruments such as bearer shares and anonymous accounts that was included in the original bill proposal.  The Czech proposal responds to a demand from countries negotiating the text, said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on negotiations taking place behind closed doors.  The Anti-Money Laundering Regulation was proposed in July 2021 by the European Commission as part of a package that would also forbid large cash transactions and create a new anti-money laundering agency, AMLA, to vet practices at large financial institutions.  Under the Czech plans, crypto asset providers would be obliged to verify customers' identity even for occasional transactions of under 1,000 euros ($1,040), and to probe the nature and purpose of the business for larger payments. That would make rules more onerous than for other kinds of firms such as banks, where due diligence rules only kick in for larger payments, apparently due to fears that crypto payments can easily be broken up into smaller chunks.  Crypto service providers doing business outside the EU would need to verify whether their counterparty is licensed, and verify what money laundering controls they have, the document also proposed, with details of the vetting to be set out by AMLA.  In their parallel amendments to the bill, lawmakers at the European Parliament have zeroed in on the processing of dirty money via the metaverse, decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The bill must be agreed by both the Council and the European Parliament to pass into law.  If it does, it would represent the latest in a regulatory onslaught against online anonymity – which has legitimate purposes, but which regulators also worry can be used to process criminal funds, bust sanctions, or raise money for terrorists and other pariahs.  In August, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Ethereum-based privacy tool Tornado Cash, which it said was used to raise money for North Korea's weapons program — the first time sanction powers were invoked against a decentralized protocol.  The EU’s own Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), agreed but not yet in force, prevents exchanges from allowing the trading of anonymous crypto assets unless they’ve identified the holders. A parallel set of rules on the transfer of funds imposes extra checks on anyone handling the likes of monero or dash.

42388627,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ0QF,1668510569,Bernstein: The Collapse of Crypto Exchange FTX More Like Enron Than Lehman,"The collapse of FTX and Alameda Research impacts the centralized finance (CeFi) part of the crypto industry the most, Bernstein said in a research report Monday. Part of the crypto ecosystem is exposed to this event, but it is not the entire industry, the report added.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and blockchain-based applications, “gain from this fragility, subject to some regulatory boundaries and negotiations,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.  Bernstein says there needs to be a distinction made between the centralized custodial players in crypto, namely the exchanges, custodians, and crypto banks, as this is where regulation is coming. This will involve rules around maintaining reserves and uniform accounting for custodial firms, the broker said. Governments and regulators may also increase their scrutiny of offshore exchanges, where regulations are lighter, it added.  Binance market share is likely to increase following the FTX debacle, and Binance.com, which is offshore, is likely to continue along its arduous path of converting its exchange into a more onshore structure, the note said.  The broker sees a significant liquidity impact on the crypto market in coming weeks, which will hurt the smaller tokens.  “FTX feels closer to Enron than Lehman,” the report said. FTX was the third largest exchange with only a 10% market share, but the “noise it has created has been disproportionately more,” perhaps because of the profile of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was hailed as the “genius industry savior.”  Enron and Lehman were two famous corporate collapses that occurred in TradFi in the years prior to the creation of the first cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC) in 2009, and were the result of accounting scandals.  Echoing comments made by Wall Street rival Citi in a report last week, Bernstein says that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) continue to see traction, especially after the failure of FTX.  FTX’s failure could be the catalyst that forces the hand of regulators to accelerate regulation, the note added.

In addition to numerous hedge funds that have already spoken out about their exposure to FTX and Alameda, several exchanges are currently in the spotlight. The crypto community is currently evolving into on-chain detectives who want to discover if and which crypto exchanges are also mishandling their customer funds, trading with them, and thus not holding enough reserves. If a bank run like the one on FTX were to happen, they would not be able to withstand it. Binance CEO CZ warned a few days ago, “If an exchange have to move large amounts of crypto before or after they demonstrate their wallet addresses, it is a clear sign of problems. Stay away.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Strength As Price Holds Above $16,500; Is This A Bear Trap? With that in mind, the crypto community is currently focused on three crypto exchanges. As Glassnode’s lead on-chain analyst “Checkmate” explained, Huobi, Gate(.)io, and Crypto(.)com have been exhibiting “particularly weird BTC balance patterns” lately. All three have large jumps, drops, or oscillations on the order of 10k $BTC to $40k $BTC. The same can be said for $ETH Balances, noting the weird ‘I accidentally transferred from crypto(.)com to Gate(.)io’ event. In contrast, the analyst notes that Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Bittrex “look fairly vanilla” across BTC and ETH and do not trigger a red flag warning. The Next FTX? The rumors surrounding a collapse of Crypto(.)com are partly the exchange’s own fault. On-chain analysts found that Crypto(.)com shipped $500 million in ETH of users’ assets to Gate(.)io, by its own account “by accident.” The exchange’s ETH and stablecoin reserves have massively decreased since the uncertainty evolved. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju stated that 25-80% of ETH reserves have moved four times since September 2022. Stablecoins reserve dropped from $2.9B to $292M, -90% in the last 7 months. ETH & stablecoins reserve on https://t.co/FmNiPK88vZ : • 25-80% of ETH reserve moved four times since Sep 2022. • Stablecoins reserve decreased from $2.9B to $292M, -90% over the past 7 months.https://t.co/sljiJZbXuv pic.twitter.com/UiVw0a0Nmw — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 14, 2022 CEO Kris Marszalek was quick to respond, clarifying that the ETH transfer was made accidentally over three weeks ago, on October 21, while the funds were withdrawn to a cold wallet in the days that followed. Yesterday, Marszalek assured that all withdrawals will be processed regularly. Allegedly, the withdrawal queue is down 98% within the last 24 hours. Withdrawals are being processed as usual. No FUD please. — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) November 14, 2022 What About Gate(.)io and Huobi? The mysterious transfer from Crypto(.)com ironically took place on October 21, just before the release of Gate(.)io’s ‘proof-of-reserve’, which is why the exchange has also been targeted by the crypto community. The snapshot for the PoR audit reportedly occurred as early as October 19. However, the report was not published until October 28, which makes critics suspicious. The crypto community also distrusts Hong Kong-listed Huobi. The exchange announced that $18.1 million in crypto could not be withdrawn on FTX, of which $13.2 million was customer funds. Afterwards, biggest shareholder Li Lin declared that he will provide additional unsecured funding of up to $14 million, which will cover customers’ balances. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moves Differently From US Stock Market, Correlation Weakening? In addition, Huobi seems to have irregularities in its balance. After Huobi published the asset snapshot, 10,000 ETH were transferred to Binance and OKX deposit wallets. Subsequently, Huobi’s vacant ETH wallet had only 4,044 ETH left. Glassnode’s lead on-chain analyst discussed that all three exchanges show relatively active deposits from FTX, “usually after major sell-offs.” This is where cryptodotcom shows up as having 6-8% of their inflows sourced from FTX in May and Nov 2021. Furthermore, Huobi and Gateio regularly sent some 5-8% of their entire BTC balance to FTX during the crash. On the Ethereum front, all three exchanges saw large deposits of between 5% to 10% of their $ETH balance through 2022, with Huobi standing out the most. After the June sell-off, FTX deposited 20% of the Huobi ETH balance in a week!

A year later, the total value locked (TVL) has dropped to just over $300 million with FTX filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and facing prosecution, Multicoin and Sino Global reporting multimillion-dollar losses and the Solana Foundation itself losing ""tens of millions.""  Bankman-Fried’s downfall translated to generally falling sentiment for Solana, given his prominent endorsement of the network. He once infamously told a crypto trader on Twitter: “I'll buy as much SOL has you have, right now, at $3...Then go f**k off,"" referring to the blockchain's native token.  While the $10 billion TVL on Solana has declined over the past year, with the price of SOL contributing to that drop, the past two weeks have been more drastic. More than $700 million has exited Solana-based applications, a 70% drop from the $1 billion in TVL on Nov. 2, when CoinDesk first reported on the collusion between treasury accounts at FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research.  SOL’s 50% price drop has contributed to that fall, alongside falling prices of related DeFi tokens.  Lending and borrowing platform Solend took the biggest hit both in percentage and value terms. It held over $280 million on Nov. 2 and now holds under $30 million. Data show a vast amount of stablecoins, wrapped bitcoin tokens and Solana-based tokens have left the protocol.  Data from DeFiLlama show Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Raydium and Orca are now the largest decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, locking up over $51 million and $46 million respectively. Both have seen over 40% in liquidity exit the platform in the past week. And both held over $150 million just a few weeks ago.  Amid all the drama, some say the declines might help the market find a fair value for Solana and other networks.  “Solana has undoubtedly taken a massive blow, and the consequences of this blow seem far more dramatic and painful than for other blockchains,” Alexei Kulevets, co-founder of Walken told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Yet we’re in the midst of bear market, restless and unpredictable as it may be, it will eventually reveal the true worth of projects and token.""

BTC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BTC’s price bounces from a low of $15,500 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a recovery toward the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) In the last few days, the crypto market has been erratic, with the price of many altcoins, including Bitcoin (BTC), battling for survival after the news that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well, rallying from a low of $19,200 to a high of $21,600. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Ethereum Price Near Make-or-Break Levels, Can ETH Start Steady Recovery Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX was good. Still, after conducting their due diligence, Binance decided it would not take over FTX as this has affected the market negatively, sending the price of BTC on a spiral movement to $15,500. The price of BTC bounced off this region showing some great strength to a region of $17,300 as the price aims to break higher. The price of BTC needs to rally to a region of $18,500, acting as a demand zone to remain safe from sell-off. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $18,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,500. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $16,500 support after bouncing off from the region of $15,500, which saw BTC losing its demand zone to the bears. If the price of BTC breaks above $18,500, we could see more rallies for BTC price; a break below a region of $16,000 would be a bear trap as the price could go lower. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $17,500. Daily support for the BTC price – $16,500-$15,500.

42388641,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ1Fh,1668502086,Renewed Bitcoin Market Swoon Has Put Price Support At $13K in Crosshairs: Technical Analysis,"The bitcoin market has recently awakened from a prolonged slumber, putting bears in the driver's seat. That's the message from experts studying chart patterns, who now see a high chance of bitcoin sliding to $14,000 or below.  The top cryptocurrency fell 22% last week, hitting a two-year low of $15,600 as FTX's collapse dented investor confidence. The decline marked a downside break of months of horizontal or sideways trading above $18,000, opening doors for a notable sell-off.  ""From a technical perspective, bitcoin has now broken below $18,000, which was an area of support in recent weeks. The next levels to watch are $13,500, the 2019 high, and $12,500 (the 3Q20 high),"" strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  Range breakdowns or breakouts usually bring a notable decline or rally. According to technical analysis theory, an asset builds potential energy during consolidation and this energy is unleashed in the direction in which the range is eventually breached. The longer the consolidation, the bigger the energy store and post-breakout/breakdown move. Seasoned traders, therefore, avoid trading against the range breakdown or breakout.  ""Firstly, think of the consolidation range like a spring, coiled up over time and full of potential energy. Each successful bounce off of support and rejection from resistance adds more potential energy,"" analysts at Delphi Digital said in a note sent to subscribers on Friday. ""When prices do eventually break from the range, the impulse move can be extremely strong, much like the initial unwind of a coiled spring.""  Technical patterns can and often do fail. However, bitcoin's latest range breakdown is likely to bring more pain, as adverse macroeconomic conditions and FTX's collapse are likely to keep investor risk appetite under pressure.  ""This breakdown has been accompanied by one of the worst crypto catalysts to date, weighing on investor sentiment and asset prices. Combine the native crypto catalyst in the FTX-Alameda blowup with a continued bleak macroeconomic backdrop that has not materially changed, and continuation to the downside is the path of least resistance at this point as opposed to a reversal,"" Delphi's team noted, citing support between $14,000 and $16,000.  Michael Oliver, the founder of Momentum Structural Analysis, said bitcoin's flush out through the range lows may have kicked off the bottoming process, though the market may not find a bottom anytime soon.  ""That presumed basing action [above $18,000] might be a precursor to a bottom, but a flush-out through the range lows was likely to be next in any bottoming process. It has begun,"" Oliver said in the weekly note.  ""Based on various metrics, we suspect lower will be seen and quite possibly, this market might not find an effective low until we get into December. But for now, let it rip,"" Oliver added.

The document, filed to the federal court database system PACER late Monday, provided the first true glimpse of the crypto exchange's last day prior to filing for bankruptcy and its first few days going through the process. FTX's new CEO, veteran insolvency overseer John J. Ray III, is working with legal, cybersecurity and forensic advisers on the company's myriad subsidiaries and their respective bankruptcy processes, the filing said.  FTX filed over 100 dockets for its various related companies, including Alameda Research, the quant trading shop that held a lot of FTT tokens, West Realm Shires, a business entity in the U.S. that operates as FTX in some jurisdictions, and Clifton Bay Investments.  As part of these dockets, FTX filed motions to jointly administer the overall umbrella group of entities rather than treat each as its own individual case. As part of this effort, FTX is also asking if, rather than create a list of the top 20 creditors for each individual company, it can instead create a top 50 list for the overall structure. Moreover, FTX believes it may have over 1 million creditors overall.  ""As set forth in the Debtors' petitions, there are over one hundred thousand creditors in these Chapter 11 Cases. In fact, there could be more than one million creditors in these Chapter 11 Cases. As such, the Debtors submit that cause exists to modify that requirement such that the Debtors will file a consolidated list of their top 50 creditors,"" the filing said.  The exchange's operators are also asking the court to allow it to email the notice of bankruptcy to FTX's creditors, rather than serve them with notices at their homes.  Read more: FTX Hack or Inside Job? Blockchain Experts Examine Clues and a ‘Stupid Mistake’  FTX's customers primarily interacted with the exchange online, so their emails are already on file, the document said.  The filing touched on Friday's hack, which saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto flow out of FTX's wallets, and confirmed that FTX has been in touch with ""dozens"" of state and federal regulators worldwide, including the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and others.  FTX has also appointed new directors, including former District Judge Joseph Farnan at FTX Trading; Matthew Doheny at FTX Trading; Mitchell Sonkin at West Realm Shires Inc.; Matthew Rosenberg at Alameda Research and Rishi Jain at Clifton Bay Investments.  FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday morning, saying it had between $10 and $50 billion in assets and liabilities and over 100,000 creditors. Monday's filing did not address the questions of what assets or liabilities the exchange can currently lay claim to, but said the new leadership team is working to ""secure and marshal"" its assets. This includes having multiple lawyers and experts to review FTX and its subsidiaries' books.  The filing also provided a glimpse of how FTX got to the point of filing its first substantive documents several days after first filing for bankruptcy, saying the bankruptcy was declared on an emergency basis.  ""FTX faced a severe liquidity crisis that necessitated the filing of these cases on an emergency basis last Friday. Questions arose about Mr. Bankman-Fried's leadership and the handling of FTX's complex array of assets and businesses under his direction,"" the filing said.  Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role at 4:30 a.m. on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy (a time zone was not given, but presumably it was ET, the time zone in the the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried resides.  Since stepping down, Bankman-Fried has continued tweeting various thoughts and statements, which should concern his lawyers, legal experts told CoinDesk.

42388639,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ11f,1668483018,CFTC Pushes Back Against Amicus Briefs in Ooki DAO Lawsuit,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Monday hit back against four amicus briefs filed on behalf of Ooki DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which the CFTC sued in September for allegedly violating federal commodities laws by illegally offering leveraged and margin crypto trading products to U.S. investors.  The amicus briefs – filed by crypto legal consortium LeXpunK, the DeFi Education Fund, and venture capital firms Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz – urged Northern California district court Judge William Orrick to reconsider his earlier order granting the CFTC's motion for alternative service, which approved the CFTC's unorthodox method of serving notice of the lawsuit on the members of the DAO via a help bot on the DAO's website and a post on its forum, rather than to a DAO member directly.  In its motion of opposition filed Monday, the CFTC pushed back, arguing that it served the legal papers the only way the DAO made itself available. And, because the DAO was clearly aware of the lawsuit – it was acknowledged in both a tweet from the DAO's official Twitter account and a discussion between members in a DAO-run forum – the CFTC says the notice was effectively served.  The CFTC's suit against the members of Ooki DAO (a parallel action to suits that have already been settled against the DAO's alleged predecessor entity, bZeroX and its two founders) has been contentious – even within the CFTC.  Read more: Ooki DAO Case So 'Egregious' CFTC Had No Choice, Chair Behnam Says  Commissioner Summer Mersinger issued a rare dissenting opinion following news of the suit, calling the enforcement action ""arbitrary and unfair,"" and claiming that, because all governance token holders were considered voting members of the DAO by the suit, it ""affirmatively disincentivizes voting participation in DAO governance generally...The Commission's approach will have a chilling effect that discourages voting, thereby hindering good governance and the development of a culture of compliance in this setting.""  In addition to potentially having a chilling effect on DAO participation, the amicus briefs collectively aruged that the CFTC's action could stifle novel software developments – something the CFTC's lawyers took issue with in their opposition.  ""The CFTC is not suing technology, as Amici claim: The CFTC’s action is not against the blockchain-based Ooki Protocol, but against the Ooki DAO — an association that acts and makes collective decisions regarding the Ooki Protocol through voting by its governance token holders,"" the CFTC argued. ""The factors Amici claim disqualify the Ooki DAO as an unincorporated association — variable membership over time, inconsistent voting by members, and different or divergent views and opinions among members — are nothing more than features of almost any unincorporated association (or other business entity, for that matter).""  A DAO by any other name  The CFTC's motion also takes opposition with the DAO's decision not to wrap itself in a corporate structure.  ""Nothing prevented the Ooki DAO... from choosing to avail itself of some corporate form recognized by law to shield individual members from liability and limit potential creditors to monetary recovery from the Ooki DAO Treasury only,"" the motion stated.  ""Multiple states have set up LLC-like registration frameworks to facilitate DAO registration to attempt to obviate such individual liability issues. Here, Ooki DAO members did not choose to adopt such an approach, assuming — incorrectly —that eschewing a more traditional entity structure, with its concomitant individual-member liability protections, would 'future-proof' it against regulation.""  Ooki DAO, the CFTC argues in its motion, cannot avoid liability for breaking the law simply by transforming itself into or labeling itself a DAO – which is what the CFTC alleges was the purpose of creating Ooki DAO in the first place.  ""The Ooki DAO was created, at least in part, with evasive purpose — to avoid obligations to comply with the law. The bZeroX, LLC founders believed DAOs could not be held responsible for violating the law,"" the motion states.  ""What [the Amici briefs] are ultimately saying is that DAOs are nothing — or at least nothing that can be sued, or served, or held accountable for running a for-profit trading platform that operates in violation of the CEA and a CFTC Regulation, or for any other legal violations. Accordingly...simply switching business forms from an LLC to a DAO makes an entity immune from suit and outside any government’s enforcement reach. For the reasons stated herein, this ignores the relevant facts and is not the law, and the CFTC respectfully submits that this Court should not endorse that radical and dangerous proposition,"" it adds.

FTX’s wallet holdings have dropped in the previous week due to liquidity concerns, illegitimate loans, client withdrawals, and a market downturn. Ethereum-based token data on Dune Analytics display the present condition of wallet holdings owned by the company. This data pertains to a list that was originally prepared by The Block. This report claims that among FTX’s holdings is $61 million worth of Paxos gold (PAXG). It also held $69 million worth of USD coin (USDC) and $50 million worth of DAI, a decentralized stablecoin. Furthermore, there are more than $40 million worth of ether (ETH) and staked ether (stETH) in its wallet. According to 21Shares, a cryptocurrency investment service, the information only represents “the absolute minimum” of the wallet holdings at the moment. This simply means that the data only includes a small portion of the assets owned by the firms. Paxos Expands Team Despite Crypto Downturn Paxos, the company behind PAXG, is expanding its workforce in Singapore by at least 130 workers. Bloomberg reported that the company received a license from Singapore’s central bank to market crypto goods and services. In an interview, co-founder Rich Teo stated that the company was anticipating a three-year development drive. He mentioned that Singapore would serve as the center of growth for the region outside of the United States. The company has 20 employees in Singapore and 350 employees worldwide at the moment. Paxos stands as one of 20 companies licensed by Singapore’s MAS to conduct digital token operations under the Payment Services Act. With this recruiting effort in Singapore, Paxos appears to be going against the current digital asset sector as a whole. Recall that many exchanges have been cutting back on staff over the past several months. Since the beginning of April, approximately 11,700 crypto-related jobs have been lost, based on news reports and official statements.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  By James Rubin  Battered but unbowed by FTX fallout, bitcoin rose late Monday from the depths of red to regain its foothold snugly above $16,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently holding steady at about $16,600, up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, even as crypto market observers believe that it could dip to lower levels. Earlier in the day, BTC had dipped to about $15,850, below its most recent support.  This article was adapted from Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “We have seen broader market instability despite some positive macro developments for risk assets as a whole,” David Duong, head of institutional research, at crypto exchange Coinbase, wrote, adding: “It’s still emerging which counterparties may have lent or interacted with either FTX or Alameda (FTX’s sibling company) and what those exact liabilities are. BTC could not only retest 2022 lows but touch the $13K level. We think there is support at $13.5K.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,200, up roughly 3%. The second-largest crypto in market value and other major altcoins have been reckoning with the aftershocks of crypto exchange FTX's balance sheet vulnerabilities and consequent filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On Friday, the centerpiece of erstwhile crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire suffered hacks accounting for about $600 million in outflows. Regulators are ratcheting up their scrutiny of the exchange and its sibling, Alameda Research, whose heavy balance sheet allocation of FTX's FTT token sparked FTX's rapid unraveling.  FTX congagion remained virulent with Serum's SRM token recently falling more than 12%. On Saturday, DeFi protocols across the Solana ecosystem began unplugging from the onchain exchange that Bankman-Fried had lauded for fear that they didn’t know who wielded control – a concern fueled by the FTX hack. And the Solana Foundation said Monday it has tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies stranded on FTX – as well as 3.24 million common stock shares in Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt crypto exchange. Nevertheless, its SOL token rose about 10%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was trading flat.  Equity markets broke a recent trend upward with the Nasdaq dropping 1.1%, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.8 and 0.6%, respectively after online retailer Amazon pushed forward with layoffs, part of a larger cost-cutting campaign tied to the company’s pessimistic expectations for the months ahead.  While some analysts remained horrified by FTX's self-inflicted downfall, with an Arcane Research newsletter calling the ""situation a mess,"" and noting that one of the largest crypto companies in the industry was playing with customers’ money,"" others saw it as a potential building block for the young, crypto industry.  Venture capitalist Kevin O’Leary told CoinDesk TV’s First Mover program that FTX’s collapse doesn't mean it will be the end for crypto and described the debacle as a “defining” moment that will “stabilize” the industry. “This does not kill crypto,” added O’Leary, who said that he had considered rescuing FTX before SEC chief Gary Gensler highlighted anew the industry’s lack of regulation. “There’s going to be a silver lining to this disaster. There’s no question about it. It’ll be called regulation.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +10.8% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP +9.4% Currency Polygon MATIC +7.1% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  By Sam Reynolds  Imagine for a moment if there were a class of companies whose sole job was to safeguard customers’ assets being held by an exchange or other institution from theft, hacks or misuse by executives. And imagine if these companies were registered with the government, insured and regularly audited, with the results available for the public to inspect.  Now imagine if the majority of exchanges didn’t use these services because it slowed their business down.  Welcome to November 2022.  “If you use an external independent, licensed custodian, we would never have gotten into this situation because they couldn't have had access to customer deposits,” Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Quaglini said that with a custodian, clients’ assets are legally and technologically segregated, available for public monitoring via block explorers, and insured. Assets are disclosed, as are liabilities.  To put it bluntly: the funds would have been safe from outsider threats, insider threats, and Alameda Research.  “The ledger would have been at least managed by an independent party versus the kind of internal ledger that they were using between FTX and Alameda,” said Quaglini. “The frosting on the cake was the ‘hack’ where employees were leaving, nobody knew who was in charge of what, and then all of the sudden funds disappear because you don’t know who’s in control of the private keys.”  Despite all the due diligence that was allegedly done on FTX by some of the world’s most important venture capital funds like Sequoia, Softbank, and Temasek, this issue never came up. Caught in the Bankman-Fried cult of personality, these VCs never thought it necessary to have some safeguards in place to protect customer funds — which would have certainly been a requirement in the TradFi world.  “Investors are guilty in this case of throwing money [at FTX] without asking for really basic things like segregation [of] clients’ assets. The fact that investors were not demanding this was quite embarrassing,” said Quaglini.  In July 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), greenlit nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custodian services for crypto. In the days following that announcement, crypto raced from $9,514 to over $11,000.  Institutional capital was accustomed to having custodians, and this was the key to unlocking this narrative. This is how the asset class hit $1 trillion, and another Mt. Gox was prevented.  Some exchanges have their own custodians, like Coinbase and Gemini. These are separate entities from the main exchange, licensed appropriately under local law (Coinbase and Gemini both have New York licenses).  But FTX did not.  Nor does Binance.  Without custodians, and their requirements for public disclosure, we have no way of checking who’s solvent and who’s insolvent. Publicly known wallets can help, but that’s not the full picture. The public will have to take the word of executives at face value, and pray that Crypto.com’s balance sheet is as strong as it claims.  Exchanges are now effectively operating as unregulated banks with fractional reserve banking minus the capital requirements, regulations, or ironically, transparency.  Something has to change. Hopefully, it's not stringent regulation that strangles the industry.  Binance’s Changpeng Zhao wants to establish an industry association to promote best practices as part of his recovery fund. But will this include the use of licensed custodians? Time will tell. So far, all he’s been calling for is self-custody.
