42433865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5snh,1615242944,"Bitcoin's 2021 Returns Destroy Everything on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs Says","Goldman Sachs, the storied Wall Street firm, didn't start including bitcoin in its weekly ranking of global asset-class returns until late January, when the largest cryptocurrency quietly appeared atop the chart.      But since then, bitcoin's lead over assets from stocks to bonds, oil, banks, gold and tech stocks and the euro has widened.      As of March 4, bitcoin's year-to-date return, at about 70%, was roughly double that for the next-closest competitor, the energy sector, at about 35%, according to Goldman Sachs' latest ""U.S. Weekly Kickstart"" report.      The comparisons could become even more flattering to bitcoin now that a recent bout of selling in U.S. stocks has taken the Standard & Poor's 500 Index's year-to-date return to roughly zero – flat on the year.    The recovery in oil prices and real yields has boosted year-to-date returns for cyclical sectors such as energy and financials, which are nevertheless underperforming bitcoin.  Crude oil and energy have a higher risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) than bitcoin so far this year.  Gold is the worst-performing asset class year-to-date, as rising yields have punished traditionally defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities.  Based on prior CoinDesk reporting, bitcoin is viewed by many investors both in crypto and traditional markets as a potential inflation hedge, especially in an era where central banks around the world are pumping trillions of dollars of freshly created money into financial markets to stimulate coronavirus-racked economies. Even so, gold has lost about 10% on the year, prompting some market observers to argue that bitcoin is stealing market share from the yellow metal.  According to a survey, some 40% of Goldman clients have exposure to cryptocurrencies.  That's the case even though, as recently as May 2020, Goldman's money-management division argued in a presentation that cryptocurrencies were ""not a suitable investments for our clients,"" merely a beneficiary of a ""mania"" worse than the infamous run on Dutch tulips in the 1600s.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/08/bitcoins-2021-returns-destroy-everything-on-wall-street-goldman-sachs-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd98f6fdd7cbeb048a801b2a3ae94dc24c6a637b-1500x873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5sph,1615240309,How the NFT Boom Explains Square's Tidal Buy,"By now, you should have heard of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the change they are driving in the art and music world.      The space is moving very rapidly, and economic models for scarce digital media are emerging. Musician Grimes has sold her art print for $6 million, DJ 3LAU sold out a crypto-digital music album for $11.6 million, Beeple’s NFTs are currently in auction for $3.5 million at art-house Christie’s while Nifty Gateway had a single one of his pieces go for over $6 million. Even more interesting is the impact on royalty models and intellectual property ownership.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    The Eulerbeats project, which pairs algorithmically generated music with artworks, has driven nearly $2 million in royalties paid to owners of the original musical collectible, separate and apart from the initial issuance.      People who understand modern media, like Mark Cuban and Gary Vaynerchuk, are also both in. We are not saying that we should just listen to influencers and blindly follow. For example, John McAfee was very … vocal … about promoting token offerings in 2017, and has now been charged with a $13 million fraud. But the core difference here is that McAfee was shilling projects for personal gain. In today’s cycle, industry participants are realizing the core change in market structure, and describing it to others. So let’s break down what that change really is.    Understanding the economic impact    We are over 20 years into the internet revolution. What is clear is there is not just one technological change, but multiple waves of transformation. Each carries with it a social and philosophical outcome.      We thought that open, endless access to the world’s media would be fantastic and freeing. That we would have an intellectual and scientific Renaissance as a result. And to some extent, that has indeed happened. But it has happened at deep cost.      First, let’s just describe the “it.”      Starting with the chart on the right above, picture the Supply and Demand of music. You can use the same shorthand for other information, like books and newspapers. This is supply and demand in the physical world at the aggregate level for the industry. So you might sell 1 million CDs for $12.99, but only 500,000 CDs for $15.99. Based on those slopes and elasticities, some aggregate amount of production and commerce occurs.      Now we introduce Napster. The price of an individual CD or song goes to $0 for those who know how to use peer-to-peer file-sharing software. That averages out to non-$0 in the population, but we know a revenue pool collapse of 50% or more actually occurred. The shape of the supply curve is remade by “democratizing” technology. At the much lower price, we shift down the Demand curve to a much larger consumption of media. Today, that includes all of YouTube, TikTok, Spotify, and the long tail of services. There has been a massive demand side expansion along the curve from technology.      See also: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      As a result, there has also been a collapse in artist revenue pools (i.e., quantity times price). We won’t belabor how little musicians earn from Spotify too much, but an illustration is provided below. You get $4 per 1,000 streams, and would need about half a million streams to make a living wage in the United States.      We also footnote that the digital rights management efforts of the 2000s was an effort by the music labels and the publishers to take back control of p2p distribution. Despite Metallica’s best framing, it was *not* a grassroots effort by the artists that directly benefited the creators. DRM was an attempt at preserving intermediation.      Now a lot of creators actually love the huge audiences they are able to access and are allergic to any sort of capitalist overlay for the remix culture of the internet. Part of being techno-literate over the last 20 years has meant being pro-file sharing. It has meant supporting the destruction of walled gardens, going open source and removing legal barriers, and even ending the concept of ownership.      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      Blockchain-based NFTs reintroduce the concept of property rights into digital media markets, and they do so through software-enforced capitalist logic. One can own art again. Is that good? Is that bad? That remains a philosophical question.      In revisiting our toy model, the core provision of endless music to the market has not changed. Instead, we add on a new market for ownership. It is one thing to experience a song by listening. It is another to own the original print and its underlying economic earning power. There is now a steeply expensive, very niche market of digital objects. There is also now a change in the demand curve, such that there are some collectors and purchasers that – all of a sudden – have the desire and capacity to participate in the new market. Many of these participants are crypto rich, collecting status and binary options.      Conceptually, we are also bringing media to financial markets, joining creative output and its $10 billion per year financialization. In the traditional markets, this would be something like the Hipgnosis Songs Fund.    Square is buying a unique go-to-market strategy. It is also getting a lot of artists as customers, who are in essence running small businesses.    Digital streaming services are growing over time and have fixed the publisher’s revenue problem. At scale, there is sufficient income generation from owning the rights to songs, and the different type of royalties that they generate (e.g., mechanical, performance and so on).      You can see also the massive asymmetry between distribution and manufacturing. Today, most value is sitting with the storefronts. This is the thing that will potentially change. Much more value could be sitting with the artists, who increasingly have a direct relationship with their fans through social media.      See also: 11 Projects Building a Strong Foundation Beneath the Marriage of DeFi and NFTs      Putting the royalty economics on-chain, and turning those into a liquid market connected into decentralized finance is a pretty large paradigm shift. You could own the royalty stream. You could collateralize it to take out a loan. You could stake it as an object that allows you some governance rights. You could create a portfolio or basket of various creative objects, and turn them into an index that generates dividends. You could lever up that index and buy downside protection. And so on.      As an example of this already, NFTX is a DeFi project that has bundled CryptoPunks into indexes, which can be purchased in a fractional manner. As CryptoPunks sell for millions of $, they become inaccessible status symbols. But, if you want to diversify your portfolio with exposure to some original blockchain-based assets, PUNK-BASIC or PUNK-ZOMBIE stand in as derivative exposure backed by the NFTs.      In the medium to long term, there will be an oversupply of tokenized art. Creators are realizing they have an asset they can sell directly to their audience, and this is still quite novel. Once all creators realize this, supply will go through the roof. Thereafter the novelty of collection will wear off, and it is likely that demand will also settle back down. Prices will reach some other equilibrium than the one we are seeing currently. Yet, early adopters have the opportunity to grab a share and to innovate their way towards new platforms.    Key takeaway    It is with this lens, for example, we should look at the acquisition of Tidal by Square from Jay-Z. Tidal has 70 million songs and 250,000 videos, and is being majority-bought by the payments processor for $300 million. According to estimates from ARK Invest, Tidal runs around $170 million in revenue, and has 1 million to 2 million subscribers paying $13 per month.      Why does a mobile wallet want to own this property? In part, the customer acquisition strategy for Cash App has been through influencers and the hip hop community, including by giving out bitcoin to followers. This is a massive leverage growth hack.      Square is buying a unique go-to-market strategy. It is also getting a lot of artists as customers, who are in essence running small businesses. Being a small business banking alternative, Square is well positioned to (1) bank and monetize the creators, and (2) then use the voice of the creators to grow adoption of Square itself.      This is CEO Jack Dorsey playing five-dimensional chess. As another example of the same insight, look at his other company, Twitter’s, roadmap to add paid subscription (“super follow”) features of its own content creators. In building financialization into the social network, the company is taking economic share back from third party tools that aggregate and represent influencers. Instead of ad units disappearing into direct messages and talent agencies, Twitter becomes both a creative and a financial platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/08/how-the-nft-boom-explains-squares-tidal-buy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce1801852f1114f7fbd129265a6c808728550d89-1406x827.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5srh,1615239544,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Well Above $50K, While Ether Outperforms on NFTs, July's Upgrade","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $51,800.08 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 3.48% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $49,390.18-$51.982.31 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin's price in recent weeks has retreated from February’s all-time highs, declining alongside U.S. stocks as investors grew increasingly concerned rising U.S. government bond yields might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, curtailing the easy-money era that has boosted risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrency.      But on Monday, bitcoin's price climbed for a fourth straight day, even as 10-year bond yields continued their march toward 1.6%. U.S. stocks slipped.      “It is interesting to note that Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar Index are both moving up but bitcoin, unlike previous times, is not moving inversely to them,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk.      At the moment there’s little evidence of a surge in trading volume that might reflect a fresh jolt of market intensity. The daily volume reported by eight U.S.-focused exchanges CoinDesk tracks has remained flat, in keeping with the trend of almost two weeks.      One bullish sign continues to develop: balances of bitcoin held on exchanges have reached the lowest level since November 2018, according to data from blockchain data site Glassnode. Market analysts have interpreted the lower bitcoin balance on exchanges as a bullish sign, an indication that few traders are planning to sell out of their long positions. That could imply low chances of a major market correction in the near term.      While trading activity is relatively muted, with bitcoin holding above $50,000, some analysts are eyeing the next resistance level.      “It looks like $52,000 is the important resistance we are looking to break,” Tu said.      Others, however, warn that if bond yields and dollar strength continue to rise, the crypto market might turn weak again.      “With the U.S. rates market, we might see some choppy moves with risk-off sentiment spilling over into crypto markets,” Annabelle Huang, partner at crypto market maker Amber Group, told CoinDesk.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up on Monday, trading around $1,773.21 and climbing 7.37% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether has outperformed by bitcoin since reaching an all-time high above $2,000 on Feb. 19. It is currently benefiting from the eye-popping sales of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the prospect that further growth might spur more ether demand.      The NFT craze continues this week, and with the vast majority of NFT tokens built atop the Ethereum blockchain, the ether market is attracting new bullish speculation, according to Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital.      Read More: Ethereum’s ‘EIP 1559’ Fee Market Overhaul Greenlit for July      At the same time, Ethereum’s scheduled “Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559” (EIP 1559) upgrade has gotten investor attention.      “One of the big issues at the moment from mainstream investors is their concern about transaction fees and the usability of Ethereum,” Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer at Ether Capital, told CoinDesk. He noted that a significant amount of investment in Ethereum has been focusing on scaling solutions.      Ethereum blockchain users right now pay a ""gas"" fee to a miner for a transaction to be included in a block. Such fees make up a substantial part of miners’ overall income, David Derhy, analyst at investment platform eToro, said in explaining EIP 1559. ""However, under the new proposals, gas fees will be sent to the network instead in a new fee structure called a ‘basefee.’""      “We expect ether to break new ground above $2,000 this year, with the hard fork and the fee changes all helping to cement its position as the No. 2 crypto asset, stoking further demand,” Derhy said.      He added that ether’s price rally proves the updates are mostly welcomed by the market.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Monday.

This ends an agreement the two companies had put on hold in February.  Under terms of the agreement that was put on hold and is now ending, Ripple had been paying MoneyGram to use the XRP token in international settlement since 2019 and first engaging in a pilot agreement with the service in 2018. Since then, MoneyGram had netted $61.5 million in “market development fees” from Ripple.  Shares of MoneyGram dropped in after-hours trading, down 7%.  The agreement was put on hold after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple saying XRP is an unregistered security in violation of U.S. investments law. Ripple is fighting those assertions.  Ripple said the two sides are ""committed"" to revisiting their relationship in the future.    This story is developing and will be updated.

42386132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRNT1,1615238638,Bitcoin’s Taproot Activation Gains Momentum From New ‘Speedy Trial’ Proposal,"Bitcoin developers have been debating the best way to activate the Taproot upgrade for at least a year. Some are hopeful a new proposal called ""Speedy Trial"" might put an end to the debate, by bringing forth a solution that more developers can get behind.      Ideated by Blockstream developer Russell O'Connor and written up on the Bitcoin developer email list by technical Bitcoin writer David Harding, ""Speedy Trial,"" would take a quicker approach than some of the other proposals in determining if miners are ready for activation of Taproot. All of the largest mining pools have already indicatedthey plan to upgrade.      ""The idea received significant discussion and seemed acceptable to several people who could not previously agree on a proposal (although this doesn't necessarily make it their first choice),"" Harding wrote on the email list.      Taproot is the largest upgrade Bitcoin has seen in years, and many are proposing projects on top of it. It will boost privacy and scalability, and will bring a variety of other technical benefits.    Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  Tentative Taproot agreement    Consensus for changes to Bitcoin is hard because people from all over the world contribute to it and have different opinions about how things should work. But so far it seems like ""Speedy Trial"" is getting a fair amount of support.      ""Seems almost everyone is on board,"" developer Ben Carman tweeted.      Looking through the comments on GitHub, 100% of developers so far have responded with ""ACK,"" which indicates support for the proposal. Meanwhile, Bitcoin developer AJ Towns has already coded up a draft version of the activation proposal, which similarly has a long train of ACKs.      That said, it takes time to build consensus over such a consequential proposal. CoinDesk messaged several Bitcoin developers who have not yet voiced an opinion. Most said they had not yet had time to read the proposal. Another said he did not have an opinion yet.    'Quickly succeed' or 'quickly fail'    The change itself, Taproot, isn't being debated at all. Rather, developers are debating the best way to push through the change. No CTO or central leader is in charge of the network to impose new rules. Instead, a sizable portion of the global network needs to be prepared for the new Taproot rules.      If they aren't prepared or if not all miners upgraded to the new software in time, there's a chance the network could split into two.    Read more: Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade Nailed Down for July, but Some Finer Details Still Aren’t Finalized    Developers have different ideas of how to deal with this dangerous possibility. The above article goes into much more detail about the history of this debate and its potential consequences.      Speedy Trial would give miners a chance to flag if they're ready or not – but would do so on a shorter time line than other proposals. Rather than giving miners a year to flag support as once proposed, which opponents argue is too much time, Speedy Trial gives miners three months.  Another key part of the proposal is that after this three-month lock-in, there's a waiting period of six more months before Taproot will activate.      ""The goal of Speedy Trial is to allow a Taproot activation attempt to either quickly succeed or quickly fail – without compromising safety in either case,"" Harding writes.      Beyond that, the proposal shares a lot of similarities with other proposals. If 90% of Bitcoin blocks in a window of time flag readiness, this should show that roughly 90% of miners are ready. At this point, the change will be locked in.      If this 90% lock-in threshold isn't reached in three months, however, activation fails.      ""There is no mandatory activation and everyone is encouraged to try again using different activation parameters,"" Harding writes. At this point, users would need to come up with a new plan.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/08/bitcoins-taproot-activation-gains-momentum-from-new-speedy-trial-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f16caa0581edf54c8aa9dc590e17470f50e4329-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Further, low inflation could keep the Fed on hold.    Report Friday from U.S. Department of Labor showing a 355,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls in February could be “just a taste of what’s to come over the next couple of months” as the coronavirus vaccine gets distributed further and the economy heats up, Shepherdson, Pantheon’s chief U.S. economist, wrote Sunday.  March payrolls increase could hit 1 million, Shepherdson wrote: “A smooth exit from the pandemic ought to be followed by a sustained acceleration in the numbers.”  “In the meantime, we think the Fed will remain in waiting mode.”  Minutes from January FOMC meeting did not reference any plans to change policy based on a steepening of the bond-yield curve, Shepherdson noted: “The idea of increasing the weighted average maturity of asset purchases appears not even to have been discussed at the January FOMC meeting,” Shepherdson wrote.  While Shepherdson didn’t reference bitcoin, the upshot is that cryptocurrency traders betting on an expansion of the Fed’s monetary stimulus might be disappointed in the near term.

42386123,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRNGR,1615229370,OG Status in Crypto Is a Liability,"""Bitcoin is rapidly becoming the crypto version of Australian wildlife. We separated ourselves, blocked all cross-pollination, and now there's an isolated gene pool producing weird versions of everything.""      So security researcher and Summa founder, James Prestwich, contended in a tweet thread last summer.      Is bitcoin complacent? An austere monolith? A hermit kingdom? I don't know. Bitcoin is probably fine, but underlying Prestwich's hot take is a larger point that's relevant beyond BTC: a lengthier crypto tenure does not equate to greater wisdom.      In the crypto culture, there's a strong tendency for folks to flex about when they bought in. For me, I feel like the right date marking the beginning of my blockchain journalism is September 2015, when I wrote enough about Imogen Heap's music-rights tracking project to become curious.    This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly known as Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But the allure of greater vintage is so tempting here, so I can date it to December 2013, when I first started following Charlie Shrem, a scrappy young Brooklyn, N.Y.-based tech entrepreneur, though truthfully my interest in bitcoin was really only ancillary then, going no further than the fact that it counted as ""tech.""      Tenure yields respect; not as much respect as heavy bags, mind you – but in absence of bags, time counts.      But it shouldn't count for that much. In fact, having watched this space roughly as long as the Ethereum blockchain has existed, I'm happy to go a step further: tenure can be a liability.      Tenure is, in particular, a liability for those who have dipped out and come back. But some who never left remain stuck in ancient ways.    Time is not data    One way to measure how much data can be gathered in a particular time period is by counting people. Of course we can't count people in crypto very easily, but we do have counts of active wallets, which is a decent proxy (noting, obviously, that many crypto users have more than one wallet — as they should).      So let's say you were super early to the space, say from late 2011 to early 2015. You lived in a world that had only a little over 10,000 active bitcoin wallets and faded out when there were under 200,000. There were zero ethereum wallets.      Now let's compare you to a relative newbie. Say they showed up in early 2017, before the BTC price really started sailing high but close enough that you could smell a change in the air. There would have been 500,000 active bitcoin wallets and 20,000 or so ethereum wallets.      If they stuck around for roughly the same amount of time, they would have the opportunity to meet vastly more people, watch vastly more experiments and learn vastly more lessons. There's just more going on now.      And lest we assume these new arrivals are just random, it's worth noting how many blockchains have healthy and growing developer communities.      These days, more people show up for the first time in one year than were ever present early on. Framed like that, it's crazy to presume perspectives gleaned in those hazy bygone days are inherently superior to more recent ones. This isn't some fantasy story about lost and forgotten magicks. This is technology.      One of the chief blind spots that I see in the OG's is dismissing anything that's new. There's the Bitcoin Maximalist and the Ethereum Maximalist. The two are largely caricatures, though. Many bitcoiners grudgingly accept Ethereum is here to stay and vice versa, but there's still a knee-jerk attitude of not just skepticism, but dismissal of any new coin or consensus mechanism.    Moar chainz    ""Scam"" and ""s**tcoin"" get thrown around much too flippantly, which diminishes the charge's impact when it actually should stick (and often enough it should).      For anyone who left and missed the mid-2010s, this is understandable. The space was awash in cash grabs then. But the quality of new blockchain architects has changed: Polkadot is not equivalent to TrumpCoin. Tezos is a more thoughtful piece of software than Bitshares.      Once upon a time, most new cryptocurrencies were lame forks of bitcoin (or forks of forks) with some marketing slapped on. Auroracoin, anyone? Remember potcoin? Dogecoin.      But that's simply no longer true. Today, many new blockchains are initiated by talented, well-resourced teams. No doubt many of them will fade off into obscurity, but so do many startups. Startups are afforded the benefit of the doubt and new blockchains by well-intentioned creators should be, too.      When they do fail, there are lessons to be learned for the whole industry. Old heads who dismiss them out of hand will miss out on those lessons.      Not every OG has failed to adjust their thinking to the modern reality. For example, consider Boost VC. In 2014, it promised to back 100 bitcoin startups. In 2018 we reported that it hit its goal, but the firm also changed the terms of its pledge. It had funded 100 crypto startups, not just on bitcoin.      Boost co-founder Adam Draper explained at the time that it just wasn't kosher in 2014 to talk about anything but bitcoin, but times changed and Boost changed with it. Not everyone has.

42386133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRNMj,1615222805,"Coinbase, Naval, Framework Ventures Back $19M Raise for a Capital-Efficient Stablecoin","Fei Labs, a project building a more capital-efficient decentralized stablecoin, raised $19 million from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Framework Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, among others.      The raise, disclosed Monday, is another sign competition is heating up among issuers of stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are designed to hold their value against some mainstream asset, usually (as in Fei’s case) the U.S. dollar.      Stablecoins play a linchpin role in the crypto ecosystem, allowing traders to quickly move fiat currency (or the next best thing) between global exchanges to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that might disappear if they waited for a bank wire to clear. In the mushrooming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, stablecoins are a common form of collateral for loans and other contracts.      ""First, we want to be the best stablecoin in DeFi, in which we would consider DAI to be the primary competitor,"" said Joey Santoro, CEO of Feil Labs, which is building the Fei protocol, and author of the white paper describing it. After that, it would challenge other stablecoins, the largest of which is Tether’s USDT, with a $37.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday.      ParaFi Capital and Variant Fund also participated in the round.      Fei's “genesis launch” is set for March 22, when users will be able to post ETH to get FEI tokens. Early participants in the sale and in the protocol’s liquidity pools on DeFi exchange Uniswap will be incentivized with TRIBE, the project's governance token.      Other leading stablecoins have drawbacks. MakerDAO’s DAI is over-collateralized, and requires thousands of users to manage individual vaults of their collateral. USDC and USDT are centralized and censorable. Purely algorithmic stablecoins, such as basis cash, are very strange.      Like those assets, ""FEI is basically a reserve-backed stablecoin,"" Santoro said. But unlike its predecessors, FEI, on the cusp of its market debut, would work through a direct incentive method.    How it works    From the white paper:    ""This paper proposes a new stability mechanism called direct incentives. A direct incentive stablecoin is one in which both the trading activity and usage of the stablecoin are incentivized, where rewards and penalties drive the price towards the peg.""    In other words, FEI can give users bonuses or charge fees for making trades that help it maintain its peg to the dollar. The developers have tweaked the behavior of an ERC-20 token, which runs on the Ethereum network, so that certain transactions (to start, transactions with the liquidity pool on Uniswap) can face a tax or earn a boost, depending on whether FEI needs to shrink or grow supply.      FEI works on a straightforward transactional basis. ""Users can buy FEI from the protocol, and the protocol takes those assets in reserve, which we call protocol controlled value,"" Santoro explained. In other words, users don't stake ETH, Ethereum’s native currency; they buy FEI. The asset traded belongs to the Fei protocol after the trade.      ""That's sort of where the magic of FEI is. The assets in reserve could be under-collateralized, they can be over-collateralized,"" Santoro explained. Further, the assets would be deployed elsewhere, such as on the secondary market or – later – in yield-generating projects.      ""If you want to get more FEI, you just buy it for a dollar [worth of something] from the protocol,"" he said. There's no debt that has to be maintained by users, as there is on MakerDAO, which generates the stablecoin DAI. The protocol would simply mint FEI as needed.      There will only ever be as much FEI as the market wants, because it will all just be bought on the market.    Exit ramp    What about when users want to sell? ""You can't directly redeem ETH from the protocol. You have to go to a secondary market,"" Santoro said, but the Fei protocol will be placing the ETH it takes there anyway.      If and when the protocol allows other assets to be used for buying FEI, the decision to add those assets will be up to holders of TRIBE, the project's governance token. ""It doesn't have to be just ETH,"" Santoro said, but the developers will encourage the community to only add other decentralized assets, such as DAI or aDAI. Governance will also decide where to allocate the protocol's assets.      ""Fei Protocol is intentionally governance minimized,"" Santoro said.      ""We are basically trying to say, 'What's good about Tether and what's good about MakerDAO?' and take the good things,"" he said. The mistakes the team wants to avoid repeating include ""Tether being opaque and MakerDAO being governance-heavy and over-collateralized.""      Variant Fund's Jesse Walden said its modest governance scope and less-weighty collateralization make FEI ""more socially and financially scalable.""    If ETH plunges...    When the ETH price falls and traders want to get out of FEI, selling it on the Uniswap pool will incur some kind of burn. In other words, you won't get quite $1.00 out of your sale of one unit of FEI on Uniswap because part of it will evaporate when you initiate the trade.      Next, the protocol can itself buy back FEI with its assets and burn the FEI. In both cases, taking supply off the market should push the price back up.      But, should neither of those strategies work, TRIBE can inflate and then buy FEI off the market as well (which is a role MKR serves in MakerDAO). This feature won't be live at launch, but Santoro expects it will be implemented.      If FEI rises over its target on other markets, users can always go to the FEI protocol to buy more FEI at the $1 peg to take advantage of the arbitrage in the short term, boosting supply and bringing the price back in line with the peg in short order.      That said, FEI also will have certain incentivized pools, such as the ETH/FEI pool on Uniswap. When it wants to expand supply, the protocol can also mint slightly extra FEI when users trade ETH for FEI. This is a part of the direct incentivization mechanic.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the payments giant said it plans to use its new purchase to ""accelerate and expand its initiatives to support cryptocurrencies and digital assets.""

""During our conversations with Curv's team, we've been impressed by their technical talent, entrepreneurial spirit and the thinking behind the technology they've built in the last few years. We're excited to welcome the Curv team to PayPal,"" he said.

PayPal said it expects the acquisition deal to be completed in the first half of this year.    PayPal's crypto push    PayPal, which partnered with New York state-regulated Paxos to offer buying and selling of cryptocurrency starting in October, was known to be on the hunt for a crypto custody acquisition. The payments giant was reported to have been in talks to buy BitGo for as much as $750 million, though the deal fell through.

42386134,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRNVX,1615203574,"Bitcoin's Stimulus-Led Rise Fades as Stocks Drop, Dollar Gains","Bitcoin has erased Sunday's gains as stock markets struggle to cheer progress on U.S. fiscal stimulus efforts.      The cryptocurrency is changing hands just over $50,150 at press time, representing a 1.55% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices had jumped from roughly $49,000 to $51,800 on Sunday as the U.S. Senate approved President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. The bill now heads back to the House of Representatives so it can be reconciled with the House-passed version and then sent on to President Biden to sign.      Traditional markets had mixed reactions early today, with the U.S. dollar falling against major fiat currencies and Asian stocks and U.S. stock futures initially charting moderate gains. However, with the U.S. 10-year bond yield remaining near 12-month highs reached Friday, the dollar soon regained ground, pushing the Asian equities and bitcoin lower.      The 10-year yield is currently trading just shy of Friday's high of 1.62%. S&P 500 futures are now nursing losses and futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq index are down nearly 2%.      Movement on stimulus was expected to put upward pressure on yields, and cap progress for risk assets. Hence, bitcoin's failure to establish a foothold near $52,000 doesn't come as a surprise.      The cryptocurrency has faced rejection near $52,000 three times this month, making it a level to beat for the bulls. The breakout, however, may remain elusive if yields continue to rise, diluting bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge.      Additionally, developments in the Chinese stock market could be a key driver of bitcoin's price action, trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Telegram.      The Shanghai Composite Index fell by over 2% today, while the FTSE China A50 index declined by nearly 4%. The former is down 14% from its February peak, while the S&P 500 is down less than 5% from the record high reached in mid-February.      Although the exact reason for the big drop in Chinese stocks is not known, it could be a harbinger of things to come amid rising fears of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Federal Reserve. According to Gary Biddle, professor of financial accounting at the University of Melbourne, the stock market is collapsing after a last-gasp bull run.      ""With monetary easing set to end, it’s a game of chicken as investors see how close they can come to timing the inevitable downturn,"" Biddle said in an article for South China Morning Post.      It remains to be seen if the Chinese stock market ends up dragging its global peers and bitcoin lower. The cryptocurrency's options market data shows some investors are beginning to position for a deeper drawdown. ""Puts are being bought today,"" Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas told CoinDesk.      So far today, more than 300 daily expiry (bearish) put option contracts have been bought at $50,000 and $48,000 strikes on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volume and open positions.      According to data provided by Skew, the one-week put-call skew, which measures the value of puts relative to calls, is hovering above zero, indicating increased demand for short-term puts.

In a press release on Wednesday, JPR said GPU shipments rose by 20.5% in Q4 compared with the previous quarter and 12.4% year over year.      The increase in sales, largely due to a coronavirus-led shift to working from home offices and increase in indoor-related activities such as video gaming, was also boosted by cryptocurrency mining, the firm said.      ""The pandemic has distorted all models and predictions, as has the gold-rush in Ethereum,"" said JPR.      See also: Crypto Mining Farm Spotted Using Nvidia RTX 30 Gaming Laptops: Report      JPR President and founder Jon Peddie said that while there has been speculation crypto mining would potentially spark a renewal of demand for GPUs, the power consumption of high-end cards ""greatly diminishes the payoff.""      Further, ""Ethereum, the best-suited coin for GPUs, will fork into version 2.0 very soon, making GPUs obsolete,"" said Peddie. ""A person would be very foolish to invest in a high-end, power-consuming [GPU] for crypto mining today.”      GPU suppliers like Nvidia have struggled to keep up with soaring demand for units that power everything from multimedia rendering to keeping up with the latest game titles and, though they don't like it, mining ether.
