29278443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612326,1718060438,"Ethereum Inflows Soar: Record Week With $69M As ETFs Near Trading Launch, What’s Next?","Following the recent price spike that brought Ethereum (ETH) close to the $4,000 mark, the second-largest cryptocurrency has experienced inflows and renewed market enthusiasm. This comes in response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Ethereum ETF applications by major asset managers. Best Week For Ethereum Since March According to a report by CoinShares, digital asset investment products have witnessed a total of $2 billion inflows, contributing to a five-week consecutive run of inflows amounting to $4.3 billion. Additionally, trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) have risen to $12.8 billion for the week, a 55% increase from the previous week. Notably, inflows have been observed across various providers, indicating a turnaround in sentiment. Incumbent providers have also experienced a slowdown in outflows, reinforcing the positive market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? As seen in the image above, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the market, with inflows totaling $1.97 billion for the week. On the other hand, short Bitcoin products saw outflows of $5.3 million for the third consecutive week. Similarly, Ethereum has also seen a notable surge in inflows, recording its best week since March with a total of $69 million, which for CoinShares is likely a reaction to the unexpected SEC decision to allow spot-based ETFs on Ethereum. Differing Perspectives On ETH’s Price Despite the positive developments, Ethereum’s price has struggled to maintain bullish momentum, failing to retest its yearly high of $4,100 reached in March. On Friday, the price dropped as low as $3,577. However, Ethereum addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH have increased by 3% in the past three weeks, indicating a significant spike in buying pressure. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Metric Breaks 3-Month Downtrend Amid Bullish Network Recovery Market analysts have provided differing perspectives on Ethereum’s future price action. “Trader Tank” predicts that ETH may drop to $3,500 while acknowledging the potential for a bullish reversal upon reclaiming the $3,700 level. On the other hand, crypto analyst Lark Davis highlights that Ethereum’s supply on exchanges is at an eight-year low, suggesting that the upcoming ETFs could cause a “massive supply shock” and potentially lead to a substantial increase in ETH’s price. Ultimately, as Ethereum’s price remains uncertain, market participants eagerly await the next movements in the cryptocurrency. As investors and analysts closely monitor the market dynamics, the question of whether a breakout above $4,000 or a retest of lower support levels at $3,500 awaits an answer. The second-largest cryptocurrency on the market is currently trading at $3,690, down 6.5% in the past two weeks.

29276281,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612249,1718056858,"Crypto Analyst Predicts 800% Rally To $6,000 For BNB, Here’s The Timeline","BNB has been one of the best performers coming out of the long and drawn-out bear market of 2022. Even now, the altcoin continues to show a lot of strength, suggesting that its run is far from over. According to one crypto analyst, this expected run for the BNB price could last longer and drive the price higher than expected, predicting an over 800% increase in price from here. BNB Showing Strength On The Monthly Chart A pseudonymous crypt analyst who goes by the moniker Without Worries on the TradingView website has shared an interesting outlook for the BNB price. The analysis uses the BNB monthly chart, showing that the altcoin remains bullish even after rallying over 150% in the last year already. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts Meteoric 21,700% Rise To $17, Here’s When Without Worries points out that the BNB price action looks to be in a legacy uptrend channel. Now, channels like these are rare because it means that the altcoin has been in this uptrend channel since it launched. To put this in perspective, the crypto analyst points out that altcoins like Litecoin is one of the ones which has failed to maintain a legacy uptrend channel. Furthermore, the analyst points out that the BNB price is currently seeing its third test of resistance at the time that the initial analysis was posted, which was on June 3. This third resistance test comes after three years of consolidation. However, this time around, it’s looking more bullish for the altcoin following the resistance test. One major factor driving the bullishness around BNB is the fact that the Stochastic RSI had crossed above 80. This is important because the last time that this had happened was back in May 2020, just before the coin went into a full-blown rally. “This is the same situation as today. Stochastic RSI remains with momentum for 182 days. Should history repeat, momentum continues until August / September,” the analyst stated. Price Breaks Out Of Resistance In a follow-up post, crypto analyst Without Worries revealed that the BNB price has now successfully broken out of the third resistance. Now, going back to the initial analysis, Without Worries points out that such a situation would trigger a massive breakout for the BNB price. Related Reading: Ripple’s 150 Million XRP Sale Keeps Price Surpressed Amid Bearish Headwinds The top of the target for the BNB price is placed at $6,000, which is a more than 800% increase in price from here. “The bull flag pattern confirms a breakout AND support. A measured move from the flagpole of the last resistance breakout takes price action to $6000,” the analyst said. As for the timeframe for when this will happen, the crypto analyst expects the rally to fully play out sometime in September. This means around 16 weeks or a little less than four months from now. If the analysis is correct, then BNB is just getting started.

As the largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin (BTC), consolidates in a price range between $67,000 and $70,000, Van de Poppe’s latest market update suggests that this may be the ” final time” to invest in altcoins before a potential breakout. Altcoins Analysis In a series of social media posts, Van de Poppe analyzes specific altcoins, including Sui (SUI), Chainlink (LINK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Fantom (FTM), and Polkadot (DOT), offering valuable insights for investors. One of the altcoins that has caught Van de Poppe’s attention is SUI, which, according to his analysis, has shown strength in the market with a higher low formation. Van de Poppe suggests that if momentum provides a breakout above $1.17, SUI could continue its uptrend toward $1.60 (currently trading at $1.067). Chainlink (LINK) is another altcoin Van de Poppe considers “heavily undervalued.” Drawing on historical data, he points out that LINK has delivered a 150% return in previous cycles, making it an attractive investment opportunity at its current trading price of $16.037. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Skyrocket By 1,100%, Predicts Analyst However, Van de Poppe also advises caution with certain altcoins. For instance, FLOKI, despite its substantial 1200% increase since the beginning of its recent run, carries a “higher risk of a heavy correction.” He suggests that interested investors wait for a 30-40% correction before considering an investment. Van de Poppe also draws attention to Fantom’s native token FTM, which has been forming lower highs and lower lows. With multiple tests of the $0.60 support, a price breakdown seems likely. If a breakdown occurs, he identifies two potential areas of interest between $0.4924 and $0.6113 for swing trading. Crucial Support Levels For Ethereum Regarding Polkadot, Van de Poppe highlights its potential as a market leader in the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector. He emphasizes that Polkadot is currently undervalued and is in the process of implementing RWA within its ecosystem. Despite the price not reflecting the “thriving ecosystem,” Van de Poppe expects this will change. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? In addition to these lower-cap altcoins compared to the largest, Van de Poppe provides insight into Ethereum (ETH). In a separate analysis, the market expert suggests that ETH is looking for a higher low and expects confirmation of S-1 filing approval for the long-awaited Ethereum ETFs in the US in the coming weeks. Interestingly, on the 3-day Ethereum/BTC chart, Van de Poppe identifies the 0.05-0.051 BTC range as a key support area for Ethereum.

29272006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612216,1718049623,"Bitcoin Could See Next Top At $89,200, Crypto Analyst Suggests","According to this on-chain indicator, an analyst explained how the next potential local top for Bitcoin could be $89,200. Bitcoin CVDD “Assessing Tops” Metric Could Suggest Next Potential Top In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where the next top for BTC could be based on the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD). The CVDD is an on-chain metric derived from the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD). A “coin day” is the quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. When a coin that has accumulated a certain number of coin days is moved on the network, the coin days it was carrying naturally reset back to zero and are said to be “destroyed.” Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum On “Path To Acceleration,” CryptoQuant Explains Why The CDD measures the number of coin days being destroyed across the market on any given day. Since every transaction also carries some USD value based on the price at its time, the CVDD adds another layer of context to the CDD by accounting for the USD value of every coin, breaking dormancy to destroy its coin days. Unlike the CDD, which tracks only the number of coin days being destroyed on any given day, the CVDD is a cumulative sum of the asset’s history. More formally, the CVDD is calculated as a ratio between the cumulative sum of the value-time destruction on the network divided by the age of the cryptocurrency. Analyst Willy Woo devised the original CVDD, which has proven remarkably accurate for locating historical bottoms in the asset’s price. In the context of the current topic, though, the “Assessing Tops” modification from CryptoQuant author Binh Dang is of interest. This indicator combines the 50-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin spot price with the CVDD and aims to assess probable points of tops in the asset, as its name suggests. Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of the Bitcoin Assessing Tops has looked like recently: From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin spot price had briefly breached the Assessing Tops back in March. When the asset exceeds this indicator, its price is generally overheated and prone to forming tops. It would appear that this had also held up during this recent break, as the asset had shortly reached a top following it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Beware: Extreme Greed Has Returned In Crypto The Bitcoin Assessing Tops indicator currently has a value of $89,200. While a top may not necessarily form if Bitcoin rises to this level, a peak may indeed at least become close when it does so if this indicator is to go by. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,300, down more than 1% over the past week.

42417940,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6vN,1718049600,Optimism Finally Gets Its Mission-Critical 'Fault Proofs',"Optimism, a leading layer-2 blockchain, aims to help Ethereum users transact quickly and for lower fees. Its tech serves as the foundation for some of the biggest names in blockchain, including the Coinbase exchange's popular Base blockchain and Worldcoin's World Chain–from OpenAI founder Sam Altman.  But for years, Optimism had a problem. All of the blockchains that used Optimism's technology were built according to a core underlying premise: They ""borrowed"" Ethereum's security apparatus. In reality, however, that wasn't the case.  Until now, Optimism has been missing a core feature at the heart of its security design: ""Fault proofs."" On Monday, that long-promised tech is finally coming to Optimism's mainnet.  Fault-proofs are meant to keep Optimism-based layer-2 chains honest. They help prevent operators of a layer-2 chain from passing inaccurate transaction data down to Ethereum's layer-1 transaction ledger, and they power the layer-2 chain's ""decentralized"" withdrawal mechanism.  Read more: Optimism Finally Starts Testing 'Fault Proofs' at Heart of Design – and of Criticism  Similar ""proof"" technology is used by all layer-2 rollup networks, including Optimism competitors like Arbitrum. It's meant to ensure that a rollup's users–be they NFT traders, retail investors, or big-name financial institutions–can trust Ethereum's sprawling operator network, rather than the rollup's own internal systems, to record their transactions and withdrawals accurately.  As layer-2 chains like Arbitrum baked proofs their systems, Optimism lagged behind. For years, this made Optimism the butt of criticism from peers who claimed their own technology was safer and more advanced.  Now that fault proofs are finally coming to Optimism's mainnet, the network's developers–and the growing ecosystem of other teams that use its technology–hope to put their past behind them.  How do ‘Fault Proofs’ work?  Over the past two years, layer-2 rollup networks like Optimism have become the go-to method for operating on the notoriously expensive Ethereum blockchain.  When a user submits a transaction to a rollup network, it is bundled with transactions from other users before it is passed down to Ethereum. Those bundles are written to Ethereum's transaction ledger all at once, a setup that lets users transact faster and for just a fraction of the fees.  In theory, rollup transactions are secured by ""proofs,"" which are cryptographic methods that allow observers on Ethereum to check whether transaction details have been recorded accurately. This is most relevant in the context of withdrawals, allowing users to trust Ethereum–rather than the rollup network–to pull their funds out of the layer-2 chain.  Without fault proofs, users who deposited their funds into Optimism needed to trust the rollup's ""security council"" to return their funds–a system that exposed the rollup to potential human error or bias. With fault proofs, those users should only need to trust Ethereum.  Optimism derives name from its ""optimistic"" proof system, and it launched a version of the tech when it first released in 2021 before quickly scrapping it after finding issues.  “We literally deleted the entire system essentially, re-architected it, and rewrote the entire thing,” Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That was brutal, but absolutely the correct decision.”  The Optimism team previously shared in March that it was testing its fault proofs system on their Sepolia testnet. Since then, they had an audit conducted by blockchain security firm Sherlock, and found a few bugs that they were able to patch out.  “So we fixed everything that we did find, and we got a lot of confidence in the actual implementation being ready for prime time,” Floersch said.  Starting this week, the network will again rely on a fault-proof system to power withdrawals, but it will still retain ""training wheels"" meant to ensure that things run smoothly. The Security Council will remain intact and can intervene in the event that the fault-proof system goes down. This combination of the two entities is what Optimism is calling “Stage 1 decentralization.”  The goal is to eventually reach Stage 2 decentralization, where the network will not have to rely on the Security Council at all.  “Stage 2 is a multiple fault proof system, sufficient such that it is possible to run the system in some ways, like on autopilot. There's no ability for the Security Council to intervene at the last moment,” Floersch said.  Floersch added that the team is hard at work to reach its Stage 2 goals, but he didn't give a timeline for when that ultimate vision would be reached.  With fault proofs finally shipping to Optimism's mainnet, other chains that use Optimism's OP Stack will gain access to the tech as well. (According to DefiLlama, Two blockchains that use Optimism's OP Stack, Blast and Base, currently surpass Optimism's mainnet in terms of total value locked.)  “We're going to start with OP mainnet for this upgrade, it's a decently large upgrade,” Floersch told CoinDesk. “However, it should not be too long” for Coinbase's Base chain to implement the fault proof system, too, Floersch added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/10/optimism-finally-gets-its-mission-critical-fault-proofs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d440d5f409f528ab5c458211111623d35397c246-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417943,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6wP,1718049222,In Defense of Meme Coins,"I get it: Meme coins are dumb. Unserious. A waste of time. They give the impression that the crypto industry is trivial. Full of speculators. Vitalik Buterin is probably right to say the whole industry would be better off if people instead focused on legit projects.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  But. Buuuuut – the only thing lamer than trying to financialize memes is complaining about meme coins. You can have many deep thoughts about how meme coins are emblematic of this age of “financial nihilism,” but shame on anyone uttering them aloud – especially if you’re holding a bag.  I don’t necessarily think meme coins should be celebrated, particularly not for the reasons most often given. At this point in the cycle, it’s clear tokens – even ""blue chips"" like shiba inu {{SHIB}} or dogwifhat (WIF) – aren’t really bringing in new adopters; at least not yet. I think it’s dubious to suggest that the “communities” that form around investing in meme coins are at all long term sustainable. And it’s, of course, irresponsible to suggest these tokens are creating “generational wealth” for people.  See also: Iggy Azalea's MOTHER Meme Coin Turned $3K Into $9M for 1 Lucky Trader  Meme coins are what they are: highly speculative investment vehicles. That there appears to be a near endless amount of interest and capital to plow into them essentially proves that “speculation is a use case,” no matter whether you agree with the sentiment there.  As Riva Tez put it in her recent speech at Consensus 2024, meme coins are helping crypto win the “narrative war” by fulfilling a genuine need that people have. Meme coins meet people where they are.  Fair enough to criticize casinos or state-sanctioned gambling like the lotto on moral grounds, but meme coins exist for the same reason – people like to dream their lives can change in an instant, without really having to do much work. It’s an itch that cannot simply be willed away, and it turns out gambling on blockchain-based tokens is as good as a scratch-off.  More substantially, it’s becoming evident that meme coins are tools for coordination and measuring attention. It’s in the name: meme coins are about mimetics – or the process by which ideas gain cultural currency by getting shared.  As Ravi Bakhai, who is building a meme-coin trading platform called Hype, explained, meme coins have essentially become a big, generalized betting market for determining how relevant anything is at any given time. For instance, Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token literally put a price on her fame, and the rapper’s ability to draw an audience of crypto enthusiasts.  Now, a lot has been said over the years about crypto’s place in the “attention economy,” based around the idea that attention itself is a scarce commodity, and it’s easy to overstate the value of “crowdsourcing” popularity this way. In essence, what meme coins have revealed about the world is that people like cute dogs and can be incredibly racist.  But that doesn’t mean that primitives behind meme coins can’t one day be more useful. In the same way that prediction markets help us understand sentiment because users with “skin in the game” are incentivized to tell the truth, meme coins may also help cut through the noise.  This is the idea behind the emerging category of “PoliFi,” a portmanteau of politics and finance, and the array of tokens like JEO BODEN, MAGA and elizabath whoren that some people are using as metrics to gamble on those candidates' re-election odds. But this doesn't have to be limited to politics.  See also: Trump MAGA Meme Coins Are the First Experiment in 'PoliFi'  As Calaxy CEO Solo Ceesay recently wrote in a piece for The Defiant: “Memecoins are a prime example of how any collective group of individuals can create the economic infrastructure to facilitate commerce, trade, and collaboration without the need for an intermediary. Before blockchain, this was virtually impossible.”  Finally, as the creation of dogecoin {{DOGE}} in late-2013 showed, it’s worth noting that meme coins are essentially just a blank canvas for “performance art,” as Tez puts it. Co-creators Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer said DOGE was just a spoof of Bitcoin.  That actually gets to the heart of the most cutting criticism of meme coins: that they reveal the financial and psychological mechanisms that essentially make all cryptocurrencies tick. While it’s unlikely bitcoin {{BTC}} is going to zero, it only has value because a crowd of people say it does, which is the same reason why something like the BALD token momentarily had value (and then didn't).  The only real difference is that one is backed by the belief that the digital age needs a functioning store-of-value and the other by a desire to mock the person running Coinbase. Some see this as evidence that BTC is a gigantic Ponzi, while others weep at the beauty of the economic miracle of aligning people through shared interests.  See also: 'It's Part and Parcel of Crypto': How Memes Drive Narrative  Likewise, the worst aspects of meme coins are true too for the rest of crypto. Celebrities launching tokens and using their fans as exit liquidity is unseemly. Rug pulls are reprehensible. The relentless chase for riches is upsetting. But in a real way, there is something more honest about meme coins. They make no illusions about the game being played.  Ultimately, where one stands on meme coins will likely come down to how self-serious they are. There are genuinely people out there who think meme coins are giving crypto a bad reputation, oblivious to the fact that most people view crypto this way anyway.  I don’t think I’ll ever buy a dog token.

Recent analyses indicate the potential for significant price movement. According to Egrag Crypto, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, the altcoin’s price could ascend to ambitious new heights in the coming months based on technical patterns and market trends. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP At $0.75 In July Despite Year-Long Slump Technical Indicators Pointing Upwards XRP has so far emerged as a focal point for potential bullish activity. Notably, the asset has recently broken out of a week-long downtrend, recording a 1.6% uptick in the last 24 hours, with its price now hovering around $0.5032. This shift comes as the market is closely watching several key indicators that could predict further gains. According to the technical analysis done by Egrag, there is currently a preliminary target for XRP at $7.5, known as the Atlas Line target. Egrag Crypto also expresses a strong confidence that XRP will break through the White Triangle pattern—a technical configuration seen as a critical indicator of future price movement—in the chart he shared (below). Breaking this pattern could set the stage for reaching and surpassing a “measured move at $1.5” levels, according to the analyst. Further technical analysis identifies the Fibonacci 1.618 zone, stretching from $6.5 to $7.5, as a critical region for potential profit-taking should the token’s price ascend to these levels. Achieving a weekly close above this range could set XRP toward mid-double-digit prices, approaching the Fib levels of 2.414 and 2.618. Such movements would underscore a strong bullish trend, provided the current market momentum continues. #XRP ATLAS LINE – $7.5 is Target Number 1 (UPDATE): 🌟🚀✨ A) With high conviction, I can say that #XRP will break the White Triangle and hit the measured move at $1.5. 💪💎 B) Moreover, the Fib 1.618 zone ($6.5-$7.5) is critical, and taking profits will happen here. 📈💰 C)… pic.twitter.com/MyKqoczSa3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 10, 2024 XRP Market Sentiment And Analyst Perspectives Adding to the optimism, another analyst known as “Jack The Rippler” recently pointed out a bullish triangle pattern forming on the daily chart for the token. If this pattern successfully breaks above the $0.600 level, it could trigger an exceptionally bullish trend. However, despite these optimistic technical forecasts, the reality of reaching such high figures remains speculative, with significant resistance levels that must be overcome in the short term.

Following the flash crash on June 6, prices reversed sharply from the $72,000 level, further highlighting the significance of the liquidation level. In the past, Bitcoin prices have recoiled from this level, with analysts expecting a short squeeze to print once this line is breached. Hedge Funds Are Short Selling Bitcoin Futures: Will This Strategy Backfire? Amid this slip, one analyst on X notes that hedge funds and Wall Street firms have increasingly taken short positions on Bitcoin futures contracts, expecting BTC prices to plunge. Though they could be net long on the spot market, taking advantage of the fee differential, the trader notes that this strategy is risky. If anything, massive losses could occur should prices unexpectedly spike. Between the current price point and slightly above all-time highs at $74,000, exchange data and trader notes show $12 billion worth of short positions on BTC futures. This move means that hedge funds are net bearish, and since everyone knows the big boys of Wall Street are shorting, this move could backfire spectacularly. Even so, hedge funds selling BTC futures are nothing new. Often, hedge funds tend to short the futures of a given product and simultaneously buy the spot markets, taking advantage of the carry trade to profit. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Skyrocket By 1,100%, Predicts Analyst The problem is that this hedging tactic is popular in traditional finance and has been profitable before. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a new asset class that is outside the traditional finance system. Accordingly, the strategy might not pan out exactly as expected, leading to massive losses. BTC Fragile But Spot ETF Issuers On A Buying Spree Whether Bitcoin will recover from spot rates remains to be seen. As it is, BTC is under immense selling pressure, dropping from $72,000. Although the uptrend remains, buyers are yet to reverse the June 6 losses, meaning the path of least resistance in the short term is southwards. A break below $66,000 would completely wipe out gains of May 20, signaling a trend shift. Related Reading: Notcoin (NOT) Develops Falling Wedge Triangle: Rally Looms?

42417941,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6sH,1718038349,Solana Heavyweights Wage War Against Private Mempool Operators,"A group of Solana {{SOL}} validators are facing financial penalties for allegedly facilitating economic attacks against crypto traders.  Over 30 validator operators were kicked off the Solana Foundation Delegation Program over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter said. While they remain validators on the network, they're no longer eligible to receive what amounted to payout boosters for validating transactions on the Solana blockchain. Many of the operators were Russians, another source said.  The purge escalates a months-long shadow war between heavyweights of the Solana validator ecosystem and an underground economy of validators believed to be exploiting traders for profit through what's known as a ""sandwich attack,"" whereby bots frontrun and backfill trades that haven't yet been executed.  It's among the more notorious maximal extractable value, or MEV, strategies possible on blockchains that rely on mempools, which are essentially waiting rooms for unconfirmed transactions. Solana doesn't have a native mempool, but the wildly popular validator software developed by Jito Labs once did.  In March, at the height of Solana's meme coin frenzy, Jito Labs shut off the mempool function because it was exposing traders to near-constant and costly sandwich attacks. Jito's CEO framed the move as being in the best interest of the Solana ecosystem even if it cut off one potential revenue stream for validators, the server operators who keep things running on this decentralized network.  Rather than completely solve the problem, Jito's move pushed it underground. Whispers quickly emerged of private mempools whose operators were making at times hundreds of thousands of dollars by enabling sandwich attacks.  One proposal from infrastructure operator DeezNode offered validators who opted into its private mempool 50% of the profits generated by MEV, according to documents reviewed by CoinDesk.  A Jito Foundation governance post from late Sunday indicates 10% of the JitoSOL pool is being delegated to validators running private mempools. The Jito Foundation has proposed imposing further economic penalties on those validators by way of restricting yet more staked SOL.  Solana Foundation's own delegation blacklist is small as a portion of the delegation program. It targets a total of 32 operators that together had 1.5 million SOL, about 0.5% of program stake, a source said.

42417933,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6o9,1718037863,EU Vote See Reelection of Some Officials With Key Roles in Bloc's Crypto Journey,"The European Union election has seen the reelection of Stefan Berger, Ondrej Kovarik and Irene Tingali, who played key roles in shaping crypto legislation for the 27-nation trading bloc.  A ""slight shift to the right"" is likely to lead to ""greater focus ... on competitiveness and growth,"" said one crypto industry participant.  The European Parliament (EP) election, which has been characterized by a swing to the right, has seen key figures who played a big part in the trading bloc's crypto journey reelected.  The vote for the 720 members of the parliament (MEPs) started last week, and results have been trickling in from the 27 nations since Sunday. Among those returned are Stefan Berger, the rapporteur for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, as well as Ondrej Kovarik and the former chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), Irene Tingali.  ""Berger and Kovarik were rapporteurs (so leading EP work) on digital euro and payment services directive respectively. There’s no guarantee they will return to ECON but if they do, chances are they will retain these roles,"" Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation told CoinDesk in a statement.  ""They were also both active on MiCA, as rapporteur and shadow rapporteur respectively. Tingali was ECON chair. I think she wants to try to keep that role. It’s influential as the chair is involved in all the negotiations at trilogue,"" Foster continued. Trilogues are informal meetings between representatives of the parliament, the European Council and the European Commission on the development of legislation.  The election saw the bloc shift more to the right, although not as far as some people had expected, Foster said. The most extreme moves occurred in Austria and France, where President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election after the National Rally secured almost double the number of seats of his center-right grouping. In Austria, the Freedom Party is set to win 27% of the nation's seats, more than any other party.  The largest block in the European Parliament remains the center-right grouping of the European People's Party, which has grown from 176 of the previous parliament's 705 seats, to a predicted 186 now. The Identity and Democracy group, home to both France's Rally National and Austria's Freedom Party, has expanded from 49 to a forecast 58. Most of the groups associated with left-wing views lost influence.  ""The slight shift to the right, combined with a strengthened EPP and a weakened Green Party may well see a greater focus over the next five years on competitiveness and growth,"" Foster said. ""This could lead to a more enabling framework for innovation-friendly policies.""  Crypto has not been a key theme in the EU elections but the future of crypto will be down to the commissioners who can propose legislation. Some members of the crypto community are looking for more blockchain policies, but MEPs can't propose new legislation, they just shape it and decide on it. New commissioners will be selected after the EU election.

42417936,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6qD,1718035893,"Senate Bill Could Open Crypto to U.S. Sanctions, but Industry Trying to Head It Off","A provision in the recent spending package from the Senate's intelligence committee targets crypto ties to terrorism and caught many in the industry off-guard, criticizing it as a flawed approach to a worthy goal.  The staff of the panel's chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, has been meeting with people in the digital assets industry to talk about the provision, sources say.  Crypto insiders predict the effort isn't likely to survive the budget process.  A piece of legislation with heavy implications for the digital assets sector made it through the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's funding package recently without most in the industry – and many in Congress – apparently aware of it, but industry insiders consider its chances for survival to be limited.  A Senate bill meant to fund U.S. intelligence operations included a section borrowed from an earlier bill aimed at preventing the use of cryptocurrency to support terrorism. That provision, as written, could require a massive shift in the crypto industry toward identifying users' identities to prevent sanctions that could strangle digital assets businesses. Were it to become law, it would mark the most important U.S. crypto policy yet adopted – and all without significant debate about its merits.  This section of the intelligence funding effort would speed and automate the process to sanction ""foreign digital asset transaction facilitators"" – including crypto exchanges – that are linked to users who support terrorism groups.  Though the Intelligence Authorization Act cleared the committee in a unanimous 17-0 vote, its crypto section wasn't mentioned publicly nor listed among the major provisions of the bill when Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the committee's chairman, announced the passage in a press release. Now, Warner's office has been setting up meetings with people in the crypto sector to talk about that section, according to three people familiar with the discussions, and the Digital Chamber, an industry lobbying group, confirmed it's among those in the talks.  The dialogue suggests the matter is still in play as the spending package advances toward wider Senate consideration, potentially within the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  ""We’ve chatted with Warner staff on this, and they’re open to broader engagement here from industry,"" Cody Carbone, chief police officer for the Digital Chamber, told CoinDesk in an email. ""I think it likely does get zapped out of the NDAA process given the immediate pushback from the industry.""  The House of Representatives may also be unlikely to embrace this kind of provision that puts the industry in a strict U.S. box soon after the House approved wider crypto market-structure legislation meant to regulate the industry without stifling it. That passage last month of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) saw a third of House Democrats jump on board, suggesting that crypto regulation could have wide bipartisan support across Congress. That showing reinforced another recent industry success in the Senate in which 11 Democrats voted with Republicans to erase the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting policy despite a promised (and fulfilled) veto from President Joe Biden.  With so many senators sympathetic to the industry, passage may be difficult to win for illicit-finance legislation that didn't come through an open debate and amendment process. The original bill was backed by Sens. Warner, Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah).  Overly broad?  The language in the spending bill may implicate a broader-than-intended array of crypto interests, and it could include central banks that issue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and software developers, industry insiders contend, adding that other lawmakers seem to have been unaware of its existence. It could raise concerns, too, among users of the market-leading Tether stablecoin {{USDT}}, which has been under U.S. scrutiny for the use of its tokens by bad actors.  Warner's office didn't respond to a request for comment on the crypto provision, nor did the office of Sen. Mark Rubio (R-Fla.), who is vice chairman of the intelligence committee.  The Washington-focused representatives of the sector's lobbying groups have sought to make it clear to policymakers that they're open to discussion on legislation to prevent illicit use of cryptocurrency, as this provision aims to accomplish. Such bills have also been broadly recognized as necessary to get Senate Democrats on board with other crypto initiatives to regulate the structure of the markets and the issuance of stablecoins.  ""Overall, we’re aligned with the goal of the legislation to cut off funding for foreign terrorist organizations, and I appreciate that it limits coverage to those groups that have 'knowingly' facilitated funds to bad actors,"" Carbone said, adding that the legislation isn't entirely bad or good. But the guidelines for identifying violators and the lack of a proportional – perhaps tiered – sanctions system could be problematic, he argued, and he said it puts too much authority in the hands of the U.S. Treasury Secretary.  The crypto industry is also keen to avoid a repeat of its painful legislative surprise in an infrastructure bill in 2021, which included an 11th-hour provision that directed crypto taxation. Getting blindsided by that bill amplified the industry's interest in funding a bigger Washington lobbying presence that's now weighing in on this intelligence bill.",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/10/senate-bill-could-open-crypto-to-us-sanctions-but-industry-trying-to-head-it-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a93039724e959268fabe74a75f9b9defe54cfd9-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29263478,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612248,1718035255,Major Bitcoin Metric Breaks 3-Month Downtrend Amid Bullish Network Recovery,"The Bitcoin on-chain metrics continue to show bullish signs that a parabolic breakout is imminent for the flagship crypto. The latest of these metrics is a significant turnaround in Bitcoin’s network activity, which could further provide bullish momentum for the crypto token. Bitcoin Sees Surge In Network Activity Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the number of daily Bitcoin addresses had broken a downtrend that began on March 5. He added that 756,480 Bitcoin addresses have been active in the last 24 hours. Martinez claimed this development is a “positive sign” that Bitcoin’s bull run will continue. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees Massive 75% Surge In Major Metric – Can This Trigger A Rally To $200? Indeed, this development could trigger a run for Bitcoin as it suggests that more users are returning to the ecosystem. This could positively impact Bitcoin’s price as they continue to trade the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, the surge in daily active addresses adds to a growing list of bullish signals for Bitcoin. Another bullish signal is the decline of Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges, which recently dropped to new lows. This positive development suggests that Bitcoin investors are holding for the long term rather than looking to offload their holdings anytime soon, which could add significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. This decline in Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges continued last week, with Martinez revealing that almost 22,647 BTC ($1.57 billion) were withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the past week. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst mentioned that the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the HTX crypto exchange has surged to 730. This surge in the buy-sell ratio means that more investors are accumulating the flagship crypto at an impressive rate. Martinez noted that this “massive buy pressure overwhelming bullish sentiment” and a strong upward trend might be on the horizon for Bitcoin. This buy pressure could undoubtedly impact Bitcoin’s price, especially if the selling pressure is low. Bitcoin’s Current And Future Outlook Martinez has also provided insights into Bitcoin’s current and future outlook in a series of posts on his X platform. In one post, he noted that Bitcoin’s price is currently situated in a strong support zone between $69,380 and $67,350, where 1.97 million addresses acquired 964,000 BTC. He added that Bitcoin must hold above this level to sustain its bullish momentum. Related Reading: Ripple’s 150 Million XRP Sale Keeps Price Surpressed Amid Bearish Headwinds Meanwhile, the crypto analyst provided insights into how high Bitcoin could rise on its next leg up if it manages to sustain this bullish momentum. He said the next local top for Bitcoin could be around $89,200. Bitcoin is still expected to rise higher than that at some point in the bull run since crypto analysts like Tarekonchain predict that it is very likely that the flagship crypto will rise above $100,000 before it hits its market peak.

42417937,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6uL,1718032731,Stablecoin Issuers Want to Give Something Back in Multi-Trillion-Dollar Market Race,"Notwithstanding regulatory uncertainty, stablecoins that kick out cash to customers are here and vying for the many trillions held in money-market funds and dollar deposits globally.  With the potential to make payments on the internet more cost effective, PayPal sees a decoupling of the payment capability of stablecoins from the yield-generating capability of money-market funds.  Stablecoins have long played a vital role in the cryptocurrency industry, a vehicle to shuttle money around the digital economy, sidestep volatility without having to liquidate portfolios into fiat currencies or post as collateral for trading.  Their usefulness in payments is fairly obvious: They seek to replicate a conventional currency like the U.S. dollar or euro in a blockchain-powered form, serving as digital stand-ins for something consumers are already comfortable with.  But huge amounts of money are stashed in them, generating gigantic profits for stablecoin issuers – who traditionally share none of that bounty with token holders.  Tether's USDT is the third-largest cryptocurrency in the world with $112 billion in assets, according to CoinDesk data; Circle's USDC is No. 6 at $32 billion.  That money is invested in assets considered supremely safe like U.S. Treasuries, earning billions of dollars a year in yield for those companies. This makes them crypto-era versions of an old product in traditional finance: money-market funds. The difference: Money-market issuers share the interest they earn from their investments in bonds and other fixed-income instruments with their customers.  Until recently the lack of competition in a low interest rate environment meant that stablecoin issuers not only could keep all the interest they earned on the collateral because the users and distribution partners didn't really care, said Rob Hadick, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly.  ""But with interest rates rising, the stablecoin issuers have become extremely profitable and it's only natural that those partners, like the exchanges, and the power users will start asking for more of a cut of the revenue,"" Hadick said.  To be fair, regulations prohibit stablecoin issuers from returning yield to users in the U.S., and the soon-to-arrive Markets in Crypto-Asset (MiCA) regime will do the same in Europe.  But blockchains span the planet and stablecoins that kick out cash to customers are here. Competition has already started to heat up with firms like Ondo, Mountain, Agora and others promising a more equitable economic model. Just last week, Paxos introduced a UAE-regulated yield-generating one called the Lift Dollar.  Payments play  Stablecoin issuers giving something back in the form of a money-market yield is a sensible strategy and a potential worry for traditional dollar-pegged tokens like Circle and Tether, which make up the bulk of collateral posted for trading purposes.  But there are other ways goodwill can be shared with users, such as some of the cost efficiencies gained from using a purely payments-focused stablecoin, carrying out transactions on a grand scale. This is the aim of fintech giant PayPal's addition to the stablecoin space: its PYUSD token.  The coming years could see a decoupling of the payment capability of stablecoins from the yield-generating capability of money-market funds, according to PayPal SVP and head of blockchain, Jose Fernandez da Ponte.  ""I think that in a few years from now you're going to see corporate treasurers keeping liquidity in a money-market fund, and the moment that they need to make a payment, switch that money-market fund to a stablecoin and make the payment, because those are built for purpose,"" Fernandez da Ponte said in an interview.  Clearly, PayPal seems to be more focused on honing PYUSD's ability to do faster, cheaper payments – PYUSD is now integrated with the high-throughput Solana {{SOL}} blockchain, for instance – than worrying about how its locked up value level stacks up against USDT and USDC.  But not everyone thinks a payment-focused stablecoin like PYUSD will necessarily thrive in the face of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-sharing tokens, a view taken recently by analysts at Bank of America.  Despite the fact PYUSD is small in comparison to the likes of Tether and Circle, it would likely be unwise to bet against PayPal given its long reach into fintech and payments via applications like Xoom and Venmo.  ""Let's be honest, who in crypto has better distribution than PayPal already?"" said Dragonfly's Hadick. ""It's unlikely in my mind that PYUSD proliferates DeFi [decentralized finance], or that it proliferates other [non-Paypal] applications. But it reduces the burden on PayPal's back office operations and makes them more capital efficient, such that they improve their own margins by 50 basis points and perhaps pass off some of that to the customer.""  Dollar base  Stablecoins as a payment method will have enduring value and are very important, said Charles Cascarilla, the CEO of stablecoin issuer Paxos. But there's a much larger world out there when considering the $6 trillion or so in money-market funds plus some $17 trillion of deposits at banks, and many trillions more in overseas money-markets funds and dollar deposits, he said.  ""Payment assets are always going to be a subset of the broad deposit and dollar base,"" Cascarilla said in an interview. ""So there's only so much that's going to be in payment stablecoins since many people are going to want to be in something that's generating a return.""  Hadick agrees that over time, pretty much all trading in both traditional finance and crypto is going to move towards tokenized yield-bearing collateral. ""The benefits of being able to earn yield while increasing capital efficiency and do intraday settlement will be too much for any major institution to ignore,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,USDT | PYUSD,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | PYUSD,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/10/stablecoin-issuers-want-to-give-something-back-in-multi-trillion-dollar-market-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3ffcc9dd0b2e38b4691593782ed1a4bab0603b4-1280x711.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417938,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6rF,1718032557,Why Zoomers Should Embrace Bitcoin: An Open Letter to Gen Z,"Despite its stature as the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains an enigma to much of Generation Z due to slanted news coverage. Media reports overemphasize fraud, hacks, and price crashes, deterring many Gen Zers from taking the time to understand Bitcoin. But the scandals and criminal activity associated with Bitcoin are not much different from those involving other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. As Gen Z, the demographic born in the late 1990s and early 2000s, grows up in a period of economic uncertainty in the U.S, we need Bitcoin more than ever.  Charlize Wang is a member of the class of 2025 at the Harker School in San Jose, Calif., and managing editor of Harker Aquila, an online news site.  Bitcoin serves as an alternative to the government-issued fiat currencies we are all so familiar with. And Bitcoin doesn’t discriminate, allowing individuals worldwide to access, purchase, and trade it independently via their devices, regardless of gender, race, or cultural background. Additionally, it shields against inflation. Unlike the dollar and other fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a fixed supply and cannot be created out of thin air. The temptation to “print” money has been too strong for leaders in developing countries from Argentina to Venezuela to Nigeria, where citizens can do little but watch their life savings steadily lose value. Bitcoin, by contrast, remains immune from government control and the risks of an overinflated money supply. It enables individuals to potentially stay afloat during economic crises and safeguard their hard-earned savings.  Recently, I had the privilege of speaking with Wences Casares, a trailblazer in using Bitcoin for social and economic transformation. His stories about how inflation wreaked havoc during his childhood in Argentina deeply moved me. He described how his mother once handed him a grocery bag filled with Argentinian pesos, urging him to spend it all that day because the currency's value would plummet by the next.  To illustrate the effects of inflation, imagine if you lived in Argentina, where the inflation rate is nearly 300% per year. Even if you had worked for 30 years and saved $100,000 for retirement, after three years, you would only have the equivalent of $1,926 – less than 2% of the value you worked so hard to save.  Gen Z in America may think this is a foreign problem. However, the U.S. economy is in a precarious position. Debt has grown to $34 trillion, it looks like Congress will never balance the budget, and Americans are saddled with unprecedented levels of personal debt. If that isn’t concerning enough, 2023 gave us three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history. The Federal Reserve’s tinkering with interest rates is not stabilizing the economy in the post-COVID years. With this as our starting point, how will Gen Z realize the “American Dream""?  For 75 years, the U.S. has benefitted from issuing the world’s reserve currency, the “almighty” dollar, and Americans have been largely shielded from the worst effects of over-inflating the money supply. But Gen Z is coming of age at a time when many experts agree U.S. dominance is waning, and we stand to bear the full brunt of currency devaluation. If the leaders of older generations destroy the value of the dollar and Americans’ savings, what will become of Gen Z? Bitcoin may be one of the few solutions that can save us from a bleak future.  Gen Z should not only embrace Bitcoin as a store of value but also for the freedom it offers. We think of America as the “land of the free” because citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to self-defense, the right to vote and the presumption of innocence. But what good are these freedoms if you can’t save for the future? If the currency devalues faster than you can spend it, as the peso did for Wences' family, do you have freedom at all? Every nation requires an economy where people can save money for housing, food, clothing, and education. Without financial security, chaos ensues and freedom is lost.  Gen Z is the most empathetic generation, the one most concerned with equality and social justice. Bitcoin, unlike the banking system, provides equal access to all. Unlike your bank accounts, your Bitcoin cannot be frozen simply because your views may clash with the government’s.  Given the likelihood of us enduring the brunt of 40 years of poor monetary policy, Bitcoin is a beacon of hope for Generation Z, solving the problem of trust in a government that has rarely earned it.

Once a frontrunner in the 2023 crypto bull run, SOL’s price has been range-bound between $155 and $170 for the past few days, leaving investors cautiously optimistic but undeniably perplexed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buoyed By Big Money: Whales Gobble More BTC, Signaling Bullish Outlook Technical Tug-of-War: Bulls Vs. Bears Technical indicators paint a conflicting picture for the high-speed blockchain darling. The dreaded “death cross” – a bearish signal formed when the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day average – has materialized, suggesting a potential short-term price decline. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, hinting at some underlying buying pressure, albeit weak. The social media front isn’t much clearer. Mentions and discussions surrounding Solana have dipped, indicating a decline in public interest. Additionally, trading activity has plummeted by over 50%, mirroring the community’s lukewarm engagement. Whispers Of Opportunity Despite the prevailing uncertainty, there are glimmers of potential for bullish surges. The derivatives market reveals an interesting dynamic. While the overall long/short ratio suggests investor indecision, some major exchanges like Binance and OKX see a more optimistic outlook with higher long positions. Furthermore, recent price spikes have triggered short liquidations, indicating that short-sellers might be getting squeezed out, potentially paving the way for a short-term rally. This phenomenon highlights the inherent volatility of the crypto market, where sudden bursts of bullish momentum can catch bears off guard. Solana Price Projection Looking ahead, analysts offer a mixed bag of predictions. Some, like the report from CoinCodex, predict a bullish surge to $185 by July 10th. However, this optimism clashes with the bearish technical indicators and the “greed” reading on the Fear and Greed Index, which could signal overvaluation. The path forward for Solana hinges on several factors. External influences, like regulatory decisions or broader market trends, could significantly impact its price. Additionally, the success of upcoming projects on the Solana blockchain could reignite investor interest and propel the token value upwards. Related Reading: Ready To Strike? Bitcoin Poised For A Big Move After Major Consolidation Solana’s current predicament is a microcosm of the broader cryptocurrency market.

42417942,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc6xR,1718028330,"Macron Calls Surprise French Election That's Unlikely to Stir Crypto, Is Likely to Shake Up Government","French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament on Sunday, calling a snap election.  Macron called the election after his rival Rassemblement National party secured a victory in the European Parliament election.  French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament and called a snap election after his ruling Renaissance party secured only about half the seats of Marine Le Pen's National Rally in elections for the European Parliament.  The two rounds of voting are expected to take place on June 30 and July 7.  The election is unlikely to undo the country's advances in the crypto industry. It registered 74 crypto companies last year, a number that was expected to jump to 100, and French regulators recently worked to attract more digital asset companies. The U.K., whose government has said it wants the country to be a crypto hub, has only 44 registered crypto companies.  Macron, first elected as president in 2017, called the election after National Rally, formally known as Rassemblement National, secured 31.4% of the seats on offer for French candidates. That trumped the performance of Besoin d'Europe, the EU representative for Renaissance. France is the second-biggest country in the EU by population and was allocated 81 seats out of 720. Germany, the largest, gets 96 seats.  Last year the EU, a trading bloc of 27 nations, passed a wide-ranging, first-of-its-kind package for crypto called the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. The rules allow crypto companies to operate across the EU if they secure a crypto asset service provider license in any member nation. The package is set to take effect for stablecoin issuers on June 30 and the rest of the legislation will be active by the end of the year.  ""I have heard your message,"" Macron said in a televised address, ""and I will not let it go without a response.""

The partnership protects the exchange’s operations, such as withdrawals and deposits, using Fireblocks’ governance and policy rules.  Cryptocurrency custody firm Fireblocks is working with Coinbase International Exchange, the non-U.S. arm of the trading business providing perpetual futures and spot trading features for institutional and retail clients in eligible jurisdictions, the companies said on Monday.  Fireblocks customers can now connect to their Coinbase International Exchange account and protect exchange operations, such as withdrawals and deposits, with Fireblocks’ governance and policy rules, according to a statement.  Coinbase International Exchange received a regulatory license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority to offer its services in May 2023. It initially operated only as a derivatives exchange for institutions and later added spot crypto trading for retail.  Fireblock uses cryptographic key sharing technology, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), to remove a single point of compromise from API credentials, combined with secure hardware enclaves to prevent further threats or inside collusion attacks.  Customers can use Fireblocks’ policy engine to configure user roles, governance policies, and approval workflows for exchange deposit and withdrawal operations to protect against an insider unilaterally moving funds from an exchange account. They can also deposit, withdraw, and rebalance across the Fireblocks Console or API and monitor all connected account balances, according to a press statement.  “As we continue to expand our offerings for institutional and retail clients, this collaboration underscores our commitment to providing a robust and reliable trading infrastructure for our global clientele,” said Usman Naeem, CEO of Coinbase International Exchange, in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/10/crypto-custody-firm-fireblocks-partners-with-coinbase-international-exchange-for-more-reliable-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/476d304b03dbba0b28d212a95bf3ce44e053bf07-3514x2426.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Elsayed, the meme-based cryptocurrency is poised for a potential increase that could see its value reach $0.00024, marking an unprecedented 1,105% gain from its current levels. Shiba Inu Price Set To Skyrocket 1,100%? In a review of SHIB’s price activity on the weekly chart (SHIB/USDT), Elsayed pinpointed a repeating pattern that initially occurred during the second quarter of 2021, shortly after Binance, a major crypto exchange, began trading SHIB. According to him, Shiba Inu’s historical data is exhibiting a pattern that, if repeated, will propel its price to new heights. He noted that the cryptocurrency experienced a notable rise to $0.00005 during the week of May 10, 2021, following its listing on Binance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Returns To February 2024 Levels, What Happened Last Time? Elsayed’s analysis draws attention to a critical period in SHIB’s market behavior. After reaching a high of $0.00005, the token underwent a correction, settling below a pivotal support range of $0.00001784 to $0.00001995 for nearly 120 days. However, a subsequent breakout occurred in October 2021 as the broader bull market gained momentum, catapulting SHIB by 343.64% from its support level to a peak of $0.00008854. History Is Repeating Itself 👀 #SHIB pic.twitter.com/zeeXVWhpKZ — Elja (@Eljaboom) June 8, 2024 The subsequent correction and entry into a bear market, exacerbated by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, saw SHIB prices fall below key support levels. It remained subdued under these levels for 658 days, struggling to surpass the $0.00001 mark. Yet, a resurgence in March of this year saw SHIB soar by more than 370% to a yearly high of $0.00004567. Building on this data, Elsayed anticipates a similar, if not more pronounced, trajectory for SHIB in the near future. He estimates that this next breakout could propel SHIB’s price to $0.0002404, effectively increasing its market capitalization to $141.6 billion. Given the cyclical nature of the crypto market, such could be on the cards, according to the crypto analyst. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Enter Buying Frenzy, 715 Billion SHIB Snapped Up In Days In the daily SHIB/USD chart, Shiba Inu’s price is currently in a consolidation phase, following a significant rally to this year’s high in early March. Despite breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern in mid-May, SHIB failed to sustain a close above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00002883. Subsequent to this rejection, the price fell below the 0.236 Fibonacci level and is now struggling to establish support at the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Maintaining a daily close above $0.00002326 is critical to prevent a potential further decline towards the 200-day EMA at $0.00001977.

EETH invests in ether futures contracts and aims to go long on ether futures, betting on an increase in price. The fund has achieved a 96% price return since its inception, outperforming ETH-USD, annualized, but investors should consider the volatility and regulatory risks of the crypto market. The ProShares Ether Strategy ETF ( EETH ) is essentially a way to gain exposure to crypto without having to deal with the nitty-gritty of actually owning ether. If you’ve been on the crypto fence so far but have been generally bullish on ether, bitcoin, or even just the blockchain concept, this is one alternative to consider. EETH is the first ETF of its kind , with the objective of replicating the performance of the underlying asset: ether. It was incepted in October 2023, so we have several months of performance history, and you should note that this is a relatively small fund. Nevertheless, it’s been growing, going from about $71 million in AUM as of 3/31/24 to the current +$100 million as I write this. The expense ratio of 0.95% is definitely a little steep, considering that several bitcoin ETFs are available in the range of 0.20% to 0.25% . You can also find other ether ETFs that charge 0.66%, such as the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), but most of these have much smaller AUMs so they need to be priced more attractively to attract investor funds. EETH Strategy Explained To be clear, the fund doesn’t invest in ether itself. It invests in ether futures contracts, while retaining its cash assets in the form of short-term securities such as T-Bills. The contracts themselves are rolled over as they approach their contract dates. Another important point to note is that the fund doesn’t seek to track ether spot prices. That’s a key consideration because there’s usually a variance between spot prices and futures, and they work differently as well. Both are CFDs or contracts for difference instruments, but spot price trading is done at the current market price, while a futures contract trade is done at an agreed-upon price sometime in the future. As you’ve probably figured out, both types of CFDs are speculative, whether it’s spot or futures, but one important difference is that you can generally limit your loss to the value of the contract fees. With spot trading, there’s potentially much more to lose if price action goes against your trade, and you don’t exit quickly enough. The purpose of EETH is to go long on ether futures, so it’s essentially betting that (ETH-USD) will increase in the future, with the difference being the gain. Naturally, if it goes the other way, you could lose quite a chunk of your investment. Still, as I mentioned earlier, losses are typically lower with futures contracts because fees are generally lower than spot trade fees. That’s the case with most commodities as well. How Has EETH Performed? Looking at the fund’s 96% return since its inception at the beginning of October last year, it’s easy to be impressed. Annualized, that’s 145% - even better than the 101% annual return for ETH-USD itself! And that’s net of the expense ratio, so the only additional cost will be your transaction fee for purchasing the ETF, as well as any short-term or long-term capital gains that may apply, for taxable accounts. That tells me a couple of things. One, the fund managers have made excellent decisions on timing their ether futures contracts, and two, the current return on money-market instruments is providing a boost to total return. In a downturn, it would provide a cushion to help offset losses. The real question, however, is whether or not you believe ether will increase in price over whatever investment horizon you have in mind. If you look at the chart over the past six months, it’s amply clear that there are several forces at play, which shows up in the volatility of the underlying asset. SA Takeaway and Conclusion Of course, one can attribute that volatility to the inherent uncertainties baked into the crypto market, but one particular positive we can take away from this is that interest levels in crypto, in general, and ether, in particular, are clearly stabilizing, if not on the rise. This can be demonstrated in various ways, such as ETH put call ratio or PCR movements over the last month. In the graph below, you can see the global ETH PCR showing overall stability despite the temporary bump toward the end of last month. The Block That was an important timeline for crypto enthusiasts to watch because it’s right after the U.S. House of Representatives approved joint resolution 109, which if eventually passed will limit the SEC’s regulatory power over cryptocurrency markets. There’s significant skepticism about the bill ever passing into law, and the White House has made its position very clear right from the very beginning: The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res. 109, which would disrupt the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system. The crypto market clearly panicked after that May 8 statement from the Biden administration, but the bill did pass through the House. Moreover, now that the President’s veto message of May 31 has been put before the House , albeit tabled until July 10, 2024, hope has again sprouted in the crypto investing world. The decline in the PCR since the beginning of June clearly shows that negative sentiment is abating. That could be a positive signal for ETFs like EETH. Although you may think that the bill wouldn’t have an immediate impact on the ETF’s performance, the fact that it could and will very likely impact the underlying asset directly makes it implicit that investors should be cognizant of these evolving dynamics around crypto regulation. As such, your stance on ETH-USD and crypto in general are key to making an investment decision. Even if you’re not keen on being directly involved in crypto trading, such ETFs give you the kind of indirect exposure you might want. SA In summary, if you’re averse to direct crypto risks but still want to get your feet wet, an ETF like EETH might be just the vehicle for you. The fund managers are doing a great job, and you’re getting the additional benefit of your investment having a floor in the form of short-term investments. For context, ( US3M ) is currently yielding about 5.4%, so there’s a margin of safety here that could cushion any losses on the ETF’s futures contracts, and on the upside, it should help boost any contracts-based gains made by the ETF. Overall, you’d need to be quite bullish on ETH-USD, and that’s what it boils down to. And since I’m transparently ambivalent on cryptocurrency, I’m rating this a Hold, particularly because I do see a potential value play for the right type of investor.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698353-eeth-indirect-exposure-opportunity-for-crypto-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29257068.jpeg
42417953,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc97d,1718024400,Fidelity International Tokenizes Money Market Fund on JPMorgan’s Blockchain,"Fidelity International has selected JPMorgan’s Onyx Digital Assets blockchain to tokenize a money market fund.  The move means improved efficiency in delivering margin requirements and a reduction in transaction costs and operational risk, Fidelity International said.  Fidelity International, a London-based funds management firm, has tokenized shares in a money market fund (MMF) using JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based private blockchain network, Onyx Digital Assets.  Tokenization occurred near instantaneously through connectivity between the fund’s transfer agent (JPMorgan’s transfer agency business) and Tokenized Collateral Network, an application that sits between a collateral receiver and a collateral provider on the bank's Onyx blockchain, said Fidelity International, which is a separate entity to U.S.-based Fidelity Management and Research.  Tokenization of traditional financial assets has become a priority for banks, and it’s an area JPMorgan has been working on for some years. The essence of tokenization is to create on a blockchain a virtual investment vehicle representing real-world assets such as real estate, precious metals and collectibles. Stocks and bonds work too.  Fidelity International also has a long history with digital assets, most recently working on a tokenization project with Swiss bank Sygnum in March.  In October last year, JPMorgan carried out its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction involving tokenized shares in a BlackRock money-market fund. The shares were transferred to Barclays for collateral in an over-the-counter derivatives trade. BlackRock has gone on to further embrace tokenization through its public-facing BUIDL project, with tokenization services firm Securitize.  “Tokenizing our money market fund shares to use as collateral is an important and natural first step in scaling our adoption of this technology,” Stephen Whyman, Fidelity International's head of debt capital markets, said in an email interview. “The benefits to our clients and the wider financial system are clear; in particular, the improved efficiency in delivering margin requirements and reduction in transaction costs and operational risk.”  JPMorgan’s TCN started with the tokenization of money market shares, a type of mutual fund that invests in high-quality, short-term debt instruments and cash equivalents. The plan is to expand across equities, fixed income and a range of asset classes, the bank said.  “Fidelity's participation in TCN brings its MMF units onto our network through tokenization, adding a new asset that is otherwise prohibitively complex to use across today's collateral landscape,” said Keerthi Moudgal, head of product at Onyx Digital Assets, JP Morgan, via email.

Driven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech. Adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with a relatively minor impact on drawdown. By Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, Denis Zinoviev We estimate ETH's price to hit $22k by 2030 in our updated base case scenario and explore optimal BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) allocations in both traditional 60/40 and crypto-only portfolios. We anticipate that spot ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges. This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians, and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs. In response, we've updated our financial model and reevaluated the fundamental investment case for ETH. We also performed a series of quantitative analyses on how ether (ETH) interacts with bitcoin (BTC) in a traditional 60/40 portfolio, focusing on the tradeoff between risk and return. The key takeaways of this piece are: Driven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech. Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66B in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22k per coin, by 2030. Adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with a relatively minor impact on drawdown. An allocation close to 70/30 between bitcoin and ether for a crypto-only portfolio provided the best risk-adjusted returns. The Investment Case for Ethereum: An Evaluation Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, is a novel asset that exposes investors to a high-growth, internet-native commercial system called Ethereum that threatens to disrupt existing financial businesses and Big Tech platforms like Google and Apple. Ethereum is a successful digital economy that attracts - ~20M monthly active users while settling $4T in settlement value and facilitating $5.5T in stablecoin transfers over the last twelve months. Ethereum secures over $91.2B in stablecoins, $6.7B in tokenized off-chain assets, and $308B in digital assets. The centerpiece asset of this financial system is the ETH token, and in our updated base case, we believe it to be worth $22k by 2030, representing a total return of 487% from today’s ETH price, a compound annual growth rate ((CAGR)) of 37.8%. We project ETH’s 2030 valuation based upon a forecast of $66B in free cashflows generated by Ethereum and accruing to the ETH token. We estimate 33x valuation multiple on those cashflows. As Ethereum is a platform for applications, we begin our valuation by estimating the market size of business sectors that blockchain applications will disrupt. We estimate the total addressable market (TAM) to be $15T based on annual revenues in these industry verticals: Finance, Banking, and Payments ((FBP)) - $10.9T Marketing, Advertising, Social and Gaming (MASG) - $1.1T Infrastructure (I) - $1.8T Artificial Intelligence ((AI)) - $1.4T From our TAM figures, we apply market capture estimates of these revenues utilizing blockchains such as Ethereum. These penetration rates are 7.5%, 20%, 10%, and 5% for FBP, MASG, I, and AI, respectively (Fig 6). After that, we predict the share of crypto applications built on Ethereum rather than other blockchains, and our base case is 70%. We then estimate the fees that Ethereum will charge app users, which is effectively a “take rate” on these applications’ revenues, and we calculate this will be 5-10%. We recently updated our ETH model from Spring 2023 to add the AI end-market to reflect Ethereum’s great potential in that sector. The other impactful adjustments to our previous model are increased burn of ETH supply, greater end market capture, and a higher take rate on underlying economic activity. We believe these changes are justified by fundamentals, recent innovations that make Ethereum more accessible, and changing politics in the U.S. Fig 1.

These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as “ Digital Oil ” because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum. ETH can also be viewed as “ Programmable Money ” as the financialization of ETH and other Ethereum assets can occur automatically, without any intermediary or censorship, on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, we consider ETH a “ Yield Bearing Commodity ” because it can earn yield in ETH by being pledged, non-custodially, to validators who govern the Ethereum network. Finally, we believe ETH can be deemed an “ Internet Reserve Currency ” as it is the base asset that prices all activity and most digital assets within the $1T+ Ethereum ecosystem and its 50+ connecting blockchains. Fig 3. Ethereum Ecosystem Daily Active Users Have Grown 71% CAGR Source: Artemis XYZ as of 5/28/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Compound Annual Growth Rate ((CAGR)) represents the rate at which the value of ether (ETH) has grown annually over a specified time period. This metric is used to provide a smoothed annual growth rate, eliminating fluctuations and giving a clearer picture of long-term investment performance. Regardless of its classification, ETH benefits from the growing usage of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a vibrant economic platform that can be considered a “Digital Mall” whose usership has grown ~1500% , and revenue has surged at a 161% CAGR since 2019. Over the past year, Ethereum has generated $3.4B in revenue, and this value accrues directly to ETH holders. Because ETH must be purchased to utilize Ethereum, all ETH holders benefit from the demand-driven currency inflows. Additionally, ~80% of these revenues in ETH are used to buy back and “burn” circulating ETH to remove it from circulation permanently. This is analogous to irreversible stock buybacks. Over the last six months, 541k of ETH worth $1.58B, 0.4% of all supply, has been removed. Thus, holders of ETH double benefit from Ethereum activity due to both usership-driven ETH purchases and the burning of supply. ETH users can also earn a yield on ETH, in ETH, which amounts to ETH ) Staking Rewards Calculator - Earn 3.63% - Staking Rewards"" target=""_blank"">~3.5% per annum. This is done by “staking” ETH to Ethereum network entities called validators to provide them with the necessary collateral bond to run the Ethereum network. Fig 4. Ethereum Revenue Per User Exceeds Most Web2 Businesses Source: Business of Apps, Artemis XYZ as of 5/28/2024. Compared to web2 applications, Ethereum ( $3.4B ) generates more revenue than Etsy ( $2.7B ), Twitch ( $2.6B ) and Roblox ($2.7B ). Ethereum (20M) boasts more monthly active users than Instacart ( 14M ), Robinhood ( 10.6M ), and Vrbo ( 17.5M ). Additionally, the average Ethereum monthly active user generates $172 in annual revenue, comparable to Apple Music ( AAPL ), $100; Netflix ( NFLX ), $142; and Instagram, $25. We categorize Ethereum as a platform business, similar to the Apple App Store or Google Play. However, Ethereum has a substantial edge over web2 platforms because it offers the Ethereum users and Ethereum app business owners unique value propositions not available outside of crypto. The most appealing aspect of using Ethereum is its potential cost savings to businesses and users. Whereas Apple and Google ([[GOOG]], [[GOOGL]]) take around 30% of hosted application revenue, Ethereum currently extracts around 24% (14% for non-DeFI apps). Additionally, we believe that Ethereum’s take rate will drop to 5-10% over the next 18 months as activity shifts to less-expensive Ethereum Layer-2 Blockchains (current take rates of 0.25%-3%). From the payments angle, credit card processors and other payment apps like PayPal ( PYPL ) syphon 1.94% on all payments ( 2.9% on business transactions) while Visa ( V ) charges 1.79-2.43% or more. By contrast, on Ethereum, users pay around 0.001% for a simple transfer, which is less than 1/1000th of the cost of current leading payment applications. Compared to data-centric social networking platforms like Facebook, we believe Ethereum may enable more capable and lucrative applications for entrepreneurs. Ethereum allows applications to freely interconnect and innovate using a permissionless deployment environment and open-source data. Thus, anyone can create an application and tap into important data, including all user activity on a chain - which would be like Visa giving away customer payment data for free! For example, the social media app called Farcaster currently collects $75.5 per monthly active user, whereas Facebook makes around $44 . Even more compelling, the incentive structure of open-source has spawned a far more engaging application as the average daily time on the app for Facebook is 31 minutes versus 350 minutes for Farcaster. The result of Ethereum’s attributes is that some of the margins earned by Big Finance, Big Tech, and Big Data could be transferred to users in the form of consumer welfare. As more data is generated in public and more commerce is moved off expensive, closed financial rails, business moats will erode. The result will be potential business formation around the low-margin economics of open-source. Consumers and app builders will migrate to Ethereum because it is cheaper and provides more value than current stalwarts. We believe that, over the next 5-10 years, between 7% and 20% of Web2/Big Finance business topline, trillions of dollars, can be squeezed by systems like Ethereum and remitted mostly back to users and app builders. Furthermore, the unique ownership properties of Ethereum allow for a censorship-free digital existence on social media and gaming applications. These features will be increasingly valuable if government censorship of information continues to grow. There is also strong reason to believe blockchains like Ethereum will become important back-end infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence applications. The proliferation of AI Agents and an AI Agent economy will demand unrestrained transfer of value, definitive proof of humanity, and clearly defined data/model provenance. These unique properties are available on blockchains, but evade existing tech infrastructure. We explored many of the implications of crypto and AI in our February 2024 piece . We estimate that the TAM for global AI productivity gains may be as high as $8.5T by 2030. Based upon assumptions of business adoption of 66%, AI software value capture of 25%, and a 72% non-hardware value capture, we see the TAM of potential revenues for crypto and AI to be $911B by 2030, with $45.5B in revenues for open-source AI applications and infrastructure, of which $1.2B in revenues may flow back to ETH holders directly. Currently, the majority of activity on Ethereum is financial activity. Decentralized exchanges and banking protocols comprise 49% of Ethereum’s revenues, while 20% is accounted for by simple transfers of value. These revenues are bucketed under Finance, Banking, and Payments (FGP). Meanwhile, Infrastructure (I) takes up the next largest share, around 19%, which relates to decentralized businesses t, and creates software to service decentralized apps. Finally, we classify activity related to social media and NFTs within the Marketing, Advertising, Social Media, and Gaming (MASG) category. MASG contributed 11% of those revenues. Currently, AI plays a very minor role in generating revenue for Ethereum. Ethereum revenues from the aforementioned end-market activities are Ethereum revenue items. These include Transaction Fees, Layer-2 Settlement, Blockspace Ordering (MEV), and Security as a Service. Transaction Fees are charges users (and, in the future, autonomous agents) pay to engage with applications or transfer value on Ethereum. Layer-2 Settlement is the revenue derived from Ethereum Layer-2s Blockchains paying Ethereum for the privilege of “settling” transactions. MEV is revenue generated by users paying for the right to order a block of transactions. Security as a Service is the usage of ETH as collateral to “back” permissionless applications that need this value to perform their business functions. Over the last year, ~72% of Ethereum revenues stemmed from transactions, MEV made up around 19%, L2 settlements were around 9%, while Security as a Service has not officially launched. As we believe Ethereum’s strongest value proposition is to finance, we project in 2030 that 71% of Ethereum’s revenues will derive from financial businesses (FGP). Due to experimentation and the benefits of Ethereum’s open-source financial and data system, we believe MASG will grow to 17%, which will slightly displace Infrastructure, which will provide 8% of revenues. On the balance, AI will account for 2% of Ethereum’s revenues. However, we could see AI’s topline contribution grow by magnitude or more if decentralized AI software demonstrates its immense potential. From the standpoint of revenue items, we estimate that individual mainnet transactions will only make up 1.5% of revenues. Layer-2 Settlements, which bundle blobs of transactions on the mainnet, will dramatically increase to roughly 76% of revenues. This is because we anticipate that the majority of activity will occur on Ethereum Layer-2 blockchains but that most of the value from those transactions will accrue to Ethereum. Meanwhile, MEV maintains its importance at 18% of proceeds, while Security as a Service will become 4.5% of Ethereum’s topline. Fig 5.

Bitcoin and Ether: Optimal Portfolio Allocations Analysis Overview We performed a study to evaluate the impact of including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in a traditional 60/40 investment portfolio, covering the period from 9/1/15 to 4/30/24. The analysis was conducted through five main components: Optimal constrained allocation in a traditional 60/40 portfolio : We assessed the ideal weight of BTC and ETH in a 60% equity and 40% bond portfolio, limiting the maximum combined allocation to 6%. This was done using 169 sample portfolios with incremental additions of crypto exposure. Drawdown and Sharpe ratio analysis : We examined the drawdown and Sharpe ratios of a subset of 16 representative portfolios to understand the risk-return tradeoffs. Adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with a relatively minor impact on drawdown. For investors with high-risk tolerance (up to ~20% annualized volatility), an allocation of up to 20% continues to improve the risk/reward of the overall portfolio. Between BTC & ETH, we see a roughly 70/30 weight as providing the best risk-adjusted returns. Optimal BTC and ETH allocation in a crypto-only portfolio : We analyzed every permutation of BTC and ETH weights in a portfolio consisting only of these two cryptocurrencies, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio and arrive at an ideal BTC/ETH weight. Efficient frontier using the optimal crypto portfolio : We investigated the optimal weighting of the ideal BTC/ETH portfolio to maximize return given various levels of volatility to illustrate a portion (with reasonable volatility levels) of the efficient frontier when adding crypto to the 60/40. Time dependence of efficient frontier results : We considered the impact of various starting points on the results from study #4. By doing so, we show that a larger crypto allocation helped portfolio risk-adjusted returns across every available time period. 1. Optimal allocation in a traditional 60/40 portfolio The primary goal was to identify the optimal allocation of BTC and ETH within a traditional 60/40 portfolio, constrained to a maximum of 6% combined weight in cryptocurrencies. The analysis involved creating 169 model portfolios with incremental crypto exposure (up to 3% each for BTC and ETH). The results indicated that a portfolio with 3% bitcoin and 3% ether (alongside 57% S&P 500 and 37% U.S. Bonds) provided the highest return per unit of risk (standard deviation). In other words, while maintaining a conservative overall allocation of 6%, the maximum allowable allocation to crypto achieved the highest risk-adjusted returns.

Drawdown and Sharpe ratio analysis To evaluate the risk-return tradeoffs, we analyzed 16 representative 60/40 portfolios with incremental increases in crypto allocation, up to the same 6% maximum. The key findings were: Sharpe Ratio Improvement : Portfolio Sharpe ratio improves significantly as the crypto allocation increases. Minimal Impact on Drawdown : Maximum drawdown only increased marginally, making the higher crypto allocation an attractive tradeoff for many investors. Data on max drawdown and Sharpe ratio showed that a 6% crypto allocation resulted in a Sharpe ratio nearly double that of the 60/40 portfolio, while only modestly increasing drawdown. This emphasizes the very favorable risk-return tradeoff when adding BTC and ETH to a traditional portfolio.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Sharpe ratio is a measure used in finance to evaluate the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (such as the return on U.S. Treasury Bonds) from the rate of return for a portfolio and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. This ratio helps investors understand how much excess return they are receiving for the extra volatility that they endure for holding a riskier asset. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return.

Optimal BTC and ETH allocation in a crypto-only portfolio Focusing solely on a BTC and ETH portfolio, we tested every possible weighting combination to determine the optimal mix for maximizing the Sharpe ratio. The analysis revealed that the ideal allocation was 71.4 % bitcoin and 28.6% ether. This configuration yielded the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating the best risk-adjusted return for a crypto-only portfolio. The findings underscored investors' need to hold both cryptocurrencies to maximize benefits. The naïve allocation of 50% BTC and 50% ETH also demonstrated substantial advantages, reinforcing the value of diversification within the crypto asset class.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Volatility refers to the fluctuation in the returns of an asset or portfolio as measured by the standard deviation of returns. Higher volatility indicates greater risk and potentially higher returns, affecting the risk-adjusted returns measured by the Sharpe Ratio. Compound Annual Growth Rate ((CAGR )) represents the rate at which the value of ether (ETH) has grown annually over a specified time period. This metric is used to provide a smoothed annual growth rate, eliminating fluctuations and giving a clearer picture of long-term investment performance. Sharpe ratio is a measure used in finance to evaluate the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset after adjusting for its risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (such as the return on U.S. Treasury Bonds) from the rate of return for a portfolio and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. This ratio helps investors understand how much excess return they are receiving for the extra volatility that they endure for holding a riskier asset. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return.

The efficient frontier when Including crypto To arrive at the optimal allocation to crypto without constraints while maintaining reasonable volatility, we looked at the optimal weighting of the ideal crypto portfolio (28.6% ETH and 71.4% BTC) to be added to the traditional 60/40 portfolio. The goal was to maximize returns while maintaining given levels of volatility (13%-25%) and hence produce a portfolio of the efficient frontier using those assets, with levels of volatility typically associated with broad investor portfolios. The resulting scatterplot demonstrated that incorporating the optimal crypto portfolio into a traditional 60/40 portfolio could significantly enhance returns with varying degrees of risk.

Time dependence of efficient frontier results To determine whether different starting points have an impact on the risk/reward profile of the combined ideal crypto and 60/40 portfolios, we repeated the analysis in 4, while repeatedly moving the starting point 1 quarter forward. Our only constraint was to include at least 3 years of returns. As such, we were able to produce 23 sets of results, and remove time dependence as a variable from the analysis. Our findings were: The optimal weight of the ideal crypto portfolio increased as risk is added across all time periods.

In other words, the results from study #4 are independent of the starting point, and thus bolster the case for including a balanced mix of ETH & BTC up to the 6% weight we studied. Ether Investment Risks While ETH boasts a market cap of over $400 billion and is considered a well-established smart contracts platform, it's important to note that investing in ETH comes with significant risks. Dependence on speculation At this stage, Ethereum’s ecosystem is heavily dependent upon speculation to generate revenues. If the overall appetite for risk declines, ETH may exhibit substantial downside beta to the SP500 or NASDAQ Composite. Regulatory risk Depending upon regulation. ETH or many of the assets within its ecosystem may be classified as securities. This could cause many Ethereum businesses to have to register with the SEC or face serious legal consequences. The largest financial firms have substantial lobbyist presence as well as former employees appointed to the highest levels of most governments around the world. These former employees could create regulatory moats that disfavor disrupters like Ethereum. Interest rate risk As a high-risk asset, rate hikes or otherwise restrictive global liquidity could have an outsized impact on ETH’s valuation compared to other asset classes. Competition The emerging smart contract platform space is incredibly competitive. Though Ethereum has a substantial lead, high performance blockchain such as Solana and Sui have some technical advantages and have focused on business development and user experience. This may allow them to challenge Ethereum’s dominance over the long run. Financial firms evolve One of the biggest advantages of Ethereum is that it enables a cheaper financial system because it removes many high-cost aspects of the current financial system. If financial firms pivot to implement cost savings measures, they could retain user base. Existing financial firms could also create rival blockchain smart contract platforms that cut into Ethereum’s long-term potential. Geopolitical Money control is the most important domain of government power. Geopolitical events, such as major regional war or even elevated geopolitical tensions, could push the governments around the world to squash non-sovereign financial systems and forms of money. Conclusion The analysis clearly shows that adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio can substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with a relatively minor impact on drawdown. An allocation close to 70/30 between bitcoin and ether for a crypto-only portfolio provided the best risk-adjusted returns. Investors should consider their individual risk tolerance, but the data suggests that a balanced inclusion of BTC and ETH can offer outsized benefits in terms of return enhancement relative to the incremental risk introduced. The findings highlight the potential of cryptocurrencies to improve portfolio performance in a controlled and measurable way. Disclosures Please note that VanEck has positions in ether and bitcoin.

Hypothetical or model performance is designed with benefit of hindsight. Index performance is not representative of fund performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. General Digital Assets Disclosures Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

The crypto financial services firm is well positioned to benefit from the continued adoption of digital assets, the report said.  The company’s mining assets could appreciate in value if the AI trend continues, the broker said.  Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is well positioned given its strong institutional exposure to benefit from the continued adoption of digital assets on a structural basis, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Monday raising its price target for the crypto financial services firm.  Canaccord raised its Galaxy price target to C$23 from C$17 while maintaining its buy rating on the stock.

42417967,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9N7,1718022700,Explaining Bitcoin's Dull Price Action Amid Record ETF Inflows,"ETF Inflows appear to be a part of non-direction cash and carry strategy and do not necessarily represent outright bullish bets.  Stablecoin inflows have slowed as well.  Crypto market observers are in flux as bitcoin's spot price continues to coil in a narrow range despite record inflows into the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  That starkly contrasts with the first quarter when prices surged as ETFs drew in billions. Back then, most traders likely placed bullish directional bets through ETFs.  That may not be the case anymore.  ""It’s entities buying ETF and selling [CME] futures to roll down basis some primes are letting entities net that This is also why ETF inflows are high, but the spot is relatively unch[anged],"" pseudonymous market observer CMS Holdings said on X.  The bi-legged strategy, popularly known as cash and carry arbitrage, aims to profit from the premium in the futures market relative to the spot market.  Traders seem to be shorting bitcoin futures on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) while taking long positions in ETFs. As of last week, hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, categorized by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, held record net short position of 18,175 contracts, according to data source QuickStrike.  A similar conclusion can be drawn from the fact that open interest, or the dollar value dedicated to active CME bitcoin futures contracts sized at 5 BTC, has grown in tandem with the cumulative ETF inflows.  In other words, record shorts aren't necessarily outright bearish bets and ETF inflows don't necessarily represent outright bullish bets. Both constitute a non-directional strategy, leaving the cryptocurrency's price directionless.  Per BitMEX Research, large bitcoin ETF holders like Millennium and Schonfeld are likely involved in the cash and carry arbitrage (the basis trade).  ""We agree with @cmsholdings that the CME commitment of traders reported increase in short positions in the hedge fund category is related to the basis trade. A key driver for this is that prime brokers are probably more willing to allow usage of the Bitcoin ETFs as collateral,"" BitMEX Research said on X.  Meanwhile, inflows through dollar-pegged stablecoins, the other prominent source of bullish pressures in the first quarter, have also slowed, arresting bitcoin's price rally.  ""Currently, near the top of its range, bitcoin faces a challenge in breaking above new all-time highs. This can be attributed to the Bitcoin halving on April 20. Following this event, the minting of stablecoins notably slowed down, and wallets holding $>10m in stablecoins declined.

42417968,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9RF,1718020860,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Little Changed After Liquidation Rout,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk's daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin was little changed over the weekend following a $400 million liquidation rout on Friday. BTC fell to under $69,000 from over $71,000 after U.S. non-farm payrolls data came in stronger than expected, which saw open interest and trading volume slump. Since Friday, the number of unsettled futures contracts across various tokens slid to $60 billion from $99 billion, suggesting traders significantly pared bets. However, analysts at Presto Research told CoinDesk that they expect market volatility to return in the week ahead with macroeconomic catalysts such as the CPI release on Wednesday. BTC traded around $69,450 during early European hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has fallen around 0.5% in the past 24 hours.  Crypto investment products took on nearly $2 billion of inflows last week, extending a five-week run to over $4.3 billion, asset manager CoinShares said. Trading volumes in exchange-traded products rose to $12.8 billion for the week, up 55% from the week before. Bitcoin led investment activity at over $1.97 billion inflows for the week, while ether saw its best week of inflows since March at nearly $70 million. ""Unusually, inflows were seen across almost all providers, with a continued slowdown in outflows from incumbents,"" CoinShares analyst James Butterfill said. ""Positive price action saw total AUM rise above the $100 billion mark for the first time since March."" Butterfill said ETH buying was likely in reaction to the surprise SEC decision to allow spot ether ETFs.  The agreement to buy Bitstamp shows crypto is becoming an increasingly important part of Robinhood's business, according to investment bank Architect Partners. ""This acquisition instantly expands global reach to ensure participation regardless of U.S. actions,"" the report said. Robinhood is continuing to expand its digital asset offering despite receiving a Wells Notice from the SEC last month, Architect added. The Bitstamp acquisition will also expand Robinhood's institutional offering, which positions the trading platform as one of the ""few publicly traded crypto-influenced companies that will be able to serve institutions as they come into the digital asset space,"" the note said. Architect also said the price of $200 million in cash is a significant discount to the $500 million valuation that Bitstamp received in the 2018 majority investment.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price and Bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the price's 20-day moving average.  At present, the Bollinger bands are in a state of contraction, a clear sign of a market lull.  The longer the Bollinger band squeezes, the bigger the eventual volatility explosion.

29253658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=612213,1718019021,Notcoin (NOT) Develops Falling Wedge Triangle: Rally Looms?,"Notcoin (NOT), a relatively new entrant in the cryptocurrency market, has recently formed a falling wedge pattern on its price chart. This technical formation is characterized by converging trendlines that slope downwards, signaling a potential bullish reversal. Typically, a falling wedge pattern occurs after a prolonged downtrend, indicating that the asset’s price is likely to break out to the upside. The emergence of this pattern in Notcoin’s chart is drawing attention from traders and investors who are keen to understand its implications for future price movements. A confirmed breakout from the falling wedge could signal the end of Notcoin’s downtrend and the beginning of a new upward trajectory. However, it is essential to consider other market factors and indicators to gauge the strength and sustainability of such a reversal. This market outlook aims to explore the potential scenarios for Notcoin following the formation of the falling wedge pattern, providing insights into what traders and investors might expect in the near future. Analyzing Market Outlook For Notcoin On The 4-Hour And 1-Day Chart As of right now, the price of Notcoin is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart and is moving within the triangle, suggesting that the wedge might continue for a while before there is a potential break out. Confirming the above claim, the RSI line in the 4-hour RSI indicator has dropped below 50%, suggesting that sellers are still active in the market and that the asset will remain active within the triangle for a while. Meanwhile, in the 1-Day timeframe, it can be observed that Notcoin’s price is attempting a retest after a successful breakout above the upper base of the wedge. This means that Notcoin might go bullish after the retest. Also, the 1-Day RSI confirms this retest as the RSI line is seen dropping down from the overbought session toward the 50% level. Price Implication In The Event Of A Breakout In the event of a successful break above the wedge, Notcoin will begin to move upward toward the $0.029405 resistance level. If it breaks above this level, it will move higher to create a new high. However, if Notcoin’s price decides to do the usual and break below the wedge, it will start to descend in the direction of the $0.011381 support level. The price may move much farther to test the $0.007953 level and possibly other levels on the chart if it breaks below this support level. NOT‘s price was down by -1.13% as of the time of writing, trading at approximately $0.019, with a market capitalization of over $1.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $818 million.

42417964,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9K1,1718017200,"Bitcoin ETFs, Bankruptcy Paybacks Have Given Crypto Lending a Second Wind","Crypto lending sector is making a comeback thanks to spot bitcoin ETFs and customers getting their assets back from bankrupt companies, Ledn's co-founder said.  Bitcoin's rally validated crypto holders' investment thesis.  The firm survived the crypto winter by being ""boring, slow and safe.""  The crypto lending sector is recovering from the crypto winter, which blew up several large players, thanks to spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and creditors getting some of their assets back from bankrupt companies.  ""What I'm seeing is that this market has come back roaring,"" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CoinDesk during a recent interview at the Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas. ""The market never really left; it [just] got scared.""  Crypto lending is akin to conventional banking. Customers deposit bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with a company like Ledn, and earn interest or use that crypto to back loans. The interest paid to depositors is generated by lending their crypto to others and charging them interest.  The sector spectacularly imploded in 2022 as crypto prices dove, with firms including Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis filing for bankruptcy.  Since then, the digital assets sector has recovered from the bear market downturn. Prices have soared, with the CoinDesk 20 Index up more than 200% since the end of 2022. The rally kicked into high gear late last year after BlackRock and other conventional finance giants applied – successfully – to create bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. According to Ledn's Di Bartolomeo, the positive narrative surrounding these funds is one of the major reasons why users are back in the lending market.  ""Bitcoin has gone up from $20,000 to $70,000 and has become the focus of the political race in the U.S.,"" he said. ""So that means there's more interest, there is real product market for bitcoin as an asset and for bitcoin as a collateral for lending.""  In fact, Ledn processed more than $690 million in loans in the first quarter, its most successful quarter since its inception in 2018. More than 84% of the processed loans were directed to institutional clients, as demand spiked after bitcoin ETFs were approved in January. Ledn only process loans in bitcoin, Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} and two stablecoins: USDC and USDT.  The institutions participating in this sector now are mostly market makers from both Wall Street and crypto-native companies. ""These are the firms that are operating in the ETF markets as well as spot,"" Di Bartolomeo said. ""Some have made their names in crypto, some in TradFi.""  Bankruptcy paybacks  Another reason users are returning to the lending market is that many of the firms that went bankrupt are starting to give users their money back. Many of them are now returning to the lending market, according to Di Bartolomeo.  When asked why this is the case, he explained that for most of these users, their investment thesis – if you hold them long enough, you will get an appreciation of wealth – has been playing out despite the market downturns. These users were ""kneecapped"" by some bad actors, but as they start to get their assets back, many of the ""hardcore users"" won't likely sell, he said. Di Bartolomeo added that this is when they turn to the lending market to use their assets for borrowing and lending.  ""What I'm seeing is sort of undisputed proof that people want to hold their bitcoin for the long term and also want to have their cake and eat it, too,"" he said. A customer could be worth millions in bitcoin, but if they turn to a TradFi bank, they won't recognize their digital assets as collateral for a loan. ""This is what we [lenders such as Ledn] bridge [the gap] for these customers,"" he added.  Surviving crypto winter  So how did a centralized lender like Ledn survive the crypto winter when many went bankrupt? The short answer is staying true to the lending and borrowing business fundamentals. Ledn only works with qualified and vetted institutions, doesn't have an asset and liability mismatch and doesn't take part in DeFi yield farming, he said. ""That means that if somebody lends to me bitcoin, I lend bitcoin; if somebody lends me a dollar, I lend dollars. There's always a taker. And there's always liquidity,"" Di Bartolomeo said.  He also added that all the lending and borrowing activities are term-matched, meaning if a user lends an asset with seven-day terms, Ledn lends it to another user who can give it back in five, providing liquidity for the assets.  ""People were calling us boring, and we said listen, this is our way: boring, slow and safe,"" he noted.  Read more: Crypto Lenders Caused Crypto Contagion Last Year.

The investment bank said the deal also increases the trading platform’s institutional exposure.  Architect Partners said the price paid for the acquisition was reasonable.  Crypto is becoming an increasingly important part of Robinhood’s (HOOD) business and, despite receiving a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month, the trading platform continues to expand its digital assets business, investment bank Architect Partners said in a Friday report.  The expansion is evidenced by the recent agreement to buy crypto exchange Bitstamp, the bank said. Architect notes that crypto accounted for 20% of Robinhood’s total revenue in first-quarter 2024.  “This acquisition instantly expands global reach to ensure participation regardless of U.S. actions,” the report said.  A Wells Notice is a preliminary warning from the SEC informing a company that the regulator has enough information to bring a potential enforcement action against it. Robinhood received a Wells Notice from the SEC on May 4 due to its listing of crypto tokens that the regulator potentially views as unlicensed securities.  The Bitstamp acquisition will also expand Robinhood’s institutional offering, which positions the trading platform as one of the “few publicly traded crypto-influenced companies that will be able to serve institutions as they come into the digital asset space,” the note said.  Bitstamp is a “prime asset due to its long operation history and global licensing reach,” Architect said, adding that Robinhood acquired the crypto exchange at a reasonable price.  Architect notes that the price paid by Robinhood of $200 million in cash is a significant discount to the $500 million valuation that Bitstamp received in the 2018 majority investment.

Some traders expect buying activity in ether-tracked products to continue, with expectations of the asset reaching the $10,000 price level in 2024.  Crypto investment products took on nearly $2 billion in inflows last week to help extend a five-week run to over $4.3 billion, asset manager CoinShares said in a Monday report.  Trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) rose to $12.8 billion for the week, up 55% from the week prior. Bitcoin led investment activity at over $1.97 billion inflows for the week, while ether (ETH) saw its best week of inflows since March at nearly $70 million.  Buying activity for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has picked up since mid-May after a dismal few weeks in April, which saw days of zero net inflows across all products and even outflows from major products such as BlackRock's IBIT. However, inflows have since picked up - with IBIT becoming the largest bitcoin ETF last week amassing over $20 billion worth of the asset since its January issuance.  “Unusually, inflows were seen across almost all providers, with a continued slowdown in outflows from incumbents,” CoinShares analyst James Butterfill said. “Positive price action saw total assets under management (AuM) rise above the $100 billion mark for the first time since March this year.”  Butterfill added ETH buying was likely in reaction to the surprise SEC decision to allow spot ether ETFs.  Meanwhile, some traders expect the inflows into ETH products to continue in the coming months, with a rally expected toward the end of the year.  “$5-10 billion of fresh capital could be channeled through ether products in the short to medium term,” Ed Hindi, Chief Investment Officer at Tyr Capital, told CoinDesk in a Monday email. “This could fuel an end-of-year rally in ETH and its ecosystem to new record highs.”  “A price target of $10,000 in 2024 is now a reasonable target especially when other supportive factors, like ETH now being deflationary, are taken into consideration,” Hindi added.  In May, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved key regulatory filings tied to ETH ETFs, a historic milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency.  The regulator approved documents for eight ETFs – from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy and BlackRock – for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/10/bitcoin-bags-2b-inflows-ether-sees-highest-institutional-buying-since-march,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0469313dfda8d51565fcec0eeb87746d4b45ae47-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Poised For A Big Move After Major Consolidation,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems poised for a major breakout, if prominent analysts are to be believed. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has been stuck in a consolidation phase for a record-breaking 87 days, but experts say this slumbering giant might be about to awaken with a vengeance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buoyed By Big Money: Whales Gobble More BTC, Signaling Bullish Outlook Charting A Course For Breakout Faibik, a well-known crypto analyst, has identified a technical pattern on the Bitcoin daily chart that hints at a potential explosion. This pattern, known as a Descending Broadening Wedge, suggests a price squeeze that often precedes a significant breakout. Faibik believes that a surge past the crucial $71,000 resistance level would be a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential reversal of the recent downtrend. $BTC Descending Broadening Wedge formation still in Play on the Daily timeframe Chart..📈 Once Bitcoin bulls clinch the 71.3k Crucial Resistance, the Party will start. 🔥🚀 Trust the Process..✍️#Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/gBas14jIDo — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) June 9, 2024 The DBW on the BTC chart is a sign that the price is getting tighter and tighter, explained Faibik in a recent post. This typically leads to a breakout in one direction or another, and based on the current market sentiment, a bullish breakout seems more likely. A Quick Bitcoin Price Overview Using trend lines to connect the three lower highs and three higher lows, the price of bitcoin broke out of the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 4. Nevertheless, the weekly resistance at the $71,280 level refused the breakout. At the $68,500 mark, which is the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern, BTC is now finding support. Bitcoin might rise 7% to reach its all-time high of $73,777 if current support holds. Will Bitcoin Emerge A Bullish Butterfly? Mags, another popular crypto analyst, takes a slightly different approach. He views the current consolidation phase as the longest Bitcoin has ever experienced, surpassing previous periods before significant price increases. The analyst compares this extended consolidation to a butterfly in its chrysalis, suggesting a potential transformation on the horizon. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a pattern of consolidation around all-time highs, followed by a price discovery phase that precedes sharp price movements, the analyst said. The current 87-day consolidation period shatters previous records, potentially indicating a massive price move could be in the offing. Mags highlights prior instances where similar consolidation periods preceded major bull runs. In 2017, for example, Bitcoin consolidated for 48 days before a breakout, while in 2020, the consolidation phase lasted 21 days before a significant price increase. Related Reading: Scalpers Rejoice! Top Analyst Predicts Chainlink (LINK) Short-Term Surge The $71.3k Resistance Level Both Faibik and Mags agree that a breakout from the current consolidation phase could be a game-changer for Bitcoin. They advise investors to keep a close eye on the $71,300 resistance level, as a surge past this point could signal the start of a bullish trend.

The Fed will find it difficult to ignore G7 interest-rate cuts, the trading firm added.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} have lost steam since Friday's hotter-than-expected U.S. jobs data damped hopes for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in September.  The post-report price swoon in the two largest cryptocurrencies offers a good opportunity to pick up bargains, according to QCP Capital, a Singapore-based trading firm.  Friday's non-farm payrolls data showed the U.S. economy added 272,000 jobs in May, way more than the 185,000 estimated and well ahead of April's downwardly revised 165,000. While the jobless rate ticked higher to 4%, average hourly earnings, the sticky inflation component, rose 0.4% month-on-month, above the expectation of a 0.3% rise.  Markets immediately trimmed the probability of a 25 basis-point Fed rate cut in September to 60% from 85%, sending risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, lower. JPMorgan and Citi scrapped forecasts for a Fed rate cut in July, while some observers put rate increases or additional liquidity tightening back on the agenda. Bitcoin, which looked primed for a breakout above $72,000, fell almost 3% to $68,400, according to CoinDesk data. Ether and the CoinDesk 20 index followed bitcoin's lead.  QCP Capital said the Fed will have trouble keeping rates elevated while other central banks reduce borrowing costs.  ""Strong upside surprised on NFP (272K vs 182k), higher payrolls came with higher unemployment (3.9% to 4.0%). It was confusing enough to trigger a risk-off ahead of U.S. inflation numbers and FOMC,"" the firm said in a market update.  ""We agree that this is a good opportunity to buy the dip as the markets will increasingly price in at least one Fed rate cut from here. It will be difficult for the U.S. to ignore as the rest of the world continues to cut rates,"" QCP Capital said.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada cut rates last week, leading the Group of Seven (G7) to start a so-called easing cycle. According to MacroMicro, the number of central banks whose most recent moves have been rate cuts has increased this year.  Other central banks, including the Fed, may soon join the fray in tit-for-tat rate reductions (often called currency wars) as a part of a strategy to manage their burgeoning public debts, inadvertently boosting demand for alternative investments like cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} were little changed over the weekend as open interest and trading volumes slumped after a $400 million leverage flush out on Friday, dampening market momentum.

42417987,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9PB,1718005593,Iggy Azalea Says MOTHER Tokens Can Soon Be Used to Buy Phones,"Iggy Azalea's MOTHER token holders may soon use the cryptocurrency to purchase phones and monthly cell plans from the singer's telecommunications company.  The move follows the launch of a MOTHER merchandise store and is part of a broader effort to increase the cryptocurrency's utility amid a volatile, but overall positive, performance since its introduction last month.  Holders of singer Iggy Azalea’s mother (MOTHER) tokens may soon be able to use the the viral cryptocurrency to pay for phones and services from the Australian rapper's planned telecommunications company, adding utility to a token issued less than a month ago.  The development comes on the back of a MOTHER merchandise store announced last week, which contributed to a rally in the token at the time. MOTHER has advanced 18% in the past 24 hours, outpacing gains in the meme coin sector, DEXTools data shows. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has dropped 0.3%.  “Tomorrow I’m finally relaunching the telecommunication company I co-founded and you will be able to purchase phones, or month to month cell plans using $MOTHER or Sol,” Azalea wrote on X. “Ad campaign n rollout to follow late this week.”  In a follow-up tweet, she said Unreal Mobile is a service provider for the phones and that there would be “a selection of phones for purchase if needed.” The payment infrastructure will be handled by Sphere Labs, which did not offer a native token as of Monday.  Unreal’s plans range from $20 to $80 a month based on data usage and network spectrums, the site shows.  Phones sold by the Solana blockchain proved to be a success, partley because they came with an allocation of BONK tokens. All units of the flagship Saga model sold out in 2023 as sentiment around Solana-based meme tokens grew, eclipsing a dismal launch in 2022. The sales even prompted the announcement and early development of a second Saga phone, which crossed 100,000 in presale orders in February 2024.  The controversial MOTHER, issued as a celebrity meme coin in late May on Solana, saw volatile trading in its first few days as uncertainty around its actual issuer mounted among crypto circles.  The issuance sparked debate among crypto believers, with some voicing concerns that it was a possible cash grab by a celebrity and others saying it showed what broader adoption of tokens could really look like.  As such, Azalea’s continual backing of promises of long-term growth seems to have paid off for early believers as the token’s market valuation grew from under $10 million to over $200 million.",POSITIVE,BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/10/iggy-azalea-says-mother-tokens-can-soon-be-used-to-buy-phones,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdd27e7b55b003277a9abf6484ecdb17b2ab8ff7-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Reveals Ultimate Bias Guide,"In an analysis released to his 280,000 followers on X, the renowned crypto analyst known as Cold Blooded Shiller (@ColdBloodShill) provided an in-depth look at the current state of Bitcoin amidst a volatile market environment. His commentary, titled “Ultimate BTC Simple Bias Guide,” unpacks the recent emotional reactions triggered by Bitcoin’s price movements and offers a strategic framework for interpreting these changes. Buy Or Sell Bitcoin Now? On Friday, the Bitcoin price plummeted from $71,900 to $68,500. This decline coincided with the release of the US Employment Situation Summary Report, a piece of economic data that typically influences market sentiments across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. “It’s very easy to forget that it was simply one red candle on Friday that caused a huge reaction in the emotion of the discussion on Twitter,” Shiller writes, emphasizing the often exaggerated emotional response to single events in the crypto markets. Cold Blooded Shiller’s technical examination of Bitcoin reveals a strong underlying uptrend, despite recent price volatility. However, he identifies critical resistance and support levels that are pivotal to understanding the future movements of Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum On “Path To Acceleration,” CryptoQuant Explains Why The $72,000 price level stands as a major resistance, having thwarted Bitcoin’s upward movement five times, including the most recent rejection last Friday. Shiller elaborates, “We have resistance of the range at $72k,” indicating that a breakout above this level could potentially lead to significant bullish momentum. Conversely, the support levels at $67,000 and subsequently at $61,000 are described as crucial for maintaining the bullish scenario. Shiller warns, “BTC needs to hold the uptrend, if we lose $67k, we’re once again going to be in a downtrend with this being confirmed as a LH [Lower High] and therefore negative market conditions continuing.” The further loss of $61,000 could, according to him, signal the end of the current bullish cycle, with implications that could extend to a broader weekly downtrend. Analyzing the broader market dynamics, Shiller points out the absence of high time frame (HTF) bearish divergences on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a common indicator used to predict potential market reversals. “As a positive, there are no HTF bear divs, which have typically been a strong signal for cycle tops. We’re clean on RSI,” he notes. This observation suggests that despite the testing of critical resistance levels, the market might not yet be at a cyclical peak, providing some reassurance to investors concerned about potential downturns. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Witness 18 Straight Days Of Inflows, Options Traders Eye $100,000 Shiller’s guidance for traders is to maintain a watchful eye on the key price levels that will dictate Bitcoin’s short-term market direction. “The Daily needs to make a fresh high and break $72k; otherwise, it’s at risk of losing the Daily trend below $67k,” he advises, highlighting the importance of these thresholds in shaping market sentiment and trading strategies. This advice suggests that while the broader trend may still support a bullish stance, readiness to pivot based on key technical indicators is crucial. In light of these observations, Shiller advises his followers to use these insights to strategically manage their investment portfolios. The current market conditions, characterized by attempts to break resistance at $72,000 and support holding at key lower levels, imply a tactical approach to investment decisions. Traders and investors are advised to set clear markers for adjusting their positions, preparing for potential shifts in market dynamics that could influence their investment outcomes.

The world’s top cryptocurrency recently surged to within a hair’s breadth of its all-time high, fueled by a buying spree from whales. However, lurking beneath the surface are potential threats that could derail this rally. Related Reading: Scalpers Rejoice! Top Analyst Predicts Chainlink (LINK) Short-Term Surge Whale Appetite Increasing Big investors have been accumulating Bitcoin at an alarming rate, close to $1 billion worth per day according to some estimates. This insatiable appetite suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Analysts point to this whale activity as a bullish indicator, fueling optimism that Bitcoin can break past its previous highs of around $71,000. While you are scared, whales are buying #Bitcoin like never before. pic.twitter.com/QAVXpdWER4 — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) June 8, 2024 The sentiment isn’t isolated to the big leagues. Retail investors, the average person on the street, are also joining the party. The number of addresses holding between 0.01 and 1 BTC has increased, indicating a broadening of interest in the cryptocurrency. This confluence of whale and retail investor enthusiasm, representing millions of users, could propel Bitcoin to new heights. Profit Taking And Short-Term Jitters As the price climbs, a double-edged sword emerges – the MVRV ratio. This metric indicates how much profit holders are sitting on. With Bitcoin nearing its peak, the MVRV ratio has climbed significantly, suggesting many investors are now in profit territory. This profitability can be a blessing and a curse. The allure of locking in gains could entice some holders, potentially millions based on address growth, to sell, creating downward pressure on the price. Related Reading: Cardano Bloodbath? Sell-Off Raises Fears Of Imminent ADA Price Drop Bitcoin Miners Feeling The Squeeze In a related development, Bitcoin miners are dedicating significant computational power to verifying Bitcoin transactions and are rewarded with newly minted coins. However, recent times have seen a decline in miner revenue, with some reports suggesting a drop from $53 million to $48 million in just a few days. If this trend continues, miners may be forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings to stay afloat. This influx of additional coins on the market could further exacerbate selling pressure and hinder the current rally. Bitcoin Price Prediction Meanwhile, according to the latest Bitcoin price prediction, Bitcoin is expected to rise by 28%, reaching $89,300 by July 10, 2024. The market sentiment is bullish, supported by a Fear & Greed Index reading of 72, indicating strong greed. Additionally, Bitcoin has recorded 16 green days out of the last 30, showing a consistent upward trend with a 4.16% price volatility over the same period. The high number of green days and manageable volatility levels suggest a stable market, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This environment appears conducive to further price increases, aligning with the prediction of a significant rise. The sentiment indicators and recent price performance both point to continued optimism among investors.

The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,838 swing high to the $3,574 low. However, there was no close above the $3,700 level. Ethereum is now trading below $3,740 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, ETH might face resistance near the $3,700 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,740 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,838 swing high to the $3,574 low. An upside break above the $3,740 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,800, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,840 level. If the bulls push Ether above the $3,840 level, the price might rise and test the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $4,080 resistance zone. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,740 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,660. The next major support is near the $3,640 zone. The main support sits at $3,580. A clear move below the $3,580 support might push the price toward $3,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,450 level in the near term.
