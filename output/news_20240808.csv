32206330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634077,1723161508,"Dogecoin Price Looking Stronger – ‘Expect Massive Gains’, Analyst Predicts","Currently at a turning point is Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but has lately attracted the interest of traders. Analysts and investors are keenly observing its price movements, if it can overcome a significant barrier. The $0.10 mark has emerged as an interesting number as some analysts think it will set in motion the meme coin to a fresh positive phase. Related Reading: Polkadot Developments Show Strength, Despite Coin’s 18% Loss A recent examination by Crypto Daily Trades Signals indicates that Dogecoin has demonstrated amazing endurance, especially when it recovers from critical support levels. According to Crypto Daily Trades, DOGE is now looking stronger and emerging from key support levels. He said “$0.10 Is a key area for us now. Since the bottom DOGE is up about 15%.” Popular crypto analysis tool Coincheckup, on the other hand, also emphasizes the significance of the $0.10 level and notes it as a possible starting point for further developments. Now the issue is if DOGE can maintain its speed and reach this threshold, therefore enabling notable price increase. $DOGE is looking stronger and coming up from Key Support levels. $0.10 Is a key area for us now. Since the bottom DOGE is up about 15%. Expect massive gains once we break $0.10 cents pic.twitter.com/Hrk9QwXuAx — Crypto Daily Trade Signals (@cryptodailyTS) August 7, 2024 $0.10: The Critical Threshold For Dogecoin, the $0.10 price point has become a critical threshold that both acts as a psychological barrier and a main gauge of future development capacity. Analysts at Coincheckup advise breaking over this level might cause a strong upward trend, maybe resulting in significant increases for DOGE investors. Market watchers’ identification of a triangular breakout pattern adds even more evidence for a positive surge’s probability. Still, landing $0.10 will not be without difficulties. The market is still erratic, hence even if Dogecoin has shown tenacity, it has to overcome this opposition if it is to keep on its upward path. A good break over this key level might signal the start of a new growth phase, therefore strengthening Dogecoin’s place in the larger crypto scene. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.09999, 0.8% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a 17.1% decline in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Investor Sentiment And Market Influence The coin’s capacity to remain consistent in times of market downturns has given it a reputation as a “rugged” digital asset capable of withstanding volatility. This resiliency has inspired expectations that DOGE is headed for future expansion, particularly if it can keep up its present upward tendency. The direction ahead for Dogecoin will be much influenced by market dynamics. The wider cryptocurrency market has been characterized by uncertainty; several digital assets show significant price movements. Dogecoin has shown really good performance in spite of these factors, suggesting that it could be less influenced by more general market developments. DOGE is under intense observation by Coincheckup and other experts; many of them believe that a breakthrough over $0.10 would cause more purchasing demand and higher prices.

This implies that even if Dogecoin may keep increasing, it might run up against some obstacles at important psychological levels. Investors should be advised of the possibility for consolidation when the price of Dogecoin approaches these benchmarks. Still, the general attitude is positive; DOGE is a cryptocurrency worth keeping careful attention in the next weeks.

32204495,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634035,1723158035,Solana Faces Uncertainty: Expert Explains Impact Of Jump’s Rumored Exit,"Solana, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market experienced a tumultuous start to the week, with one of the most severe price crashes since the collapse of FTX. While macroeconomic factors were primarily responsible for this downturn, substantial sell orders from Jump Crypto, a division of the prominent Chicago-based quantitative trading firm Jump Trading Group, also played a significant role. In the 10 days leading up to the crash, Jump Trading transferred $277 million worth of ETH to various exchanges, significantly intensifying selling pressure across the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Jump Trading liquidated 11,500 ETH (valued at approximately $29 million) from its holdings in Lido Finance, further contributing to its extensive sell-off. This aggressive selling activity by Jump Trading has sparked widespread speculation regarding the firm’s potential full-scale withdrawal from the crypto sector. What Jump’s Rumored Exit Could Mean For Solana These movements have ignited speculation within the community regarding Jump’s potential withdrawal from the sector, a scenario that could have profound implications for specific projects, especially Solana. Jump Crypto has been deeply involved with Solana, not least through its development of the Firedancer validator client, which is set to become one of the most crucial components of the Solana network infrastructure in the near future. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Jumps 39% From Crash Low, But Is This Rally Sustainable? Jonah van Bourg, a crypto analyst and host of the 1000x podcast, has provided an exposition on what the rumored exit of Jump’s crypto activities could mean for Solana. Van Bourg explains, “Jump’s rumored exit will impact Solana and Firedancer. Here’s my take: Jump would not build Firedancer for free. Based on what I have heard, I think it’s reasonable to assume that Jump received millions of units of locked SOL as compensation for their multiyear effort building a complex validator client.” The implications of Jump’s potential exit are multifaceted. Van Bourg suggests that despite the rumors, Jump is unlikely to completely sever ties with Firedancer or Solana immediately due to the “megacontracts” involved that include extensive legal documentation. This suggests a structured, rather than abrupt, transition, which may stabilize immediate impacts but introduces long-term uncertainties. “In other words, Jump can’t (and shouldn’t) walk away. Thus, Jump will probably continue to develop & support Firedancer for some time,” Van Bourg adds. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bounces 30% Amid Market Recovery, Analysts Remain Bullish Furthermore, the expert speculates on the financial motivations underlying Jump’s future involvement, “They will not be doing so out of an altruistic desire to design the decentralized utopia of the future, as Mustache Warrior would often claim (in an insult to everyone’s intelligence). Instead, this is unquestionably about vesting 8-10 figures worth of compensation.” Despite this, Van Bourg remains bullish on Solana in the near term, suggesting that fears of a massive sell-off by Jump are overblown. “I am not worried about Jump unloading their mammoth position anytime soon. I remain bullish SOL and have been accumulating on dips for some time,” he declares. Yet, he also pragmatically acknowledges the possibility of Jump reducing its position strategically post-Firedancer contract expiration, “once the Firedancer contract sunsets, it would be irrational to assume that an economic actor as savvy as Jump wouldn’t exit their length, especially at higher prices. This is precisely what they [probably] just did with their ETH and ETH ecosystem deals.” At press time, SOL traded at $154.17.

SEC Lawsuit Ends: Will The XRP Price Cross $3 Once More?,"The long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple finally concluded following Judge Analisa Torres’ judgment on August 7. With the lawsuit out of the way, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto predicts that the XRP price could soon surpass its all-time high (ATH). XRP Price Is Set For A “Mega Run” To New ATH CrediBULL Crypto mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the stage is set for an “inevitable mega run for XRP. The analyst added that XRP hitting a new ATH is a matter of when and not if. XRP’s current ATH stands at $3.84, meaning the crypto token could rise above this price level soon. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Bottom Is Not In, Will Price Crash Below $50,000 Again? Before now, crypto analysts like RLinda had highlighted the conclusion of the case between the SEC and Ripple as one of the catalysts that could spark a massive rally for XRP. She asserted that this event would give XRP a “second life” to achieve a successful breakout above critical resistance levels. Crypto analyst JackTheRippler predicted that XRP would rise to as high as $100 once the case between the SEC and Rippled ended. Crypto analyst Common Sense Crypto also alluded to the lawsuit while outlining why XRP can reach $100. The analyst suggested that the conclusion of the case will lead to the launch of a Spot XRP ETF, which can spark such a parabolic rally for XRP. This lawsuit began in December 2020 and is believed to have hindered XRP’s growth, especially during the 2021 bull run when the crypto token failed to record significant gains or even close to breaking its ATH. However, that looks set to change as Judge Torres’ judgment has ended the lawsuit, at least for now, with an appeal still a possibility. Judge Torres declared a $125 million penalty against Ripple for violating securities laws and an injunction against future violations. However, the $125 million is way below the almost $2 billion fine the SEC initially proposed. The court also ruled that the SEC cannot bar Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) sales. XRP Is Just Getting Started Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that XRP’s current rally following the court’s ruling is just getting started while urging market participants to get ready for the “real fun.” Whatever happens, XRP holders will hope that the excitement about the end of the lawsuit can help send XRP above $1 in the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Following Crash Below $0.1 Such a move will undoubtedly boost the confidence of these investors that XRP can reach the projected heights that these analysts say it will attain. It is worth mentioning that XRP failed to break the $1 resistance when Judge Torres declared last year that the crypto token wasn’t a security. As such, XRP’s price action will be one to watch. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.60, up over 18% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417471,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYYzF,1723152981,Bitcoin Miner With Celsius Assets Delays IPO After Losing CEO and Auditor,"UPDATE (Aug. 9, 13:26 UTC): Updated throughout to note that RSM said it is no longer auditing publicly traded miners, in contrast to Ionic's claim that the firm ceased auditing the entire cryptocurrency sector.  Ionic Digital, the bitcoin miner that bought bankrupt crypto lender Celsius' mining assets, has delayed a plan to go public after losing its CEO and auditor.  Former CEO Matt Prusak told the company in July he won't stay on after the end of his employment term on Aug. 14, the miner said in a statement Thursday. Ionic has started searching for a new CEO and named its recently hired CFO, John Penver, the interim boss.  Penver was hired in July to shepherd the company's plan to go public. Ionic said that despite the leadership change, it still intends to do an initial public offering and is ""confident"" that Penver will be able to lead the company to that goal.  How long it will take is another matter.  Ionic also said its auditor, RSM US, severed ties with the miner, citing a strategic decision by the accounting firm to ""disengage from all audit engagements with companies in the cryptocurrency sector."" However, RSM told CoinDesk that it will no longer audit publicly traded digital asset mining companies, but that it is not dropping the whole crypto sector. The auditor will still offer its services to privately held crypto-related firms, a spokesperson said.  ""RSM's decision was not a result of any disagreements with the Company on accounting principles, practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,"" Ionic said in its statement, adding that it has made good progress in finding a replacement.  Ionic came out of stealth earlier this year. At the time the miner said it would acquire all of Celsius' mining assets as part of the bankrupt lender's emergence from Chapter 11 and that it would go public within 12 months.  Getting dumped by RSM has thrown a wrench in the works. ""The temporary absence of an auditor has prevented the Company from being able to update its SEC filings, which in turn has delayed Ionic Digital's efforts to become a public reporting company,"" the statement added, without giving a revised timeline.  News the of delay comes at a time when the mining landscape has become more competitive after the recent Bitcoin halving, which cut the block rewards paid regularly to miners by half.  The availability of spot bitcoin exchange traded-funds (ETFs) have also deterred many investors from the mining industry, shutting some doors to capital for miners. This has put pressure on some companies trying to take their firms public.  Most recently, bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, which planned to go public, canceled its IPO, discontinued its hosted mining business and cut staff across several units, citing reduced revenues.

42417493,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYZDh,1723152130,Careers in Crypto: 5 Insights for 2024,"1. The Crypto Job Market is Hot  This headline may be an understatement. A recently posted job on LinkedIn for a Crypto Product Marketing Manager received more than 500 applicants in just five days.  As Web3 becomes more mainstream, there is an incredible uptick in the demand for roles in crypto and blockchain companies. While this demand will only continue to grow, there is also a positive trend in companies growing their teams. Crypto Jobs List, a jobs board, recorded about 600 new crypto and blockchain job listings in the month of July 2024.  The reason for the crazy job market? It could be a sprint after a long bear market for many industry professionals (the ones that made it through) and their excitement to get the flywheel moving again while productivity and funding is on the rise. The increased adoption of crypto and blockchain is also contributing to the increased supply of people looking to be involved. As mentioned before, all the money flowing into the space after many years of withholding investing in crypto after the FTX scandal has created an ideal opportunity for founders to hire the top talent they need.  2. A Lack of Good Product & Marketing Talent  Crypto Twitter has expressed a clear lack of true talent in the product and marketing departments.  The challenge with product and marketing in a young industry is the lack of quality of candidates that have put in the time and proven their worth. There are many young and hungry people in the space that are “doers,” but how can we prove they will get the job done when they can’t get to the next level in the first place?  There also may be a gap in technical skills as we have a lot of product and marketing professionals dipping in from other industries, as companies prefer experience to technical knowledge.  Internal recruitment teams and founding teams are struggling to find people that are reputable and trustworthy to execute on the responsibilities of their role.  Perhaps there are contests that can be held to prove innovation capabilities and strategy for product and marketing, but how can one prove they will execute long term without a track record? Hence, the vicious cycle and why executives are cherry picking from other industries.  3. VC Funding Effects on Hiring  The funds are flowing to crypto companies and the data shows. According to PitchBook data, crypto focused VCs shelled out $2.01 billion in the first three months of 2024, already surpassing the $1.9 billion raised in the entirety of 2023.  This has created a direct boost in the demand for hiring as companies are trying to reach those goals and bring those products to market.  As funding continues to flow, we hope to see a continued hiring streak and, in the meantime, we can all work on polishing the talent in the crypto market to get people where they need to go. The sentiment and hope for companies to deliver on the products and services they promise is high and we need the people power to get it done.  4. Institutions Building Out Their Digital Asset Teams  Many of the large financial institutions have been or are beginning to build out their digital asset and blockchain departments. These teams are quietly growing, but the general timeline for institutional adoption feels further out per the Crypto Summit 2024 hosted by Coinbase.  But the largest financial institutions are getting involved, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Swedish Central Banks, HSBC, State Street and Morgan Stanley.  Although full institutional adoption is far out, the growth is happening and we will see how this evolves over the years, hopefully increasing the supply of blockchain job opportunities.  5. Finding Your Next Role in Crypto  The job market is very difficult right now. It’s crowded, people are scrambling for jobs, and companies are scouring the field for the right people.  Job seekers: Less is more. Focus on a few jobs you are highly qualified for and passionate about. Tailor your resumes to the roles you are applying for. Make it easy for hiring managers to immediately understand that you are a perfect fit for the opportunity at hand.  Hiring managers: Invest in employer branding, make sure your marketing team is active on LinkedIn, and you have relationships with recruiters that work with the best people in the industry. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Ben Horowitz have all emphasized the importance of hiring the best people. In markets like this, lean on experts to help you get to the right people.  Job seekers: Keep your head up and keep digging. Work on your skills and personal development in the meantime.  The job market is crazy, so give yourself some grace. Personalization is more important than ever in this world flooded with AI and people desperate for opportunity. Lean on personal connections, reach out to The Crypto Recruiters for open roles, and build that personal brand.

Related Reading: Aave Protocol Unfazed By Market Jitters, Surges 21% Bitcoin SV is a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash which is also a fork of Bitcoin itself. BSV, however, has traits unique to itself, unlike its close cousins that make it more attractive to businesses. Solving Real World Problems With On-Chain Solutions President of the Blockchain Association Uganda Reginald Tumusiime discussed his organization’s project, the KitePesa, a stablecoin backed by the Ugandan shilling. According to him, most of the countries in Subsaharan Africa have been exploring central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects as a form of currency. This institutional interest in blockchain tech and stablecoins are the factors that KitePesa will leverage for further development. The project has its merits. The Ugandan people have been switching to digital banking which offers the same features as traditional banks but with convenience as mobile phones become more and more prevalent. In 2023, customers of mobile money providers reached 42.9 million with the figure expected to rise in the coming decades. KitePesa will leverage institutional interest to build a reliable blockchain infrastructure that operates and functions much better than traditional mobile money networks. With Uganda’s robust regulatory framework regarding payments and the technologies involved, KitePesa has regulatory backing to operate in a legal environment. The project will be launched on the BSV Blockchain, integrating the somewhat local project into the international market which may invest as they see potential in KitePesa. Continuation Rally Might Happen At These Levels BSV could be faced with a breakthrough and is attempting to settle between $40.29 and $45.30. If the bulls are successful in taking this position, we might see further upward movement in the coming days or weeks. However, the market still has its doubts with the total market cap of the crypto market seeing a measly 0.2% gain in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin and Ethereum recover at a snail’s pace. In private equity, indices, futures, and commodities are experiencing hiccups as the market expects more volatility ahead and after the release of several macro indicators.

But this move is still highly dependent on the broader market’s movement that is currently grinding to a halt.

Hopes for Donald Trump's crypto aspirations were kindled earlier this week when Eric Trump, his son, tweeted that he has ""fallen in love with Crypto / DeFi. Stay tuned for a big announcement."" Then on Thursday, Restore the Republic began trading, soaring to a $155 million market capitalization just hours after launch.  Ryan Fournier, conservative activist and chair of Students for Trump, amplified the hearsay, saying that ""rumor has it that the official trump coin is out...called Restore the Republic."" That post on X has since been deleted.  Subsequently, Eric Trump popped the bubble and chaos ensued. He warned users of ""fake tokens"" and said that the ""only official Trump project has not been announced."" The post sent RTR spiraling. It fell 95% from its peak price.  ""I was told by sources that Don Jr. would be backing this token,"" Fournier posted on X on Thursday. ""That is why I said rumor. I'm not a big crypto guy and I was not in any way involved in this project.""  Crypto observers also pointed to evidence that Kanpai Labs, the entity behind the Kanpai Pandas non-fungible tokens (NFT), boosted the token with advertisements prior to the launch.  Bags, the pseudonymous creator of Kanpai, said the Trump family picked the launch date then ""hard rugged us."" That post was deleted soon after.  Blockchain data shows that early investors, or insiders, made $4 million of profits in six hours on the token's rise and fall, onchain sleuth Lookonchain found. Five crypto wallets bought 105 million of RTR with $882,000 worth of SOL, then sold 95 million tokens for $5 million in SOL.  The debacle underscores the wild west nature of the burgeoning memecoin market, where grifts and rug pulls abound. Recently, another Trump-themed token DJT was in the spotlight as Martin Shkreli claimed that he and Donald Trump's son Barron created the token. DJT tanked 90% last week as a large token holder appeared to sell en masse.  The episode also highlights Donald Trump's sway among crypto enthusiasts. Analytics firm LunarCrush said that there are currently 162 Trump or MAGA (the shortened version of Trump's famous campaign slogan: Make America Great Again) crypto tokens, up from 111 two weeks ago.

Both tokens have shown remarkable potential, but how do they compare in terms of profitability and future prospects? Market experts weigh in on the performance and potential of these two 100X titans. Ripple’s Recent Surge and Future Outlook In a landmark decision, Ripple Labs scored a significant victory against the SEC, with the court ruling that Ripple (XRP) is not a security. This ruling has been a major win for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency community, boosting investor confidence and causing a sharp increase in XRP’s price. Despite a $125 million fine imposed on Ripple, the outcome was much more favorable than the SEC’s initial $2 billion demand. XRP’s Temporary Rebound Following the favorable court ruling, XRP witnessed a “dead cat bounce,” surging by 9% in the past 24 hours. However, on-chain data indicates that this rally may be short-lived. Analysts highlight a negative price-daily active address (DAA) divergence and a high market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, suggesting that the recent surge might not be sustainable. Market Sentiment and Price Predictions Despite the temporary rebound, market experts predict further declines for Ripple (XRP). The current market value of XRP stands at $0.614531 with a market cap of $34.41 billion. Analysts caution that the positive MVRV ratio could lead to increased selling pressure, potentially pushing XRP’s price down to $0.50 or lower in the short term. However, if demand increases, XRP could see a rise to $0.52. MPEPE’s Explosive Growth Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been making headlines with its impressive presale performance, raising $667,870 and selling 788,176,961 tokens at a price of $0.00107 USDT each. Investors are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) due to its strong market presence and promising returns. The token has surged by 310%, highlighting its potential for substantial gains. While XRP has a longer history and broader market recognition, MPEPE’s recent performance has caught the attention of many investors. The innovative features and strategic marketing of Mpeppe (MPEPE) have positioned it as a strong contender in the meme coin sector. Unlike XRP, which is currently facing regulatory challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh and unencumbered investment opportunity . Conclusion: A Comparison of Titans XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique advantages and potential for significant returns. XRP’s recent legal victory provides a boost, but its future is still clouded by regulatory challenges and market volatility. In contrast, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) explosive growth and strong market performance present a fresh and promising investment opportunity. Meanwhile, PEPU’s innovative use of Layer-2 technology and successful fundraising efforts position it as a strong contender in the meme coin market. For investors seeking substantial gains, diversifying across these tokens could provide a balanced approach to capitalizing on the current market dynamics.

The fund hopes to outperform the price of bitcoin through its investments by buying it for a discount through allocations like this.  OneMedNet (ONMD) late last month raised $4.6 million in a private placement and used $1.8 million of the proceeds to purchase bitcoin {{BTC}}, according to a press release.  Among the investors was Off The Chain Capital, a crypto investment fund with ties to Bloq Chairman Matthew Roszak and Fortress founder Rob Kauffman, which purchased a combination of shares and warrants in ONMD.  OneMedNet has seen its stock price fall more than 90% since it came public via a SPAC deal late last year.  “It’s an opportunity that if it works correctly, it can outperform bitcoin’s performance,” Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital told CoinDesk. “From our goal as an investor, we’re looking for these discount or value opportunities and we work really hard to try to outperform bitcoin.”  Dixon believes that it is crucial for public companies to reinvest some of their cash into bitcoin, rather than real estate, stocks or bonds, in order to add the most shareholder value.  “I think more and more public companies are going to wake up to the fact that if you don’t have bitcoin on your balance sheet, you’re not being intelligent as a fiduciary to that additional cash flow you have in terms of where you allocate this part of your treasury reserve strategy,"" he said.  In this, Off the Chain and OneMedNet is making a similar argument to that of Michael Saylor, whose MicroStrategy (MSTR) has seen its stock price outperform the return of bitcoin since the company began adding the crypto to its balance sheet in August 2020.

32198209,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634166,1723146133,Millions To Be Made With Mpeppe Whilst Dogecoin’s Performance Dips,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, new players continually emerge, challenging the dominance of established coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is one such newcomer, poised to offer substantial gains for investors, even as Dogecoin (DOGE) faces a period of decline. Let’s delve into why Mpeppe is capturing investor interest and what it offers that Dogecoin currently lacks. Current State of Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite in the meme coin sector, enjoying massive popularity, especially with endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. As of today, Dogecoin is trading at $0.100022 with a market cap of $14.55 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $928.01 million. Despite this impressive liquidity, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a 1.67% dip in the last 24 hours and an 8% drop over the past week, bringing its price to $0.096. This downturn has caused concern among investors, even though some analysts remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. Bullish Predictions Amidst Market Volatility Analyst Alan Santana recently suggested that Dogecoin (DOGE) could reach new highs, potentially hitting $2.55 by 2025. He points out that the optimal accumulation zone for DOGE is between $0.053 and $0.065, indicating that current prices might represent a buying opportunity. Santana’s prediction hinges on the assumption that Dogecoin will rebound significantly, potentially offering a 26-fold increase from its current levels. However, such forecasts should be approached with caution, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its unpredictability. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Rising Star While Dogecoin (DOGE) faces its challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a promising investment with the potential to deliver substantial returns. Priced at just $0.00107 during its ICO, Mpeppe offers an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Here are some reasons why Mpeppe is gaining traction: Innovative Features and Real-World Utility Mpeppe sets itself apart from other meme coins through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and gaming applications.

Security and Investor Confidence In contrast to the cautionary tales surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE), such as the recent warning from Shiba Inu (SHIB) Scam Alerts about potential scams within the Shiba Inu community, Mpeppe emphasizes security and transparency. The Shiba Inu community has been advised to verify all information through official channels to avoid falling victim to scams related to the much-anticipated TREAT token. This focus on security is something that Mpeppe aims to uphold, ensuring that its investors can trust in the project’s legitimacy and safety.

Two of the most talked-about presale tokens today are Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These tokens are generating buzz for their unique features and potential for massive returns. Let’s dive into what sets these two apart and why investors are eyeing them as potential 100x gainers. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A Rising Star Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has taken the crypto world by storm, particularly within the meme coin sector. Having just recently launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has already raised an impressive $7.6 million. This rapid growth indicates strong investor confidence and interest in the project. Key Features of PEPU High Staking Rewards: One of the standout features of PEPU is its staking pool, which offers an annual return of 256% in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) tokens. This high yield has attracted many investors, with 625 million tokens already staked. Strong Community Growth: PEPU’s social media presence has exploded, with over 15,000 followers on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram. This growing community is a testament to the token’s increasing popularity. Innovative Technology: Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is set to launch its own Layer-2 solution, making it the first Pepe coin to achieve this. This new blockchain promises to be 100 times faster and more cost-effective than Ethereum, while still maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum network. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Gambling Utility Token Mpeppe (MPEPE) is another presale token that has garnered significant attention. Unlike many meme coins, MPEPE offers real-world utility, particularly in the gambling sector. This unique positioning gives it a strong edge in the market. Key Features of MPEPE Real-World Utility: Mpeppe’s integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms provides it with tangible value, distinguishing it from purely speculative tokens. Community Support: Similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Mpeppe has cultivated a strong and growing community of supporters who believe in the project’s vision and potential. Presale Success: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently priced at $0.00107 during its presale, presenting an attractive entry point for early investors. The presale has already seen substantial participation, indicating strong market interest. Comparative Analysis: PEPU vs. MPEPE Both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised for significant growth, but they cater to slightly different investor interests. PEPU appeals to those looking for high staking rewards and innovative blockchain solutions, while MPEPE attracts investors with its practical applications in the gambling sector. The Future of Meme Coins: What Experts Say The rise of PEPU and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market where new and innovative tokens are challenging established players like Dogecoin (DOGE). Despite DOGE’s recent performance dips, some analysts are still bullish on its long-term potential. For instance, Jaxon Gaines from Watcher Guru suggests that Dogecoin could hit $2.55 by 2025, a significant increase from its current price of $0.100022. This prediction, however, remains speculative and dependent on various market factors. Security and Community Concerns While both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) show promise, it’s crucial for investors to stay vigilant. Recently, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community received a warning about potential scams surrounding the much-anticipated TREAT token. This serves as a reminder for all crypto investors to verify information through official channels and remain cautious of fraudulent schemes. Conclusion Both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present exciting opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. While PEPU impresses with its staking rewards and technological advancements, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out with its practical utility in the gambling industry. As always, investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks before diving into these promising presale tokens.

This new entrant is set to rival Shiba Inu (SHIB) as one of the top gainers of 2024. As Shiba Inu navigates through market challenges and security warnings, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the attention of investors with its promising prospects. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Security Alert Recently, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, known as the SHIB Army, received an important security warning. Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a Shiba Inu-focused X account, issued a cautionary message to the community. The warning emphasized that the much-anticipated TREAT token has not yet been launched. The alert highlighted the risks posed by bad actors who exploit the excitement and anticipation within the community by creating fake tokens and misleading investors. Key Safety Tips for Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders To ensure the safety of their assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are advised to follow key safety tips: Official Information: Always seek official information from Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) official website and channels within the ecosystem. Beware of Misinformation: Cross-check facts with reliable and official sources to avoid falling prey to scams. Wait for Official Announcements: Do not engage with any assets claiming to be TREAT or SHI unless they are officially announced and released. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Promising New ICO In contrast to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a promising new ICO.

The current presale stage has already garnered significant interest, with a substantial portion of tokens sold.

Despite a substantial increase in its burn rate—up by 300.52% with 1,097,520 tokens burned in 24 hours—SHIB’s price remains sluggish. As of now, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at $0.00001337, a drop that has pushed it behind Avalanche and Tron in market capitalization. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) Market Entry Mpeppe (MPEPE) has entered the market with strong momentum. The early stages of its ICO have been met with enthusiasm, reflecting a high level of investor confidence. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B.

Based on his analysis, a 1,100% price surge is already in the works for this altcoin. JASMY To Surge By Over 1,100% Marks predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that JASMY will surge by over 1,100% soon enough. The analyst was confident about the altcoin enjoying such a price rally, noting how every pullback for JASMY since its breakout has supported further bullish movement for the token. He also noted how JASMY has continued to hold a bull pattern at its current price levels. Related Reading: XRP Prediction: Analyst Says Bullish Divergences Are Still Present, Here’s Why In line with this, Marks stated that a significant continuation of this bullish movement with a potential 1,110% upside to reach the price target of $0.2785 is already on the horizon. JASMY has already come a long way in this market cycle, and the analyst highlighted that, noting how the altcoin was at some point 7,350% away from this price target of $0.2785. JASMY is one of the best-performing assets among the top 100 crypto tokens by market cap, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 220%. Commonly referred to as Japan’s Bitcoin, JASMY has benefitted from the artificial intelligence (AI) hype, which is one of the leading narratives in this market cycle. JASMY is the utility coin of Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, which provides secure data transactions and storage for IoT devices. JASMY has also witnessed impressive growth thanks to some bullish fundamentals since the start of the year, including the launch of JANCTION AI, a layer-2 network designed to host decentralized AI applications. Meanwhile, there were earlier rumors that JASMY had secured a partnership with Apple to help integrate Japan’s My Number Card system into iPhones in the country. Altcoin Under The Spotlight Besides Marks, JASMY has caught the attention of other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa. Altcoin Sherpa once mentioned it as one of the altcoins to keep an eye on, stating how the coin was “extremely strong” as it didn’t budge following the pullbacks that the crypto market experienced. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Bottom Is Not In, Will Price Crash Below $50,000 Again? Altcoin Sherpa also suggested that JASMY could rise to $0.067, although he didn’t state when exactly this would happen. Crypto analyst AltCryptoTalk also recently analyzed the altcoin and stated that the bulls should kick in soon as JASMY holds above $0.0125. These bulls already look to have taken an interest in the altcoins, with crypto analyst Steph stating that JASMY’s current weekly candle looks “extremely bullish” and indicates a huge buying pressure for the crypto token. According to CoinMarketCap data, JASMY is trading at around $0.0214 at the time of writing, down over 2% in the last 24 hours.

32194942,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634011,1723140015,"Polkadot (DOT) Bulls Push Toward $4.8 Resistance, Breakout Ahead?","Polkadot (DOT) has been gaining significant bullish momentum, with its price steadily approaching the critical resistance level of $4.8. This upward movement suggests a strong presence of positive sentiment in the market. As DOT nears this key resistance, speculations are about whether the bulls can maintain their dominance and drive the price higher. A successful breakout above $4.8 could signal the beginning of a new bullish phase, potentially leading to further gains. However, failure to break this level might result in a pullback. This article analyzes DOT’s recent price action and its approach to the critical $4.8 resistance level. With the help of technical indicators, it will evaluate the significance of this resistance, assess market sentiment, and predict potential future movements, including the likelihood of a breakout. DOT was trading at around $4.73 and has increased by over 3.58% with a market capitalization of over $6.9 billion and a trading volume of over $200 Million as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has increased by more than 3.61%, while its trading volume has increased by more than 7.46% Market Sentiment: Are Bulls In Control? Currently, the price of DOT on the 4-hour chart has been on a bullish move following a rejection at the $3.5 support mark. It is now advancing toward the $4.8 resistance mark and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Since breaching this key resistance level, the digital asset has shown a consistent upward trend, indicating that the bulls are gaining control and could drive the price even higher. Additionally, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator has successfully risen above 50% and is currently heading to 60%, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing and the asset might experience further upward movement. On the 1-day chart, although DOT is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it has successfully printed three bullish momentum candlesticks approaching the $4.8 resistance level. This indicates that the bulls remain in control, which could help trigger a rally for DOT. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is ascending from the oversold zone toward 50%, further supporting the potential for a continued rally and indicating that the bulls are gaining control over the bears. Conclusion: Will DOT Break Through Or Face Rejection? In conclusion, as DOT’s price approaches the $4.8 resistance level, it could either break through or encounter a rejection. A breakthrough above the $4.8 resistance level, DOT might continue its bullish move to challenge the $6.2 resistance level. Once it breaks below this range, the digital asset may move further to test the $7.7 level and probably other key levels afterwards. Meanwhile, if DOT encounters rejection at the $4.8 resistance level, it may start to decline toward the $3.5 support level. Should the price fall below this support, it could drop more to test the $1.9 support point, potentially creating a new low if this level is breached.

Bitcoin advanced 6.4% over the past 24 hours, currently changing hands at $59,500. Ether {{ETH}} topped $2,600, up 8.8% during the same period, snapping its losing streak against BTC.  The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index also booked similar gains, with altcoin majors solana {{SOL}}, near {{NEAR}}, avalanche {{AVAX}} and filecoin {{FIL}} up nearly 10%.  Ripple's XRP ran hottest with its 22% surge, driven by optimism on a fresh court decision in a long-running case that weighed on the token's price. Investors were upbeat that a U.S. court ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine for violating securities laws, a much smaller fine than the $2 billion the Securities and Exchange Commission requested.  Read more: XRP Jumps 17%, Beating Bitcoin Gains, as Ripple-SEC Case Ends  Market observers pointed to two favorable developments that supported the rally in bitcoin and crypto prices.  A U.S. judge approved on Thursday that FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research will pay out $12.7 billion to creditors. Many hope that part of the funds will flow back to crypto markets as former users reinvest the proceedings in digital assets.  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill that legalizes crypto mining in the country. ""Russia seems to be acting to keep up with the US. Nation-level bitcoin FOMO (fear of missing out) is heating up,"" said Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant. ""Their entry will boost the hashrate, strengthen network fundamentals, and diversify miner politics.""  With today's gain, bitcoin has now completely reversed its weekly candle that wicked to as low as $49,000 early Monday to positive.  While there's plenty of time until Sunday's weekly close, if BTC finishes the week around the current prices, it would form a hammer candlestick. That's a bullish chart pattern in technical analysis that often appears at the bottom of downtrends, hinting at a trend reversal.  Some analysts, however, warned that future price action could be choppy.  Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, noted that BTC reached its 200-day moving average cloud that could act as a resistance, arresting the rally.  ""I'm hopeful that we can break above this level, but I'm not ignorant to the fact that it can just as easily act as resistance,"" he said. ""Bullish if we break and close above it.""  Cryptocurrencies rarely rebound in a straight line after capitulation events such as Monday's crash, K33 Research analyst David Zimmerman pointed out.  ""V-shaped recoveries are not the norm, there is no need to rush into new positions,"" said Zimmerman. ""The prices within these wicks are usually revisited, and looking to get positioned into coins showing relative strength during this time is the focus.""

The positioning in the BTC futures market and macro concerns are keeping the bank cautious on digital assets.  The catalysts that could drive the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} and broader cryptocurrency markets higher are mostly factored in, said banking giant JPMorgan.  Digital assets prices saw their biggest selloff since the 2022 FTX implosion earlier this week, mostly driven by contagion in traditional markets, with bitcoin falling more than 15% before rebounding somewhat, the bank's analysts wrote. The selloff in crypto was mostly driven by retail investors, while momentum traders also contributed by exiting their long positions and building shorts, the bank said.  The swift correction started after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate last week, leading to a stronger yen and the unwinding of the ""carry trade"" - a strategy in which traders borrowed money in the low interest rate yen to speculate in higher-yielding assets. While both traditional and digital asset markets have since stabilized, many traders remain concerned.  Meanwhile, there has been limited to no ""de-risking"" from the institutional investors in the bitcoin futures market, which shows limited open interest and sideways action over the spot price spread, the analysts said.  The JPMorgan team noted that there are few catalysts that could keep institutional investors optimistic on bitcoin and crypto sector, including Morgan Stanley wealth advisors offering crypto to their clients, bankruptcy paybacks being almost over, and both political parties in the U.S. pointing towards favorable regulations.  However, those positive catalysts seem already priced into the current price of digital assets, the bank said. ""With limited de-risking in the CME bitcoin futures space and with equity markets still looking vulnerable ... we remain cautious on crypto market despite the recent correction.""  The cautious note from JPMorgan isn't new, as the bank has recently said that any rebound in crypto markets in the near term is likely to be short-lived as bitcoin price is still too high relative to its production cost and versus gold.  The bank's analysts currently estimate that the average production cost for mining bitcoin is around $49,000, and any price action below this level would pressure the miners, weighing further on BTC price.

That service was highlighted in the enforcement action.  A spokesman for the bank didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Under the order, the bank has to soon provide the Fed a series of written plans and a new approach to compliance, including an agreement to ""ensure that the Bank collects, analyzes, and retains complete and accurate information for all customers."" The bank must notify the Fed 30 days in advance of taking on ""any new strategic initiative, product, service, or relationship with third parties related to the digital asset strategy.""  The Fed noted that Customers ""has begun to take measures to address the identified deficiencies.""  The agencies that oversee banking in the U.S. – the Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. – have previously issued guidance to banks meant to limit their exposure to the crypto sector. Last year, the Fed said it was revamping its own digital assets approach, having its new “novel activities supervision program” – with specialized experts – help the regular banking supervisors monitor the overlap of the crypto sector with the banking system.

According to CoinGecko, XLM shifted upwards by almost 10% gaining in an environment where the majority of altcoins are still experiencing pain.

In an interview with Stellar, Decaf Co-Founder and developer Fernanda Orduna stated the reasoning behind the platform: “They don’t have many options. They don’t have financial freedom. This is something that happens everywhere in Latin America and especially now, for example, if you look at Argentina, Venezuela, [and] Colombia, people have a real need.” XLM market cap currently at $2.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Stability And Low Volatility Support XLM Bulls As of writing, the token is currently in a tight spot to secure its gains in the past 24 hours. XLM is sitting between $0.1003 and $0.1058, a price range historically held by the bears. XLM bulls might find some respite on this price range. The token’s low volatility might be followed by stable prices which will give the bulls enough time to gather momentum for a breakthrough toward $0.1058 in the long term. How far into the future the “long term” might be is entirely dependent on the overall market environment. With private equity firms pointing to more pain in the financial market, crypto won’t be spared once stocks start flashing red. XLM’s high correlation with Bitcoin will play a part in this affair.

32191000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633977,1723132814,CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Price Could Reach New ATH If It Holds This Level,"Following the Bitcoin price crash below $60,000, hopes for the BTC price to reach a new all-time high, at least for the short-term, seem to have been shattered. However, over the long term, analysts still expect that the Bitcoin price will still rebound from here. One of those who believe that the BTC price will still reach a new all-time high is CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young, but there is a caveat to this rally. Bitcoin Price Must Hold $45,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young revealed that the Bitcoin price remains bullish even after the crash. The major level is the $45,000 level, though, as holding this level will be a defining factor for whether the bearishness continues or if Bitcoin makes its way to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Cardano Price Crash Below $0.3: Is It Time For You To Buy ADA? The reason for the $45,000 caveat is miners’ profitability levels, which are currently sitting at $43,000. This $43,000 is the cost to mine a single Bitcoin by taking into account all of the operating costs. This means that as long as the BTC price remains above $45,000, miners remain in profit from any mined BTC. However, a fall in price below the $45,000 level will initially put the Bitcoin price dangerously close to the cost of mining a BTC. Further decline could put it below the $43,000 level, at which time it would become unprofitable for miners to mine BTC, and possibly affecting the hash rate. The CEO recognizes that some signals are still bearish for the Bitcoin price. However, he believes that if the pioneer cryptocurrency is able to maintain the $45,000 level without breaking for the next two weeks, then a rebound could be in the works. Following this, Young believes that the BTC price could reach a new all-time high before 2024 ends. Bearish Signal Not Seen Since 2023 Returns The X post which the CryptoQuant CEO was responding to was from Julio Moreno, who is the Head of Research at CryptoQuant. In the post, Moreno took a rather bearish stance, identifying a peculiar bearish signal which had not been seen in more than one year. Related Reading: XRP Prediction: Analyst Says Bullish Divergences Are Still Present, Here’s Why The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is one that can signal a return of the bear market. The researcher points at the COVID sell-off of 2020 as one of the instances when this indicator has turned bearish. Going by this historical performance, the Bitcoin and crypto market could be gearing up for another extended bear market, which would mean that the market decline is far from over.

42417483,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYZ9Z,1723129690,Do Kwon’s Extradition from Montenegro Postponed Yet Again,"Do Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro has been delayed yet again.  Just last week, the Balkan country’s appellate court issued what seemed to be a definitive decision to extradite Kwon to his native South Korea. But like past extradition decisions in Kwon’s case, it has been postponed by Montenegro’s Supreme Court at the request of the country’s top prosecutor, Minister of Justice Andrej Milović, according to local media reports.  Montenegro has unexpectedly found itself at the center of a diplomatic tug-of-war over the Terraform Labs co-founder. Both South Korea and the U.S. want to try Kwon for civil and criminal charges tied to the $40 billion implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022.  Both countries have issued competing extradition requests to Montenegro, where Kwon has been in custody since March 2023, when he was arrested for using a fake Costa Rican passport en route to Dubai while on the run.  Kwon wants to be tried in his native South Korea, which has lighter penalties for financial crimes, and successfully fought earlier decisions to extradite him to the U.S. last year. But the country’s courts – and apparently its prosecutors and government officials – are split over which request to honor.  Kwon’s Montenegrin defense attorney Goran Radić did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment by press time, but told Vijesti, a Montenegrin newspaper, that the continuous delays and seven court decisions in Kwon’s case represent a “judicial disgrace.” Radic also told Vijesti that Milović had made an “illegal private promise” to extradite Kwon to the U.S. instead of South Korea, which issued its extradition request first.  Montenegro's Prime Minister, Milojko Spajic, is a personal investor in Terraform Labs, Bloomberg reported earlier this year.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BUSINESS | LUNA,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/08/do-kwons-extradition-from-montenegro-postponed-yet-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58ca032cc4c46238ccd54ec650f6e8d35aaae83c-950x534.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32188054,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633945,1723127400,Crypto Analyst Forecasts XRP Price Path Post-SEC Lawsuit Resolution,"Crypto analyst Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) has published a XRP price prediction following Ripple’s partial victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. The analysis, delivered to his substantial follower base of 311,000 on X, delves into the implications of the court’s decision and the technical outlook for XRP. Implication For XRP Doctor Profit began by revisiting XRP’s historical performance, emphasizing its resilience and significant milestones. He reminds his audience that XRP price surged an extraordinary 60,000% in 2017 and has maintained a top-ten position in crypto market capitalization rankings for a decade. This, he argues, underscores its stability and appeal in the volatile crypto market. Despite a 75% drop in its value following the SEC lawsuit in 2020, XRP has shown remarkable durability, he notes, maintaining its high-ranking market position amidst sweeping market pessimism and shifts towards other altcoins. Related Reading: XRP Prediction: Analyst Says Bullish Divergences Are Still Present, Here’s Why Yesterday’s legal victory is described by Doctor Profit as a “massive, bullish event” that provides much-needed regulatory clarity for XRP. He speculated on the positive ramifications of this outcome, suggesting it could lead to increased institutional adoption and potentially pave the way for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). “This is a massive, bullish event due to the newfound regulatory clarity and the flood of bullish rumors that will follow. Is it far-fetched, to suggest that the SEC and XRP might be working on an XRP ETF behind closed doors? This aligns perfectly with my ETF approval ranking prediction: first BTC, second ETH, and third XRP—not SOL,” Doctor Profit claims. Related Reading: 3 Reasons To Buy XRP Now: Crypto Analyst Shares Bullish Forecast He also proposes that the newfound legal clarity could spur partnerships and integration of XRP into further financial platforms and systems. “Do you know that Ripple has partnerships with over 300 financial institutions worldwide? The ripple network was tested in the European Central Bank and is even mentioned in their report. Same goes for the Bank of America and many other banks world wide! XRP will play a key role in the CBDC implementation,” the analyst writes. XRP Price Analysis Focusing on technical analysis, Doctor Profit identified a crucial resistance line at $0.72, stemming from a pattern established back in 2017. This resistance has been tested multiple times over the years without a conclusive breakout. According to his analysis, the current chart formation is a mirror image of the pre-2017 surge setup, indicating a potential for a similar explosive price action if XRP can decisively break through this resistance level. The analyst also provides detailed price targets underpinned by this technical setup and the optimistic market sentiment post-lawsuit resolution. In the best-case scenario, XRP could soar to between $16 and $20, predicated on a repeat of historical movements and broader market acceptance. The analyst writes, “If we hit another rejection at $0.72, don’t panic. The breakout is inevitable, and I expect targets way above $1 latest by Q1 2025. When XRP pulls a 2017 move and hits the same Fibonacci levels we have seen in 2017, we’re looking at a potential top of $16!” A more conservative estimate places XRP at $4 to $7, assuming more moderate market conditions and investor response. Moreover, Doctor Profit suggests key buying zones around $0.38 to $0.44. “Holding this diamond strong! I’ve been holding for four years and I’m loading up on dips. Key buy zones are $0.38 to $0.44—that’s where I’ve been buying the last few months. If the market dips into those zones again, I’m buying even more,” he concluded. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6064.

The theory of overleveraged traders and cascading liquidations may have contributed to Bitcoin's sharp drop in price over the weekend. Bitcoin simply isn't perceived as a flight to safety asset but rather as a high beta tech play. This perception could persist for a long time. Corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury strategy could be a bullish factor in the long term, potentially decoupling BTC from TQQQ. Based on its performance this week, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) pretty much failed its most recent trial as a flight to safety asset. The unwinding of the yen carry trade this week had spooked markets across the world, and we saw the VIX hit 60, which was one of its highest readings in history. This was clearly a time when some assets did experience a flight to safety. U.S. treasuries, for instance, saw an unusual price appreciation, as reflected by a broad shift down of the yield curve. BTC crashed from $62000 to $52000 between Saturday (3 August) and Monday (5 August). Spot markets were not open for most assets at this time. The S&P 500 only fell 3.8% between Friday and Monday morning. By Monday at market close, most risk assets, including BTC had started a climb back from this dip. It's important to note that the S&P 500 is down just 6% from ATH (set just last month), but BTC is down 17% from the local top of $68000, set at around the same time the S&P 500 had its ATH. This price performance honestly surprised me, because I am of the opinion that BTC is the most compelling asset today for long-term returns. Much of my thesis is that it is a superior protection against monetary debasement and fiat financial system issues. Despite the recent price action, I still stand by this position, but I have been trying to poke holes in my own thesis as an exercise of intellectual honesty. Flight To Safety One of the most memorable moments in my Bitcoin investing journey was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank back in March 2023. At the time, many banks were in crisis because they owned long-duration assets in the form of treasury bonds. You might recall that March 2023 was preceded by a string of aggressive rate hikes to quell the decades-high inflation in 2021 and 2022, which was caused by the aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus done in 2020. The rate hikes were terrible for long-duration assets, so many banks had major duration mismatch issues, which turned into liquidity and solvency issues when people suddenly wanted to withdraw. This is an inherent risk of fractional reserve banking. This forced the Federal Reserve to step in with the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) which allowed banks to redeem their heavily underwater long-duration positions at par. This was basically another bailout for the U.S. banking sector, and by the end of the year, banks were using the BTFP to earn some easy arbitrage profits. When the banking scare resulted in the infamous failure of Silicon Valley Bank on 10 March 2023, these were the market reactions of four very different asset classes. BTC and others around SVB failure (Seeking Alpha) In the next two days, BTC shot through $24000 and never looked back. It was up over 10% while the others were flat or down on the banking crisis news. BTC around SVB failure (Yahoo Finance) The SPX fell a little bit before it started higher. TLT and GLD seemed to go up slightly with BTC on the day of SVB's collapse. I took that episode as a sign of BTC's status as a flight to safety asset. And this was quite unexpected given that crypto was just months coming out from the collapse of FTX. When things got very chaotic as it did with SVB, with some commentators even saying that this was a "" Lehman moment ,"" BTC of all things was the flight to safety. So this time around, when the financial system was again reeling from the results of central bank actions, now in the form of the Bank of Japan unexpectedly raising rates and unwinding a classic carry trade, I was surprised that BTC did not respond as a flight to safety at all. In fact, it drastically underperformed most assets and utterly failed the test. I am still thinking through why this happened. There are a few theories which I've seen which are interesting. Theory 1: Only Asset Around to Sell on Weekends The major moves started happening on Friday, 2 August. The BoJ raised rates on 31 July , on Wednesday. Thursday and Friday both saw adverse price action in most markets. The Nasdaq 100 was hit a bit harder than the S&P 500. Friday was quite bad for U.S. markets, and Japanese equities weren't doing too good either. Now, the theory is that over the weekend, crypto was the only spot market which were trading, so traders dumped crypto to raise cash in anticipation for the coming margin calls on Monday as they realized that the yen carry trade was probably going to start unwinding. This meant that BTC took much of the selling pressure to the chin, and this is reflected in a pretty large 19% drop from Saturday to Monday. I think this theory makes sense on the surface but is more like a coping mechanism by the diehard Bitcoin supporters (and even though I am certainly a member of this group, I try to be intellectually honest). It is making the rounds on social media, and Bitcoin companies like Swan and River have communicated this theory as a possible explanation for the crash in their email newsletters. Theory 2: Overleveraged and Cascading Liquidations Crypto allows for massive leverage. Some perpetual futures products support up to 100x leverage. It is not uncommon to be trading BTC derivatives with over 20x leverage. These derivatives also trade 24/7/365. When there is a little bit of volatility, a lot of liquidations can happen at once, creating a cascading selling pressure. Here is a chart of BTC liquidations aggregated across various crypto exchanges. A lot of longs were liquidated on Sunday, 4 August. This is likely a reflexive factor that contributed to the 19% crash. Liquidations (Coinglass) Here are the funding rates of perpetual futures, also aggregated from different crypto exchanges. Funding rates (Coinalyze) Positive funding rates are indicative of net bullish (long) positions on BTC. Funding rates are a cash flow that is exchanged between longs and shorts on a daily basis to force the price of the derivative to track the value of the underlying. When funding rates are positive, it means leveraged traders are paying extra to be long the underlying. A build-up of positive funding rates could indicate overt bullishness. And actually, I think we can conclude this is exactly what happened seeing that open interest had risen 50% from mid-July before peaking on 29 July, just 2 days before the BoJ's rate hike. Open interest on Bitcoin (Coinalyze) There was clearly a lot of leverage in the system, and it had to be violently washed out via liquidations, and this is what caused the collapse in the price. I like this explanation more. It is a classic function of crypto markets. In this case, BTC is simply another risk asset to trade, and the traders got washed out, and the price action laid it bare for all to see. Theory 3: Most Investors See Bitcoin As High Beta QQQ Right Now This is my personal explanation, which I've been aware of for a while. BTC's reaction to SVB was certainly a contradiction of this theory, but let's look at a long-term chart. TQQQ and BTC (Seeking Alpha) BTC really does track together with the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF ( TQQQ ), a 3x fund of the Nasdaq-100. There is no good reason to expect this perception to change anytime soon, so if this is what people perceive, then that sentiment will be what drives the market price of BTC. The explanation really can be that simple, because it's not that much of a stretch to say that people create markets, and the price is just as much a reflection of people's collective perception of reality as it is a reflection of reality. For this relationship to break, more people who are actively involved in trading BTC must come to understand it as something more than a high beta version of tech-heavy indices. Until that happens, BTC won't be any more of a flight to safety than TQQQ. Conclusion BTC completely failed as a flight to safety asset this time. I believe Bitcoin bulls need to be honest about this, reflect, and add more nuance to their thesis. I think BTC remains a Buy. I see extremely bullish developments. For instance, some corporations are beginning to adopt BTC treasury strategies, inspired by the indisputable outperformance of MicroStrategy. I wrote an article that explained the options available to a corporation exploring such a strategy. The article was a breakdown of what I thought was the most important moment in the recent Bitcoin Conference in Nashville . I view corporate adoption as the most bullish medium term-factor in Bitcoin's evolution. As more companies buy into BTC with their excess cash, they unlock optionality they would never have had access to before. And it isn't just publicly traded companies that are doing this. Various private companies are exploring it too, no doubt in their search for an asset which can store their accumulated earnings for the long haul without leaking purchasing power. A large list of known Bitcoin treasuries can be found on this website here . In the long term, I think this kind of corporate adoption will be consequential in decoupling BTC from TQQQ. I also think corporate adoption will be the leader that pushes for regulatory dovishness and overall government acceptance of BTC as an asset, which is at least politically self-destructive to oppose. These should help change BTC's perception over time, and maybe next time it will pass the flight to safety test.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4712053-bitcoin-just-flunked-the-recent-flight-to-safety-test?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32187734.jpeg

Trump and RFK Jr. both promise to create a national Bitcoin reserve if elected, resonating with crypto enthusiasts. Bitcoin's market dominance is increasing, with potential government purchases and ETF inflows supporting my $148,000 price target. Investment Thesis Unfortunately, most recent reports on Bitcoin ( BTC ) indicate the anticipated bullish impact of the cryptocurrency's halving event has not materialized as many investors, including myself, had expected. Instead of leading to a price surge, Bitcoin experienced a period of volatility and stagnation post-halving. However, the new front now is a Bitcoin Strategic reserve. The concept here is the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. It's gaining traction and offers what I believe to be is a cornerstone for the cryptocurrency's future. Countries (including the US and already El Salvador) are exploring a reserve as a means to diversify their monetary holdings, which could lead to it becoming a much more legitimate financial asset, much like gold.

Kennedy Jr., both running for the presidency, made headlines by promising to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to the gold reserves used to hedge against dollar fluctuations. Trump's recent comments during the Bitcoin 2024 Conference reveal a shift in his position towards cryptocurrencies, who previously called Bitcoin a ""scam"" but now pledges to transform the U.S. into a "" crypto capital "" and ""bitcoin superpower"" by creating a national Bitcoin stockpile if re-elected​. On this same note, the Trump campaign's acceptance of Bitcoin donations and the promise of a Bitcoin reserve have resonated with crypto enthusiasts​. They see this as a real bullish opportunity. Kennedy has similarly emphasized the importance of Bitcoin in his campaign, suggesting that a Bitcoin reserve could serve as a hedge against inflation and dollar devaluation. He is clearly capitalizing on public discontent with traditional financial systems by promoting Bitcoin as a means to protect individual financial sovereignty. I believe we are in the middle of a growing trend among some political figures who view Bitcoin as a potential solution to the economic challenges posed by fiat currencies​. Both campaigns are tapping into the rising crypto sentiment and acknowledging Bitcoin's role in a diversifying monetary system​. Last month, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced a bill in Congress proposing the U.S. government purchase one million Bitcoins to create a strategic reserve. Lummis argued that holding a significant Bitcoin reserve would enhance U.S. financial security and position the country as a leader in the digital currency market. The potential government purchase of such a large Bitcoin quantity could drive demand and increase Bitcoin's value, positively impacting related investment vehicles like IBIT​. With the prospect of significant government involvement in Bitcoin, I believe ( IBIT ) represents a strong buy. The potential US government (alone) purchasing one million Bitcoins could drive an exponential increase in demand and increase Bitcoin's value, directly benefiting public market investment vehicles like IBIT​. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage While I continue to be bullish on IBIT (and Bitcoin as a whole), it's more than evident that the cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin included) has experienced a notable drop since my last research piece , with its price dropping as low as $30/share in this first week of August as we say a route in asset prices due to the Yen Carry Trade unwinding . Despite the price action setback, I still the fundamentals of Bitcoin continue to strengthen, driven by growing institutional interest and strategic adoption plans​. Just this past week, Morgan Stanley's decision to allow financial advisors to purchase Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, for their clients, makes it the first major Wall Street bank to allow its advisors to offer direct Bitcoin investments to clients with a high-risk tolerance and a net worth of at least $1.5 million. I think this is a big first step. As Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance among political leaders and financial institutions, the implications for the cryptocurrency's market cap will be significant, likely triggering a large bullish move. The purpose of this update piece is to show how the fundamentals have detached from reality, in a bullish way. Deep Dive On Strategic Reserve There are a handful of Bitcoin reserve proposals on the table from major political leaders in the US. First is by former President and presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Trump proposed maintaining the current 200,000 Bitcoins held by the U.S. government from criminal seizures, rather than selling them off​. This move, though largely symbolic, as reported, is intended to prevent these Bitcoins from entering circulation, and will potentially help stabilize and/or add upward pressure on the price of the world's most valuable token asset​​. Some have seen the plan as modest and lacking substantial economic impact​ by its critics. For those who have been following the space for a few years, it's crazy we are even here where there is a real chance the US gets a Bitcoin reserve. In contrast, Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed a more ambitious plan, pledging to purchase up to 4 million Bitcoins on behalf of the U.S. government if elected​. This would represent nearly 20% of the total Bitcoin supply. Wow. Keep in mind, most countries have yet to recognize Bitcoin as a national asset, making these U.S. proposals as a massive icebreaker to help facilitate the right discussions about global reserves. On the other hand, a win in the presidential race for current US Vice President Harris might result in stricter regulations, which could dampen Bitcoin's valuation and market dynamics. The Harris campaign has reached out to cryptocurrency advocacy groups in an attempt to amend their relationships with them. I am not yet optimistic that a Harris Administration would be bullish for Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency for that matter). Bitcoin Is Consolidating Crypto Market Share While candidates for US president and US senators are debating the concept of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoin's market share among major cryptocurrencies has steadily consolidated over the past few years, exceeding its competitors like Ethereum (ETF), and Solana​. As of early August, Bitcoin dominates the market with a 55.70% share. Powering this, I believe, is the increased accessibility for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to invest in and participate in Bitcoin's potential. BTC Dominance (coinmarketcap.com) At the same time, the Ethereum blockchain's launch of spot ETFs here in the U.S. was anticipated to similarly bolster its market presence much like the launch of Bitcoin ETFs did for Bitcoin. However, these largely ETFs resulted in a ""sell-the-news"" scenario that led to price declines for the second, more valuable token​. Ethereum's price has fallen against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio reaching a three-year low​. Bitcoin is gaining market share in the cryptocurrency market as investors realize it is one of the few highly viable, legitimate cryptocurrency assets. With assets consolidating into Bitcoin, I view the token as a slightly safer bet (but still risky), especially given the political and regulatory uncertainties facing Ethereum and other altcoins. I believe this suggests that Bitcoin will likely continue to capture a larger share of the crypto wallet market, and with it continue to see strong upward movement. Valuation My $148,000 price target for Bitcoin remains unchanged from my previous coverage in April. I still believe this target reflects the potential for an exponential price appreciation curve driven by the possibility of governmental purchases that could accelerate Bitcoin demand while removing a ton of market supply. With this, IBIT is still well-positioned to capitalize on this dynamic. Previously, I highlighted how the rising ETF inflows and the expected reduction in Bitcoin's supply, which should keep the valuation outlook for Bitcoin promising. I believe the recent market volatility (while extreme) is still less extreme than what was anticipated because of the ETFs consistent inflows into the market. ETFs are providing liquidity, so the insane volatility we used to see in Bitcoin drops off. This will help bring more marginal buyers into the market. Risks While this was not on my risk list back in April, one of the biggest risks to Bitcoin's price is if a non-crypto advocate were to win in the upcoming election, causing a high likelihood of a large sell-off in Bitcoin. Vice President Harris has been seen as less favorable towards cryptocurrency, with expectations of continued regulatory crackdowns akin to the Biden administration's policies (such as keeping SEC chairman Gary Gensler)​. The crypto market has shown increasingly extreme sensitivity to political developments, with Bitcoin's price fluctuating in response to proposed government policy and SEC enforcement announcements. For example, SEC chairman Gary Gensler, since taking office in 2021, has maintained a critical view of the crypto sector, often emphasizing the prevalence of fraud and manipulation within it. He argues that digital assets should adhere to the same regulatory standards as traditional securities and commodities. These regulations would be inherently incoherent with a decentralized blockchain. Gensler's tenure at the SEC has been marked by a series of high-profile enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Ripple and Coinbase ( COIN ). These resulted in prolonged legal battles that have frustrated industry leaders​​. For instance, Ripple's legal challenges with the SEC have cost the company over $100 million in defense, highlighting the agency's aggressive approach​. Over the last three weeks, Trump's odds of winning the presidency have decreased notably. His probability of success fell from 67.9% to 49% as reported on one platform (Polymarket). Vice President Harris, who recently entered the presidential race, has seen her odds improve, even overtaking Trump on other betting sites​. Please keep in mind that this analysis is not meant to be political commentary but rather an examination of what is driving the crypto market. Bitcoin prices have been sensitive to political events, given Trump (and RFK Jr's.) strong pro-crypto stance and promises to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The market perceives a Trump victory as beneficial for Bitcoin, which can lead to increased adoption and favorable regulatory policies. Please also keep in mind that while the market has a clear preference for who they want to win, Bitcoin's performance under President Biden has been robust, despite the administration's regulatory stance. The cryptocurrency has benefited from exponential institutional interests and investments, with Bitcoin gaining traction following Biden's executive order on digital assets in early 2022​ ​. In contrast, Donald Trump, initially a skeptic, has recently shifted his stance, actively courting the crypto community by promising less regulatory pressure​. Bitcoin also thrived during Trump's presidency , benefiting from a lack of regulatory clarity, which allowed the market to expand rapidly​. The point here is that while industry insiders are concerned that without Trump in the White House, Bitcoin could face pressures, the currency has done well under both democrats and republicans. I believe it will probably continue to perform well under both hypothetical administrations, too. The question is, if we get a truly pro-Bitcoin president in office that wants to establish a Bitcoin reserve, what will that do to prices? Bottom Line While price action itself has been weak, Bitcoin's fundamentals appear stronger than ever, despite its recent price decline. The cryptocurrency's resilience is demonstrated by growing institutional interest and strategic endorsements from political figures like Trump and Kennedy, who advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations​​. Major financial players like Morgan Stanley have also begun offering Bitcoin ETFs to investment advisory clients, signaling increased institutional adoption​. With this, my $148,000 price target for Bitcoin remains unchanged. I continue to view Bitcoin as a strong buy, as its growing integration into mainstream finance and its potential role in a national reserve strategy support its long-term valuation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4712048-ibit-btc-strategic-reserve-deep-dive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32187370.jpeg

The crypto community has been interested in these movements as they raise issues about the possible influence on the market. Related Reading: Bloody Monday: Cardano Not Spared From Bloodbath, Suffers 30% Loss Mined only one year after the launch of the first bitcoin, it has been unaltered till today. Early on in 2010, the miner had painstakingly accumulated 250 BTC using five wallets. The value of these coins was almost $13.95 million as of August 7, a sharp rise from their initial price. After being dormant for 11 years, a miner wallet woke up and transferred 250 $BTC($13.95M) to 5 new wallets 40 minutes ago. The miner earned 250 $BTC from mining via 5 wallets in 2010.https://t.co/lcrW5XohuX pic.twitter.com/C57Tz6lpvM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 7, 2024 Historical Context And Mining Evolution The historical background of this development lends a fascinating element. Back in 2010, regular CPUs let one mine BTC. First mined on a GPU in July 2010, the Bitcoin Market was founded in February of the same year. FPGA mining first became popular in 2011; in 2013 it quickly took front stage with ASIC mining. Thanks to this development, mining cryptocurrencies has become a huge sector controlled by very wealthy corporations. Originally earning 250 BTC, the miner’s pay-off in May 2013 was merely $28,080. These coins are now valued at over $14 million as we speak. The possible long-term worth of early Bitcoin investments is shown by this great appreciation. Speculations And Satoshi Nakamoto Rumors The unexpected behavior of this whale has surely sparked rumors within the crypto community. Some speculate about possible involvement of Satoshi Nakamoto, the secretive founder of Bitcoin. The time and historical relevance of the coins support these ideas. A more likely theory, however, is that an early miner simply uncovered an old hard disc with Bitcoin and chose to sell or relocate the contents. This is not the first time dormant Bitcoin came alive. Another long-dormant wallet with 26 BTC has shifted its cache to a different address. Acquired in 2012 for an estimated $301, the coins were valued around $1.81 million at the time of the transfer. These events show how early Bitcoin users—who mined or bought the currency in its early years—are now profiting greatly. Accumulation Trends And Market Impact The movement of these long-dormant currencies fits a clear pattern in the Bitcoin market. Over the previous 30 days, around $22.8 billion worth of BTC has been moved to “permanent holder addresses,” said founder and CEO of CryptoQuant Ki Young Ju. This points to a substantial accumulation period, therefore reflecting investor optimism. I’m pretty sure something is happening behind the scenes. 404,448 #Bitcoin have moved to permanent holder addresses over the past 30 days, and it’s clearly accumulation. We’ll know within a year. https://t.co/Ip0jow2pGN pic.twitter.com/OOxuWcyxJu — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) August 6, 2024 “I’m very convinced something is occurring behind the scenes,” Young Ju said on X, hinting to the wider consequences of this accumulating pattern. It’s a positive news for the market of Bitcoin as the shift of over 400,000 BTC to cold storage wallets indicates that investors are getting ready for any future price rises. Related Reading: Polkadot Developments Show Strength, Despite Coin’s 18% Loss Trading at $57,308, Bitcoin is still trying to recover from a significant sell-off that started last week. The activity of this long-dormant whale reminds investors of Bitcoin’s erratic character and the possibility for major swings at any moment, therefore injecting some excitement and conjecture into the market. All things considered, the waking of this Bitcoin whale has captivated the bitcoin community as well as underlined the long-standing worth of early Bitcoin purchases. The event emphasizes the changing scene of cryptocurrency mining as well as the continuous tendencies in Bitcoin accumulation.

32184087,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634094,1723122020,"Ethereum ETF or Mpeppe Which Will Create Millionaires, Experts Insight","The cryptocurrency investment landscape is currently buzzing with two exciting opportunities: Ethereum (ETH) ETF and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both have their unique advantages and cater to different investor profiles. Here’s a detailed analysis of these options and insights from experts on which might be the more promising path to significant wealth. Ethereum ETF: The Safe Bet for Traditional Investors The Ethereum ETF offers a structured and regulated way to invest in Ethereum (ETH), making it an attractive option for those seeking stability and conventional financial security. Unlike direct cryptocurrency purchases, the ETF integrates into established financial systems, providing a regulated framework that appeals to more cautious investors. It simplifies the process of investing in Ethereum (ETH) by trading on traditional stock exchanges, which might be a preferred route for those familiar with conventional investment methods. Despite its safety and ease of access, the Ethereum ETF might not deliver the explosive returns that more speculative investments promise. It’s designed to offer steady growth and diversification, which can be appealing but doesn’t necessarily capture the high-risk, high-reward potential of more volatile assets. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin Revolution Taking the Market by Storm Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a fresh and dynamic approach in the cryptocurrency world, blending meme culture with blockchain innovation. This new entrant leverages the viral nature of internet memes and popular culture to create a buzz that traditional investments often lack. Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to capture the imagination of a younger, more digitally savvy audience by combining humor with serious investment potential. The cryptocurrency’s focus on community engagement and its innovative use of meme culture provide a unique platform for rapid growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to foster a global community passionate about soccer and digital innovation, potentially leading to substantial gains driven by viral trends and community enthusiasm. Its speculative nature and connection to popular culture might offer higher short-term returns, appealing to those willing to embrace higher risk for the possibility of significant rewards. Expert Opinions: Ethereum ETF vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE) When comparing the Ethereum (ETH) ETF to Mpeppe (MPEPE), experts offer differing perspectives: – Advocates for the Ethereum (ETH) ETF argue that it provides a safer and more stable investment option. Its integration into regulated financial systems and its ease of access through traditional stock exchanges make it a prudent choice for those seeking long-term growth with minimal risk. While it might not offer the same explosive potential as Mpeppe (MPEPE), its stability and regulatory oversight are seen as significant advantages. – Proponents of Mpeppe (MPEPE), however, highlight its potential for rapid and substantial gains. They point to the cryptocurrency’s viral appeal and community-driven growth as key factors that could drive its value up significantly. For investors who are willing to take on more risk, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the chance to capitalize on emerging trends and meme culture, potentially leading to extraordinary profits. Making the Choice: Which Investment Aligns with Your Goals? The Ethereum (ETH) ETF and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two cryptocurrency investments that offer different investment strategies and risk tolerances. Ethereum ETF provides a stable, regulated investment in Ethereum (ETH) for long-term growth, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity fueled by meme culture and community engagement. Both options are expected to shape future investment opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

This is the third blockchain where the fund's shares can be traded. Previously, the fund was tokenized on Stellar and Polygon, another layer-2 network of Ethereum.  ""The Stellar network is the Franklin OnChain U.S Government Money Fund’s official record of share ownership,"" a spokesperson for Franklin Templeton told CoinDesk. ""The Fund may also use the Polygon and Arbitrum networks for certain accounts upon request and subject to eligibility. Arbitrum will initially be available to institutional wallets.""  The Wall Street investment giant said the expansion will help the integration of decentralized finance into the traditional financial system and help Franklin reach a new audience for FOBXX.  “Expanding into the Arbitrum ecosystem is an important step on our journey to empower our asset management capabilities with blockchain technology,” said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, in a statement.  The fund, which launched in 2021, was the first to use a public blockchain to record transactions and ownership. It stands at a $420 million market cap, making it the third-largest U.S. Treasury-linked on-chain product, according to data from rwa.xyz  Since then, several other firms have made a push into tokenization of real world assets (RWAs) by bringing their funds onto blockchain rails. The biggest ones include BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and crypto-native startups Securitize and Ondo Finance, all of which have launched tokenized funds in recent years.

42417476,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYZ2L,1723122000,"NEAR Pushes 'Signatures' on Mainnet, in Growing Trend of Chain Abstraction","NEAR Foundation, the non-profit behind the NEAR blockchain, announced on Thursday that a new feature designed to make it easier to seamlessly transact between networks is live on mainnet – adding to a growing trend of projects working on a design concept known as ""chain abstraction.""  The feature, Chain Signatures, was introduced in testnet in March, and allows users with a NEAR account to sign transactions on blockchains it supports, without the need for cross-chain bridges. The move is supposed to eliminate some of the steps when it comes to transacting on different chains, making it faster and easier to use.  NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin has personally touted the project's roadmap towards chain abstraction, which aims to simplify the user experience in crypto that exists due to the growing multi-chain ecosystems. Router Protocol, an unrelated project designed around chain abstraction but built using Cosmos blockchain technology, launched its main network last week.  Chain Signatures are at the center of NEAR's chain abstraction ethos, said Kendall Cole, CEO of Proximity Labs, which supports the NEAR ecosystem, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “It's definitely the core product,"" Cole said. ""It will enable some other really important products.”  NEAR argues that introducing Chain Signatures can facilitate easier DeFi activities like borrowing, lending or trading.  “This capability dramatically expands the liquidity and utility of assets across blockchains, creating a seamless and efficient financial ecosystem,” NEAR wrote in a press release.  NEAR’s Chain Signatures could, for example, enable decentralized finance (DeFi) for blockchains like Bitcoin that do not traditionally support smart contracts.  “We have one application going live that's kind of exploring that, which is a DEX that will let users trade between Bitcoin and any other chain,” Cole said to CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has seen a flurry of activity over the last few months, with projects popping up aiming to bring layer-2 networks and non-fungible tokens to the Bitcoin network.  “What our technology enables is a smart contract on NEAR to custody bitcoin on the Bitcoin network,” Cole told CoinDesk.

42417481,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYZ6T,1723122000,"Coinbase-Backed Vega Gets Into Prediction-Market Race, Chasing Polymarket","Prediction markets are having a moment. After Joe Biden's halting debate performance last month led to speculation that he might drop out of the race, the blockchain prediction market Polymarket – where users had already been betting on the incumbent's election odds – became a useful resource for gleaning public sentiment.  Polymarket lets users bet on everything from sporting events to science. Although it's generally illegal to bet on election outcomes in the United States, Polymarket's global prediction markets have earned citations alongside traditional voter polls in Beltway discussions concerning the 2024 U.S. presidential election.  Now, the Coinbase Ventures-backed Vega network is joining the competitive fray with its own betting-focused upgrade. Vega, a blockchain and decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses the Cosmos network infrastructure, is one of a number of crypto platforms focused on perpetual futures – a tool for speculating on future asset prices.  Vega's new update expands its DEX app to accommodate prediction markets, allowing users to bet on the outcomes of future events just as they can currently bet on future token prices.  At least initially, Vega's prediction market will differ from Polymarket's in that it will be more of an open framework than a fully fleshed betting app. Vega will continue to look like a conventional decentralized crypto exchange: Users will be able to trade assets like normal, with the only difference being that some of those assets will now proxy as prediction bets.  Polymarket, by contrast, is a standalone app built on top of the Polygon blockchain ecosystem. It presents traders with a casino-style betting interface similar to that of Draft Kings or other internet betting platforms.  ""The starting point here is we're developing the protocol, building out the primitives, enabling this to be built,"" explained Vega founder Barney Mannerings. ""The people building on Vega and launching markets can kind of launch their own products with their own [user experience (UX)], and even bring in sports, news or whatever.""  While bet-on-anything apps have their detractors, Vega's upgrade underscores the increasing enthusiasm around prediction markets as a potential breakout use case for blockchain technology.  ""I wouldn't be surprised – especially if prediction markets take off – if you don't find some of the other DEXs that are offering perpetual or futures to start doing this, because it just seems to make sense to me,"" said Mannerings.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/08/coinbase-backed-vega-gets-into-prediction-market-race-chasing-polymarket,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/266ca83d60b629c92c96d442d4895ee6f2363c44-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC offers a lower price per share compared to GBTC, making it appealing to retail investors with smaller accounts. Despite similarities in strategy, BTC may face liquidity challenges compared to IBIT due to lower volumes and AUM, making IBIT a potentially better investment option. Grayscale launched their Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) on July 30, 2024, which is said to be a spin-off of their larger trust, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). 10% of the Bitcoin held in GBTC was carved out in order to be held by the mini trust, BTC, with GBTC retaining the remaining 90%. Corporate Reports You can find additional research on alternative bitcoin ETFs here: BRRR Has The Cold Storage Appeal BITU May Be Too Risky At 2x Leverage IBIT Is A Great Vehicle For BTC Investing VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF May Not Be The Optimal Bitcoin Fund To 'HODL' The two trusts are essentially the same, with one major difference that may drive appeal. Both funds hold the same strategy: a passive investment vehicle for investing in bitcoin. The major difference is the fee. BTC has a gross expense ratio of 15bps, significantly lower than GBTC’s expense ratio of 1.50%. I believe this is what drove the carve-out of BTC as the legacy trust has been struggling to compete with bitcoin ETFs as a result of the January 10, 2024 SEC approval of bitcoin spot ETFs . Given that Grayscale is no longer the only player on the block, the fund manager was forced to create a competitive trust to retain their asset level. btcetffundflow.com Another benefit BTC holds is the low price per share. This factor may make the fund more appealing to retail investors with smaller brokerage accounts that wish to gain exposure to bitcoin while being more precise on their percentage holdings. One share of BTC as of the close on August 7, 2024, was $4.86. This compares to the share price of GBTC of $43.67 or iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) at $31.19. What’s interesting is the daily performance difference between the three funds, in which IBIT’s daily performance was -3.56%, GBTC was -3.64%, and BTC was -3.76%. Seeking Alpha Volumes traded between the two Grayscale funds were similar at just north of 4mm, while IBIT had volumes of 24mm. These factors suggest that Grayscale may have a less liquid market when compared to IBIT, which has $19b AUM, dwarfing GBTC’s $13b and BTC’s 1.75b. Given the price volatility of bitcoin, I believe it would be prudent to invest in the more liquid market, IBIT. This assumes the investor does not have size constraints and pays no mind to the $4.86/share appeal. BTC currently holds 30,792 bitcoins in the trust, as compared to GBTC’s holdings of 237,497 bitcoins. For reference, IBIT holds 344k bitcoins within their ETF wrapper . According to Grayscale’s website , BTC is structured as a trust as opposed to an ETF or ETP and is not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Performance between GBTC and bitcoin differ slightly, potentially due to GBTC having fewer trading volumes, resulting in a premium to the underlying assets. Given BTC’s limited time as an investment vehicle, premium/discount cannot be appropriately analyzed. Given the lower management fee and lower price per share, I suspect that smaller retail investors seeking to actively trade bitcoin will elect to trade BTC over GBTC or IBIT. Given this factor, I believe BTC may potentially hold a higher premium/discount as the trust gains more visibility in the market. TradingView Conclusion BTC was a spin-off from GBTC on July 30, 2024, providing a low-dollar vehicle for retail investors to gain exposure to bitcoin. Though BTC’s expense ratio is significantly lower than GBTC, BTC remains more expensive than competing ETF IBIT. Given that the two funds hold the same objective, I cannot recommend BTC over IBIT. Given this factor, I will provide BTC with a HOLD recommendation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4712020-btc-offers-retail-investors-a-trading-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32184856.jpeg

Some of the largest catalysts for the month included the ether ETP launches, the German State of Saxony selling large tranches of BTC ($3B), and the return of BTC to Mt Gox claimants. The financial effects of Ethereum’s decision to implement EIP-4844 are still dragging on the price of ETH. Before August’s bloodbath, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose 6% in July, while Ethereum (ETH-USD) lagged, facing ETH ETP outflows and fee revenue issues due to EIP-4844. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Bitcoin rose (+6%) in July vs. ETH (-4%), while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were (-1%) and (+1%), respectively. Bitcoin Magazine held its annual conference in Nashville, which VanEck attended, along with two of the three Presidential candidates (Trump and RFK Jr.), both of whom announced plans to establish US strategic reserves of BTC. We’ve been writing about this possibility for years, and released a new model detailing some of our assumptions in July. Versus’ bitcoin’s (+6%) gain, the market capitalization of layer 1 smart contract platform (SCP) tokens rose (+4%). Among SCPs, the clear winner of the month was Solana’s SOL token (SOL-USD), which recorded a gain of (+20%). Though it was not the worst-performing token of the month, Ethereum’s ETH (-2%) lagged other majors as the ETH ETPs saw outflows of -$750M over the first 5 trading days. Some of the largest catalysts for the month included the ether ETP launches, the German State of Saxony selling large tranches of BTC ($3B), and the return of BTC to Mt Gox claimants. Since July 5, Mt Gox has remitted $7B of its total $9B to estate account holders. Additionally, the US Congress failed to override the veto of the SAB 121 bill, as expected, while Circle obtained approval to issue USDC and EURC under Europe’s MiCA regulatory framework.

Net selling of the high-priced ETHE offering totaled -$1.7b or (-20%) of starting AUM, compared to GBTC selling of -$2.1B (-8% of AUM) over the first 5 days of trading. In total, ETH ETPs saw outflows of -$750M vs bitcoin ETPs gaining +$846M of inflows. Though we partly attribute ETH’s weakness to the outflows from the ETP launch, ETH also stumbled in July due to more pressing issues around its economics. The financial effects of Ethereum’s decision to implement EIP-4844 are still dragging on the price of ETH. This is because Ethereum fee revenue from user transactions continues to disappoint as the result of the changes enabled by EIP-4844. At the time of writing, ETH’s average daily fee revenue was only $3M, the lowest since October 2023. This revenue drop occurs because EIP-4844 Ethereum created a new layer for Layer-2 data that reduced demand for transaction blockspace. The new layer, called “Blob Space,” is specifically designed to offer cheaper prices to Ethereum’s L2 roll-ups who post their data to Ethereum. Blob Space also has its own pricing mechanism that adjusts pricing according to blockchain usage. However, since the demand for Blob Space is below targeted capacity, Blob Space prices have remained minuscule, averaging between $25k-$50k per day. Due to EIP-4844 lowering L2 prices, it is speculated that Ethereum L2s users have saved over $680M since EIP-4844 was instantiated on March 13, 2024.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Outside of the ETPs and government selling, the crypto news cycle spun out relatively few noteworthy items as we have reached the seasonal bear market for hard work (summer). Bitcoin fees declined an epic (-75%) in July compared to June. Curiously, the transaction count for Bitcoin was up (+7%) month to month, but the fee revenue for Runes, Inscriptions, and Regular transactions was down (-76%), (-59%), and (-79%), respectively. These declines in activity occurred because we did not see wild swings in transaction fees due to demand surges to trade Bitcoin’s NFTs (Runes and Inscriptions). Solana, whose SOL token had a banner month surging (+20%), also flipped Ethereum in average daily DEX volume for the first time in smart contract blockchain history. However, there is some dispute about the data due to the prevalence of wash trading on Solana versus Ethereum. Solana also recently announced an upgrade to compress the size of its blockchain history through zero-knowledge proof data compression. The upgrade enables Solana to retain and potentially improve its decentralized over the long-term (+10 years). Due to Solana’s high throughput of transactions, Solana’s blockchain requires massive amounts of data storage. Without effective data compression, Solana’s blockchain growth would increasingly demand higher network bandwidth and more expensive servers to run nodes, resulting in more centralization. Hamilton Lane also made a big announcement to allow investors access to a private credit fund called SCOPE on Solana. Polygon (-8%), a middle-of-the-pack performer on the month who is pushing a new “chain of chains” architecture called the “agg layer” at the same time they are introducing a token upgrade and migration, will have its new token begin replacing on Sept 4, 2024. The new token, POL, will be swappable 1:1 for the old token, MATIC. Another interesting trend that continued in July was the ascension of the NEAR (+2%) blockchain from a usership standpoint. NEAR (NEAR-USD) remains the second most used blockchain, by daily active users, at 1.95M, just below TRON at 2.1M. Just over 1 year ago, NEAR had only 67k daily active users. Most of NEAR’s usership is billed to be user-generated rather than bot-created, as NEAR’s activity relates to a discount shopping application called Kai Kai, which is based in Taiwan. July’s Notable Performers - HNT (+39%) Helium (HNT) – 1Y Market Cap (Circulating) Source: Artemis XYZ as of 07/24/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Helium Network’s native Helium Network Token (HNT-USD) (“HNT”) outperformed in July, driven by a variety of fundamental developments. Originally developed solely as an Internet of Things ((IOT)) network on its blockchain, Helium migrated to Solana in April 2023 before launching its consumer mobile service, Helium Mobile, in December. On July 15th, Helium Mobile crossed 100,000 subscribers, demonstrating noteworthy adoption for a crypto-based consumer application. Helium Mobile combines legacy cellular networks with its own decentralized network of hotspots, offering subscribers 5G ‘hybrid coverage’ for $20 per month. As a decentralized network, it is operated by individuals who run wireless hotspots from common places such as cafes, shops, or their homes. These operators earn MOBILE tokens as they provide coverage to nearby subscribers. In late June, Helium announced boosted hotspot rewards for New York’s most highly trafficked areas, indicating a strategy focused on delivering service to dense population centers. Additionally, the network progressed on several other initiatives to accelerate service scaling. The newly launched Helium Mobile Licensing Program will enable third-party device manufacturers to build hardware such as RAKwireless’s mobile hotspot. The network is also becoming OpenRoaming-compatible. This allows cellular users of other networks to connect to Helium hotspots when they are out of range of their home networks. This enhances service and lowers mobile traffic costs for partnered cellular providers. We believe these developments suggest Helium’s ability to ideate and deploy new scaling incentives, signaling the potential for continued innovation and growth. One key catalyst for HNT's outperformance in July was the re-calibration of investor expectations for Helium, driven by its potential to become a hub for thousands of DePIN projects. Previously, Helium was seen as a network with limited growth and upside potential due to its focus on WiFi, Mobile, and IoT services. However, the introduction of Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP) 128, which adds an “Energy Network” rewarding solar power and battery resources, has changed this perception. The real value of Helium may lie not in its current businesses but in its potential to coordinate many new DePIN projects. Helium's network of operators, incentivized by HNT, will likely support and bootstrap new networks, just as they did with Helium IoT. This new dynamic positions Helium as a launchpad for DePIN projects, offering a geographically distributed and committed network of operators. While the total addressable market and growth potential for HNT have increased, the likelihood of capturing a significant portion remains low. Nevertheless, this shift in expectations helped drive HNT to a strong +39% performance in July. HONEY (+57%) Weekly Mappers Earning HONEY Rewards Source: Dune Analytics - @insights4vc as of 07/27/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Hivemapper (HONEY-USD) (HONEY) echoed Helium’s success as the second-biggest mover this month, further suggesting market enthusiasm around maturing DePIN projects. Launched on Solana in November 2022, Hivemapper’s network aims to capture a living map of the globe through a decentralized fleet of drivers. Hivemapper’s 5,600+ weekly mapping contributors added ~0.88M unique kilometers in the past 30 days to its total unique coverage of 14.60M km, representing 24% of global coverage. In late June, Hivemapper reported that its map's growth rate is 4-5 times faster than Google's. This rapid growth is driven by investors who have equipped Uber, Lyft, Amazon, and commercial truck fleets with Hivemapper devices. The basic idea involves users attaching specialized cameras to their cars, automatically sending images to the Hivemapper network to create highly up-to-date 3D maps. In return for supplying image data, drivers earn HONEY tokens. These images are used to update and expand a global map that Hivemapper utilizes in two main ways: to enhance its navigation app, aimed at competing with Google and Apple Maps, and to create a valuable data set available for enterprises & fleet managers to purchase exclusively with HONEY tokens. In theory, this enables users who contribute data to the network to share in the economics of reducing costs and improving resiliency in the otherwise highly monopolized market of mapping networks. According to Hivemapper’s Q2 2024 report published July 25th, the project added a Fortune 50 company, municipalities, property management companies, and two of the top 10 global online map providers to its customer base. Hivemapper also started the month with a new exchange listing on Kraken, likely increasing the token’s liquidity and distribution. We believe that these factors - in addition to growing awareness of the DePIN sector more broadly -likely contributed to HONEY’s standout month. July’s Notable Laggards - UNI (-21%) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Volume Market Share Source: The Block as of 07/26/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Despite an overall surge in crypto markets, Uniswap’s native UNI token (UNI-USD) experienced a significant drawdown this month. As the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by volume, Uniswap has been a DeFi mainstay ever since UNI reached $1B+ valuations shortly after its September 2020 airdrop. However, Uniswap faces several coinciding challenges that may drive poor market performance. In February of this year, Uniswap’s governance proposed activating the protocol’s fee mechanism, which would distribute a percentage of the DEX’s trading fees pro rata to UNI token holders. UNI surged over 100% in the following weeks, adding approximately $4.5B to its market cap. However, the DAO rejected the proposal in March, and UNI’s price suffered shortly after. In April, Uniswap Labs, the SoHo-based core development team, announced receiving a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, notifying them of a planned enforcement action for violating securities laws. The matter remains pending, which the market may interpret as a significant ongoing regulatory risk. Furthermore, Solana has taken over 300% of relative market capitalization from Ethereum over the past year, eroding Uniswap’s competitive advantage when compared to other major DEXs outside of Ethereum’s ecosystem. The bar chart above displays the relative share of volumes between six leading DEXs, illustrating how top Solana-based DEXs Raydium and Orca have steadily increased Solana’s share of DEX volumes to reach new highs in July. Even within the Ethereum ecosystem, Uniswap is facing new competitive pressures. Ironically, Aerodrome Finance took a dominant share of DEX volumes on Coinbase’s Base network this month, while Aerodrome distributed trading fees to its token holders. As regulation, competition, and Ethereum-centric exposure are likely priced into UNI’s market, we are monitoring for shifts in these factors as potential bullish catalysts. LDO (-15%) Lido Market Share of Ethereum Staking Shrinking 18bps in July Source: Artemis XYZ as of 07/29/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. LDO (LDO-USD), the most valuable liquid staking token, Ethereum, was down (-15%) on the month amid potential legal issues, Ethereum revenue challenges, and broader ETH underperformance. Lido also lost market share of Ethereum staking in July, decreasing (-18bps) from 29.15% to 28.97%, despite positive net flows into Lido’s staking contract. Though Lido’s growth in ETH TVL is encouraging, its loss of market share amid a substantial unlock (780k ETH) from Pendle Finance’s Ethereum re-staking application has disappointed many investors. However, Lido's performance was above average compared to peer token categories, Ethereum liquid staking governance tokens (median -23%) and liquid re-staking governance tokens (median -31%). The biggest challenge facing Lido and other liquid staking tokens is the reduction in the yield earned by Ethereum stakers. The average yield accrued to ETH stakers is (-28%) lower YoY, moving from 4.1% per annum to 2.9%. Since liquid staking projects earn a take rate on ETH stakers who opt into liquid staking pools, declining yield means decreased revenues. This yield is derived from two sources: inflationary yield from Ethereum monetary policy and fee revenue captured by Ethereum. Most of the yield decline stems from the drop in Ethereum revenues. The current decrease in Ethereum revenues is the direct consequence of EIP-4844, which reduced prices for Ethereum Layer-2s to post data to Ethereum. In July, Ethereum revenues were (-36%) lower month-to-month, while Lido’s were off (-15%) in dollar terms and down (-8%) in ETH terms. Lido not only grappled with sagging revenue in July, but it also struggled with ongoing legal issues. As a consequence of an SEC lawsuit against the important Ethereum infrastructure company called Consensys, Lido was cited as an unlicensed dealer of securities. The liquid token that Lido grants users who stake their ETH with Lido’s validator network, stETH, is being deemed a security by the SEC. In their brief, the SEC argues that Lido’s stETH reward structure, ownership details, and marketing materials are strong evidence that stETH is a security. In response, Lido intends to combat the allegations by accelerating the decentralization of its network while enabling permissionless entry by new validators.

The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), is similarly sedate, sitting 0.6% higher. One stand-out is XRP, which jumped nearly 20% after a judge reached a milestone ruling in the Ripple's long-running legal case with the SEC. On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil penalties and imposed an injunction against future securities law violations. Although the case is said to have reached its end, the SEC is expected to appeal the ruling – likely extending legal matters.  Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet arranged a 1 billion yen ($6.8 million) loan to buy more bitcoin {{BTC}} after adopting the largest cryptocurrency as a reserve asset earlier this year. The Tokyo-based company said it borrowed the money from shareholder MMXX Ventures ""with the entire amount allocated for purchasing bitcoin"", in a statement on its website. The six-month loan carries an annual interest rate of 0.1%. In May, Metaplanet said it would adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset to hedge against the volatility of the yen. At the start of July, it held 161.3 BTC ($9.2 million). The company's strategy mimics that of software developer MicroStrategy, which has been acquiring bitcoin for over four years and holds in excess of 226,000 BTC.  Brazil's markets regulator, CVM, approved a Solana-based ETF. It is the first product of its kind in Brazil and among the first Solana-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally. The Solana-based ETF is in a pre-operational stage, so has yet to be approved by the Brazilian stock exchange, B3. Exame, a local news organization, said the product would follow the CME CF Solana Dollar Reference Rate, created by CF Benchmarks. Brazilian asset manager QR Asset will offer the ETF, while Vortx, a local fintech focused on capital markets, will serve as its manager, the report stated. SOL trades at just under $154, 1.1% higher in the last 24 hours, at the time of writing.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily trading volumes in the crypto spot market since early 2021.  Volume surged to over $150 billion during Monday's market rout, the second-highest daily tally since May 19, 2021. That day, China reiterated its ban on bitcoin mining.  Investor confidence typically recovers slowly from a high-volume price slide.

32182754,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633916,1723118427,"More Pain Ahead: Analyst Warns Of Imminent Bitcoin Plunge Below $54,000 To Fill CME Gap","After enduring a substantial drop to a seven-month low earlier this week, Bitcoin (BTC) showed resilience by reclaiming ground above the $57,000 threshold on Tuesday, sparking optimism among bullish investors who hoped that the worst of the downturn was behind them. However, the leading cryptocurrency has quickly retraced over 3% in the past few hours, slipping back towards the $54,900 level, suggesting a possible continuation of the prevailing downtrend. BTC’s CME Gap & Bearish Indicators Crypto analyst Rekt Capital weighed in on the situation, noting Bitcoin’s repeated retracements following unsuccessful attempts to stabilize at higher levels. Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin stands on the verge of filling the CME Gap positioned between $53,700 and $54,600. While acknowledging the proximity of the current price at $54,900 to this gap, there’s uncertainty surrounding the necessity of filling it, especially considering its relatively minor size. Related Reading: BREAKING: XRP Price Rallies 27% As Ripple Secures Major Win In SEC Lawsuit The analyst mused on the possibility that this downward movement could merely signify a volatile daily retest around the $55,800 support level, which aligns with the lows seen in early July. However, if the CME Gap does require filling, doing so sooner rather than later, while the price remains in close proximity, could be a strategic move, according to Rekt’s analysis. Adding to the bearish indicators, Julio Moreno, Head of Research at data analytics firm CryptoQuant, highlighted a significant observation regarding the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator. Moreno flagged a bear phase for the first time since January 2023. Previous instances of the indicator signaling bear phases coincided with major market events like the COVID-induced sell-off in March 2020 and the Chinese mining ban in May 2021, accurately predicting the onset of bearish trends in November 2021. $50,000 Bitcoin Support At Risk? Crypto firm Material Indicators has also shared bearish predictions in the near term for the Bitcoin price, raising red flags concerning Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Observing a scenario where Bitcoin bulls are seemingly under siege, the firm notes a stabilization in BTC bids around the $50,000 mark. However, the cautionary tone emerges as they brace for a potential dip towards a crucial support level at $45,000 if the $50,000 mark fails to hold firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative: Shorts’ Turn To Get Squeezed? Adding to the market sentiments, market expert Jesse Olson has detected a pending sell signal on Bitcoin’s weekly Heikin Ashi chart. This signal, if confirmed, would mark only the fifth such occurrence since 2021, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics. Ultimately, it becomes increasingly apparent that Bitcoin must exhibit robust bullish momentum in the days ahead to counteract the intensification of the current downtrend. Revisiting its all-time high levels of $73,700, achieved in March, now appears contingent upon sustained upward movements to offset the prevailing market pressures.

Despite gains earlier today, losses saw the coin edge lower, as visible in the daily chart. The daily chart rejected the coin at around the $3,500 resistance level. At this pace, Ethereum could continue plummeting if bears step on, mirroring losses of the first half of the week. Jump Trading Liquidating Ethereum: Will Prices Drop Below $2,000? Multiple factors at play explain the recent weakness. As it is, the coin could drop even lower, targeting the $2,000 support line. With the general crypto community cautious, Jump Trading, a crypto market marketing firm, has been dumping ETH incessantly over the past few trading days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Still Intact? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says According to Lookonchain data, Jump Trading claimed 11,501 ETH worth over $29 million from the liquidity staking platform Lido Finance. The blockchain analytics platform said the block of ETH is set for sale. Jump Trading, currently being investigated by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), also plans to redeem another 19,049 ETH worth over $48 million from the same platform. This amount will likely be dumped in the secondary markets, weighing down prices even more. On August 5, Jump Trading liquidated over 120,000 wETH, accelerating the sell-off. Though Bitcoin lost over 20% that day, losses were more pronounced on Ethereum, which dumped by nearly 40% from July highs, dropping to as low as $2,100. PlusToken Ponzi Scheme Tokens Moving, Impact Of The Ronin Bridge Hack Beyond the liquidity impact of Jump Trading, large amounts of ETH are being moved from wallets associated with the PlusToken Ponzi scheme, according to Scopescan data. The last time these wallets were moved was in 2021, when Chinese authorities shut down the scam. The PlusToken Ponzi wallets control roughly $2 billion worth of ETH. Similar to the panic when the United States government moved $2 billion of BTC and when Mt. Gox began distributing BTC, the same is being witnessed. Presently, sentiment has been dented and could depress ETH prices in the short to medium term. Related Reading: Explosive XRP Prediction: Analyst Foresees 20-Fold Gain Though minimal, ETH faces more pressure following the Ronin Bridge security breach. While the white hacker has returned roughly 2 million USDC of the reported $10 million lost, the fact that ETH was the main asset stolen is a concern.

While Japan has yet to approve crypto ETFs, the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia have all recently given the go-ahead to such products.  The boss of Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) said “cautious consideration” needs to be given to the decision of approving crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bloomberg reported.  Many people believe crypto assets “do not necessarily contribute to the wealth creation of the Japanese people in a stable and long-term manner,” FSA commissioner Hideki Ito said in an interview with the financial news organization.  Japan has been a global leader in regulating stablecoins – digital currencies whose value is pegged to a real-world asset – and Web3. It was among the first countries to regulate crypto assets, even if that was followed by stiff consumer protection laws after the collapse of crypto exchange Mt Gox.

As of the start of July, Metaplanet held a total of 161.3 BTC ($9.2 million).  Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet (3350) has arranged a 1 billion-yen ($6.8 million) loan to buy more bitcoin {{BTC}} after adopting the largest cryptocurrency as a reserve asset earlier this year.  The Tokyo-based company said it borrowed the money from shareholder British Virgin Islands-based MMXX Ventures ""with the entire amount allocated for purchasing bitcoin"", in a statement on its website. The six-month loan carries an interest rate of 0.1% a year.  In May, Metaplanet said it would adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset to hedge against the volatility of the yen. At the start of July, it held a total of 161.3 BTC ($9.2 million).  The company's strategy mimics that of software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has been acquiring bitcoin for over four years and holds in excess of 226,000 BTC, more than 1% of all the bitcoin that will ever exit.  Metplanet shares closed at 893 yen ($6.10) on Thursday, 20% higher on the day as Japanese stocks continued their recovery from last week's sell-off following an interest-rate hike by the Bank of Japan.

On Wednesday, the company announced the launch of two new crypto mutual funds: the Grayscale Bittensor Trust and the Grayscale Sui Trust. Grayscale Unveils Bittensor And Sui Trusts According to the announcement, the Grayscale Bittensor Trust is exclusively dedicated to TAO, the token supporting the Bittensor Protocol, which incentivizes the advancement of open-source artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In parallel, the Grayscale Sui Trust focuses solely on SUI, the token underpinning the Sui protocol, a Layer 1 (L1) smart contract blockchain designed to facilitate globally scalable decentralized applications. Related Reading: Tron Lost 10% Since Last Week – Is There A Saving Grace Ahead? Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, expressed enthusiasm about the new additions, emphasizing the “pivotal roles” Bittensor and Sui play in the decentralized AI and smart contract blockchain realms, respectively. Sharif-Askary said: With the launch of Grayscale Bittensor Trust and Grayscale Sui Trust, we continue to provide investors with familiar products that enable access to tokens at the cutting edge of the crypto ecosystem’s continued evolution. These newly launched Trusts are now available for daily subscription by eligible individual and institutional accredited investors, operating similarly to Grayscale’s existing suite of single-asset investment trusts. Notably, they represent some of the first investment products exclusively focused on the tokens underpinning the Bittensor Protocol and Sui. In Wednesday’s announcement, Grayscale also confirmed its intention to seek a secondary market listing for the new products. Still, it cautioned that success was not guaranteed, with regulatory considerations posing potential challenges. SUI & TAO Price Analysis Following the asset manager’s announcement, the two tokens present a stark contrast in price action following the broader market crash experienced over the weekend and exacerbated on Monday. For instance, the SUI token hit a 9-month low of $0.4636 on August 5th, following a steady decline from its all-time high of $2.17 in March of this year. However, SUI has climbed back to the $0.6166 level since Monday, with a 3% increase in the last 24 hours, with its next resistance wall at $0.6966. Related Reading: Cardano Price Crash Below $0.3: Is It Time For You To Buy ADA? On the other hand, the TAO token has been unable to post gains in recent weeks, registering a 24% price drop in the fourteen-day time frame. Despite this, TAO has rallied significantly to the $253 level on Wednesday after falling to the $164 level on Monday. In the case of another leg up to regain previously lost levels, the most insignificant hurdle in the near term is placed at the $300 level, which is key for bullish investors in the token to approach the all-time high of $757 reached in March.

In the context of Bitcoin, a death cross suggests that a significant downturn could be imminent, as it signals that short-term momentum is slowing relative to the long-term trend. However, it’s worth noting that not every death cross results in a lasting bearish period. Bitcoin itself has shown resilience in the face of past death crosse formations. For example, after the March 2020 death cross, Bitcoin rebounded and reached new highs later that year. Similarly, a death cross in June 2021 was followed by a strong recovery, culminating in a new peak months later. These instances highlight that while a death cross can be a bearish indicator, it doesn’t necessarily dictate long-term price movements. Market Performance And Short Term Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin, after surging as high as $57,707 earlier today, has now retraced back to a trading price of $56,057., at the time of writing down by 0.8% in the past 24 hours. This retracement has resulted in a more than $200 billion decrease in Bitcoin’s market cap valuation over the past day. Interestingly, despite this dip, the asset’s trading value has surged over the same period, increasing from $26.7 billion in the early hours of Wednesday to above $43.5 billion at the time of writing. Sharing his technical outlook on the asset, prominent crypto analyst Ali has revealed that the Bitcoin chart shows a “classic rising wedge”—a pattern suggesting a correction to $54,500 should BTC break the $56,800 support. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Outshine Gold? Trading Guru Weighs In On The Historic Financial Duel Ali also highlighted that if the BTC price can close a candle above the $58,000 mark, the overall pattern can be considered “invalidated.” This chart shows a classic rising wedge for #Bitcoin. A correction to $54,500 is likely if #BTC breaks the $56,800 support.

Bitcoin's price plummeted to its lowest level in over five months this past week. BTC is currently up ~27% year-to-date. Ether's price also plunged this week, hitting its lowest level in six months. ETH is currently up ~5% year-to-date. XRP is currently down ~20% year-to-date. This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here . Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price plummeted to its lowest level in over five months this past week. BTC is currently up ~27% year-to-date. Ether Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price also plunged this week, hitting its lowest level in six months. ETH is currently up ~5% year-to-date. XRP XRP ( XRP-USD ), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~20% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. As of August 5th, Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch . On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH).

32173506,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633852,1723104014,Ethereum On The Move: Dormant ETH Wallets Linked To $4 Billion Scam Awaken,"On Wednesday, online reports unveiled that hundreds of Ethereum wallets that had been dormant for over 3 years were moving large amounts of ETH. The wallets were believed to have moved $2 billion worth of ETH linked to a $4 billion crypto scam. Investors worried that another massive dump would affect the market’s recovery. However, further details revealed that the initial ETH amount suspected to be moving was considerably smaller. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bounces 30% Amid Market Recovery, Analysts Remain Bullish 3-Year-Old Dormant Ethereum Wallets Awaken On-chain tracking firm Lookonchain reported that hundreds of Ethereum wallets started to move considerable amounts of ETH earlier today. In a now-deleted post, the firm suggested that the wallets, which had been dormant for 3.3 years, possibly moved over 700,000 ETH. Lookonchain tracked the funds back to an address linked to the PlusToken Ponzi Scheme. In 2020, the Chinese police reported seizing 833,083 ETH, now worth around $2.11 billion, as part of the crackdown on the scam crypto trading platform. The now-awaken ETH wallets’ funds came from an address labeled “Plus Token Ponzi 2.” This wallet dispersed 789,533 ETH from the seized assets to thousands of addresses and had not moved since April 2021. The news sparked a conversation between crypto investors, who feared the Chinese government would follow the steps of the German and US governments, adding another wave of selling pressure to Ethereum and the recovering market. However, newly unveiled details clarified that the amount of ETH suspected to be moved was incorrect, which prompted the on-chain data firm to delete its original report. Is ETH’s Selling Pressure Over? According to on-chain data analyst EmberCN, the amount of Ether “waiting to be sold” is significantly smaller. The analyst detailed that most of the original 789,534 ETH went into crypto exchange Bidesk three years ago. The tokens were transferred to the now-collapsed exchange between June and September 2021 via multiple Ethereum addresses. Per the report, most of the ETH transferred to Bidesk was transferred into Huobi and sold in 2021. Additionally, the analyst claimed to have tracked down around 12 Ethereum addresses to have collected PlusToken-related ETH in the last 30 hours. These wallets reportedly have 25,757 ETH, worth around $63.1 million. Some of that amount was not “transferred to Bidesk in 2021; some was taken out of Bidesk and not transferred to Huobi.” EmberCN concluded the “current collection” moving was only a small unsold portion of the PlusToken-related tokens. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization still took a 6.5% hit in the last four hours. This performance could be attributed to Jump Trading’s latest sell-off. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Drop Another 20% Lookonchain revealed that the Chicago-based trading firm sold another $29 million worth of ETH today. Jump Trading also redeemed another $48.2 million in preparation for selling on Wednesday morning. Per the report, the firm still holds 21,394 wstETH, worth around $63.6 million. As of this writing, ETH went from hovering between the $2,500-$2,540 range to trading around the $2,370 mark. This represents a 6.8% and 28.3% drop in the daily and weekly timeframes.

42417487,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYZ8X,1723100595,"XRP Jumps 17%, Beating Bitcoin Gains, as Ripple-SEC Case Ends","XRP surged 17% after a court ruling in the case involving Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This led to a jump in its price from 50 cents to 65 cents and a significant increase in trading volumes.  The judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil penalties and agreed to an injunction against future securities law violations, although an appeal by the SEC is expected, potentially extending the legal proceedings.  XRP surged 17% to lead market-wide gains after a U.S. judge made a milestone ruling in the long-running case between the closely related Ripples Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Crypto traders widely expected a settlement in the case throughout July, with the tokens drawing outsized attention from South Korean markets and beating gains in major tokens on several days, as reported.  On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil penalties and imposed an injunction against future securities law violations. Although the case is said to have reached its end, SEC is expected to appeal the ruling – likely extending legal matters.  Markets positively reacted to the ruling as prices of XRP zoomed to 65 cents from 50 cents after the ruling, with trading volumes jumping to $4.2 billion in the past 24 hours from Tuesday’s $1.2 billion.  As such, there were just $6 million in short liquidations on XRP-tracked futures, suggesting the movements were spot driven.  Meanwhile, open interest—or the number of unsettled futures contracts—on XRP-tracked futures rose by $200 million in the wake of the ruling, indicative of new money entering the market. Data shows that over 60% of these traders have a long bias and expect prices to increase further.  XRP was one of the few major tokens in the green during the Asian morning trading hours amid a flat market.  Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) jumped nearly 6% to $6.33 after Binance announced it will list TON on its marketplace.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, Solana’s SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB were unchanged in the past 24 hours, data shows, while ether {{ETH}} dropped 3.4%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, is up 0.3%.  Inflow into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) came in at $45.1 million for the August 7 trading day, according to market data. GBTC saw outflow of $30.6 million, while BTCW had inflow of $10.5 million and IBIT had $52.5 million.  Ether ETFs, saw outflows of $23.7 million. Grayscale's ETHE hit $31.9 million in outflow, while Fidelity's FETH had $4.7 million in inflow, ETH saw $1.7 million in inflow, and EZET had $1.8 million of the same. The rest registered no flow.  BTC's lack of movement might be the market beginning to price in a potential Kamala Harris White House, with Semir Gabeljic, Director of Capital Formation at Pythagoras Investments pointing to Harris' rise as a market catalyst to watch.  Harris, who recently tied Donald Trump both in the polls and on Polymarket (the latter of which has historically favored Trump), now has a pro-crypto advocacy group called ""Crypto for Harris"" attached to her name which hopes to make smart crypto legislation a bi-partisan issue. Many stakeholders, including Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, are also calling for crypto policy not to be the domain of one party so that the U.S can play catch-up to Asia in rule-making.  Meanwhile, other coins that are in the green during the Asia trading day are TONCoin, up 9.7%. TON may have some momentum as the TON-themed 'The Open Summit', part of ABS 2024 in Taipei, wraps up Thursday.  At the same time, Trump-themed PoliFi coins are struggling as their namesake is challenged in what's now a very competitive election. MAGA (TRUMP) is down 12.5%, or 44.5% on-month, while Solana's TREMP is down 6% on-day and 43% on-month. Harris-themed KAMA is trading flat, and up over 160% in the last month.

42390648,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd50AD,1723100046,"Bitcoin Faces Risk From 'Maxed Out' U.S. Consumers, Analyst Says","U.S. consumers accumulate debt at a slower rate amid rising credit card delinquencies.  Slower borrowing means the fiat-to-crypto onramp will remain constrained, 10x Research said.  Although the unwinding of the yen carry trade has likely paused since Monday, stabilizing risk assets, including bitcoin {{BTC}}. Still, other risks remain, such as the slower U.S. consumer borrowing, according to 10x Research's founder Markus Thielen.  Total credit outstanding increased by $8.9 billion in June following an upwardly revised $13.9 billion in May, missing the consensus estimate of a $10 billion increase, data released by the Federal Reserve Wednesday showed.  Revolving debt, representing credit cards, which allow borrowers to access funds up to a specific limit and repay the loan over time, fell by $1.7 billion, the most since early 2021. Non-revolving debt, which includes student tuition and auto loans, rose $10.6 billion, the biggest increase in a year.  Perhaps more concerning is the increasing delinquency rates, a sign of deteriorating household balance sheets. In the June quarter, the share of credit card delinquents or those running late on repayments for more than 90 days, was 10.93%, the highest since the first quarter of 2012. Meanwhile, auto-loan delinquencies hit 4.43%, the highest since 2021.  It's a sign U.S. consumers have maxed out on their borrowing capacity and present a challenge to bullish crypto narratives, according to Thielen.  ""Weak U.S. consumer credit data, which dropped from $11.3 billion to $8.9 billion (below the expected $10 billion), mainly due to rare negative credit card debt and soaring delinquencies, signals a collapsing personal savings rate. This is significant for crypto as it suggests the fiat-to-crypto onramp will remain constrained due to maxed-out U.S. consumers,"" Thielen said in a note to clients.  Thielen also cited the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election, the slowing U.S. economy, and dwindling AI hype as risks to the crypto market. Both bitcoin and Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI, bottomed out with the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.  Shares in NVDA peaked in June near $140 and have since dropped to $98, according to charting platform TradingView.

32170050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633787,1723098627,"Solana (SOL) Jumps 39% From Crash Low, But Is This Rally Sustainable?","Solana has observed a sharp rally of 39% from the crash low. Here’s what the data says regarding whether this run can continue further or not. Solana Has Breached The $153 Mark After Recovery Continuation In Past Day A few days back, Solana crashed alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market, dropping its price to a low of $110. Since this bottom, though, the asset has observed a sharp rebound, as it’s now back at the $153 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative: Shorts’ Turn To Get Squeezed? The chart below shows the recent trend in the SOL price. The graph shows that Solana has already recovered beyond the level it had been at prior to the crash. However, despite the 39% rally, SOL is still quite far from the $194 level it was at towards the end of July before the drawdown first began. As for whether it’s possible for the cryptocurrency to continue this recovery surge, perhaps market sentiment could provide some hints. SOL Rally Began When Sentiment Was In The Fear Territory According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the crowd sentiment around Solana had dipped into the fear territory during the recent price crash. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the ratio between the positive and negative sentiment around SOL has changed over the past few weeks. Historically, cryptocurrency has been more likely to move against the majority’s expectations, so a fearful sentiment can be a positive sign for its price. Thus, it’s not surprising to see that the asset found its rebound when the crowd was thrown into a panic. As is visible in the chart, the market had seen a positive sentiment spike instead towards the aforementioned high of July, which may have been why the coin had reached a top back then. With Solana observing its recovery and registering growth of another 10% in the last 24 hours, sentiment has improved, but the ratio is still not near the greed territory. Santiment notes that if the crowd disbelief continues, SOL can also potentially further its surge. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Recovers 20% As Network Lights Up With Activity As usual, one major obstacle to the rally can be selling from the whales. Data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert reveals that a Solana whale has just made a big deposit to the Coinbase exchange. In this transaction, the whale moved SOL worth almost $31.7 million from their private wallet to Coinbase. Investors usually deposit to exchanges when they want to use one of the services they provide, which can include selling. As such, the whale may have made this transfer to cash in on the recovery run.

Trump-themed memecoins are also down significantly over the last month.  Former President Donald Trump began the election cycle with a significant lead over the Democrats in the race for the White House. Now, with President Joe Biden out and Kamala Harris in as the party's candidate, that lead no longer exists.  Over the last month, Trump's odds of re-taking the White House have declined by 13 percentage points, while Harris' has increased by 34 percentage points – first as the likely successor to replace Biden in the last days of his campaign, and then as a political rival to Trump.  Trump is down from a high of 72% in the days after the first Presidential debate against Biden, which proved to be a disastrous affair for the Democrats, with Biden saying afterward he ""screwed up.""  This bump for Harris means that Polymarket is now aligned with polling. A poll conducted by CBS News between July 30 and August 2 gave Harris a 1 percentage point lead over Trump, which is a tie considering the poll's 2.1 percentage point margin of error. Polling aggregator 538 called the race a statistical tie around the same time, and in the days since, Harris has created a small edge in the polls.  Meanwhile, Trump-themed PoliFi tokens are also down in the last month with a deeper decline than polling or prediction markets.

32166659,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633905,1723093226,"XRP Prediction: Analyst Says Bullish Divergences Are Still Present, Here’s Why","XRP is currently trading slightly above the $0.50 price level, having experienced a significant price decline that erased most of its gains from the previous month. XRP managed to break through the $0.60 price level in a rally last month, although this surge was short-lived, lasting only a few days. Despite this setback, crypto analyst Javon Marks notes that there are still bullish divergence patterns present in the market, suggesting that another breakout could be on the horizon. These patterns indicate potential upward momentum, hinting at a possible recovery and a very optimistic price surge to new all-time highs. Bullish Divergences Are Still Present Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently shared an intriguing XRP technical analysis on the social media platform X with very bullish price prediction targets for the cryptocurrency. According to Marks, the crypto asset recently embarked on a bullish rally, which ultimately turned into an attempted breakout before reversing. The rally he was talking about was XRP’s price journey from $0.4321 in July, which saw it peak at $0.6534 on July 31, according to data from Coinmarketcap. As such, XRP ended up breaking out of a multi-year descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Explosive XRP Prediction: Analyst Foresees 20-Fold Gain This interesting pattern is shown on Javon Marks’ XRPUSD monthly candlestick chart. The descending triangle pattern, which has been in formation since XRP’s all-time high of $3.4 in 2018, is characterized by a series of lower highs and higher lows. Over the past six years, this pattern has become smaller, reflecting a period of consolidation and reduced volatility. This formation has tightened for the past few months, culminating in the minor breakout in July and a move towards a more bullish outlook for XRP. Although the XRP price now finds itself trading within this region of descending triangular pattern again, Javon Marks remains optimistic. Furthermore, he pointed out an interesting correlation between the price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is a popular momentum indicator. According to Marks, this correlation suggests that a successful bullish breakout is on the horizon. $XRP recently broke out temporarily which looks to have been only an attempted breakout but, between Price Action and the RSI, there are patterns still present through bull divergences that can suggest a successful bullish breakout to be on the horizon! On a conservative note,… https://t.co/BCrp9CwT6i pic.twitter.com/XGGiv0nBDp — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 6, 2024 Price Targets For XRP According to Marks, a successful breakout would translate into a price range between $15 and $18 on the conservative end. A more intense rally could result in XRP reaching above the $100 price level. His final target on the price chart is $260 for XRP, which represents an increase of 41,780% from the current price level. Rallies of such magnitude are not new to the crypto industry. As Marks noted, we’ve witnessed full logarithmic scale follow-throughs of this nature in the past. The last time the altcoin broke out of a similar multi-year descending triangle pattern was in 2017, resulting in a 42,000% price increase that culminated in its current all-time high. Related Reading: XRP Price Recovery Encounters Hurdles: Will It Prevail? However, realistically speaking, the crypto market has evolved since then. XRP is now one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, and a repeat of such a 40,000% surge is easier said than done. A lone XRP rally of that magnitude would propel XRP to overtake even Bitcoin in terms of market cap, which many market participants would deem impossible. Nevertheless, a sustained XRP rally in the near future is not out of the question. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5162 and is up by 3% in the past 24 hours.

42390660,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd51P9,1723091479,Did Sanctioning Tornado Cash Work?,"Sanctions are an effort to throw the weight of the U.S. dollar around to tamp down on activities the U.S. government thinks may be harmful – like money laundering to fund terror groups or rogue nations. The New York Federal Reserve thinks they had a real effect in crypto.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Sanctions effect  The narrative  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a report Wednesday finding that sanctions against Tornado Cash did actually have an effect on the crypto mixer's usage.  Why it matters  Obviously the big question around Tornado Cash is whether people have the right to transact privately online and how mixers fit into this right. Kind of a secondary question is whether these services are censorship-resistant, as some in the industry have claimed. The New York Federal Reserve took a look at the effect of the Office of Foreign Asset Control's 2022 sanctions against Tornado Cash.  Breaking it down  When a person or entity is sanctioned, OFAC is banning any U.S. persons – that is, a U.S. citizen in the U.S. or abroad, or resident of the U.S., or an entity that has a similar kind of tie to the U.S. – from engaging with the sanctioned party. After OFAC first blacklisted Tornado Cash, usage plummeted some 90%, TRM Labs reported in October 2023.  In the two years since it was first sanctioned, however, usage has grown back to some extent, Wednesday's NY Fed paper said.  ""While volumes and transaction diversity for larger Tornado Cash pools never fully recover to pre-sanction levels, we observe recovery in the smaller pools which may indicate retail users continue to find the product attractive,"" the report said.  Moreover, block proposers include Tornado Cash transactions, but block builders are excluding them, the paper continued.  You can read the paper at this link or my initial write up at this link, but I wanted to highlight two details the paper emphasized.  The first is this suggestion that sanctions compliance really kicked in after an August 2023 court ruling finding that Tornado Cash was indeed an entity for the purposes of OFAC's definitions. And the second, which is tied to the first, is that the main entities not complying with the sanctions have ideological issues – the true believers in censorship-resistance, in other words.  ""We find direct evidence of large builders switching to a cooperative posture following the ruling, giving credence to the idea that clarity around regulation is a pivotal factor to determining whether to cooperate,"" the paper said. ""With the ruling, we find two builders responsible for over half of the non-cooperative blocks, pointing to significant dependence on a few players to facilitate the settlement of Tornado Cash transactions. This heavy dependence on a few builders reveals a surprising level of fragility in the censorship-resistance of Ethereum.""  As a result, Tornado Cash's privacy functionality ""has deteriorated relative to before,"" the paper said, both because the transaction volume and number of different wallets engaging with the mixer have dropped over the past two years.  What's more, the paper said blocks that contain Tornado Cash transactions generate lower fees than blocks that don't. Validators that process these blocks are more likely to be ""motivated by philosophical reasons"" than pure profit, the paper said.  The overall paper is worth a read, as mixers increasingly draw scrutiny from international regulators over their potential uses by groups like Lazarus.

(The New Yorker) Over the weekend, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. published a video where he described how he picked up a dead bear cub with the intent of skinning it and keeping the meat, but instead ended up leaving it in Central Park staged to make it look like a bicyclist hit it. This was apparently to front-run a New Yorker article profiling him.  (Reuters) Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country after days of protests that saw over 300 students and other people killed amid protests over the nation's jobs quota system.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The price was able to surpass the $0.5150 and $0.550 resistance levels. It gained over 25% and broke many hurdles near the $0.600 level.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.700 resistance or even $0.720 in the near term. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $0.620 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.600 level. The next major support is at $0.5880. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.570 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4922 swing low to the $0.6477 high.

It is the first product of its kind in Brazil and among the first Solana-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally. The first was launched by Switzerland-based investment product provider 21Shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange in June 2021.  According to CVM’s database, the Solana-based ETF is in a pre-operational stage, so it has yet to be approved by the Brazilian stock exchange, B3. Exame, a local news organization, added that the product would follow the CME CF Solana Dollar Reference Rate, created by CF Benchmarks with the support of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  Brazilian asset manager QR Asset will offer the ETF, while Vortx, a local fintech focused on capital markets, will serve as its manager, the report stated.  “This ETF reaffirms our commitment to offering quality and diversification to Brazilian investors. We are proud to be global pioneers in this segment, consolidating Brazil's position as a leading market for regulated investments in crypto assets,” said Theodoro Fleury, manager and chief investment officer of QR Asset, in a statement, the report added.  For its part, the largest South American country has also been fertile ground for ETFs. B3 listed a Bitcoin ETF and an Ethereum ETF between 2021 and 2022, while it started offering BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in March 2024.

32163474,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633835,1723087809,Hidden Bitcoin Agenda? CryptoQuant CEO Weighs In On Ongoing Rise In BTC Accumulation,"Over the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a significant surge in whale accumulation. Ali highlighted that the “number of BTC addresses holding 100+ BTC increased from 15,913 to 16,006 during the recent correction. While this trend is noteworthy because it suggests whales bought the dip, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, an on-chain data aggregator, has spotlighted that it also suggests a calculated buildup of Bitcoin by influential players in the shadows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Still Intact? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The Hidden Bitcoin Agenda Revealed Ki Young Ju’s observations stem from his analysis of Bitcoin transactions over the last month, revealing a massive shift of nearly half a million BTC into what is described as “permanent holder wallets.” Ju noted: I’m pretty sure something is happening behind the scenes. 404,448 Bitcoin have moved to permanent holder addresses over the past 30 days, and it’s clearly accumulation. We’ll know within a year. This transfer, amounting to roughly $22.94 billion, signals routine market behavior and a strategic accumulation that hints at plans by major financial entities or even state actors. This activity was first hinted at three weeks prior when Ju reported an unusual movement of 385,000 BTC into cold storage, highlighting a pattern of behavior among Bitcoin whales that diverges from typical market operations. #Bitcoin is in an accumulation phase. Over the past month, 358K BTC has moved to permanent holder addresses. In July, global spot ETF inflows were 53K BTC. Though not all remaining BTC is in custody wallets, whales are clearly accumulating. And it’s an unprecedented level. pic.twitter.com/Cyl2ZVhIIX — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2024 What Are The Consequences? The implications of such heavy accumulation are quite profound. Ju said this could be the prelude to a major revelation, where traditional financial institutions, companies, or even governments might disclose substantial Bitcoin acquisitions made during this period. He suggests that within a year, the public could learn that these entities have been quietly building their Bitcoin reserves throughout the third quarter of 2024. This strategic accumulation, Ju theorizes, could be a move to secure a substantial stake in the world’s flagship cryptocurrency in anticipation of or in response to broader economic shifts. This theory is further boosted by distractions in the crypto space, such as the German government’s sale of BTC and the U.S. government’s disposal of Bitcoin related to the Mt. Gox debacle.

The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could rise steadily if it clears the $2,550 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Struggles Below $2,550 Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,250 resistance level.

A high was formed at $2,555 before there was a downside correction. The price declined below the $2,450 level. It dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,911 swing low to the $2,555 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair tested the $2,320 support and is currently rising. Ethereum price is still trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A close above the $2,550 level might send Ether toward the $2,685 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,865. An upside break above the $2,865 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,000 resistance zone in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $2,350. The first major support sits near the $2,300 zone. A clear move below the $2,300 support might push the price toward $2,150 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,911 swing low to the $2,555 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,050.

BTC could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $58,000 resistance zone in the near term. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $55,500 and $56,500 levels. The price is trading above $57,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $56,850 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might struggle to clear the $58,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Could Continue Higher Bitcoin price started a recovery wave above the $53,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to clear the $55,500 and $56,500 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $61,040 swing high to the $49,110 swing low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $56,850 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The bulls are now attempting more upsides above $57,500. Bitcoin price is now trading above $57,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $58,250 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $61,040 swing high to the $49,110 swing low. The first key resistance is near the $58,800 level. A clear move above the $58,800 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $59,500. The next major hurdle sits at $60,000. A close above the $60,000 resistance might spark bullish moves. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $62,000 resistance. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to recover above the $58,250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $56,400 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The first major support is $54,500. The next support is now near $53,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $52,000 support zone in the near term.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up almost 6% today, with the rebound slowing to a mere 2% increase since yesterday. However, this has not deterred investors from keeping their eyes on DOT as it slowly makes its way upward. Related Reading: Bloody Monday: Cardano Not Spared From Bloodbath, Suffers 30% Loss This is partly due to Polkadot’s continuing on-chain developments that helped ease market anxieties after the broader sell-off that happened this week. We might see more positive movement in the coming days investors and traders are convinced that the sell-off is a one-of-event. Tuning In To On-Chain News For Polkadot On-chain, the Polkadot’s parachains are actively contributing to the network’s overall growth. Polkadotters, an X account dedicated to sharing Polkadot developments, shared several developments this week. Bifrost’s July report is among the developments that show incredible growth for the protocol. The monthly report shows that Bifrost grew by a substantial margin. By the end of July, Bifrost had a total of $80.8 million in total value locked (TVL) and over 8 million voucher DOT (vDOT) minted. vDOT is the protocol’s representation of DOT staked on the platform and according to this high number, DOT is an active token used in staking on Bifrost. Peaq, a parachain focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secured a partnership with Roam, a fellow DePIN-focused platform. The partnership covers Roam’s launch of its network and native token on the Peaq ecosystem, contributing to Polkadot’s growth through increasing activity on Peaq and its network. DOT Tries To Breach $4.61 DOT is currently attempting to break through the $4.61 ceiling, resuming yesterday’s action by trying to flip the ceiling to a solid support level. However, this maybe thwarted by the bears as the market currently favors the downward pressure felt by investors and traders in the short term. Despite this, positive developments can alleviate the shaken confidence brought by the market’s sharp decline this week. The only question remaining will be how big the gains can be if the rebound continues. If DOT bulls are successful in this breakthrough, the token will have the necessary foundation for future upward movement. Bulls can emulate DOT’s movement in late 2020 where they settled on $4.61 before the market’s bull run. However, market volatility will still be a huge problem for DOT’s performance. Related Reading: Aave Protocol Unfazed By Market Jitters, Surges 21% If the major cryptocurrencies continue their rebound to pre-overreaction levels, then there might be a chance for DOT to reclaim $6.16 in the long term.

Saylor’s Bitcoin Vision Unshaken In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Saylor disclosed that he has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the past several years and has no plans to sell any of his holdings soon. “I continue to acquire more,” Saylor stated. “I think it’s a great capital investment asset for an individual, family, institutional corporation or country. I can’t see a better place to put my money.” Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Bottom Is Not In, Will Price Crash Below $50,000 Again? Saylor’s personal BTC stash is in addition to the over 226,000 BTC held by MicroStrategy, the enterprise software firm he co-founded and led as CEO until recently transitioning to the executive chairman role. MicroStrategy began amassing Bitcoin in 2020 to hedge against inflation and has since emerged as the largest publicly traded corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. The company’s Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at around $13 billion. Despite the recent volatility and price declines in the cryptocurrency market, Saylor remains unwavering in his conviction about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He views it as a superior store of value and investment asset compared to traditional options like cash, bonds, or even gold. ‘Death Cross’ Analysis & Short-Term Sell Signals Amid Monday’s broader market crash, market expert Timothy Peterson noted in a social media post that Bitcoin had formed a “death cross,” where the 50-day average exceeds the 200-day average. Interestingly, Peterson notes that this rare event has only taken place eight times since 2015. Historical data analyzed by Peterson revealed that Bitcoin experienced a positive outcome approximately 62% of the time following previous’ death cross’ instances. Notably, downturns were observed during bear market years such as 2014, 2019, and 2022. Nevertheless, Peterson expressed skepticism about a repeat of such downturns, suggesting that Bitcoin plummeting below $40,000 by year-end seems improbable. Instead, he projected a potential surge to over $90,000 by the year’s close, drawing parallels to past bullish trends following similar patterns. Related Reading: Cardano Price Crash Below $0.3: Is It Time For You To Buy ADA?
