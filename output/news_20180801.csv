The exchange's U.K. division will now offer same-day deposits and withdrawals from the platform, allowing transfers to happen almost immediately. In a statement, Coinbase U.K. chief executive Zeeshan Feroz wrote that this system will replace the previous method, which had customers convert cryptocurrencies into euros before converting a second time into pounds.  The old process took several days, he said, an aspect that the new process will skip altogether.  Feroz explained:  ""Customers will now be able to deposit and withdraw pound sterling and use it to directly buy and sell cryptocurrency – for the first time. Customers will not only benefit from increased speed, but reduced cost as well. By no longer having to convert funds from GBP to euros and vice versa to add and remove funds, there will be no more exchange rates.""  The rollout of this new system is ongoing. Several customers already have access to GBP wallets, and all U.K. customers will receive access over the next few weeks.  Both individual and institutional customers will benefit, Feroz said, adding that the new wallets ""will allow investors to make almost immediate transfers, an essential feature for traders and hedge funds who need to be able to enter and exit their positions quickly.""

42429442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLysHh,1533147925,"Telegram Tech Promised In ICO Vulnerable to Attack, Researchers Say","With $1.7 billion in the bank following its initial coin offering (ICO), Telegram has released its first crypto-friendly feature – but security researchers are skeptical.  As detailed in a blog post published today, Virgil Security, a U.S.-based startup, has identified several weaknesses in the new identity verification app, called Passport. While the company praised Telegram for publishing the application's API as open source, allowing the code to be checked by other experts, Virgil Security detailed two problems with the app: how it encrypts data and how it protects stored data.  ""Their commitment to openness gives security practitioners the opportunity to review their implementation and, ideally, help improve it,"" Virgil Security's Alexey Ermishkin wrote on the company's blog, adding:  ""Unfortunately Passport's security disappoints in several key ways.""  Telegram has never publicly announced or verified the existence of its billion-dollar ICO. But as documents started to leak earlier this year, it became clear that the company, more widely known for its chat app, aimed to compete with many of the services – from filesharing to encrypted browsing – that crypto startups had already proposed.  Plus, it wanted to bring blockchain-based payments to the Telegram chat app, which in recent years has become popular among the crypto community.  Payments and identity verification go hand-in-hand, making Passport a natural early offering from the company. Plus, disrupting the digital ID incumbents like Equifax, which keep data in centralized databases vulnerable to breach and abuse, has long been a shared goal of the cryptocurrency community, so it's is a fitting place for Telegram to start.  In its blog post about the new product, Telegram promises that ""your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using end-to-end encryption. It is encrypted with a password that only you know, so Telegram has no access to the data you store in your Telegram passport.""  It goes on to promise that, eventually, this data will be stored in a decentralized fashion, Identity was one of the components of the ambitious blockchain-based system that Telegram promised in its ICO technical whitepaper.  But from the looks of Virgil Security's findings, Telegram needs to go back to the drawing board.  Brute force  Virgil Security's chief critique of Passport's security is the way it encrypts its passwords.  In announcing Passport, Telegram released a considerable amount of information about how the system works. In particular, Virgil Security focuses on the fact that Telegram uses SHA-512 to hash passwords.  ""It's 2018 and one top-level GPU can brute-force check about 1.5 billion SHA-512 hashes per second,"" they write.  It goes on to estimate that with enough computers, these passwords could be busted for anywhere from $135 to $5 each, depending on the strength of the passwords users chose.  However, before an attacker could begin its attack, it would need to first breach Telegram itself, as Virgil acknowledges.  ""To access the password hashes, the attack would have to be internal to Telegram. The ways that could happen are numerous — insider threat, spearphish, one rogue USB stick, etc,"" Virgil Security co-founder Dmitry Dain told CoinDesk.  And if lots of users begin using and in turn loading this data into Telegram's Passport, it will make the company a very attractive target.  Telegram has long been criticized for taking its own approach to cryptography, rather than relying on established standards. That said, Telegram's model has not been known to have been broken so far.  Unsigned data  The other danger to users Virgil Security critiques is a bit more nuanced: the fact that the data uploaded to Passport isn't signed.  By cryptographically signing data (an integral part of blockchain architecture broadly), users can quickly verify the data was loaded there by the person who claimed to have loaded it and it hasn't been changed.  Without a cryptographic signature, an attacker could change some part of the data and no one would know.  The Virgil Security post argues:  ""Now, when people see 'end-to-end encrypted,' they believe that their data will safely be sent to a third party without worries of it being decrypted or tampered with. Unfortunately, Passport users will have a false sense of confidence.""  Yet, with Virgil Security's critiques and the newness of the product, it should be relatively simple for Telegram to harden its security (Virgil Security is one provider of end-to-end encryption).  Telegram did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

42429455,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLysfh,1533140714,Bitcoin's Price Snaps Longest Monthly Losing Streak Since 2016,"Bitcoin's price posted gains in the first month of the third quarter, snapping the longest losing streak it's seen in nearly two years.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 20 percent in July, having registered losses in the previous two months - the first instance of back-to-back monthly drops since August 2016.  At press time, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $7,580, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At first instance, the rally seen in July may appear corrective in nature as BTC was looking oversold at the end of Q2, courtesy of a 58 percent drop in the first six months of the year.  However, a detailed look at crypto market metrics reveals the July rally had substance.  To start with, the BTC dominance rate surged in July as prices recovered from the yearly lows below 6,000, indicating the investors are likely betting on a sustained rally in BTC and are not merely buying the leading cryptocurrency to rotate money into other innovations.  Secondly, trading volumes showed signs of life, adding credence to BTC's inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal.  The average daily trading volume in July was $4.56 billion - up 5.11 percent compared to the average daily trading volume of $4.34 billion seen in June, according to CoinMarketCap data. Also, the average daily trading volume rose for the first time in July after three straight monthly declines.  Clearly, BTC looks primed for further gains after July's 20 percent price rise. Still, the bulls need to adopt a cautious stance as the major part of the rally was likely fueled by expectations that institutional money would flow into cryptocurrency waters if the US SEC approves bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs).  Thus, a BTC rally could unravel if the SEC rejects proposals for ETF approval. We have already seen the trailer of what could happen if the SEC continues to play spoilsport.  For instance, BTC prices fell sharply from $8,200 to $7,900 last Thursday on SEC's rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF and more importantly, the bullish momentum has weakened since Friday.  Looking ahead, BTC could continue to rise as increasing calls for bitcoin ETF will likely keep the cryptocurrency in demand. The technical studies are also biased toward the bulls.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin cleared the falling channel last week, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has ended.  What bulls need now is a convincing move through the 50-week moving average (MA), currently located at $8,430. If scaled, the cryptocurrency will likely attack $10,000 in a couple of weeks.

At the start of the June 4 roundtable on conduct standards for investment professionals, according to the transcript, SEC official Eric Werner introduced Jay Clayton, who was present at the event and currently serves as chairman of the SEC. Werner is the associate director of enforcement for the SEC's Fort Worth regional office.  In discussing Clayton's work at the agency, Werner highlighted an instance in which he walked into a ""heated"" discussion between the SEC chairman and an unnamed attorney about cryptocurrency – while also stressing Clayton's commitment to the issue in question.  Werner was quoted as saying:  ""In fact, the first time that I met the Chairman, I walked into a heated discussion he was having with an attorney in my office about the legitimacy and viability of cryptocurrencies. I was taken aback, honestly, about how much thought he had given to this space and the issues surrounding that. And what I have learned in the time working with him is that he has given every single issue that he has confronted that same dedication and thought process.""  Clayton, whose agency is one of several U.S. regulatory bodies taking a leading role in regulating the industry, particularly around initial coin offerings (ICOs), has remarked publicly on the technology in the past.  Indeed, it was during a hearing in February that Clayton stressed the difference between cryptocurrencies and ICO-derived tokens that are securities.  ""I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story,"" he said at the time.

Conservative MP Grant Shapps resigned from OpenBrix – and stood down as co-chair of a parliamentary blockchain group he co-founded – after the Financial Times' Alphaville discovered a secret deal between the MP and the blockchain company. While Shapps claimed in public filings that he was not being paid for his work, it appears that OpenBrix was to pay him in crypto tokens.  OpenBrix is a blockchain-based property platform which provides a decentralized system for real estate owners and participants to trade properties. The company is set to launch an ICO in December, according to the report.  Founder and CEO Shahad Choudhury told Alphaville that Shapps had signed on to serve on the advisory board as chair of governance for the company, and the MP had also signed a consultancy contract with OpenBrix. As part of this contract, Shapps wrote an article about the potential of the blockchain for the property market and attended an OpenBrix event.  The contract signed by Shapps hadn't required any further commitments until the ICO closes in December, according to Choudhury.  ""To be honest, [Shapps] had nothing to do until after the [ICO] ... His main role was the governance role after we've got the money. He could have quite happily not done anything and he'd still be governance chair,"" he said.  The company would have paid Shapps and four other advisors a total of 8 million BRIX tokens, which would have been worth roughly 2.8 million pounds or $3.7 million. It is unclear how many Shapps would specifically have received, but he has reportedly declined to accept any tokens as of press time.

Published Tuesday, the company's ""Pulse of Fintech 2018"" report states that traditional venture capital investments in U.S.-based blockchain companies in the first half of this year have already exceeded the total for 2017, though it did not specify numbers.  The impressive half-yearly figure was led by $100 million-plus funding rounds achieved by consortium startup R3 and crypto investment startup Circle Internet Finance, the report adds. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Venture Capital Tracker, Circle raised $110 million this year in a Series E round, while R3 raised $107 million.  KPMG U.S.'s Financial Services Digital and Fintech Lead Safwan Zaheer said in the report that ""there's more VC flow available than opportunities to invest — a sign of tremendous growth in the space.""  He added:  ""In particular, investments in blockchain doubled the first half of 2018 compared to 2017. Blockchain has the potential to transform banking and if banking systems were to be rewritten today they would be based on blockchain.""  The spike in blockchain investment can this year is attributed in the report to various factors, including the ""widespread applicability of blockchain to help harness efficiencies within financial institutions.""  The report states:  ""Blockchain's capabilities extend from recordkeeping and the registration of transactions to documentation management and supply chain management. While it has primarily been looked at from a banking and insurance point of view to date, the reality is blockchain opportunities abound and could enhance processes for any number of US and global businesses.""  KPMG concluded that it expects that blockchain – alongside so-called regtech and insurtech – will only gain momentum going forward.  As well as compiling research data on blockchain, KPMG has also been putting its money where its mouth is on the tech.  The Netherlands-based giant recently joined a trial project alongside the three other major auditors and 20 banks in Taiwan to trial a blockchain service for auditing public companies' financial reports.

The new API is now available at three off-the-shelf tiers, with costs ranging from $79 to $699.

Aside from the much anticipated API, several other ""highly-requested"" new features have also been added to CoinMarketCap, including data from derivatives markets, a new exchange ranking system, a daily newsletter and an update to its iOS app.  ""As our new product releases show, we are constantly updating so that we can help to grow adoption of cryptocurrency.

42429453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLysbh,1533121220,Bitcoin's Price Eyes Consolidation After 11% Decline,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor bout of consolidation following an 11 percent drop from recent highs above $8,500.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,570 on Bitfinex, having clocked a nine-day low of $7,469 earlier today.  A minor correction was overdue, though, as BTC had looked overbought a week ago at the two-month high of $8,507. Things took a turn for the worse in the last 24 hours, as BTC's overlong sideways action ended with a downside break and the bargain hunters failed to turn up at the key support of $7,800.  As a result, the cryptocurrency ended up retracing more than 35 percent of the rally from the June 24 low of $5,755.  Clearly, the tide has turned in favor of the bears in the last 24 hours, although oversold conditions and indecisiveness seen in the short duration charts will likely keep the cryptocurrency range-bound in the next 24 hours.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows BTC has created a doji candle at the key support of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), indicating indecision in the market.  A minor corrective rally to $7,800 could be on the cards if the current 4-hour candle closes above the previous doji candle's high of $7,587. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 30.00, signaling oversold conditions. So, this appears to be the most likely scenario.  That said, the gains will likely be short-lived as 5-candle and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Further, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the key support of $7,815 (July 27 low), meaning the bears are in control.  Acceptance below the immediate support of $7,456 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) would strengthen the bear case, although oversold conditions are seen capping losses around $7,400.  View  BTC is seen trading the narrow range of $7,400–$7,800 in the next 24 hours.  BTC's bull run from the June 24 low of $5,755 has ended, but only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA of $7,574 would confirm a bearish reversal.  On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above $8,000 would shift risk in favor of a rally to 200-day (MA), currently located at $8,405.

The funding effort was led by industry investment firm Blockchain Capital, the startup announced Wednesday. Tusk Ventures, Distributed Global, Reciprocal Ventures, Elefund, Slow Ventures, SV Angel, Kindred Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Breyer Capital, V1.VC, Kokopelli, Village Global, Chapter One and Digital Currency Group also contributed funds.  The money will be used to expand the startup's community team and start new research and development projects, according to CEO Alan Curtis. The funding effort comes after Radar Relay raised $3 million in December 2017 in a round also led by Blockchain Capital.  Radar Relay provides a wallet-to-wallet trading platform for ethereum tokens. Investors can connect their wallets to the platform to exchange tokens directly, without the startup ever taking any tokens into custody.  The company sought to raise the funds due to the platform's popularity, Curtis added. While the platform appears to be widely used, only a small portion comes from the U.S., which makes providing support for the vast majority of Radar Relay's users difficult.  The company now hopes to expand the team in order to help reduce some of these concerns.  Curtis explained:  ""We are supporting users from 150 countries. Of those countries, less than a third of our users are from the United States, which means we have to have core competencies in those [other] countries. Part of this funding is to establish a community ambassador program in those countries so we can serve our customers abroad.""  The community ambassador program will see Radar Relay hire individuals fluent in various languages and able to provide support for users, he said. But according to Curtis, the startup's beta phase saw a notable amount of activity from users.  ""We just left beta about a month ago and during that beta we saw $150 million in transaction volume,"" he said.  As such, expanding the team to meet support demand will be a key focus for the next month or so. Alongside that, Curtis added, the firm plans to start exploring how to support security tokens and crypto collectibles.

42429448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLysPh,1533110441,"The SEC's Hester Peirce Isn't a Bitcoin Champion, Just a Regulatory Realist","Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission shouldn't be acting as gatekeepers to new technologies like bitcoin, according to Commissioner Hester Peirce.  Peirce's remarks, made during an interview with CoinDesk, follow the agency's decision to confirm the 2017 rejection of a bitcoin-tied exchange-traded fund backed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, which reinforced the argument made in a publicly-issued dissent published alongside last week's announcement.  According to Peirce – who was sworn into office this past January and previously served as a staffer in the U.S Senate – the decision actually does a disservice to investors who are operating in the market.  ""From my perspective, we need to be mindful of what our role is, and it's not to be the ones who decide which innovations and which technologies get through and which ones don't,"" Peirce told CoinDesk.  She added:  ""I think that's a very dangerous position to put ourselves in, and I think it really does harm investors because it denies them opportunity.""  Perhaps unintentionally, Peirce's dissent made her a kind of hero in the eyes of the crypto community, netting comparisons to the effect comments made by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chief J. Christopher Giancarlo had on his own social media following earlier this year.  In the days following what were perceived as his positive remarks about the technology, Giancarlo was quickly dubbed ""Crypto Dad,"" a nickname that's now been extended to Peirce, who some have sought to label the ""Crypto Mom"" of seemingly supportive U.S. regulators.  But according to Peirce, her statement on Friday wasn't intended as a remark in support of bitcoin; rather it's in defense of new technologies and the people who invest time and resources in developing them.  ""I'm not taking a view whether bitcoin is going to succeed or fail. I'm excited by the fact that people are thinking of new ways to do things,"" Peirce told CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin is one of those things, blockchain is one of those things, other cryptocurrencies – but again I'm not weighing on any particular innovation or any particular asset.""  Requirements satisfied  According to Peirce, the Winklevoss proposal was worthy of approval.  In both interview and in her Friday statement, Peirce argued that Bats BZX Exchange, the exchange that filed the proposed rule change and pushed for a review following the rejection by agency staff in March 2017, had satisfied the requirements as dictated by the Securities Exchange Act.  She argued that it was wrong for the agency to focus on manipulation in the spot market for bitcoin and that the risks in question were taken into consideration when BZX made its pitch to the SEC.  ""I think the exchange, in making a decision to list this particular product, had looked into whether it thought investors were interested in it, and if investors are interested in it, I don't see why we should stop them from having access to it.""  Indeed, in her Friday statement, Peirce contended that ""approval of this order would demonstrate our commitment to acting within the scope of our limited role in regulating the securities markets.""  ""If someone is trying to raise money for a legitimate project, as long as the person explains what he's trying to do and what he's going to do with the money that reveals everything material that investors need to know – I don't think we should stand in the way,"" she later told CoinDesk.  Nothing to follow?  Support or not, Peirce's remarks earned her a big boost in Twitter followers, which as of the time of writing stands at roughly 15,800. Data from analytics site SocialBlade shows that at the start of the month, her follower count was at 1,275, representing a 1,139 percent increase.  And while she clarified that she's not an advocate for bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, she said she finds the work around the technology ""really exciting.""  ""It's not that I'm supporting any one asset, it's just that I'm supporting the ingenuity and the creativity and the curiosity that's motivating people to invest their time and money in these new technologies,"" she said. ""I think that's exciting. But again, I can't weigh in on any particular asset, including bitcoin.""  But according to Peirce, the crypto-faithful who are following her shouldn't expect too many fireworks.  She concluded:  ""It's that my guess is that most of those followers will find most of my tweets very boring. Most of them are about very dull regulatory things.""

At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,536 on Bitfinex, down 6.9 percent on the day, a figure that also finds the price breaking a key support level at $7,800.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been largely confined to a narrow price range of $7,673–$7,800, since it broke $8,000 yesterday. However, mounting sell volume continues to apply downward pressure, presenting a bleak outlook for bulls looking to take back the reins.  As such, bulls now are looking for 24-hour volume in excess of 2.4 billion, a threshold that would inspire hope of a reversal.  Hourly Chart  For those eyeing the charts, the extenuated bearish MACD demonstrates high price volatility and negative price action with the signal line (orange line) continuing to plow under.  The above chart shows:  Topside resistance began at $7,987, with the 55-period exponential moving average acting as a barrier.  Prices quickly fell away from between $7,987 and $7,802 with a massive spike in sell volume.  A cascading downside break from the trading range - bearish pattern  RSI is oversold at 22.9l; it could either turn bearish by dropping lower or it could create a bullish divergence whereby prices continue to drop from the previous hours but the RSI creates a higher high.  Extenuated bearish MACD - the extension created from the sell-off risks a possible drop further as the bearish histogram continues to play out.  Hourly RSI  The hourly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells of a fight currently playing out between the bulls and bears as it hangs at 23.142 at press time, presenting a possible weak bullish divergence before the closing period.  If it drops below 22.745 it would expose the lowest levels in three weeks - since July 10. This would create a short-term rebound whereby price action would need to be reassessed.  View  A drop below 22.745 RSI levels would likely expose bitcoin to a short-term rebound whereby price action would need to be re-analyzed  An extended MACD creates a new bearish cycle on the histogram - extending the sell-off period by a couple of hours.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $7,600 presents a bullish-to-bearish trend change and risks toppling the recent two-week climb.  Disclosure: The author hold USDT at the time of writing.

42429438,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLys9h,1533090639,"One Year Later, A Wave of Apps Is Emerging on Bitcoin Cash","Happy birthday, bitcoin cash.  Tuesday marks the one year anniversary of the first block on the crypto protocol that split from the bitcoin network, now the fourth largest by total value, after a years-long disagreement about the course the cryptocurrency should take.  For supporters, the main goal for the competing protocol was increasing the block size to allow more transactions, and in turn more users, all in an effort to make cryptocurrency competitive with more traditional payment rails. But whether or not that plan would work was very unclear, if not highly criticized.  Yet, over the course of the last few months, around the same time developers raised its block size parameter from 8 MB to 32 MB (bitcoin's limit is ~1 MB), bitcoin cash has seen an influx of new projects, including social media and tipping methods, taking advantage of its blockchain.  And since many of bitcoin's most active developers were adamantly against the tweaks bitcoin cash stood for, the developers behind the alternative protocol see these apps as proof their offering is competitive.  Looking through the applications that have sprung up, it's clear that those drawn to bitcoin cash are trying to carve out a unique role for the cryptocurrency – one that aligns with the initial value proposition touted.  Many of the applications target users with cheaper, faster payments, like Blockpress, a social media platform, and Centbee, a wallet that uniquely integrates a user's phone list.  But there's also some work being done to make bitcoin cash a more complex blockchain, able to handle smart contracts and token launches.  ""The tremendous accomplishments that the bitcoin cash community has managed to garner in a year of existence with a new ticker, wallets and an all-around ecosystem has been phenomenal, and we hope to continue and increase on this trajectory,"" Eli Afram, founder of Bitcoin Cash Australia, an advocacy group for the software, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""There's a lot happening. We truly have an app explosion in full effect.""  Space and fees  For many app developers, the lure to bitcoin cash is all about the protocol's unique selling proposition – basically, more space.  Take for instance Memo.cash, a social media platform resembling Twitter, where users can post short messages that get stored on the bitcoin cash blockchain never to be erased. Since bitcoin cash allows for more data to be stored in each transaction, supporters argue bitcoin isn't capable of supporting an app like Memo.cash.  ""Many of these apps cannot work on the bitcoin network, simply because of certain limiting changes that have been made to the codebase. For example, the OP_RETURN function on bitcoin cannot take the same size payload as bitcoin cash, meaning an app like Memo would have a restrictive message size limit,"" Afram explained.  On top of that, more space within blocks also means reduced fees for users sending transactions.  For GitCash, which launched just last month, this is integral since it allows users to tip – no matter how small the amount – developers for their work on Github. The project emphasizes that bitcoin cash's model allows fees to stay low even if usage increase dramatically.  And for developers that work on open-source projects generally on a volunteer basis, this app will likely be a welcome development.  Yet, the timing for these apps that focus on fees could be off.  Many of these developers compare the fees on bitcoin cash to those of bitcoin during the latter's most popular time period, whereby fees eclipsed $20 per transaction. But right now, bitcoin fees are rather low – sometimes even lower than those on bitcoin cash today.  Still, supporters say it's still worth it to build on bitcoin cash since it's future-proofed, meaning ready for a day when usage of the protocols picks up again.  Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com, a mining and wallet provider focusing on the cryptocurrency, told CoinDesk:  ""We think these community-driven networks can be very effective at moving the needle in the adoption of bitcoin cash as a medium-of-exchange, which is the primary reason it was forked and developed.""  Scalability concerns  But even while all this innovation happens, there's a big downside to increasing the amount of data kept on a blockchain – namely, it could make it much harder for users to run the underlying infrastructure that makes bitcoin cash tick.  That's why in bitcoin, many developers are heads down working on the lightning network, an in-progress layer for pushing transactions off-chain.  Despite these alternatives, bitcoin cash supporters think raising the block size is a better and easier solution.  ""[Bitcoin cash's] last hard fork increased the block-size to 32 MB, virtually eliminating the risk for any network congestion due to scaling and paved the way for a low-cost transaction super-highway,"" de la Torre said.  He believes that by making that one small change, bitcoin cash will avoid scaling problems other blockchains have faced.  Referring to the crypto cat app that went viral and caused high fees and transaction backlogs late last year, de la Torre said: ""I don't think we'll see the bitcoin cash network get clogged by CryptoKitties anytime soon.""  And for de la Torre, the fact that there's so much space within bitcoin cash means that plenty of other long-heralded use cases for cryptocurrency might finally see some pickup.  ""In countries such as Venezuela where monetary inflation is estimated above 40,000 percent, the utility of this new block space to open up fast, low-cost transactions as an alternative payment system to local fiat has been more than salient,"" de la Torre added.  Yet, that hasn't necessarily happened in practice so far – not for bitcoin cash, which only sees a fraction of the transactions the main bitcoin network sees and is worth about a tenth of bitcoin by market cap, but also not for bitcoin either.  The 'wormhole'  And not only are developers thinking about high-value payments use cases, but the use case that garnered incredible attention last year – the initial coin offering (ICO) – is also being considered for bitcoin cash as well.  Pointing to a long-standing upgrade proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone, Afram told CoinDesk: ""There are teams racing to produce a token protocol that will enable countless new use cases, which I'm very much looking forward to.""  And a couple weeks ago, cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain released a proposal for adding a token mechanism to bitcoin cash, perhaps eerily dubbed ""Wormhole.""  The idea with behind these proposals is to make it possible to spin up new tokens on bitcoin cash.  But just as ICOs broadly have taken vast amounts of criticism, the idea is sparking controversy among bitcoin cash users and developers too. Some have argued that the birth of tokens on the network will poorly impact the protocol and even worse, could introduce vulnerabilities that could put users at risk.  Still, that isn't stopping several developers from trying to implement the upgrade into bitcoin cash's next hard fork, coming in the fall.  As such, crypto tokens could be the next step towards differentiating bitcoin cash from its rival, bitcoin, and adding features that allow it to compete with even more protocols.
