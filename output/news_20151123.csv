42378417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i99V,1448316280,Ethereum Swaps Tool Added to Microsoft's Blockchain Sandbox,"ConsenSys has added a new decentralized application (Dapp) to its Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service toolkit available on Microsoft’s cloud computing platform Azure.  Called the Ethereum Total Return Swap (eTRS), the application aims to serve as both a functional and an example use case that will allow internal tech teams at Microsoft Azure clients to better understand and utilize the toolkit, first announced in October.  Marley Gray, Microsoft’s director of technology strategy for financial services explained that the offering part of the tech giant’s ongoing partnership with ConsenSys, noting that eTRS aims to ""demonstrate the power"" of the Ethereum blockchain through a step-by-step guide for how a swap agreement can be facilitated on the platform.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ”This solution allows our customers to stand up a complex reference implementation on the blockchain that can fundamentally change how the swaps market functions. […] The ability to rapidly develop and express existing financial products using this platform can help ignite innovation in the industry.  Gray said that eTRS will allow clients to create swap agreements as well as monitor the risk valuations, funding and pricing of the swap in real time. The offering was previewed as part of Microsoft Connect 2015, a conference held from 18th to 19th November in New York.  In statements, ConsenSys said that the offering will illustrate how the Ethereum blockchain can complement bitcoin by expanding the capabilities of blockchains beyond value transfer to “next-generation applications”.  Founded in 2014, ConsenSys describes itself as a distributed Dapp “production studio” focused on offering a developer sandbox for the Ethereum network that enables those using its tools to build without working with the core protocol.  The startup, which claims 60 members worldwide, also works to create second-level applications built on Ethereum that showcase how it can be leveraged for use cases such as peer-to-peer lending, identity and reputation, while also serving as separate products as part of its “hub-and-spoke model”.  About eTRS  On the surfact, ConsenSys’s take on total return swaps functions similarly to existing agreements, wherein one party makes payments to another based on the return of a reference asset.  Unique to the cryptoswap offering, however, is that ConsenSys uses elements of the Ethereum blockchain that allow for referencing client accounts, technology it says will help fulfill know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements digitally.  ConsenSys CFO of enterprise capital markets James Slazas suggested the release will help highlight the potential cost savings Microsoft’s clients could capture by building similar applications with its toolkit, which is based on its work building identity tools into the Ethereum blockchain itself.  ""It's not just to use but to get their minds thinking about, if I had a global system for decentralized identity, that means I don’t have the cost of onboarding new clients, so I can change the level of client we take on, because the cost reduction occurs,"" Slazas said.  In eTRS, Ethereum is then used to automate collateral requirements based on the price of the assets used. The creditworthiness of those involved in the transaction will, in turn, be updated on a reputation system that is adjusted based on performance.  ""Finally, we will reconcile the counterparties accounting records with triple-entry accounting on Ethereum, whereby the third journal entry is recorded on an immutable blockchain drastically reducing the possibility of fraud,"" the company explained.  Similar to a number of startups seeking to use blockchains to lower transaction settlement times, ConsenSys said its “cryptoswaps” have t+0 settlement, completing days faster than the industry standard t+3.  Live demonstration  Slazas explained that the eTRS was launched in conjunction with the Microsoft Connect conference so that the ConsenSys team could make its offering more “relatable” to potential enterprise users.  “We highlighted each of the areas that the blockchain is having impact. The eTRS isn’t just you and I call each other and agree to some terms to get [a swap] settled,” he explained.  He went on to describe how he introduced eTRS as a project designed to work with bank customers and that had gone through KYC processing.  “We are able to use that reputation and identity to enter into the transaction. That makes trading much more streamlined and it has an impact on banks,” he continued, adding:  “It wasn’t ‘Hey we’re trying to sell the Dapps to these banks.’ It was more to be able to show them what could be done.”  Slazas said that as many as 50 individuals attended the live demonstration.

42378400,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i8rt,1448311860,BIS: Digital Currencies Could Disrupt Central Banking Model,"Digital currencies could disrupt the ability of central banks to exercise control over the economy or issue money should the technology scale, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in a new report released today.  The BIS  , a financial entity cooperatively owned by the world’s central banks, said that it has been looking at the technology as early as November 2013, and in February of this year the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) asked a working group to draft the report it published today.  The report  outlines how digital currencies like bitcoin as well as its underlying decentralized ledger, the blockchain, could impact central banks and the broader global financial system.  While stressing that such outcomes are incumbent on ""widespread adoption"", the BIS paints a possible future in which its ability to conduct monetary policy, assess the flow of money or even generate revenue on the currency a central bank issues becomes limited.  As the report notes:  ""A widespread substitution of banknotes with digital currencies could lead to a decline in central bank non-interest paying liabilities. This, in turn, could lead central banks to substitute interest paying liabilities, reduce their balance sheets, or both. The result could be a reduction in central bank earnings that constitute central bank seigniorage revenue.""  The ability of central banks to gather data on money aggregates, or measurements of the money supply, could also be hampered should digital currency use become widespread.  ""Significant expansion of digital currencies could also raise a number of technical issues regarding the appropriate definition of monetary aggregates, especially if the digital currencies were not denominated in the sovereign currency,"" the report notes. ""In a monetary policy regime heavily focused on the growth of monetary aggregates, such measurement difficulties could create some complications for monetary policy implementation.""  Some of the report's conclusions echo past work from the BIS, which in October 1996 published a report on the emergence of electronic money schemes. In particular, the new report points back to speculation on what could occur if banknotes are replaced by digital forms of money.  ""As discussed in depth in the 1990s, the effect of digital currencies on the implementation of monetary policy will depend on the change in demand for bank reserves,"" the report states. ""If the substitution is large and the interconnection is weak, then monetary policy may lose efficacy.""  Government-issued digital currency  On the subject of whether central banks should consider issuing their own currencies based on a distributed ledger, the BIS went so far as to acknowledge that some functions of a central bank could be rendered obsolete.  ""The emergence of distributed ledger technology could present a hypothetical challenge to central banks, not through replacing a central bank with some other kind of central body but mainly because it reduces the functions of a central body and, in an extreme case, may obviate the need for a central body entirely for certain functions,"" the report’s authors state.  Specifically, there may be no need for a central bank to issue currency if a distributed ledger is backing a widely used digital money, says the BIS.  ""In some extreme scenarios, the role of a central body that issues a sovereign currency could be diminished by protocols for issuing non-sovereign currencies that are not the liability of any central institution,"" the report states.

Bitcoin Group  filed its second supplementary prospectus on Friday, 20th November, a move that pushed the firm’s IPO closing date to 8th January of next year.  According to the company, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has prompted the firm to hire ""an appropriately qualified independent expert"" who, according to the note, will:  ""...respond to issues raised by ASIC concerning the Replacement Prospectus including how the Bitcoin industry operates, [and] the variables underpinning the Bitcoin Mining Equation...and its impact on BCG, and information setting out future performance of BCG. BCG is appointing an independent expert to prepare a report in relation to these matters.”  Bitcoin Group has been required by ASIC to file new documentation over the past few months and has been scolded publicly amid its IPO push, which has seen delays in the past.  Bitcoin Group, based in Melbourne, operates its own bitcoin mine and claims to possess as much as 6 petahash in capacity. It previously focused its efforts on bitcoin trading.  Neither ASIC or Bitcoin Group responded to requests for further comment as of press time.
