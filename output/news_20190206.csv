42381497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myYz,1549490447,The Collapse of QuadrigaCX: What We Know (And What We Don't),"QuadrigaCX, the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, made headlines the world over last week when it announced it was filing for creditor protection and owed upwards of $130 million or more to its customers.  The long-suffering exchange has had banking issues for more than a year, and customers complained they could not easily withdraw fiat or crypto over the past several months. Fears that the exchange may be insolvent or running a scam were exacerbated by an announcement that its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, died of Crohn's disease while in India.  After weeks of poor communication (and several days of the website going offline entirely), the exchange announced it was filing for a stay of proceedings in an attempt to head off any customer lawsuits while it tries to recoup its funds and figure out its next steps.  The situation as a whole carried echoes of the Mt Gox scandal, both in terms of the degree of global interest (many mainstream news outlets and publications have run stories, centered primarily around the stated inability to access customers funds following Cotten's death) and the scale of future uncertainty.  As CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, the legal picture surrounding the exchange is beginning to solidify. A Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge granted the exchange its application, giving it a 30-day stay of proceedings to try and recover any cryptocurrencies, as well as find other avenues for reimbursing customers.  Yet many questions swirl around the proceedings, further fed by the theories propagated by QuadrigaCX customers, observers and critics. Below, we explore some of the biggest questions as they currently exist.  What we know    Quadriga owes a lot of money    QuadrigaCX says it owes roughly 115,000 people some C$190 million in both fiat and crypto. These 115,000 customers are part of a larger group of nearly 300,000 individual accounts created, though it appears that the remainder doesn't currently store any funds on the exchange.  In a court filing last week, Cotten's widow and the executor of his estate Jennifer Robertson claimed that neither she, nor anyone else on the QuadrigaCX team, knew how to access the exchange’s crypto reserves – or indeed, where they might even be located. The exchange holds roughly 26,500 bitcoin ($92.3 million USD), 11,000 bitcoin cash ($1.3 million), 11,000 bitcoin cash SV ($707,000), 35,000 bitcoin gold ($352,000), nearly 200,000 litecoin ($6.5 million) and about 430,000 ether ($46 million), totaling $147 million, according to the affidavit.  Cotten reportedly conducted all of his business operations out of an encrypted laptop, which Robertson has been unable to gain access to. While a consultant has been hired to try and break into the laptop, this expert has so far been unsuccessful.  While the timing of the move hasn't been confirmed, the laptop will ultimately be given to professional services firm EY, which was appointed monitor by the court.  Compounding the exchange’s problems is the fact that much of its fiat reserves are tied up after a well-documented legal fight with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. There is no timeline yet for when those funds might be restored.  All told, the exchange estimates that it owes customers about $53 million in fiat and $137 million in crypto (in U.S. dollars).    Not all of Quadriga's funds are in crypto    According to its court filing, about $70 million CAD ($53 million USD) of its funds are held by payment processors in fiat.  Of that, about $30 million CAD ($23 million USD) is held by payment processor Billerfy in the form of bank drafts. Billerfy has explained in the past that it was having difficulty finding banking partners to endorse these drafts, preventing it from releasing the funds back to the exchange.  During the discussion in court Tuesday, Quadriga attorney Maurice Chiasson, a partner with law firm Stewart McKelvey, asked whether EY – the monitor appointed to oversee Quadriga's efforts – might be able to assist in finding a banking partner to endorse the drafts. It is unclear whether this is a possibility, and EY declined to comment when reached.  In an email, Billerfy managing director and owner José Reyes told CoinDesk he had not yet heard from EY, and was not sure what the next steps would be now that the company has been appointed as monitor.  He added in a later email that he has not had any luck finding banking partners to endorse the drafts yet.  Lawyers for Quadriga also control a further $5 million held by several New Brunswick, Canada-based companies. However, these funds may be used to organize bankruptcy processes and other administrative tasks, Chiasson explained.    Quadriga has 30 days under the existing order    Tuesday's stay grants Quadriga 30 days to try and recover its missing cryptocurrency reserves, as well as unlock its fiat holdings and look for other assets that can generate revenue. In an early filing, EY indicated that the exchange could sell its trading platform as one such revenue generator.  An initial report will be due on March 1, and another hearing will be held at the end of the 30-day period to determine what progress Quadriga is making.  It's possible that the exchange will file for an extension to the stay during that hearing, though Chiasson said in court Tuesday that ""it is our hope that as and when significant events develop, [such as if] we find a significant store of coins, we would immediately [begin distribution].""  There will be a separate hearing to determine which law firm will be appointed as representative counsel on Feb. 14, though no lawsuit can be filed while the stay is in effect.  A request for clarification to Bennett Jones LLP, one law firm vying to be appointed, was not returned by press time.  What we don’t know  Still, numerous questions surround the entire situation, including whether the exchange ever had the funds it claims are currently locked up in cold storage.    If there are really any cold wallets    One of the most concerning claims in Thursday’s affidavit was that the team is currently unable to access cold wallets holding Quadriga’s reserves. However, prominent voices in the crypto community are casting doubt on this assertion.  MyCrypto’s founder and CEO Taylor Monahan told CoinDesk that she would be ""very surprised to learn of a cold storage ether address"" based on how the exchange managed its holdings with three primary wallets.  ""Almost all of the largest transactions are either sent to exchanges or amongst three ‘primary’ addresses … I haven’t seen anything indicating a large reserve or cold storage mechanism being used on the Ethereum chain,"" she explained.  That does not mean the exchange has no cold storage wallets at all – but while it is possible, Monahan explained that she would find it “improbable” based on the exchange’s past practices.  The differences in what the blockchain data appears to be saying about Quadriga’s holdings and what the exchange claims have led to further questions about the existence of the funds at all, sparking allegations of fraud on the part of the exchange and its operators.    What’s the deal with the multi-sig wallets    In 2015, Cotten said the exchange used multi-signature wallets as a security precaution. Multi-sig wallets typically see multiple parties maintaining control of a part of a wallet’s private key.  In such a scenario, two or more of the parties would have to sign a transaction before it can be approved. However, no other Quadriga employees appear to have announced themselves as able to sign off on transactions.  In other words, the question remains whether there was a multi-sig wallet, where Cotten single-handedly managed all of the signatures, or if this security precaution was not actually taken.    What comes next    As stated, Quadriga now has 30 days of breathing room to try and find its missing coins, as well as unfreeze its fiat holdings.  What is less clear is how the exchange might proceed.  An email account set up by EY Canada to accept messages from Quadriga creditors was not functional as of press time. While Quadriga has released a new statement on its website, specifics were not included.  Instead, the website's statement noted that ""we are in the early stages of a long process,"" and that the work was ongoing.  ""What we can tell you is that the CCAA process will allow QuadrigaCX to keep all options open to attempt to maximize the funds available for the company's stakeholders. We will provide further updates to the extent possible,"" the statement reads.  Rumors and speculation    Whether Cotten is really dead    Despite two separate documents stating that Cotten died on Dec. 9, 2018 in Jaipur, the capital city of the Indian state of Rajasthan, online conspiracy theories continue to claim that he faked his death in order to pull an exit scam.  J.A. Snow Funeral Home, which issued a statement of death on Dec. 12, refused to confirm or deny that it actually issued the document. Calls to the Nova Scotia Department of Vital Statistics, which tracks life events (including deaths) were not returned by press time.  Separately, the Government of Rajasthan's Directorate of Economics and Statistics produced a death certificate for Cotten on Dec. 13, which CoinDesk obtained and published Tuesday. No cause of death was listed and further inquiries were not returned.  Angel House, an organization which builds orphanages in India and has been affiliated with Cotten in the past, did not pick up when called.  Anna Baydakova and Yogita Khatri contributed reporting.

Thakrar wrote in a follow-up message:  ""Token Foundry is focused on building sustainable decentralized networks and enabling purchasers to safely buy vetted tokens. ... We learned that there is a long tail market of potential purchasers that do not know how to participate in the Web 3.0 world, and as a result, we are building additional software to help responsibly bridge that gap.""  Observers have questioned the fate of the company since founder and CEO Harrison Hines left ConsenSys in August 2018, just four months after Token Foundry debuted. Hines now runs a company called Terminal Systems, which employs at least five other ConsenSys alums, according to LinkedIn.  ""There's no one left at Token Foundry – anyone still employed under that banner actually works on ConsenSys Digital Securities,"" a person with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity. ""They just haven't killed the brand yet because it'll be a bad look.""  For his part, Hines told CoinDesk in a text message: ""Having a good founder/leader who is passionate about the vision and the mission is critical to a startup's success and keeping the team motivated and together.""  Perhaps alluding to ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin, who reportedly owns the large majority of each of the venture studio's startups, Hines added:  ""I'll never start a company again that someone else has control of.""  Revenue driver?  Token Foundry launched in April 2018, and by summer Lubin was painting the ""spoke"" as a standout success.  At an event in Brooklyn on August 20, CoinFund founder Jake Brukhman pressed Lubin in an on-stage interview to share which of ConsenSys' 50 projects were making money. Lubin named Token Foundry as one of only two mentioned as strong revenue generators.  “The company projected revenue of $50 to $100 million for 2018,” a source told CoinDesk. ""Based on the sales that they did raise, that is very unlikely.""  The old Token Foundry site shows four finished sales, though only three successfully made it to the finish line. Dether, which allowed physical shops to sell cryptocurrencies, raised $13.4 million in February 2018. Gambling startup Virtue Poker raised $18.5 million in May. Then a protocol for improving location services, FOAM, raised $16.5 million August. Finally, media startup Civil failed to reach its soft cap, returning all contributions (most of which came from ConsenSys itself) to participating investors.  Like any service provider, Token Foundry would have only earned a small fraction of any of the sales. The pace did not appear to be enough to justify its staffing, based on subsequent news.  The spoke let go of seven people in November, according to The Block, to whom Thakrar said: “We are expanding our offerings and will continually reassess our positioning to ensure Token Foundry’s future success in this dynamic space.""  Thakrar sent nearly the exact same message to CoinDesk later that month, adding: ""Our goal remains the same: connecting platforms with existing participants that will add the most value to a given network, lessening the barriers for well-seasoned participants, and building incentives for new participants.""  Meanwhile, a broader contraction was underway at ConsenSys, as CoinDesk reported in December. It's unknown whether the cuts associated with Lubin's vision for “ConsenSys 2.0” further shrunk Token Foundry, but another source with knowledge of the company said that most of the original members of the team are either gone or looking for a way out.  Shifting mission  Those that remain with the project may be steering it toward the token economy's latest point of focus: security tokens.  ConsenSys Digital Securities  is a part of Token Foundry, according to FINRA, the financial industry's self-regulatory body.  FINRA shows CDS licensed as a broker-dealer, that is, a company that deals in registered securities. This is an important distinction, because last year in advance of the token sale for Civil, ConsenSys and Token Foundry were strongly pushing the message that ""consumer tokens"" could dodge securities law.  That proposition was not tested, at least not on Token Foundry's watch, as the Civil sale failed last October. Civil's new offering will eschew Token Foundry entirely.  The transition of Token Foundry to something more in line with typical securities law is reflected in the various versions of the project's new website.  Late last month, its home page still expressed the original mission of the project, with the following tag line: ""Token Foundry is a global platform for everyone to safely buy vetted tokens.""  Days later, with a complete redesign, the text sounded more like a venture capital firm: ""Token Foundry partners with ambitious startups and enterprises who are building infrastructure and apps for Web 3.0.""  Then, by the following Monday, it had a third message that seemed to hew closer to the original: ""Last year, Token Foundry became the standard for issuing and purchasing well designed tokens. This year we are adding new ways to conduct cryptocommerce, from subscriptions to token issuance.""  But according to Thakrar, CDS is just part of the larger token strategy at ConsenSys. He described it as a discrete team working to ""build both the primary and secondary markets for tokenized assets.""  Leigh Cuen contributed reporting.  Update: This report has been updated to reflect that Jay Thakrar's job title is head of operations, not chief operating officer.

Topping up a wallet with ether should take “less than a minute,” according to Opera.  Charles Hamel, Opera’s crypt product lead, said:  “We think that the next important phase for crypto will come from usage and that for it to reach wider adoption, it has to be easy to buy and easy to use.""  Additionally, users in Sweden will get a discounted fee of 2.5 percent from Safello for a limited time, while Norway and Denmark users will receive a discounted fee of 5 percent, according to the announcement.

Announcing the news on Wednesday, Abra said the app will utilize the bitcoin blockchain and smart contracts technologies to support fractional investments in stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The app already offers investment in 50 fiat currencies and over 30 cryptocurrencies.  “Just as consumers can own a fraction of a bitcoin, they can soon use Abra to own fractions of high-priced stocks and ETFs,” the firm said.  The feature will be made available to investors in over 155 countries, offering zero trading fees for the remainder of 2019 on stock and ETF investments, the firm said, adding that the minimum investment is $5. Interested users can currently sign up for early access on the company website.  For the initial roll-out, Abra said it will offer 50 new investment assets, including stocks from major firms like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix; commodities like SPDR Gold Trust; ETFs like Vanguard Growth and the S&P 500; and indexes like the Russell 2000.  The app is non-custodial, meaning Abra does not store or have access to user funds. Instead these are stored on the bitcoin blockchain, making transactions ""more secure and private than centralized databases used by most crypto exchanges and wallets.” the firm said.  Using a system based on blockchain and smart contracts lets Abra peg the value of ""anything with a reliable price feed"" to the price of bitcoin, it explained.  The company's CEO, Bill Barhydt, said:  ""We are building bitcoin-backed investing products because, for the first time, we can truly democratize access to investment opportunities at global scale. It shouldn’t matter where you live or how much you earn to be able to make investments and participate in capital markets.”  Founded in 2014, Abra is backed by notable investors including American Express Ventures, Foxconn Technology Group, Arbor Ventures, among others.  Back in October, the firm launched a new token aimed to offer investors more exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The token tracks the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and essentially allows investors to invest in all ten at once.

42381500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myfH,1549454458,Cypherpunk Valentine: Why Shoppers Spend Bitcoin on Lingerie,"The most cypherpunk way to celebrate Valentine’s Day may be to buy lingerie with bitcoin.  Panties.com founder Lila Williams told CoinDesk that she receives “a handful” of bitcoin payments every month since she started accepting bitcoin in March 2017. So, this Valentine's Day season, her site is running a campaign where all purchases paid in bitcoin get 15 percent off and a free pair of lace panties.  Some bitcoin fans might be reluctant to spend their crypto on apparel. Yet lingerie, in particular, is often viewed by aficionados as a purchase similar to jewelry – an investment in a piece of fine craftsmanship.  If bitcoin is an investment, then spending bitcoin on lingerie from women-led companies that accept crypto – like Naja and Kala, both of which pay garment makers above-average wages and use fair-trade materials – is a way to invest in women.  Speaking to this broader industry dynamic, Rebecca Migirov, an alumna of ethereum venture studio ConsenSys and currently the CEO of lingerie brand Kala, told CoinDesk that the industry is seeing a “woman-led revolution in terms of product.” The best way to support crypto adoption, she says, is for consumers to “show there’s demand in the market.”  That’s why Rick Shaddock, a member of the Digital Currency Association, said he used bitcoin he acquired during the market peak in December 2017 to buy his wife panties for their anniversary because there’s no volatility in lacy underthings.  “It turned out to be a wise exchange, because BTC went down 80 percent,” Shaddock said in an email. “Panties were a much better investment than bitcoin in 2018.”  Needing censorship resistance  Stepping back, the American lingerie industry is widely dominated by corporations with controversial labor practices, since bras, in particular, are difficult to mass produce and must be partially assembled by hand.  For example, Victoria’s Secret – majority owned by billionaire Lex Wexner – has reportedly relied on cheap prison labor and child labor. Lingerie companies with higher ethical standards but less corporate power face rampant advertising censorship from subscription sites like Patreon to digital portals like Google and Instagramhttps://www.thelingerieaddict.com/2018/05/sesta-fosta-lingerie-addicts.html.  “There are enormous problems with advertising even luxury lingerie,” Panties.com founder Williams said.  Williams told CoinDesk that, in addition to having trouble with Google Ads, Facebook frequently bans her advertisements and labels them “sexual content,” even if the picture features a woman in a modest satin robe and nightgown.  Migirov’s Kala brand has the same issue converting shoppers through social media platforms like Instagram, which often mislabel niche lingerie advertisements as pornography. As such, Migirov said the lingerie industry could benefit from censorship-resistant platforms with smooth bitcoin payment options.  The only trouble, both Williams and Migirov say, is that the lingerie industry isn’t particularly tech-savvy. Until crypto-friendly retail platforms like OpenBazaar or AdLedger gain traction with mainstream audiences, siloed websites may limit boutique advertising and sales.  Speaking to her 33 years of experience in the lingerie industry, first launching a website then accepting credit card payments before most of her competitors, Williams added:  “Yes, computers were the big disappointment of 1990, but they aren't any more. And I believe that one day the same will be said of bitcoin.”  Slow growth  Williams said she might be interested in processing her own bitcoin payments someday if the technology becomes more user-friendly.  “One of the problems with bitcoin is when you push that button it is gone, gone, gone, there is no recourse,” Williams said, adding she occasionally holds some bitcoin savings rather than immediately converting it to fiat.  Using traditional credit card processors, she pays more than 3 percent of her earnings each month, in addition to a $75 monthly fee, which dwarfs BitPay’s average 1 percent transaction fee.  Beyond payment processors like Bitpay and Shopify, which offer the comforting guarantee of recourse if something goes wrong, several plug-and-play bitcoin node devices have emerged over the past six months that leverage the lighting network’s to reduce network fees to unprecedented lows.  Node retailers like Michel Luczak, co-founder of the French startup Nodl, and Lightning in a Box co-founder Norman Moore in New York, both told CoinDesk that they expect 2019 will see gradual adoption across merchant sectors because education is the biggest hurdle to adoption outside the tech industry.  “We are trying to sell not one node per shop, but for a group of shops, to show them that this can bring them more freedom,” Luczak said, speaking broadly about a wide range of vendors. “It’s a problem of trying to educate people and show what [a node] can bring them.”  Adoption may be slow across the lingerie industry, but it continues on a steady incline. In a sector of the fashion economy where female entrepreneurs are often censored and sidelined, cryptocurrency payments offer a way for shoppers to directly empower businesses they believe are challenging corporate norms.  “More people ask to use bitcoin over the phone than ask to use Discover card,” Williams said.

42381513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myt7,1549450831,Little-Known Resistance May Be Blocking Bitcoin Price Bounce,"View  Bitcoin continues to chart bearish lower highs along the 50-candle moving average on the 6-hour chart. The immediate bias remains bearish while the cryptocurrency is held below that average line, currently at $3,450.  Recent history shows bull failures at the 6-hour 50-candle moving average are often followed by a drop below the recent low. BTC, therefore, risks printing fresh multi-week lows below $3,322 (Jan. 29 low), having faced rejection at the crucial moving average hurdle earlier today.  A convincing 6-hour close above the moving average resistance will likely weaken bearish pressures and allow a corrective rally toward $4,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) price gains may be capped by a key moving average that has been acting as stiff resistance since mid-January.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $3,445 earlier today, confirming an upside break of a falling wedge – bullish reversal pattern – carved out over the last six weeks.  The breakout failed, however, and BTC ended up charting a bearish lower high near the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 6-hour chart.  Notably, that average line has put the brakes on a number of attempted corrective rallies over the last three weeks.  For instance, bitcoin’s quick recovery from lows near $3,400 on Jan. 22 had triggered hopes of a stronger recovery rally. That price bounce, however, failed to clear the 6-hour chart 50-candle MA for four days straight and the repeated bull failure was followed by a drop to $3,322 on Jan. 29.  Hence, the bulls will likely feel emboldened if and when that MA hurdle is convincing scaled. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,367 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.6 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The 50-candle MA on the 6-hour chart is seen at $3,450.  6-hour chart  As seen above, BTC has charted bearish lower highs (red arrows) along the downward sloping (bearish) 50-candle MA over the last three weeks. What makes it a strong short-term resistance is that after every rejection the price has hit a bearish lower low.  So, the probability of BTC printing fresh multi-week lows below the Jan. 29 low of $3,322 in the next day or two is high. After all, the cryptocurrency faced rejection at the 50-candle MA earlier today, invalidating the bullish view put forward by the falling wedge breakout.  Also supporting the bearish case is the Bollinger band breakdown (acceptance below the lower band) and the relative strength index (RSI) of 35.00.  Bearish pressures would possibly weaken following a convincing 6-hour close above the 50-candle MA at $3,450.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Bitcoin support will be “activated by default,"" Coinbase said, meaning users will just have to tap “receive” tab in the app and select ""bitcoin"" to receive the cryptocurrency directly in the wallet.  Coinbase Wallet already supports ethereum (ETH), ethereum classic (ETH) and ""over 100,000"" different ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 collectibles built on ethereum, the exchange said, adding that it is also working on to add support for bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and other major cryptos to its wallet going forward.  Coinbase explained that with the main Coinbase app or Coinbase.com, users can buy cryptocurrencies and the exchange itself stores the keys centrally. But with Coinbase Wallet app, users safeguard their own private keys, which are encrypted using Secure Enclave technology for better security.  The app supports both SegWit and legacy bitcoin addresses for backwards compatibility.  Coinbase continues to add new and expanded services. Just yesterday, the exchange announced that its customers in the 32 EU and European Free Trade Association countries can now make withdrawals into their PayPal accounts.

42381512,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myqb,1549444223,"Bitcoin Is Becoming More Decentralized, Indicates New Research","Bitcoin has become more decentralized by several measures, according to Canadian financial services firm Canaccord Genuity Group.  In its February report, the firm said bitcoin was less decentralized in its earlier days, as measured by its hashrate distribution. However, over the last few years, “increased competition” among mining chip manufacturers has led to decreasing centralization.  Canaccord said, in mid-2014, mining pool GHash.IO controlled about 50 percent of the total bitcoin hashrate, making the largest cryptocurrency “vulnerable” to a potential 51 percent attack (controlling a majority of the hashing power allows bad actors to potentially rewrite transactions).  In 2019, however, no single mining pool controls more than 20 percent of bitcoin’s hashrate, with five mining pools having from 10–20 percent and the remaining groups controlling less than 10 percent of the total hashrate.  Bitmain, for instance, has seen increasing competition from Canaan Creative due to its “inability to produce a meaningfully superior alternative to the Antminer S9,” the firm said. The closer competition, it continued, has led “Canaan Creative to sell its chips to a broader audience of miners that can effectively compete with Bitmain.”  Citing ARK Invest research, the report further said that bitcoin’s centralization as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) has steadily declined from ~3,000 in 2013 to ~1,200 currently.  The HHI index is used to gauge market concentration. An HHI of less than 1,500 is considered to be a “competitive marketplace,” an HHI of 1,500–2,500 is considered to be “moderately concentrated,” and an HHI of over 2,500 is considered “highly concentrated,” the firm explained.
