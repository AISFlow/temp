42387075,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWfIJ,1623794503,Andreessen Horowitz Has Its Own Media: So Far That's a Good Thing,"Today marked the launch of Future.com, a media outlet funded by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Commentators, particularly media figures, have engaged in some justifiable hand-wringing about the implications of a venture capital firm starting an “owned media” operation. That anxiety has been heightened by a broader context of Trumpist skepticism towards the media, and a wave of tech-specific media backlash spearheaded by companies like Tesla and influential figures like Balaji Srinivasan.      After looking at the first wave of items published on Future.com today, I don’t think there’s much reason to panic about the site. In fact, there’s much to admire, including an abundance of smart and informative pieces on cryptocurrency systems. I hope other entities planning to open in-house media, including Coinbase, are taking notes – because while Future.com looks great, the risks of such an operation are still real.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Above all, it’s good that Future.com is explicitly an opinion and educational publication, not a news site. In broad terms, that’s important because there would be an inherent, deep conflict of interest to a16z reporting news about specific companies that it was invested in, or companies that competed with its investments. It would have strong motivations to distort or omit facts in ways that benefited it. I trust a16z enough that I’d expect it to run a clean operation, but even the perception of such conflicts would have made its content much less valuable.      Instead of news about the present, Future.com is focused on theories about, well …. the future. Its first round of articles includes incredibly deep thought pieces about hybrid work and the future of intellectual property on DAOs, for instance. These pieces cite information about specific companies, and some are authored by the staffers from Andreessen portfolio firms. But they’re primarily about problems or opportunities shared by many different companies.      The depth and subtlety of these pieces is another notable point in Future.com’s favor. This piece on the lessons of containerization in shipping from Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen, for instance, clocks in at nearly 2,200 words (about nine printed pages), and includes wonky details about things like changing China-U.S. transit times and container ship size.    Read more: Emily Parker: What Coinbase’s Media Play Means for Crypto    Speaking as someone with nearly a decade of experience in the news business, it’s very rare for content of this depth to find a home at for-profit media sites. For one, the business model often can’t support paying writers for the amount of work involved. Even commentary from people like CEOs, while often provided gratis to publications, is usually streamlined to cater to readers interested in speed, not depth.      From that perspective, Future.com models perhaps the best reason for tech companies to bypass the mainstream media – not to present their perspective to the general public, but to provide a level of mind-numbing, un-economical depth in which only insiders are likely to be interested.      The thing I would compare Future.com to most, in fact, isn’t a news site like CoinDesk or Bloomberg, but an academic research journal. The site isn’t peer-reviewed, but it shares much of the same insularity as journals. Margit Wennmachers, one of the heads of the project, told TechCrunch that it’s aimed at “tech people” and “the tech curious.” The contributors include tech CEOs, professional investors, and more than a few actual academics. The site’s presentation is almost aggressively low-key: As of now, for instance, there are no images on the site’s frontpage. That would be absolutely suicidal for a standalone news site trying to catch the eye of a casual observer.      This emphasis on dry, academic depth should be additive to existing news sites, rather than competitive. It also significantly reduces the possibility that its contents will be manipulative, for the simple reason that easily-manipulated people tend to have really short attention spans and little appetite for learning.      More abstractly, it’s also arguably a benefit to readers that they know not to expect objectivity from Future.com. A16z is an investment firm, and seems set on using the new site primarily to flesh out the thinking behind its own investments. In investment circles that’s known as “talking your own book,” and it’s pretty common and unproblematic behavior – as long as it’s transparent that that’s what you’re doing.      Future.com could definitely improve on its transparency by adding explicit disclosures of its investments to related stories. Currently its disclosures take the form of a boilerplate small-text block at the end of each story, without specific investments cited. But the kinds of readers willing to slog through 2,000 words on the future of robot lawyers would also take a moment to click over to the a16z disclosures page to figure out that it was written by the CEO of a portfolio company.      All that being said, there’s a larger context here that is still worrying. Tech companies publishing what are effectively their business theses seems fair enough, but it does risk reducing the traditional press’s ability to ask hard questions of the businesses themselves. This has already happened with Tesla, a company that can communicate directly with its rabid fanbase so effectively that it actually disbanded its public relations department in 2020. There’s literally nobody there anymore to answer questions from the press, a situation that ultimately increases the risk for Tesla stockholders.      Maybe Future.com will become influential enough that a16z companies also decide to go direct. And a16z, with its track record of backing operations like Facebook, Instagram, and Clubhouse, certainly knows how to reach and engage a truly mass audience.      But for now, that seems if anything to be the opposite of the thinking behind Future.com. Tesla was able to connect with a wide swathe of retail investors largely thanks to its flashy, charismatic and impulsive CEO. Andreessen Horowitz seems to know it can’t pull off the same trick. Instead, its operation is leaning hard into being, frankly, boring as hell for anyone who isn’t already extraordinarily well-informed. And that should be just fine by media professionals.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,David Z.

42387094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWfcR,1623788209,Market Wrap: Attempts to Push Bitcoin Above $40K Stall,"Bitcoin stalled for most of Monday before making another run at $40,000 as of press time. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market valueis holding support above $36,000 and remains up about 20% over the past seven days.      Some analysts are optimistic about a decisive break above $40,000 while others prefer to see stronger signs of upside momentum before calling a bottom in bitcoin.    Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39752.7, -0.3%  Ether (ETH): $2523.88, -0.85%    ""Bitcoin is at its highest level since May, a notable recovery, but the crypto asset has yet to convincingly break through – and most importantly, close above – the $41,000 mark,” wrote Simon Peters, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, in an email to CoinDesk.      “I would really need to see a stronger increase to feel optimistic about the price recovering and possibly pushing onto $50,000 and beyond,” wrote Peters.      “After a timely correction, we see positive sentiment and market trends with bitcoin stabilizing in the $40,000 range and positioned for a relief rally,” wrote Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, in an email to CoinDesk.      “We expect bitcoin to see strong support over the next several months above $40,000, which is double the 2017 all-time high,” wrote Ehrlich.    Institutional developments    Below the surface, institutions have been carving out the future of crypto finance – a reminder of how fast the industry is evolving beyond daily price swings, although some 81% of fund managers believe bitcoin is in a bubble, even after May's 35% price crash, according to a recent Bank of America survey.      The integration of cryptocurrencies into the existing financial services industry could boost sentiment despite frequent episodes of price volatility      On Monday, CoinDesk reported that Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto investment firm with $1.2 billion in assets under management, raised $70 million at a $500 million valuation. Several hedge fund giants such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC participated in Bitwise’s Series B funding round.      Crypto is gradually making its way into the multi-asset universe, evidenced by Bitwise’s plans to grow and establish ties with financial advisory firms. Also, last week State Street, a U.S. custody bank that oversees $40 trillion in assets, launched a cryptocurrency division.      But these institutional developments will take time given the regulatory hurdles and pace of mainstream adoption. For now, traders and analysts are waiting for a catalyst to drive crypto prices higher or lower.    Bitcoin dominance threshold    Bitcoin’s dominance rate – the top cryptocurrency’s share in total market capitalization – remains below 50% at press time, having peaked above 70% in early January.      According to analysts at JPMorgan, that dominance rate is still quite low, which is a bearish sign.      “We believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us,” JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note published June 9.      Others see the recent stabilization in the dominance rate as a bullish sign.      After an initial capital rotation from altcoins into bitcoin, we expect bitcoin to continue to consolidate sideways until the re-accumulation is complete, scarcity kicks in, and price action,” said Ehrlich in an email to CoinDesk.    Bitcoin futures open interest rise    Outstanding bitcoin futures contracts have climbed to a one-month high, suggesting a rebound of speculative activity surrounding the cryptocurrency after a string of positive headlines that appear to have stabilized the market.      The aggregated dollar value of open interest – bitcoin futures contracts traded but not settled – has climbed to $13.1 billion, the highest since May 19, data from Skew shows. For the past month, open interest mostly stood in the range of $10.5 billion to $13 billion.      Meanwhile, research by Glassnode shows that short liquidations in bitcoin futures occur when the perpetual funding rate turns negative, during the consolidation for the past month.    Altcoin roundup  Though gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have dropped, an increasing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) users and developers are still flocking to layer 2 solution Polygon, primarily due to the cheap transaction costs and fast block times.  The World Economic Forum in its report mentioned several scalability features of blockchain networks including Algorand, Cardano, Celo, XRPL, Solana and Stellar.  The chiliz (CHZ), keep network (KEEP) and shiba inu (SHIB) tokens have been listed on Coinbase Pro and will begin trading starting 9 a.m. PT on Thursday although CHZ and SHIB will not be available to New York residents.  The Algorand blockchain is getting a network provided by fintech infrastructure provider Six Clovers. The network will use fully regulated stablecoins in connecting banks, merchants and payment providers to make transactions globally.  Switzerland’s Sygnum Bank is launching custody and trading across a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens including aave, aragon, curve, maker, synthetix, uniswap and 1inch network.

Revealing details of the project for the first time, the funds will go toward making “the first-ever animated series curated entirely on the blockchain” a reality. Fox’s initial plans were made public last month during the company’s “upfront” presentation to advertisers.      The studio’s NFT play will initially be driven by a show called “Krapopolis” from “Rick and Morty” creator Dan Harmon. With $100 million behind the project, it’s now one of the more ambitious mainstream forays by a mainstream brand into NFT experimentation.      Fox said Tuesday that “Krapopolis” will feature blockchain-related content “from character development right up through premiere night in 2022.” A spokesperson told CoinDesk the project will be based on Ethereum.

The number of bitcoins locked on the Ethereum blockchain via wrapped bitcoin, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol leveraged to convert BTC to ERC-20 tokens, has increased to a record 189,000 BTC, according to Arcane Research's weekly note published Tuesday. The tally has increased fourfold in the past 12 months to a record 1% of bitcoin's circulating supply of 18.73 million.      The trend shows how some savvy crypto traders have pivoted to salvage or maintain returns even as bitcoin's price tumbled by 35% last month.      ""Lackluster performance by bitcoin and growing interest in Ethereum-based exchange-traded products did little to derail the long-lasting trend of locking bitcoin on the Ethereum network,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk. ""It shows the hunt-for-yield trade is nowhere near the exhaustion mark and also underlines the growing comfort, as well as a sense of security, that wrapping bitcoin is a safe method in earning yield on assets, be that by retail or more professional market participants.""      Each wrapped bitcoin token is backed by one bitcoin, so theoretically prices for the tokens should be roughly equivalent. The protocol essentially allows bitcoin holders to tokenize (lock) their coins on Ethereum for an equivalent number of WBTC tokens, which can be put to work on the DeFi platforms.      ""The motivation of tokenizing bitcoin on Ethereum is to enable functionality that is not natively supported on the Bitcoin blockchain, such as compatibility with the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem,"" Arcane Research noted.      WBTC holders often lent these tokens to DeFi protocols in return for market-determined interest rates. For example, the DeFi giant Aave currently pays an APY of 1.21% on WBTC deposits. These WBTC tokens are also dedicated as collateral for securing crypto-backed loans, used to generate ""yield farming"" revenue or posted as margin on decentralized derivative exchanges.      Holders have also been tokenizing bitcoin through other venues like Huobi BTC (HBTC), renBTC. However, WBTC leads the pack by a big margin.      Also read: 3 Things to Watch for Before Calling a Bitcoin Bottom      ""In total, 240,000 BTC has now been tokenized into Ethereum protocols,"" Arcane Research said.

42387090,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWfXP,1623774241,On the Road: A Lesson About Open Access and Bitcoin,"The word capital derives from the Latin caput, often translated as head – like El Capitan – but also denoting a source or a spring. Money, in some sense, is that from which society flows. It’s the source of the roads we drive on, the tools we use, the bread we eat. But not everything has its price.      Last week I took a short sojourn up the Hudson River, a two-day trip by foot from my home in southern Westchester, N.Y., to the Graymoor monastery near the Highlands. Most of the trip was along a single highway, Route 9, which sways parallel to the famous river. Water, roads and bitcoin – of all things – happened to be on my mind.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    I left the morning after bitcoin was established as legal tender in El Salvador, an event of historic proportions. It matters not just for the majority of Salvadorans who lack access to basic financial services, but also for the hard-capped digital currency’s presence on the world stage. Thus begins one of the most exciting experiments in monetary policy. Could an open access payments layer revolutionize a struggling economy? What might bitcoin help build?      Bitcoin as legal tender in the U.S., especially in Westchester, wouldn’t likely have much of an effect. Walking through one of the satellite counties of New York City, you witness some of the most extreme levels of wealth inequality in this country. Town from town. Person to person.      I walked by Lyndhurst, Jay Gould’s historic estate, which happened to be closed to the public for the 145th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. I also woke up early on the second morning and walked through the town of Ossining. I was alone with the migrant workers until the diners started opening.      Despite the disparity of wealth in Westchester, the banking and payments systems here are strong. I was never far from an ATM and every merchant I patronized took credit cards. Bitcoin, for me, for most in the global north, seems more like a speculative investment than a tool I desperately need.      Of course, these financial services are all privatized and reliant on centralized institutions. There could be a role for a disintermediated monetary network to exist side by side, as it will in El Salvador. It’s like how toll roads operate within a network of mostly open streets.      Along Route 9, there are a number of mile markers first laid down in the 18th century. It was one of the postal routes that Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, designated as a way to transmit mail through the state-run service. Information, like money, could be seen as a form of capital. Another stream of development.      This open road, along with a few detours to be closer to the river or walk past New York’s highway-caged forests, brought me where I needed to be. For most of the journey, the Hudson River was never far from sight and its presence, its winds and tides could be felt in the air. This river, too, parts of which are a Superfund site, is another source that belongs to everyone. At least in theory, much of the land along its banks has been parceled out and paid for.    Read more: Cory Doctorow: The Monopoly Web Is Already Here    When I arrived at Graymoor, beat after about 40 miles of walking, I realized the privately run monastery was mostly closed.

42411650,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glQO21,1623773101,Kim Kardashian and EthereumMax. Why?,"On Monday morning, Kim Kardashian posted this Story to her more than 210 million Instagram followers:  Plenty of celebrities and influencers have promoted cryptocurrency and blockchain projects over the years, including huge names like DJ Khaled and Paris Hilton. But Kim K’s post is almost certainly the biggest single piece of social-media crypto promotion ever in terms of absolute reach. And it comes on the heels of shoutouts for ethereum max from other big names, including National Basketball Association great Paul Pierce and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather. In fact, according to a press statement, ethereum max was “the Exclusive CryptoCurrency (sic) accepted for online ticket purchasing” for the recent Mayweather/Logan Paul pay-per-view fight.  That all seems very impressive, so you might naturally be wondering what EthereumMax is and whether you should be buying it. To help you decide, I spent a few hours doing a very shallow dive into the project. I share my findings below.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.  But this isn’t just about EthereumMax (sometimes abbreviated to emax). For years, crypto investors emphasized that you should “do your own research” about projects because the industry is so rife with scams, fraud and bad projects. It’s not obvious how exactly to go about that research, though, so I hope you'll find some helpful methods below.  To be clear, what follows isn’t the right analytical approach for everyone. For day traders who move in and out of holdings quickly in an attempt to buy low and sell high over very short timespans (hours, not days), market signals like trading volumes or price patterns are key.  But for crypto buyers looking to make a longer-term investment, it’s best to focus on what stock traders call fundamentals. That includes information about who’s behind the project, what kind of innovation it brings to the table, its roadmap, revenues, spending, etc. A lot of this can be gleaned from public statements posted by the project and its participants: You don’t have to be a professional detective to do your own research, you just have to be willing to do some thoughtful reading.  During my quick research session, I saw a number of signals that suggest investors should approach EthereumMax cautiously.  For one thing, that Kim Kardashian Story was bought and paid for.  What is EthereumMax?  But before we get to that, some basics. The EthereumMax project was launched just a month ago, a spokesperson said Monday. According to its website, emax is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. That means it is NOT a fork, upgrade or competitor of Ethereum. An ERC-20 requires very little technical skill to create (that’s kind of the point), and they take advantage of functions of the Ethereum blockchain itself.  And despite the name, emax is not affiliated with any of the developers behind Ethereum. This is a fairly common problem in crypto because names are often not copyrighted or policed. There are dozens of coins with “bitcoin” in the name, for instance, but most have little to do with BTC.  While some ERC-20s are just for fun and have no real function, others are used to operate secondary software systems. Broadly, the hope is these tokens will increase in value based on their utility in those systems. But it’s hard to figure out exactly how emax works – the “tokenomics” section of the project's home page contains only vague descriptions of “community perks” and a forthcoming non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. It also promises “yield rewards” that distribute 3% of all transactions divided among holders. But there’s no detail about how any of this works.  There also doesn’t appear to be any information on the homepage about the team behind the project. This varies widely, but projects with unknown backers and developers are generally considered of higher risk. That’s in large part because it reduces the risk of prosecution or other blowback if the team disappears with investor funds or abandons the project.  Kim K, paid shill  So, now to Kim’s paid Story. I know she was paid, not thanks to some great investigative achievement, but because Kim included a promotional disclosure in the post itself. It’s at the far bottom right of the Story, though, and just three characters long: #AD. As in, advertisement.  This is just the sort of disclosure the Federal Trade Commission requires from social media influencers who post ads for beauty products or health supplements. Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Commission is primarily concerned with undisclosed promotion, so Kim’s disclosure is likely protection there, too.  How much did the people behind emax pay Kardashian? There’s no easy way to know, but previous reporting suggests she gets paid between $300,000 and $500,000 for most posts, and in some cases much more. I would guess a post to Kim’s ephemeral Stories feed is less spendy – but if you’re an investor, you should consider whether spending a year's worth of developer salary on an Instagram ad serves the long-term interest of a project.  Equally, Kim’s disclosure raises questions about the other celebs promoting emax. Paul Pierce did not include any promotional disclosure when he tweeted about emax on May 26, and I’ve found no evidence that Mayweather, who wore an EthereumMax T-shirt before the exhibition match with Paul, has disclosed any payments for his promotion.  That doesn’t mean they’ve done anything wrong, of course. Maybe famous multimillionaires Paul Pierce and Floyd Mayweather were truly promoting emax because they did their own research and they believe in the project.  The other possible explanation is they were paid for their promotion and just didn’t disclose it. This is something Mayweather has done before: he was fined $615,000 by the SEC in 2018 for tweeting about a coin called Centra, which turned out to be a fraud. At least some fans in Paul Pierce’s replies seem to believe the worst about him, too, comparing his tweet to Soulja Boy’s recent promotional-tweet mishap, accusing Pierce of being “paid to shill” and describing emax as “a classic pump and dump.”  Deals, deals … deals?  EthereumMax has notched a few deals that sounded promising. In a press release on May 26, a press release trumpeted that EthereumMax ""is now the exclusive CryptoCurrency (sic) accepted for online ticket purchasing” for the Mayweather/Paul bout. On May 28, another release described a partnership with Miami’s Groot Hospitality to accept the token for payments at two nightclubs.  It’s very much a mark in favor of the EthereumMax project that it seems to have negotiated cryptocurrency payments deals with a respected nightlife entrepreneur and with the organizers of the biggest boxing (exhibition) bout in years.  But is that what really happened?  Whenever you see claims about partnerships, look into the partners. Groot Hospitality, despite its goofy name, seems to be a legitimate Florida-based restaurant and nightclub business. A quick search of its listed properties shows they're broadly well-reviewed and high-end businesses. (Groot’s Miami Asian fusion outlet Komodo seems particularly mouthwatering.) And while it may sound obvious, there’s a good amount of evidence from professional news coverage that Grutman is a real person and basically respected in his industry.  But it seems the Groot Hospitality deal hit a snag. On June 3 the firm tweeted that its “use of EthereumMax Cryptocurrency (sic) will be postponed due to processing.”  The boxing deal also isn’t quite what it seems at first glance. There is no mention of EthereumMax on the official portal for Mayweather-Paul tickets built by Fanmio, the fight’s promoters. There are no statements or releases directly from Fanmio discussing any deal with Ethereum Max. And EthereumMax’s press release directs to an entirely different page, mayweatherpaultickets.com, which doesn’t indicate any affiliation with Fanmio.  To get a clearer picture, we reached out to EthereumMax about the program. “We had direct relations with a promoter to sell an exclusive limited amount of tickets,” a representative told us. “This was not partnered with Fanmio or ShowTime.” Basically, EthereumMax built a middleman portal at mayweatherpaultickets.com that somehow swaps emax for dollars, which are then used to buy tickets. But the portal isn’t authorized by the fight’s promoters. (CoinDesk has reached out to Fanmio for comment as well, and we’ll update this story if we hear back.)  The project's honesty when questioned is a point in their favor. But it makes the original claims seem misleading: How could EthereumMax claim to be the “exclusive CryptoCurrency (sic) accepted for online ticket purchasing” for the fight, if there’s no official relationship to the promoters? The wording is very careful – it doesn’t say emax is the “official cryptocurrency of the Mayweather-Paul fight” or similar. In this case “exclusive” just means “the only token you can use for this purpose.”  That doesn’t mean it’s based on an official relationship – but the choice of words suggests EthereumMax would like you to think it is.  Grammar problems  Another easy way to evaluate a little-known project is to examine the professionalism of its presentation. We’ve already noticed the Ethereum Max website doesn’t have much in-depth information. And its press releases are a little troubling as well.  Here’s the first sentence of that May 28 release about the now-paused nightclub deal:  “Groot Hospitality announced that it would “accept $eMax as it’s (sic) exclusive crypto currency (sic) at the groups (sic) largest Miami nightclubs LIV and Story.”  In journalistic jargon, “sic” means “this error was in the original.” So that’s three grammatical or spelling mistakes in the first sentence of the project’s press release (correct versions: “its,” “cryptocurrency,” and “group’s”).  These misspellings are not a warning sign simply because they indicate that a team isn’t entirely professional. In crypto in particular, it may be tempting to dismiss such errors as honest mistakes from teams who don’t always speak English as their first language, or who are overworked and just not that focused on PR.  But believe it or not, many scams actually insert spelling or other mistakes in their literature intentionally. This is for much the same reason they recycle scams such as the “Nigerian Prince” swindle: By turning away people with more critical judgment, they can focus on more gullible or impulsive targets. In the case of email scams, it saves scammers the labor hours that would otherwise be wasted corresponding directly with a prospect who might ask too many questions. The effectiveness of this ""negative filtering"" strategy was demonstrated in a 2012 Microsoft Research study.  Another way to do your own research is to look back at old press releases for evidence of a team’s follow through. For instance, this May 30 release says the EthereumMax team “is planning on releasing their Q3 roadmap before the Floyd Mayweather vs. Logan Paul PPV.” Eight days after that match, there is no sign of a roadmap of any sort on the project’s website. Delays happen, of course, so there may be nothing to worry about here – but would you invest in a conventional startup that missed this sort of deadline?  The power of the quick read  As I said, I’m not here to draw any conclusions about EthereumMax. Nor do I claim I’ve examined it from every angle – in fact, that’s the point. You can do this kind of rough analysis of any project in just a few hours (it only took me about five hours of work to do this research and write it up for you).

The Series C round of funding was joined by CMS Holdings, CMT Digital, Electric Capital, HashKey Capital and StarkWare Industries, a software company that supports the upgrade of dYdX’s low-fee trading platform.      San Francisco-based dYdX said it will use the new capital to “significantly improve liquidity” during volatile trading periods. Additionally, the funds will go toward protocol decentralization, an expansion of perpetual swaps contracts, a mobile app and back-office hires.      The beefed-up war chest makes the idea of decentralized exchanges meaningfully challenging the Coinbases of the world a smidge more concrete. Notably, Paradigm founder Fred Ehrsam was an early Coinbase executive.    Read more: Big Guns Back $10M Investment in DeFi’s dYdX    The exchange aims to be a decentralized hub for Ethereum-based crypto derivatives. Its biggest volume comes from the cross-margined perpetual swaps market, which has seen $2.2 billion in trading since a February technology upgrade that dramatically lowered user costs by skirting pricey Ethereum transaction fees.    Success with swaps    Perpetual swaps are comparable to bitcoin and ether futures contracts without an expiry date. Cross-margined means traders can use the same asset pool as collateral across multiple markets, instead of needing to deposit collateral in each market separately. That means more risk to the trader – but also higher potential reward. DyDx founder Antonio Juliano said it's more “capital efficient.”      “We're doing about $40 to $50 million in volume every day on layer two” perpetual swaps, Juliano said, referring to the protocol upgrade.      Nearly 30% of dYdX’s perpetual trading volume still flows through the exchange’s on-chain margin product; Juliano credited that activity to a handful of large investors. He said his team is dedicated to layer 2.      “We feel that's a better product and has a lot more growth potential,” he said.    Big goals    In the long run, Juliano said he’s positioning dYdX to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world by catering to derivatives, which he said is crypto’s biggest market.      “And the biggest thing that's happened I think in the crypto markets in the past year, is that the derivatives volume, really driven by perpetual contracts, has become bigger in terms of trading volume than everything else in crypto put together,” he said.

42387069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcLt,1623763800,State of Crypto: Congressional Hearings Are Ramping Up,"The U.S. Congress is holding four different hearings that are directly tied to crypto this month, reflecting growing scrutiny around the industry.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Growing hearings  The narrative    In about 30 minutes, the House Financial Services Committee Fintech Task Force is going to kick off a hearing on central bank digital currencies. It’s one of four major Congressional hearings on crypto this month.    Why it matters    It feels like Congress is starting to look a bit more closely at crypto. Four different hearings in June are going to focus on the recent crypto bull market, whether bitcoin is bad for investors and good for criminals and what lawmakers can or should do about it. To be clear, there have been hearings for years. What's different is we're starting to narrow in on specific issues and clearer examples of topics within the industry.    Breaking it down    I’m going to be honest: I had a plan for this week’s newsletter, but I wasn’t able to get all the reporting I hoped to do. So we’re winging it today, based on a Twitter poll.      Last week, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a former presidential contender and a longstanding advocate for consumer protections, hosted a Senate subcommittee hearing on cryptocurrencies. On paper the hearing was about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) but bitcoin (and to a lesser extent, crypto at large) ended up being the real subject. And if you’re bitcoin, it wasn’t a great hearing.      Warren took aim at bitcoin’s price volatility, some of the consumer protection concerns around digital assets and the energy required to secure the bitcoin network. These aren’t new concerns – we’ve been hearing about these for years. But last week’s hearing – and another three occurring this month – suggest we’re getting to a new stage of regulatory awareness. Here’s my rough historical summary:    Bitcoin launches, regulators are aware but not overly concerned and we see some guidance about how the Internal Revenue Service or FinCEN will treat it.  The initial coin offering boom happens, and the Securities and Exchange Commission jumps in with the DAO report and subsequent enforcement actions.  Everything changes when the Facebook-led Libra (now Diem) project is unveiled. This really does feel like the turning point. Crypto went from being this quirky magic internet money to having the potential to destabilize the global financial system.  Regulators start talking about stablecoins and stablecoin regulations.  At nearly the same time, the coronavirus pandemic begins and regulators start thinking about central bank digital currencies as a regulated, government-controllable alternative to stablecoins.  Then the crypto bull market begins and attracts even more attention.    So we’ve been heading here for a while. The question is, what happens next? I haven’t seen any proposed legislation but the fact we’re going to see several more hearings (including another one promised by Warren) suggests an increasing amount of discussion from lawmakers.    Odds and ends    There has been a lot of signal on the regulatory front these days. It’s worldwide – not just in the U.S. – and it has been, frankly, a little mind blowing. What’s most interesting to me is all of the moves we’re seeing suggest policymakers by and large are looking at crypto as something that can and should be regulated, but not something that could or should be banned. Some of this has been developing for years but the signaling is certainly far more prominent now than it was even 24 months ago. Here’s a quick list:    FinCEN announced it’ll finalize its crypto-relatedanti-money laundering (AML) efforts and rulemaking by this autumn in its list of regulatory priorities. The SEC didn’t mention crypto at all in its own list of regulatory priorities, to the disappointment of Commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman. A dozen bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are still floating out there, but it’s looking increasingly like we may not see one approved in the near future.  Speaking of which, the SEC has (unsurprisingly) deferred a decision on the Kryptoin application by 45 days.  The Central American Bank for Economic Integration will form a technical group to help El Salvador figure out how to implement its bitcoin bill after a request from the Central American nation.  Argentina’s central bank is investigating a number of fintech firms for providing unauthorized crypto-related services. The bank did not reveal the names of the firms. Bonus: You can read this piece in Spanish if that’s your preferred language.  South Africa wants to regulate crypto businesses and the digital asset sector more broadly, with its financial regulator proposing anti-money laundering rules and other actions to more tightly oversee the industry.  The Bank of England published a stablecoin paper. It’s basically just evaluating how stablecoins or a central bank digital currency might fit into its economy.  U.S. Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) wants FinCEN to reconsider the proposed counterparty rule and is concerned that recent FATF guidance might “run counter” to FinCEN’s own existing regulatory position.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he wants to regulate crypto as soon as possible after the country previously warmed to the thought of using bitcoin as a financial instrument.  Texas’ state bank regulator told banks they can provide crypto custody services under existing law.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    It feels like we’re in a holding pattern here, so informal poll time: Should I keep this section?

On Tuesday, Six Clovers, a provider of fintech infrastructure, announced the launch of the system, which will be led by two former PayPal staffers and an early employee of Ripple, the startup behind the XRP cryptocurrency that also sought to solve cross-border payment snafus.      The network will use fully regulated stablecoins in connecting banks, merchants and payment providers to make transactions globally.      “Six Clovers is a next-generation payments infrastructure that solves many of today’s challenges with domestic and cross-border payments, while opening up a whole new world of digital finance opportunities,” CEO and co-founder Jim Nguyen said in a press release.      The company is backed by lead investor Borderless Capital and has received support from BCW Group and Grupo Supervielle, a leading bank in Argentina. “Fueling cross-border transactions with regulated stablecoins to represent fiat on-chain has never been done before,” Borderless CEO David Garcia said.    Read more: Arrington Capital Launches $100M Algorand Ecosystem Fund    Six Clovers is far from the first company attempting to create a widely used cross-border payments network. Facebook’s controversial Libra (now Diem) has largely failed to date because of international regulatory backlash, among other issues.      Despite skepticism from lawmakers, another hurdle is getting banks on-board. “It’s not a technical difficulty, it’s about running the business, collaborating with the various parties to all at the same time accept this as a payment,” Lin William Cong, an associate finance professor at Cornell University, told CoinDesk.      With Grupo Supervielle, Six Clovers has its foot in Argentina, but reaching a global audience will be difficult, Cong said.      For now, Six Clovers is focusing on a more limited set of countries and regions.      “China is always a tough region to crack,” Nguyen said. “I think that for us, there are significantly greener pastures with significant lower competition like Latin America, Europe, Singapore and Southeast Asia.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | SPONSORED,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/15/ex-paypal-execs-launch-cross-border-payments-network-on-algorand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e5586c35cbe969900c33b265ea5ed08dafa4885-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcOP,1623760210,"Hedge Fund Giants Druckenmiller, Loeb Back $70M Funding for Crypto Asset Manager Bitwise","Bitwise Asset Management – a crypto investment firm with $1.2 billion in assets under management that is trying make inroads in the country's $20 trillion financial advisory industry – has raised $70 million at a $500 million valuation, CoinDesk has learned.      The Series B round of funding was led by tech investor Elad Gil and crypto venture fund Electric Capital. Meanwhile, a who’s-who from the financial world also participated, including Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, hedge funder Stanley Druckenmiller, financier Henry Kravis, Bridgewater Associates CEO David McCormick and Nadeem Meghji, a senior managing director at Blackstone.      Bitwise – a five-year-old firm that CEO Hunter Horsley said is now profitable – plans to further strengthen its ties with the financial advisers he says are critical to the widespread adoption of crypto. About 300,000 financial advisers oversee much of the country’s private wealth, he noted.      In an interview, Horsley predicted most Americans “will own crypto in one way or another over the next decade” and said reaching that benchmark will require making crypto as seamless an investment as stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are for money managers.      “They're not trying to trade events or outsmart the market, they’re just going to want crypto to fit in with the rest of their investment lives,” he said.    Bitwise goes big    Bitwise has already established ties with 200 financial advisory firms, more than double the count from January. It plans to find more partners by bolstering its client education resources and relationship management team.      The firm offers BTC and ETH funds, thematic index funds, including a decentralized finance (DeFi) index fund, and adjacent ETF products, like the Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which invests in companies such as MicroStrategy and Riot that have exposure to crypto.    Read more: Bitwise Launches ETF of 30 ‘Pure-Play’ Crypto Firms Like Coinbase, MicroStrategy    BITQ alone has seen $45 million in inflows since launching on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.    ETF hopes?    Horsley said the new funding will help the firm build more products faster. “You’ll see more products from us this year,"" he explained.      All that would appear to make Bitwise a natural contender for a bitcoin ETF. Indeed, the company has tried to launch an ETF before, but nuked its own bid in early 2020 after months of stonewalling by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF.      For now, Bitwise remains on the sidelines as at least nine other firms try their luck in getting SEC approval for a bitcoin ETF before Gary Gensler, the new SEC chairman.      “The ETF is a great wrapper. But we've grown 20x year over year without a [bitcoin] ETF,” Horsley said.      “There are a variety of different pipes that we can open up to help investors pull crypto into the rest of their lives,” he added.    Storied backers    Others who contributed the funding round include Coinbase Ventures and ParaFi Capital as well as tech and finance executives from Facebook, Google X, Spotify, Visa and Instacart.      Gil and Electric Capital, the two lead investors, joined Bitwise when institutional crypto adoption was more thought experiment than reality. That dynamic has radically changed after more than a year of major financial firms jumping into the industry.      Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg said Bitwise has walked a careful line to build a backer list of “just legendary people.”      “You really need to understand crypto. But you also really have to understand traditional finance and Wall Street and asset management,” Garg said. “So I think the investors that they brought in are sort of reflective of that.”      He said the equity investors are betting Bitwise is the “leading asset management company” in a crypto market that he thinks could still grow 10 to 100 times larger.      “Once you start talking capital flows into assets and the $20 trillion that's sitting with asset managers, it's not at all crazy” to conclude that Bitwise could be “a primary conduit” of inflows of hundrds of billions of dollars from private money managers, Garg said.    ‘For the long haul’    Horsley said the new round of funding came together in the wake of bitcoin’s April highs. “If $60,000 was the top, this round is happening after the top,” he said.    Read more: Crypto Fund Bitwise Raises $4 Million in VC Funding    In 2017, Bitwise raised $4 million in a seed round of funding that came as the bitcoin market was nearing its historic $20,000 peak, followed by a 65% sell-off in less than a month. Bitwise unveiled its seed funding just weeks before the market top.      Then, and now, Horsley said Bitwise’s backers are “in it for the long haul.”      “They think that this is an asset class that’s here to stay and they think that Bitwise has the potential to be an enduring institution in the space,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/15/hedge-fund-giants-druckenmiller-loeb-back-70m-funding-for-crypto-asset-manager-bitwise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8091534c8b32c2fa8aeab45236e2ab4ed2cba3d2-2048x1070.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcN9,1623756327,3 Things to Watch for Before Calling a Bitcoin Bottom,"While bitcoin sees signs of life after a month of dashed hopes, experts warn it may be too early to call a resumption of the broader bull run.      The cryptocurrency reached 2 1/2-week highs above $40,000 early Tuesday, having found bids near $36,000 over the weekend after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the carmaker could resume bitcoin transactions should miners meet environmental standards.      Some observers see Musk's comments as massively bullish because they show that concern over the negative environmental impact of mining that was partly responsible for May's 35% drop are transitory. Others are cheering El Salvador's decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.      However, macro and crypto-specific factors including the impending U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, bitcoin's dominance rate and technical charts warrant caution on the part of the bulls.      Let take a look at these factors in detail.    Fed fears    The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference following the meeting at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.      While the central bank is likely to keep key policy tools unchanged, some analysts are concerned the bank may strike a slightly less dovish tone in the wake of rising inflation.      ""While we think that most Fed members will be determined to keep interest rates on hold until they see signs of a sustained increase in prices, we also expect a handful of voting members to upgrade their interest rate projections over the forecast period,"" Matthew Ryan, a senior market analyst at the global fintech and FX risk-management firm Ebury, said.      ""This is likely to result in a median dot that shows hikes before the end of 2023 versus the March projections that signaled no hikes until 2024,"" Ryan said.      According to crypto finance service provider Amber Group, there are some concerns the Fed may discuss the timeline for paring down, or tapering, the liquidity-boosting emergency stimulus launched a year ago. That's evident from the pre-Fed weak tone in gold, copper, and other commodities, as noted by Bloomberg.      Any hint of early tapering or a rate hike could trigger risk aversion in financial markets, killing the nascent bitcoin recovery. Alternatively, a strongly worded commitment to keep the tap open would bring cheer to bitcoin and asset prices in general.      Prominent investors like Barry Silbert, co-founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company), expect a pickup in the equity market volatility after the Fed meeting. Some of that could feed into the bitcoin market. ""I've gone long the VIX to prepare for the macro fireworks,"" Silbert tweeted Monday, referring to the Cboe Volatility Index.      ""Fundamentally, we still see downside risk [for bitcoin] associated with a correction in the extended U.S. equities and downside risk associated with regulatory headwinds,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.    Bitcoin's dominance rate    A sustained uptick in bitcoin's dominance rate – the top cryptocurrency's share in the total market capitalization – is needed to confirm a trend reversal higher.      That's because the largest cryptocurrency by market value is usually the first to rally, followed by alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). In other words, money enters the crypto world through bitcoin, as seen in October 2020, and moves to altcoins.      The dominance rate remains below 50% at press time, having peaked above 70% in early January, according to TradingView. According to analysts at JPMorgan, that bitcoin's share is still quite low is a bearish sign.      ""We believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us,"" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note published June 9.      Also read: MicroStrategy Raises $500M From Bond Sale to Buy More Bitcoin - CoinDesk      Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said he expects bitcoin's share in the crypto market to rise in the coming weeks. ""With the rotation from altcoins to bitcoin, as well as the imminent purchase of large tranches of Bitcoin by MicroStrategy, we may see the dominance rate grind higher in the next few weeks, while altcoins lag.""    Key resistance still intact    While bitcoin has charted an impressive relief rally to $40,000, it has yet to clear key price hurdles that could pave the way for bullish revival.      ""Ideally, for us to call a bottom we would like to see a weekly close above $41,000,"" Stack Funds' Dibb said.      Simon Peters, a crypto asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, also cited $41,000 as the level to beat. ""We've seen the price face resistance earlier in the year at this level when it was trading around what was then an all-time high, and I would need to see a stronger increase to feel optimistic about the price recovering and possibly pushing onto $50,000 and beyond,"" Peters said in an email.      Bitcoin briefly topped $41,000 on Monday before falling back to under $40,000, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      While Dibb and Peters are watching $41,000, social media chatter suggests some in the investor community are focused on the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) hurdle, currently lined up at $42,604.      Also read: Bitcoin Fund Outflows Slow but Investors Start Exiting Ether Funds      Per Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, the recent recovery from lows near $30,000 might be a short-term respite.

42387064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcEL,1623730946,ASUS Launches RTX 3070 Series Cards With Feature Limiting Ether Mining,"Multinational computer company ASUS has launched a fresh batch of its RTX 30 series graphics processing units (GPUs) with a feature designed to limit its use for mining ether.      According to the company's updated product page, the TUF, KO and DUAL versions of its RTX 3070 cards have been installed with a feature known as ""lite hash rate"" (LHR). The company's 3060s and 3080s are expected to contain the feature in future launches later this year.      LHR is the industry's answer to the global supply shortage of GPUs caused by cryptocurrency miners hoping to cash in on the recent bull market fervor. The feature essentially halves the ethereum mining hashrate down to 25 MH/s.      Hashrate or hashing power is the speed and efficiency at which a mining device can operate. The greater the speed, the easier it is to solve a cryptographic puzzle, add it to the block and then collect a reward.      U.S. multinational tech company Nvidia, along with its OEM partners, announced last month the new feature for existing RTX GPUs would be rolled out in a bid to increase supply for gamers.      It is unclear whether the latest feature will address the shortage issue, but ASUS says the card's gaming prowess remains unaffected.

42387063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcFb,1623718300,DeFi Projects Continue Flocking to Layer 2 Solution Polygon,"Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain may have dropped, but that has not stopped an increasing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) users and developers from flocking to layer 2 solution Polygon.      Cheap transaction costs and fast block times have largely driven the growing adoption of Polygon by SushiSwap, Aave and other DeFi projects, according to analysts and people behind some DeFi projects.      Polygon, one of the early projects providing an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, has grown significantly in the past few months. For example, as of June 13, popular automated market maker SushiSwap has more than 15,000 unique active wallets on Polygon, while on Ethereum that number was around 4,194, according to data provided by crypto data site DappRadar – meaning there are more SushiSwap users on Polygon than there are on Ethereum.      A June 10 report by DappRadar also highlighted that in May alone DeFi money market Aave logged a daily average of $6.75 billion in transaction volume on Polygon compared to $2.48 billion and $2.28 billion for Aave and Aave version 2, respectively, on Ethereum.      Aave has been working with Polygon since March, as CoinDesk reported, in order to “escape” the high transaction fees on Ethereum.      “Using layer 2 solutions especially Polygon makes more sense because when we talk about DeFi, if the transaction cost is very high, it doesn’t make sense for small players or for the normal traders to use the application,” Sameep Singhania, co-founder of Polygon-based decentralized exchange QuickSwap, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “That’s why I think it’s a good move that DeFi is moving to Polygon.”    Polygon’s MATIC token    Prices for Polygon’s MATIC token also have rallied significantly this year so far, according to Messari. Now ranked 15th by market capitalization, MATIC token’s price is up nearly 9,000% on a year-to-date basis.      “Layer 2 solutions are a catalyst for growth and new users” for DeFi, Mira Christanto, an analyst at Messari, wrote in an email response to CoinDesk. “Ethereum gas fees have been prohibitive for many users. Polygon and other layer 2 solutions are a precursor of demand on Ethereum when the gas fee hurdle is removed.”    Read more: Mark Cuban Invests in Ethereum Layer 2 Polygon    Most recently, Polygon’s rise also occurred as Ethereum’s gas fee, the cost for the amount of computational effort required to execute trades on Ethereum, has dropped significantly. But analysts said that it may indicate a promising future for Ethereum 2.0, a system-wide upgrade for Ethereum blockchain that aims to improve the blockchain’s usability and scalability.      “Until ETH 2.0 is fully rolled out, layer 2 solutions are needed to create scalability on the Ethereum blockchain,” Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, said in an email response. “If a product creates an easy-to-use solution, the market will stick to it like glue.”    SushiSwap traction    Notably, the trading volume of SushiSwap on Ethereum is still much higher than it is on Polygon, per data on DappRadar. On June 14 alone, SushiSwap notched around $200 million in transaction volume on Ethereum but only about $47 million in transaction volume on Polygon over the same time period.      This may indicate that Polygon's growth is mainly due to increased DeFi usage by retail traders and investors, who are mostly conducting small value transactions.      “It shows that whales still want to pay gas fees and use Ethereum DEXs [decentralized exchanges],” Ian Kane, senior content specialist at DappRadar, said. “But the new wave of lower value investors are not so diehard for Ethereum and are just looking for good user experiences and low fees.”",POSITIVE,ETH | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/15/defi-projects-continue-flocking-to-layer-2-solution-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/158923b54401730b30c7bcb1a54371288a47e10b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
