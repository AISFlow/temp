17914529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552347,1695337214,Is Cardano (ADA) The Worst Investment Of 2023? Here’s What The Data Says,"Over the years, Cardano (ADA) has grown to be one of the most beloved cryptocurrencies, securing its spot as one of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap in the process. However, while the Cardano network has grown tremendously, investors in its native ADA token have not been as lucky with profitability levels plummeting over the last two years. How Many ADA Holders Are Seeing Profits? Data from the on-chain tracking website IntoTheBlock shows that ADA might be the worst performer of the top 10 in terms of profitability. While the other assets in the top 10 have managed to maintain a reasonable profitability level for holders during the bear market, ADA has been in free fall. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery As a result of this, the tracker shows that the percentage of ADA investors seeing any kind of profit at this time has fallen to 0%. An alarming 95% of holders are reported to be seeing losses while 4% are sitting in neutral territory, meaning the prices at which these tokens were last moved correlate with the current price of the altcoin. Trackers shows 0% of ADA holders are in profit | Source: IntoTheBlock To put this in perspective, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is sitting at 64% of holders in profit. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is at 52% of holders in profit. Dogecoin, which is one spot ahead of Cardano on the list, is at 41% of holders sitting in profit. Mid to long-term traders also completely dominate the ADA holder base. According to IntoTheBlock, 39% of all holders have held their coins between 1-12 months, while 61% of all holders have held for more than one year. Cardano Not Giving Up The Fight Despite the low profitability of the coin, investors seem to be looking toward ADA’s current price level as a good entry. This is evident in the CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report that showed that despite massive outflows from digital asset products, Cardano held strong. The altcoin was able to maintain its inflow trend with another $0.43 million flowing from institutional investors into the asset. Related Reading: This New Development Could Stop The Optimism (OP) Price Dead In Its Tracks Crypto analysts are also very bullish on the coin’s potential. One analyst, Kara Szabo, predicted that the price of ADA would rise as high as $5 in the next bull market, saying that the altcoin is in a prime price range for accumulation. Another analyst Hashtoshi, also said in an interview that he expects the altcoin to exceed its previous all-time high price marked in 2021. Hashtoshi attributes this expected rise to the network’s design and strong community backing the token.

42409664,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnlM,1695334814,"Vote if You Want, but Remember 'Cypherpunks Write Code'","Vivek Ramaswamy is the latest presidential hopeful with an appeal for the crypto class. Speaking at Mainnet, the New York City-based crypto conference put on by Messari, the breakout Republican candidate said he will soon announce a “comprehensive crypto policy framework” meant to address current gaps in regulation.  And so he may, the mandate is reportedly about three-quarters complete. And if the plans are as “serious” and “thoughtful” as promised, may Ramaswamy’s policies serve as a guiding light for those already in or seeking power. There’s a reason he’s known as the right’s answer to Sen. Liz Warren (it has nothing to do with his Indian heritage), and a little wonkism might benefit blockchain’s chances on The Hill.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     But let this “announcement of an announcement” also serve as a moment for crypto to consider who it's willing to crawl into bed with. While some industry insiders, like Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, who interviewed Ramaswamy in a fireside chat, consider themselves “single-issue voters” primarily concerned with government interference in the blockchain industry, let’s not decide this nation’s top executive based solely on whether he or she like Bitcoin.  In fact, let’s not vote for or against any political candidate based on their stated views on crypto. There are more important things in the world beyond the fate of stablecoin regulation. And, being honest, it’s hard not to see the politicization of crypto as anything but rhetoric. There is no one who can be voted into office who will make Uniswap run better or worse, or be able to derail Bitcoin.  On a practical level, thinking about crypto politically is almost certainly a waste of time. And more importantly, once you start basing decisions around what the government will allow in reference to crypto, the game is lost.  I’m saying this at a time when the sitting U.S. President has more or less declared war on crypto, and when the nation’s top regulators are circling the pack routinely picking off choice targets one-by-one. I know there are legal threats to crypto’s existence in the U.S., and real implications of regulatory indecision. Developers shouldn’t fear prison simply for publishing code.  But engaging in the political process as a means of ensuring crypto’s future is to miss the point of crypto so hard it’s almost embarrassing to have to write this column. Crypto doesn’t need political support – it just needs to be built in a way that rises above politics.  This isn’t even an ideological argument, it’s the practical reality of blockchain as we know it.  Projects that rely on staying in the good graces of regulators, executives and judges should be assumed dead (in the same way a vulnerability in code *should* be exploited). There’s a reason why Bitcoin has stayed around, yet projects like LBRY have been wiped off the map: if a project has a vulnerability, it will be exploited. And all crypto projects are exposed to the vagaries of the law.  The Biden administration has undoubtedly been tough on crypto, but there is no reason some future president won’t be worse. Gary Gensler was expected to be pro-crypto, and look at how that turned out. If blockchains are truly meant to sustain themselves for centuries, why expose them at all to four-year election cycles?  I am not going to say that the work of elected politicians like Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillbrand – who are advancing some of the most pro-crypto legislation to date – isn’t appreciated, or that Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota) isn’t a true believer in crypto. Lobbyists at the Blockchain Association have argued the short-term success of crypto will be determined by getting pro-crypto butts in seats.  However, there is no telling whether pro-crypto politicians or regulations won’t do even more damage than crypto’s critics and antagonists – like the negative impact that “megadonor” Sam Bankman-Fried’s preferred set of rules would have had by protecting his likely fraudulent exchange FTX. At least crypto’s enemies help crypto cut its teeth.  See also: Bitcoin Is Apolitical, but Won't Be Much Longer | Opinion  Crypto already has its political platform sorted out, whether you call it libertarianism, “classical liberalism” or crypto-anarchy: universally accessible platforms, built privately. It’s why crypto appeals to progressives who argue for expansive government programs that are not means-tested as well as conservatives who think freer markets means freer people.  Why go around trying to paint something as wonderfully postmodern as Bitcoin red or blue? Sure, there are a lot of politicians who cynically want to affiliate themselves with crypto's ultra-liberalism — often without doing the work of thinking through what it might mean for their other political concerns. I think today this is a phenomenon primarily on “the right,” which has pols like Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis tilting at the windmills of non-existent CBDCs.  See also: Aliens Exist. And They Use Cryptocurrency | Opinion  It’s telling that the MAGA-aligned Ramaswamy is willing to break with the Donald’s unerring support of the U.S. dollar. Many bitcoiners are deep-pocketed, and think problems can be solved by throwing money at it. But isn’t it a little sad that all Ramaswamy had to do was announce an unfinished set of rules and make fun of the “alphabet soup” of federal regulators to emerge as one of the most “pro-crypto pols” in the field?  Lastly, I didn't feel it necessary to debunk Ramaswamy's other non-crypto related views – of which many are contemptible, like the anti-democratic idea of raising the voting age – because like the other presidential hopefuls most aligned with bitcoin, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he has a snowballs chance in hell. Crypto is already associated with cranks, and Ramaswamy may yet have a political future, but at a certain point the ""single issue voters"" may have to wonder about the company they keep.

17912840,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552378,1695333626,Is The Bitcoin Dream Fading? Glassnode Data Reveals Newbies Facing Steep Losses,"Since its inception, Bitcoin, the preeminent cryptocurrency, has witnessed several market cycles, each with its highs and lows. Its volatile nature has recently tested investors’ mettle, especially those who ventured into Bitcoin in the past three months. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders’ Cost Basis Troubles New findings from analytics firm Glassnode have painted a detailed picture of the current scenario, revealing the challenges faced by short-term holders (STHs) of the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Sudden Boost Amid Mt. Gox Rumors, But QCP Capital Targets $22,000 STHs, defined by Glassnode as entities holding Bitcoin for 155 days or less, have recently felt the heat. The firm’s research disclosed that roughly 97.5% of these investors grapple with unrealized losses. To put it in perspective, as of September 17, Glassnode reveals the cost basis (or average purchase price) for those refraining from selling their BTC stands at $28,000, precariously hovering around 5% above the prevailing market rate. This situation stresses those new to the crypto ecosystem, causing many to reconsider their potential investment strategies. Shift In Sentiment And Trend Confidence Metric Delving deeper, Glassnode’s “The Week On-Chain” report highlights a marked change in sentiment among Bitcoin’s short-term holders. The firm identified a distinction between STHs based on their activity – those who spend their Bitcoin and those who hold. An interesting trend emerged from this classification. The cost basis of the spenders dipped below that of the holders during the market’s descent from $29,000 to $26,000 in mid-August. This shift indicates a sentiment of concern and pessimism among the STH community. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move: Crypto Analyst Predicts $45,000 Price Ahead Of Halving Glassnode introduced a ‘trend confidence metric to quantify this sentiment further.’ This metric is derived by deducting the spender’s cost from the holder’s cost basis and dividing the resultant value by Bitcoin’s current price. A pivotal takeaway from this metric was the evident negative shift in market sentiment. As stated in Glassnode’s conclusion: The Bitcoin market is experiencing a non-trivial shift in sentiment, with almost all Short-Term Holders now underwater on their supply. The firm noted that the current atmosphere of unease has been “unparalleled” since the FTX debacle. Glassnode noted: This has resulted in a negative shift in sentiment, with investors spending now having a lower cost basis than the rest of the cohort. This suggests a degree of panic is dominating this group, which is the first time since FTX collapsed. Meanwhile, although Bitcoin’s short-term holders are grappling with steep losses, the asset experienced a slight uptick yesterday, pushing its price above $27,000. However, this gain was short-lived as Bitcoin quickly retraced its steps, trading at $26,605 at the time of writing, with a 2.1% decline in the last 24 hours.

In August, the FTX founder’s release on bond was revoked and he was locked up because a judge ruled he’d probably tried to tamper with witnesses. Earlier this month, his request to overturn that decision was denied. On Thursday, an appeals court refused to overrule that.  “We reject [Bankman-Fried’s] contention that the district court failed to consider a less restrictive alternative to detention,” the order said. “The record shows that the district court considered all of the relevant factors, including the Defendant-Appellant’s course of conduct over the time that had required the district court to repeatedly tighten the conditions of release.”  Bankman-Fried’s trial begins Oct. 3 in a federal courtroom in Manhattan. He faces fraud and conspiracy charges tied to the operation and later collapse of his crypto exchange, and has pleaded not guilty to all seven charges.  The decision marks the second setback for Bankman-Fried on Thursday, after Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the criminal case, granted prosecutors’ motions to block every single one of his proposed expert witnesses.

42409665,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnya,1695331345,A $27M Crypto Loss Reveals a Toxic Mix of Money-Hungry Traders and DAO Idealists,"Nouns DAO’s internal critics have long chafed at the NFT project’s reckless spending – like paying $90,000 to name a rare frog species after itself  The DAO designed a “fork” to give dissenters an exit ramp, and itself an escape hatch if it ever came under attack  But savvy arbitrage traders played the governance game for profit, raising tough questions about the desirability of decentralization  Can you put a price tag on decentralized governance? For Nouns DAO, the answer was $27 million in crypto.  DAOs are the cryptocurrency movement’s version of a company – but with more democracy and (ideally, theoretically) zero leaders. Anyone who buys a DAO’s crypto asset – in Nouns DAO’s case it’s an NFT – gets to vote on how the group spends its money and makes decisions. But the bylaws of these groups are ever-evolving, and can get messy real fast.  Things got messy in Nouns DAO. The NFT experiment lost over half its $50 million treasury last week to a subset of its own disgruntled investors. They split from Nouns DAO; to use the crypto term, they took the “fork” in the road.  The fork was the culmination of months of contentious discussions around running Nouns DAO, a well-known crypto club with plenty of internal drama. There was a heated discussion whether to even allow forks; ultimately the community made the decision to allow them on the ground that the option would improve overall governance – as a political innovation, a form of protection for any dissenting movements and a step toward greater decentralization. Its designers believed it could be adopted by other DAOs too.  But what happened next – an extremely expensive fork – is now being characterized by some observers as a backfiring. Instead of protecting Nouns DAO from 51% attackers – a core fear of every decentralized crypto project – it attracted them. Savvy arbitrageurs came around and have since played Nouns DAO’s governance game for profit.  “This Nouns DAO fork could serve as a cautionary tale,” said Jillian Grennan, who studies DAO design as a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business.  The tale offers lessons for how DAOs navigate dissenting opinions, an issue that is certain to resurface with more projects sincere about pursuing radical decentralization. Few have done so with the commitment of Nouns DAO. At the very least the episode offers a case study in what can go wrong when money-management gets decentralized in a blockchain-enabled experiment.  The setup  A CoinDesk review of Nouns community blog posts, Discord messages, Twitter spaces and interviews with more than a dozen members revealed that the fork was the result of internal politics as much as the product of concerns over security and decentralization.  Nouns DAO raises money to bankroll whatever its members want to fund by auctioning a colorful JPEG – the Nouns NFT – once a day. Wednesday’s auction netted nearly $49,000 in ETH for the DAO, for example. That’s how its not-tiny treasury came to be.  The fork amounted to a divorce between two long-warring factions in the community.  “In Nouns there’s largely two camps of people: the book value camp and the meme value camp,” said Hong Kim, co-founder of crypto investment company Bitwise and a member of the Nouns Foundation’s six-person board.  The meme value camp, the original impetus for Nouns DAO, sought to proliferate Nouns in popular culture by funding tens of millions of dollars worth of guerilla-marketing campaigns, as well as infrastructure to support the Nouns project. Their more colorful projects ranged from outlandish – $90,000 to name a rare species of frog discovered in Ecuador – to notorious – a failed $174,000 effort to launch a 3D printed Noun to the International Space Station (that money was returned).  “Nouns spent millions of dollars on dumb s*** with unproven people,” the pseudonymous BigshotKlim told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. He’s the artist behind Nouns’ oversized red glasses, called noggles, who himself has received tens of thousands of dollars via commissioned projects from the DAO.  ""Nouns also spent millions of dollars on very cool shit and amazing people so we just learn and go forward,"" he added. For example, Nouns DAO has repeatedly funded programs that provide free eye exams and glasses to children.  All that spending angered the second group, who took a more green-eyeshades approach, project members said. The book value camp believed the NFTs should at least trade equal to each one’s share of the treasury. To them, Nouns DAO’s prolific spending (CoinDesk estimated the DAO has spent over $26 million on marketing) was squandering. Some thought they could manage the project better – especially amid the prolonged crypto bear market.  “The two sides were very much existentially triggered by each other, assuming bad intent and everything,” Kim, who is known in the community as Noun 40, said. “We ultimately felt, ‘How does crypto solve this? How does Bitcoin and Ethereum address this issue?’”  Fork it  The two largest, most valuable and most important public blockchains have a history of forking when different camps disagree on the blockchain’s future. Bitcoin’s multiyear civil war over block size spawned Bitcoin Cash in 2017. And in Ethereum’s early days, the crippling DAO hack was essentially discarded through a controversial fork away from the original chain, now known as Ethereum Classic.  While political, blockchain forks are also technological: they happen when a network’s underlying computing power splits between supporting two different histories. DAOs don’t have an equivalent means to manage a divorce.  Perhaps the closest thing is “ragequit” proposed by MolochDAO in 2019. This mechanism allows DAO members who disagree with project direction to quit the original club and take their share of the money into an offshoot.  Rage quitting was the talk of Noun town on Dec. 20, 2022, when the project’s two core engineers, Elad Mallel and David Brailovsky, introduced the controversial mechanism in a Twitter Spaces hosted by Noun Square, a media collective funded by Nouns DAO. They pitched it as a security backstop against a 51% attack, in which evil-doers who have seized majority control can force through malicious proposals, such as sending themselves the entire treasury.  “If such an attack occurs, everybody else that isn't the attacker can quit. And not only are they leaving with the assets, they’re also making it way less lucrative for the attacker,” Mallel said in the Twitter Spaces.  He and Brailovsky positioned rage quitting as an alternative to Nouns DAO’s existing defense against malicious proposals: a veto held by Nouns Foundation board members.  Kim, who as one of those board members has a say in veto power, said the Nouns community wasn’t concerned the foundation might “go rogue” with its veto, but just the possibility was something to fret over. A foundation veto is seen as a point of centralization in a DAO that flies the flag of decentralization. (Even now those closest to Nouns DAO said they seek to vanquish the veto in the hopes of using alternatives like forking instead.)  The forking mechanism was implemented in August as part of Nouns DAO’s V3 upgrade. A person familiar with Nouns DAO’s technicals said the design tried to maximize forking’s usefulness as a theoretical escape hatch while minimizing the opportunity for financial exploitation.  Under the new rules, any Nouns NFT owner can call for a fork in response to a proposal they don’t like. Their call only takes action if 20% of community-held Nouns NFTs join them. Once the forkers clear this 20% threshold, all of Nouns DAO freezes for seven days of no spending, and only debate – stay or go? The leavers then peel off with their share of the assets into a fork DAO that mimics Nouns DAO’s original governance rules, albeit with an important addition: a rage quit. Members of the fork DAO can quit and claim their funds at any time.  Not long after the rules took effect, a disgruntled Noun owner called for a fork and quickly cleared the threshold, putting all those presumptions to the test. This was no 51% attack, but rather a culmination of the political infighting between two warring tribes. The memers and the book value believers were about to split ways.  It was also a moment to rejoice for a third group, one that obseverts said was completely unaligned with the long-term believers in Nouns DAO. After eight months of gradually accumulating power and influence, it was time for the arbitrageurs to show their might and exit Nouns DAO en masse.  Arbitrage  “What makes this fork particularly fascinating is the existence of two disparate factions: those genuinely dissatisfied with Noun DAO's strategic choices and a group of arbitrageurs who view the fork as a simple financial trade-off,” said Grennan, the professor.  For some investors in the project, rage quitting was the plan all along.  The arbitrageurs are crypto investors who bought Nouns NFTs below “book value” on the bet that they might later redeem them at a higher price in a rage quit. Some of them paid attention to Nouns DAO around the time of last year’s rage quit talk. Then they started buying. Most of the Nouns NFTs auctioned in 2023 were bought by arbitrageurs, according to Kim.  “Talks of the fork gave more power” to the activist investors, said the pseudonymous Nouns DAO community member TheBower, who writes a newsletter about Nouns DAO governance. He said the activists “started to have a significant” hold on Nouns DAO to the point that conducting a fork became necessary – if only to shake them off.  The majority of forkers had cashed out of their off-shoot group by press time, taking with them 62% of the $27 million treasury. Each Nouns NFT they quit netted them 35.5 ETH: about the same as a 2024 BMW 5 Series sedan. Some had bought their NFTs at prices of 27 ETH or lower.  While rage quits were new to Nouns DAO, they were familiar to many of the arbitrageurs. Some of them are prolific activist investors who hunt the crypto space for opportunities to buy DAO assets that are trading below book value. Once in, they pressure the DAO’s power brokers to provide a redemption mechanism – a rage quit – for disgruntled investors.  The single-largest forker, a prolific, pseudonymous crypto trader named Blurr, told CoinDesk they had watched Nouns DAO from “day 1” but only embarked on their 44 Noun acquisition spree in August, “when it was clear they’d have to” let a fork happen.  “It was always a game of value maximization from all parties,” Blurr said. Blurr rejected arguments that Nouns’ seven-figure NFTs were ever anything other than an investment play, and blasted Nouns DAO’s aggressive spending. The trader got $4 million in various cryptocurrencies from the fork DAO, according to blockchain records.  The arbitrageurs' financial gamesmanship levied expensive consequences for the remaining members of Nouns DAO. Their pot for paying to sponsor movies, donate to charities, commission children’s coloring books, rename frogs, and even pay the developers, just got $27 million smaller.  Nouns DAO’s inner core is not dissuaded by the treasury loss. One prominent community member who asked to remain anonymous said the group knew there was a risk actors might play the fork for financial gain. That person said the risk was worth it “to push the envelope” of DAO design.  Aftermath  The Nouns community – remainers and forkers alike – is still coming to terms with what led up to the mess and debating whether it was a success.  Kelly Werder, an instructor at Florida Gulf Coast University who teaches classes on cryptocurrency and is active in Nouns DAO, where she remains, believes the group “did not spend enough” of the treasury to dissuade arbitrageurs from exploiting the book value discount and rage quit.  But the pseudonymous Toady Hawk, who stayed in the original Nouns DAO and runs its Nouns Square media collective, was more open to giving forkers who didn’t rage quit their chance to run “a more fiscally prudent” version of the DAO.  Grennan, the Berkeley finance professor who studies DAO design, said Nouns DAO’s forking experiment “underscores the need for more nuanced governance structures to accommodate diverse stakeholder interests without compromising the organization's long-term vision.”  “In the big picture, this one-off example demonstrates that while DAOs offer exciting prospects for community-based governance and crowd wisdom, the crowd is only sometimes correct,” she said.

Fed’s “higher for longer” stance puts pressure on crypto firms, Oanda’s Edward Moya said.  Equity sell-off could drag BTC price lower, per QCP Capital.  Cryptocurrency markets slid lower on Thursday as investors digested the repercussions of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks about keeping financial conditions tight and interest rates high for longer.  The bitcoin (BTC) price declined to around $26,600, down 1.5% over the past 24 hours, barely budged by positive news about delaying payouts related to the Mt. Gox implosion, a long-time source of selling pressure scare in digital asset markets.  Ether (ETH) broke below $1,600 and extended its losing streak against BTC, falling to a fresh 14-month low against the leading crypto asset. ETH was down 1.8% during the day, similarly to the broad market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).  Crypto majors suffered even steeper losses. Solana’s SOL, Polygon’s MATIC, Lido’s LDO and Optimism’s OP declined 3%-5% during the day.  Among crypto sectors, the CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE) defied the slump and gained 1% due to the strong performance by non-fungible token (NFT) platform ImmutableX’s native coin (IMX).  Equity sell-off could drag BTC price lower  The Fed projected one more rate hike for this year and less cuts for next year, which stirred up traditional markets.  The 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 16-year high, while the DXY index, which gauges the U.S. dollar’s strength against a basket of major currencies, jumped briefly near 106, the highest since the peak of the U.S. regional banking distress in March.  U.S. equity markets sold off as a result, with the broad-market index S&P 500 losing 1.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunging 1.8%.  Strain on the equity market due to the strict Fed policy could drag on crypto prices, according to digital asset trading firm QCP Capital.  “U.S. equity and rates markets have broken some very key levels on the back of this, and reflexivity can take over with the bearish thesis from here,” the QCP wrote in a Telegram market update. “This macro move could seep into crypto markets and take BTC lower with it, albeit with a lower beta as compared to other very stretched macro markets like the Nasdaq.”  High rates pressure crypto firms  “Borrowing costs will remain elevated and refinancing will be a nightmare for crypto firms.”  Higher rates will also put pressure on embattled digital asset firms, jacking up their refinancing costs, per Edward Moya, senior market analyst at online brokerage platform Oanda.  “Borrowing costs will remain elevated and refinancing will be a nightmare for crypto firms,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk TV.  “Crypto not only needs rates to peak, but for rate cut bets to grow,” Moya added. “The Fed still believes the soft landing will happen, but a few more stickier inflation reports and that will make those 2024 rate cut bets disappear.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/21/bitcoin-slides-to-265k-amid-surging-us-dollar-record-high-rates-are-nightmare-for-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef2bfe7c79fd7b211c8f9e139fd02931b90fb3b3-2600x1490.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17911301,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552357,1695330029,"“Paper BTC” Is Counteracting A Bullish Bitcoin Supply Shock, Analyst Explains","An analyst has explained how the growth in “paper BTC” could be counteracting a bullish Bitcoin supply shock from taking effect. Liquid Bitcoin Supply Has Dropped, But Paper BTC Is Still At Significant Levels In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo shared insight into how the paper BTC compares against the real BTC being traded. According to the analyst, “paper BTC” refers to the combined futures open interest value. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the ratio between the two types of Bitcoin over the past couple of years: The data for the paper vs real BTC ratio since January 2021 | Source: @woonomic on X The graph shows that the ratio’s value has fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.3 in recent months, suggesting that the paper Bitcoin has been 20 to 30% more than the real coins during this period. The real supply of the cryptocurrency may be divided into three categories: illiquid, liquid, and highly liquid. The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode puts coins into these divisions based on the behavior of the investors holding them. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Coming Soon? What Network Fundamentals Say To be more precise, the ratio between the cumulative outflows and inflows of the investor since they entered the market is used to define their liquidity. This ratio’s value approaches zero for the illiquid supply, as holders of this cohort rarely move coins out of their addresses. Similarly, the value becomes close to 1 for the highly liquid supply, as investors of this class tend to shift their coins quickly. In the above ratio, Woo has only used this highly liquid supply as a measure of the “real BTC.” As the chart below shows, this highly liquid Bitcoin supply has been going down recently. Looks like the value of the metric has been going down in recent years | Source: @woonomic on X The analyst notes that the less the number of coins in this supply, the more bullish is the outlook for Bitcoin since there are a lesser amount of coins available to be bought. Another analyst, James V. Straten, replied to Woo’s post with a chart that combines the liquid supply into the ratio, which, while less fluid than the highly liquid supply, still constitutes a notable part of the BTC traded supply. The paper vs real BTC ratio with liquid supply accounted for | @jimmyvs24 on X According to Straten, the liquid and highly liquid supplies have observed a combined drawdown of 500,000 BTC (around $13.3 billion at the current exchange rate) since May 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Not See Lasting Bullish Momentum Until This Happens However, as the paper BTC is still significantly more than the real BTC, any “supply shock” effects being created out of the real supply becoming less liquid are being more than made up for by the increase in the paper supply.

The incident, which occurred on October 21, 2021, witnessed BTC’s price on Binance.US nosedive from approximately $65,760 to $8,200 within a short period. Related Reading: Binance & Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? Insider Details Of Bitcoin Plunge And Alleged Manual Trading Error The ex-employee, Baradwaj, alleged that the trading firm was directly responsible for the sudden price drop, attributing it to a “manual trading error” rather than solely relying on algorithmic trading. Baradwaj claimed that a trader at Alameda Research inadvertently entered an incorrect decimal while attempting to sell a block of BTC in response to breaking news. Consequently, the trade was executed at an extraordinarily low price, resulting in a drastic crash. Highlighting Alameda’s trading operations, Baradwaj revealed that the firm primarily employed semi-systematic strategies, where traders fine-tuned algorithms to execute trades automatically at high frequencies. However, manual trades were occasionally employed in instances of system bugs or arbitrage opportunities on platforms where automated trading had not been implemented. Unlike automated trading, which adhered to sanity checks and market prices, manual trades were discretionary and prone to human error. Unfortunately, an Alameda trader’s mistake triggered a chain reaction on that fateful day in October. The erroneous trade caused Bitcoin’s price to plummet from its peak of $65,000 to as low as $8,000 on certain platforms before swiftly recovering through the actions of arbitrageurs. The incident created a stir on social media, with traders and news outlets scrambling to understand the sudden price movement. Binance.US, the platform at the center of the flash crash, issued a statement attributing the event to a bug in the trading algorithm of one of their institutional traders. Baradwaj further states that the losses incurred by Alameda Research were substantial, amounting to tens of millions. Still, due to the genuine nature of the mistake, the firm took immediate action to enhance sanity checks for manual trades. This incident exposed a vulnerability in Alameda’s risk management practices, prompting implementing “robust measures” to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The former employee shed light on the working culture at Alameda, characterized by a philosophy of moving fast to capitalize on opportunities, even if it occasionally resulted in unforeseen costs or vulnerabilities. This approach, championed by Sam Bankman-Fried, shaped the culture at Alameda Research and the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. Related Reading: Optimism To Sell 116 Million OP Tokens Via Private Sale: Will The Price React? For nearly two years, the BTC flash crash incident remained a puzzle to the public, leaving many wondering about the cause behind such a significant price drop. With the revelations made by Baradwaj, the veil has been lifted, providing valuable insights into the events that unfolded behind the scenes. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, BTC, trades at $26,600, down by over 2.1% in the 24-hour time frame.

The judge also blocked the defense's effort to get rid of one of the government witnesses set to testify.  Judge Lewis Kaplan, who's overseeing Sam Bankman-Fried's trial, granted the U.S. Department of Justice's motion to block all of the FTX founder's proposed witnesses from testifying at his trial next month.  In a Tuesday order, the judge said that while the defense could try to call four of the witnesses they proposed earlier this year, they would have to jump through some legal hoops, such as providing proper disclosures at least three days before the witnesses might testify. He also denied Bankman-Fried's motion to block a proposed government witness from testifying.  Bankman-Fried's defense team wanted to call seven individuals: Lawrence Akka, a British barrister; Thomas Bishop and Joseph Pimbley, who are with different consulting firms; Brian Kim, a data analytics and forensics expert; Bradley Smith, a law professor at Capital University Law School and Andrew Di Wu, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Remain in Jail Through the Start of His Trial  The DOJ objected, giving reasons ranging from a lack of proper clarity on what the witnesses would discuss to their unsuitability for testifying in a U.S. criminal trial.  Judge Kaplan granted all of the DOJ's objections, but said that the defense could try to call Bishop or Kim to respond to DOJ witnesses – namely an FBI agent or Peter Easton, who the prosecution intends to call to testify about customer deposits based on an analysis of FTX data.  There's a catch, however: Bishop or Wu would need to have ""filed a complete Rule 16 disclosure ... at least three days prior to the date of the relevant defense witness."" The DOJ can still object as well.  The judge set the same conditions for Pimbley and Wu.  Akka, Vinella and Smith are being excluded entirely, and in a footnote the judge wrote, ""the Court harbors serious doubts regarding Dr. Vinella's qualifications as an expert in the subject matter of his proffered testimony,"" though Judge Kaplan added that that's not why he excluded him.

42409657,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnY8,1695325106,NFTs Aren’t Dead Just Yet (But the MSM Might Be),"Rollingstone.com hit the traffic motherlode today with an eye-catching post calling the end of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The piece, “Your NFTs Are Actually – Finally – Totally Worthless,” picks up a new study by dappGambl, a community of finance experts, and runs with it hard. And it hit a nerve. As of writing (lunchtime Thursday), the post is top-trending on their website and on Google itself. Type the term “NFTs” into your browser, and it appears at the apex of the search results.  To be sure, there is plenty of meat here and the headline isn’t completely wrong, at least judged by the loose standards of headline writers. It’s sort of true that most NFTs are, indeed, worthless. The study found that, out of a sample of 73,257 NFT collections, 69,795 have a market cap of zero ETH. That’s 95% of the total, which is almost “all” of them. The study says that 23 million people now hold NFTs with no value, which is certainly tough for those investors.  “Just 21 percent of the collections included in the study can claim full ownership, meaning around four out of every five collections remains unsold,” the writer, Miles Klee, notes. “With buyers becoming more discerning, ‘projects that lack clear use cases, compelling narratives, or genuine artistic value are finding it increasingly difficult to attract attention and sales.’”  But are NFTs really dead, as the post suggests? Not exactly.  While trading volumes are certainly down, they are not non-existent. Data collected by The Block shows that trading reached about $63 million last week. That’s a far cry from the $360 million-plus weekly volume we saw in February. But it’s also not nothing.  Plus, there’s the 5% of collections that are actually worth something. The post says the study explains why “you don’t see people hawking ugly cartoon apes on the internet as much anymore.” But Bored Ape NFTs are actually trading respectably. The average price of a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT is about $42,000.  More important than precise trading dynamics is what the post shows about how the mainstream media tends to work. Publications search for extremes, absolute highs and lows that make for arresting headlines. Just last November, Rolling Stone put out a headline saying “The NFT Bubble Has Burst, but the Value For Creators Is Just Heating Up.” Last summer, it loudly touted its own tie-up with … one of the most famous NFT collections around, the Bored Ape Yacht Club. “This is a rare chance for the public to take home a piece of art from BAYC with Rolling Stone’s stamp of approval,” the promo piece said. Now Rolling Stone has an opposite sort of message similarly filled with hyperbole.  Anyone who has covered crypto for a while has seen this movie many times before. Bitcoin has been written off countless times, yet it’s still trundling out blocks. It has millions of followers and the price is now $26,000-plus, which, again, isn’t nothing.  Of course, there have been highs and lows, but the idea that a technology as useful as NFTs is going away entirely is silly. NFTs are a digital wrapper for non-physical and physical items allowing them to be tracked and traded. That is an idea with wide applicability, whether it’s reflected in art markets or not.  The bigger story here is that media publications are losing credibility because they disingenuously look for extremes when the real world is full of nuance. Many in crypto, as a result, “have already started tuning out the newscycle,” as my colleague Dan Kuhn wrote recently of this phenomenon. People are building and developing and ignoring whether the media says the world is up or down. Their reality isn’t framed by what a journalist somewhere says it is; they look at tech and make something useful out of it. And thank god they do.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/21/nfts-arent-dead-just-yet-but-the-msm-might-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6addb7094c9d47959777112394dd7afd21d6dab-2190x1460.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17908064,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552318,1695322822,Bloomberg Analyst Lauds Bitcoin Energy Shift Amid Rising Hashrate,"The Bitcoin mining industry has risen steadily in the past few years thanks to the widespread adoption and increasing interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. This growth has led to a vast increase in Bitcoin’s hash rate, causing concerns regarding the carbon footprint left behind by mining activities. A recent Bloomberg study has shown, however, that the carbon footprint left behind by the Bitcoin blockchain has stalled in recent years. Bitcoin Unlikely To Burn The Oceans It’s no news that Bitcoin mining is now a big industry on its own, with some mining firms even contributing to the economy and grid of their locations. Major BTC mining companies have also turned years of profits, which have attracted many investors, including large investment firms. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts More Trouble Ahead For Bitcoin Price, Here’s Why The issue of climate change and rising temperature have been the focus of many activists for years, with many accusing the energy-intensive activities of BTC mining of contributing negatively. As a result, regulatory agencies have been more insistent that mining corporations investigate safer and cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels for their energy needs. To this end, Jamie Coutts, an analyst for Bloomberg, revealed that the percentage of Bitcoin transactions that use sustainable energy has increased steadily since 2021 and is now over 50%. A new report has dropped on the Bloomberg @TheTerminal this morning – a further examination of this symbiosis between #Bitcoin mining and the global #EnergyTransition 🧵 pic.twitter.com/4lPt9cFAl9 — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 20, 2023 This rise was particularly kickstarted by China’s ban on Bitcoin Mining in 2021 and Kazakhstan’s cap on the energy used by domestic crypto miners. Since then, the overall hash rate has increased by 286%, yet carbon dioxide emissions have decreased from 600 grams of CO2 per KWh to 296.5 grams of CO2 per KWh. BTC struggles in the mid $26,000s | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What Does This Mean For The BTC Ecosystem? Bitcoin mining’s energy requirements take up around 50% of a miner’s operational cost. Cheaper clean energy is a way to offset these costs while simultaneously reducing the industry’s emissions or carbon intensity. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) also recently lowered its Bitcoin electricity consumption estimates by 25% from 105.3 TWh to 95.5 TWh, showing the transition is having better effects. A transition into cleaner energy methods speaks well for BTC and the crypto industry as a whole, considering the blockchain has been heavily criticized in the past by environmentalists. This leaves room for companies to accept Bitcoin as a payment method without facing any kind of backlash. Elon Musk’s Tesla, for instance, pledged in 2021 to resume allowing BTC payment for its cars when there’s a confirmation of 50% clean energy usage by miners.

42409661,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnof,1695321963,‘You Can Do Nothing’: Crypto Trading Titans Are Yelling at Each Other on Elon Musk’s X,"It started quietly. Andrei Grachev, whose firm, DWF Labs, emerged as a newsworthy – albeit controversial – presence in crypto this year, posted on Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) a photo of himself sitting beside some competitors.  “Thanks boys for the panel discussion,” he wrote alongside a photo of five people on stage.  Then came the trash-talking.  Grachev “had absolutely no business to be on that panel,” Cristian Gil, co-founder of market-making giant GSR, posted days later on X. “It’s insulting to [GSR], [crypto exchange OKX] and [Wintermute] to be in the same room as [DWF].” Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of huge market maker Wintermute, then clicked “Like” on that post.  “I never thought that you could be THAT scared of us,” Grachev replied. “Yeah, we are stronger than you in terms of tech, trading, BD and everything. … If I were you – I would be also crying all the time.”  To another Grachev post apparently directed at the Wintermute executive – “we are eating your market share like a birthday cake and you can do nothing” – Gaevoy replied with a “lol,” and “go ‘invest’ more, we are trembling in your presence.”  It’s all just words, of course, but the public quarrel is a reminder of DWF’s sudden emergence earlier this year. The company quickly and loudly popped up as a backer of startups. But there was soon debate around whether it was really engaging in venture capital investing, as some thought, or something less long-term: acting like an over-the-counter trading desk, approaching projects with the offer of buying up its tokens, then trying to sell them for a profit.  Read more: Crypto Market Maker DWF Labs’ More Than $200M in Deals Blur What ‘Investing’ Means  This week’s fight was very crypto. First, it took place in the open on X, long the home of the town square known as Crypto Twitter. Gaevoy posted a meme.  And, naturally, it raised questions about maturity levels and whatnot. What will the big Wall Street firms that are making their boldest moves yet into crypto – including bitcoin ETF applications from the likes of giant asset manager BlackRock – think of all this?  The thing is, though, there’s precedent for show-stopping battles like this in traditional finance. When author Michael Lewis’ “Flash Boys” came out in 2014, he appeared on CNBC from the New York Stock Exchange floor with the book’s hero, Brad Katsuyama.  Lewis and Katsuyama faced off “against William O’Brien, the president of the BATS Global Markets exchange, who was clearly enraged at the book’s argument that the stock market is rigged in favor of high-speed traders,” according to a New York Times article published back then.  “Insults flew,” the Times reported. “The guests raised their voices.

42409667,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMo5C,1695321114,Ex-Senator Who Once Shepherded Crypto Legislation Sees No Path in Current Congress,"One of crypto’s best friends in the previous U.S. Senate, Pat Toomey, says he doesn’t see how this Senate will move on crypto.  Coinbase’s policy chief counters that the lack of a clear position from Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown might be a good thing.  Former U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who tried and failed to push his own crypto legislation through Congress before leaving at the start of the year, can’t see how the current Senate will have any better luck, despite recent progress in the House of Representatives.  Though the digital assets industry is desperate for regulatory clarity in the U.S., and is fighting legal skirmishes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) while it waits for answers, the long-awaited congressional solution isn’t coming any time soon, Toomey predicted at a Georgetown Law seminar Thursday on national security and digital assets. And the fact that the House Financial Services Committee has cleared multiple crypto bills for floor votes probably won’t make a difference, he said, even if they’re approved by the overall House.  “I don't see a path forward in the Senate, regardless of how the vote goes in the House,” he said, though he thinks a bill on stablecoins would have the best chance.  Any crypto legislation likely needs to clear the Senate Banking Committee, where Toomey was the top Republican. But its chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), hasn’t made any moves toward legislating, even as fellow members pitch crypto bills and the House Financial Services Committee keeps churning out its own.  Brown has been highly critical of the consumer dangers posed by cryptocurrencies, but he’s been careful not to mention or touch any specific legislative response. That may actually be a good omen, says Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer at Coinbase Inc. (COIN).  “He hasn't committed at all on what to do,” Shirzad said in an interview on Thursday. “I might actually take that as a really good sign,” he said, because despite Brown’s criticism, he hasn’t just dismissed it.  “Those of us who've been involved in legislation, it's really kind of a one-day-at-a-time exercise,” Shirzad said.  However, Brown urged regulators in a letter last week to use their existing powers to crack down on crypto firms skirting the laws – reinforcing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s view that his agency needs to deal now with the businesses in breach of securities regulations. And the SEC seems happy to comply with Brown, as demonstrated by its crypto enforcement chief saying this week that the regulator has every intention of continuing its enforcement assault against more industry players.  Toomey, who now sits on the global advisory council at Coinbase, sees some hope for resolving the major sticking point of stablecoin legislation: the fight over how the issuers should mainly be regulated, whether by the Federal Reserve or the state agencies. The Biden administration has been insistent, according to those familiar with the legislative negotiations, that the Fed have the dominant role.  “I do think it’s possible to reach an agreement with the administration,” he said. He added that “it’s not impossible to bridge that divide,” and he said he thinks Democratic lawmakers – including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the House Financial Services Committee's ranking Democrat – will get on board once the White House is happy.  Still, he said he doesn’t see the stablecoin effort surviving this Congress.  “In the next Congress, I think it's quite possible to get something done,” Toomey concluded.

17906376,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552348,1695319211,Why Touching This Bitcoin Level Could Hold The Key For A Rally,"The price of Bitcoin was rejected as it approached critical resistance north of $27,000, and selling pressure continues over today’s trading session. If buyers can’t defend current levels, BTC’s price will likely re-test critical support, but this action could trigger a bounce for the cryptocurrency, according to fresh data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enjoys Growing Favorable Conditions, Top Analyst Says As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,650, with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency has recorded sideways price action and underperformed XRP and Toncoin’s TON, which recorded a 5% and 25% profit, respectively, across a similar period. The Bitcoin Level To Watch If Bears Take Over An analyst crypto research firm Material Indicators shared a fire chart showing the most significant liquidity levels for the BTCUSDT trading pair on Binance. On a monthly basis, traders on this venue have been selling the cryptocurrency and moving liquidity below current levels. The chart below shows that the Binance orderbook for this trading pair looks “thin.” The analyst claims a “small buy wall” at around $24,700, which stands as a “line in the sand” that needs to be defended to prevent further downside price action. Liquidity around this critical level is low, but bulls can inject capital to defend the level in case of further downside. If bulls succeed, Bitcoin will likely rally and reclaim previously lost territory. Otherwise, bears will have the opportunity to press further on the price, returning it to critical support around $23,000 and $22,000. These levels display even less liquidity than $25,000, which could hint at a deeper correction of “Bearadise,” as the analyst called it. Additional data provided by trading desk QCP Capital indicates that macroeconomic forces have played a critical role in influencing the price of Bitcoin. Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) sent a “hawkish” surprise across financial markets, limiting any BTC upside momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price This event had a bearish impact on legacy markets, with the Nasdaq 100 and rates markets breaking “some very key levels,” QCP Capital stated. The trading desk added: (…) reflexivity can take over with the bearish thesis from here. If we are right, then this macro move could seep into crypto markets and take BTC lower with it (Chart 3), albeit with a lower beta as compared to other very stretched macro markets like the NASDAQ.

Due to bitcoin's characteristics, the odds that MicroStrategy continues to outperform the market by a wide margin is a more probable outcome. MicroStrategy's core business is not growing aggressively, but it affords various strategies to the company that complement it's Bitcoin strategy. I've been wanting to write an article about MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) for a while. This is one of my favorite companies and has been ever since they embarked on their Bitcoin strategy. I really admire the CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor. Why? I admire him for the courage and conviction he has to do something as revolutionary and ""against the grain"" as adopting a completely new currency as its standard. Obviously Bitcoin is not a currency yet, but rather something he hopes will provide greater value for his company than holding dollars. At the moment Bitcoin serves as a store of value. And over the years, as I have sought to understand Bitcoin better, Michael Saylor has had an instrumental impact on my learning. The thesis for buying (or selling) MicroStrategy's stock really boils down to its Bitcoin holdings. Below, I will provide my investment thesis for how I think about Bitcoin and why MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy is the right strategy. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy On August 10, 2020, MicroStrategy adopted its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) strategy and began buying Bitcoin. Since then, the company has continued buying throughout Bitcoin's market cycle. MicroStrategy has received some flak from media and some investors for buying Bitcoin at higher prices, and even using leverage to do so. However, this comparison below demonstrates that MicroStrategy has performed very well relative to other stock market bellwether companies since adopting its Bitcoin strategy. It has even outperformed Bitcoin itself. MicroStrategy Outperformance Since Bitcoin Strategy Started (Q2 Presentation) The Bitcoin Strategy Currently, as of their last quarterly presentation, MicroStrategy owns 152,800 Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin's price is about $26,500 so this equates to the company holding a value of just over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin. For those who worry that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin is in danger of being collateralized, this slide below should put your mind at ease as this includes only 10 percent of their stack. In the following sections, I will break this down in several different ways to help us think about this strategy, as well as Bitcoin's price. MicroStrategy Current Bitcoin Holdings (Q2 2023 Presentation) Bitcoin's Hashrate Currently, Bitcoin's hashrate is just above 400 EH/s and has nearly doubled in the past year. Bitcoin's hashrate is a measure of the computing power that is devoted to the Bitcoin computer network. With each additional Bitcoin mining machine that is added to the network, it becomes less profitable for miners to mine Bitcoin unless the Bitcoin price increases proportionately. So far in 2023, Bitcoin has not seen a proportional increase in price and so it has become a less profitable endeavor to mine Bitcoin. Although the market does not acknowledge it yet, this should make each existing Bitcoin more valuable over time. Why does Bitcoin's hashrate matter? If you've been learning about Bitcoin for any substantial measure of time, then you probably already know that Bitcoin's increasing hashrate is what makes Bitcoin more secure. That's because each increase in hashrate provides greater protection from a ""51 percent attack."" A 51 percent attack is when a miner or group of miners owns greater than 50 percent of the computing power in the network and is therefore able to alter the Bitcoin blockchain. There is more nuance to this than I will explain here, but the takeaway is that this is an extremely unlikely occurrence, and becomes ever more unlikely as the hashrate grows. Bitcoin Hashrate September 2023 (Coinwarz.com) Mining Bitcoin Right now, one of the most efficient Bitcoin miners on the market is the Antminer S19 XP. With this particular miner, it will use roughly 3,000 watts of energy per hour. As of this writing, one Bitcoin is worth $26,500 and currently, running an Antminer S19 XP for one day will generate .00032 Bitcoin which at today's prices equates to roughly $8.50 per day . Those 3,000 watts of energy translate into 72 kWh of energy per day. There is a wide range of energy costs in the Bitcoin mining space but let's just say that energy will cost ten cents per kWh. This means that mining Bitcoin each day will cost $7.30 leaving the miner with a profit of $1.20. I realize this amount of profit will vary depending on how much energy costs and I know there are Bitcoin miners who have energy sources for much less than 10 cents per kWh, but suffice it to say, Bitcoin miners are getting squeezed at the moment. But to accuse me of miscalculating profit of a Bitcoin miner is to miss the point. That's because although profit varies depending upon the energy source, what I'm trying to understand is the energy equivalent value of a Bitcoin. Said in another way, how much energy would it cost today to mine MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings? If it costs 72 kWh each day to mine .00032 Bitcoin, then it currently costs 225,000 kWh to mine one Bitcoin. At ten cents per kWh, this makes one Bitcoin cost $22,500 to mine. This simple analysis also doesn't take into account the amount of time that it would take to mine that much Bitcoin. This is only a snapshot in time and these numbers will continue to change. And if all of the parameters for Bitcoin remain unchanged, pretty much overnight, a Bitcoin will begin to cost $45,000 to produce or mine. But odds are that by April 2024, the cost to produce one Bitcoin will be greater than this thanks to additional Bitcoin miners coming online. Converting Bitcoin's Energy Into The Oil or Natural Gas Equivalent The cost of a kWh of energy can vary wildly across the United States. In California, the average retail cost of one kWh of energy is 31 cents. When you factor in the industrial and commercial sectors, a kWh of energy averages 25 cents. In Texas, one of the more friendly states to mine Bitcoin in, a kWh of energy averages roughly 10 cents. This confirms that to mine a Bitcoin, its energy equivalent value is about $22,500 and probably less in some cases. Oil What if we converted the kWh needed to mine a Bitcoin, into the energy equivalent of a barrel of oil? Although oil varies between states, it doesn't vary in price as much as kWh energy rates. There are 1,700 kWh of energy in one barrel of oil. This means that one Bitcoin is the energy equivalent of 132 barrels of oil. When we calculate the energy equivalent value of Bitcoin in terms of oil, one Bitcoin only costs about $12,000 per Bitcoin to mine. (132 barrels x $91 per barrel) Natural Gas One thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas costs $3.60 cents. One kWh equals 3.41 cubic feet of natural gas. Therefore, 3.41 Mcf equals 1,000 kWh. Therefore, 1,000 kWh equals $12.26 equivalent of natural gas. And for the final calculation, in terms of natural gas, one Bitcoin equals $2,758 of natural gas. ($12.26 x 225) Which Way Bitcoin? kWh Oil (barrels) Natural Gas (Mcf) Energy To Mine 1 Bitcoin 225,000 132 767 $ Value $22,500 $12,000 $2,758 If I have done my math correctly, this presents an interesting problem that any investor should be able to see. One of two things need to happen. Either, oil and natural gas (and especially natural gas) need to increase in price to fill the large gap between the Bitcoin price and its energy equivalent when priced in hydrocarbons, or the price of Bitcoin needs to decrease. But also keep in mind that this simple analysis excludes any capital costs to purchase equipment necessary to directly mine Bitcoin with hydrocarbons, however, I suspect the capital expense is easily justified. I described this ""arbitrage opportunity"" conceptually in my article titled The Bullish Case for Oil here . So what is likely to happen with this ""opportunity?"" I'm not the first one to know that there is an opportunity to mine Bitcoin with hydrocarbons and it is clear from Bitcoin's continuously rising hashrate that there are Bitcoin miners who are exploiting this opportunity. As I've noted in previous articles, it was publicly disclosed that Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) began mining Bitcoin in 2021 . Over the long-term there will be several factors, each happening at once in order to bring this into an equilibrium state: 1) likely upward moves in the price of oil and natural gas (and retail cost of a kWh), 2) continued increases in Bitcoin's hashrate, and 3) the Bitcoin halving 4) Upward (or downward) movement in Bitcoin's price. Each of these will work together to find an equilibrium between Bitcoin prices and energy prices...eventually. Why does this arbitrage opportunity exist? I will touch on this briefly in the section on MicroStrategy's share dilution. In the next section, I will describe how the Bitcoin halving will help solve this as well. Bitcoin Halving Approaches The Bitcoin halving is approaching quickly. It doesn't have a set date but is estimated to arrive per the protocol sometime around April 2024. The halving is the moment in time when the number of Bitcoins that are rewarded to the miners is halved. This is why owning shares in the public Bitcoin mining companies as the halving approaches is not advisable. When the Bitcoin halving happens, I don't know how it will play out, but I would expect the Bitcoin mining industry to be forced to capitulate before Bitcoin begins to rise again. The market is brutal sometimes and it will likely go hunting for some Bitcoin mining bankruptcies following the halving. And this begs the question, if you want to be leveraged to Bitcoin heading into the halving, why would you dare to own the Bitcoin miners? Wouldn't you rather own shares in a company whose variable expenses and revenues are not tied to Bitcoin, but yet owns Bitcoin on its balance sheet? And like many things, the answer is not this simple. Naturally, It depends. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Carrying Cost One dependent factor is MicroStrategy's carrying cost. In other words, owning Bitcoin with leverage is not free but comes with interest expenses. What are those interest expenses? At the end of Q2, MicroStrategy's annualized interest expenses were roughly $36 million. You can see below where MicroStrategy's interest expense is coming from. MicroStrategy Capital Structure (Q2 2023) Here is a graphic of the company's debt that is coming due in relation to the Bitcoin halving. If the Bitcoin halving has a similar effect as it has in the past, by 2027 and 2028, Bitcoin will have appreciated to some degree from current levels. Will Bitcoin appreciate by more than MSTR's weighted average interest expense that sits somewhere less than 3 percent? Time will tell, but I like that bet. MicroStrategy Debt Notes Due (Q2 2023 Presentation) MicroStrategy Share Dilution Michael Saylor's conviction to exchange MSTR shares for Bitcoin comes from the fact that he is happily exchanging a non-scarce asset in company shares for a perfectly scarce asset, Bitcoin. The verdict is still out, but this strategy is likely a brilliant one. This is a strategy that won't avail itself to public companies forever and hopefully in this case, fortune will favor the bold. Very simply, Michael Saylor understands Bitcoin's scarcity (along with its other attributes that lend value to its scarcity). And one way to tell if the strategy is working is if MSTR shares have been penalized for its dilution...and to date, it has not. Remember the slide above where it showed that MSTR shares have outperformed the market as well as tech bellwether stocks? If exchanging shares of MSTR for Bitcoin was going to penalize MSTR's performance, it perhaps would have by now. Similar to mining Bitcoin with hydrocarbons, MicroStrategy is exposing with their shares what they believe is a type of arbitrage opportunity. As the world transitions from the fiat money world back to the hard money world, arbitrage opportunities will abound. And in fact, Bitcoin is a kind of arbitrage all its own against the inevitable growing money supply. This is nature's way of coming back into equilibrium. MicroStrategy Quarterly ATM Activity (Q2 Presentation) MicroStrategy Shares Outstanding Table (Millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q2 2023 Shares Outstanding 10.6 10.1 9.6 11.3 11.5 14.1 Bitcoin ETF vs. MicroStrategy vs. Bitcoin In this slide, as I have laid out above, MicroStrategy lays out why owning MSTR shares is advantageous relative to other forms of gaining exposure to Bitcoin, including Bitcoin itself. MicroStrategy touts the following advantages they provide: Ease of Access - Most people have a stock brokerage account where they can buy MicroStrategy. Not everyone wants to learn how to hold Bitcoin in a cold storage Bitcoin wallet. (although that is likely advisable) Downside Protection - MicroStrategy can leverage their non-Bitcoin business to limit risks to their Bitcoin holdings. Intelligent Leverage - A weighted average interest rate on its Bitcoin-related debt below 3 percent Generate Yield - It does it with ""intelligent accretive financing"" as well as buying incremental Bitcoin with cash flow. Healthy Derivatives - MicroStrategy provides a way to use derivatives to hedge one's Bitcoin holdings by using MSTR puts and calls. Tracking Bitcoin's Price - MSTR tracks the price of Bitcoin relatively closely. MicroStrategy Advantage over other forms of bitcoin exposure (MicroStrategy Q2 Presentation) Balance Sheet and Tax-Advantages MicroStrategy carries Bitcoin on its balance sheet and in the table below you can see that their debt-to-asset ratio has risen above 1. Surely this is a terrible sign, right? Not really. You can see below that their carrying value on the balance sheet is much lower than the actual value of their Bitcoin. And as we said above, at a moment's notice, the company has approved the ability to sell shares at-the-market if it needs greater liquidity. And with a perfectly scarce asset like Bitcoin on the balance sheet, demand for MSTR shares is not likely to suddenly dry up. It is important to note that current accounting standards allow MicroStrategy to impair its Bitcoin assets at the prices they reach at the end of each quarter. This creates an accounting tax advantage for MicroStrategy which they fully capitalized on in 2022. However, when you read the footnotes on the slide below, this tax advantage for ""digital assets"" may be getting cancelled by FASB soon. MicroStrategy has responded to FASB's proposed changes. To me, this would seem like a double standard and simply a way to penalize a company who owns Bitcoin versus other assets. This will be something to watch over time. MicroStrategy's Debt-To-Asset Ratio Table 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Assets 856 917 1,466 3,557 2,410 Debt 326 408 913 2,578 2,793 Debt-to-Asset Ratio .38 .44 .62 .72 1.16 Bitcoin Holdings Carry Value vs Market Value (MicroStrategy Q2 2023 Presentation) MicroStrategy's (Other) Core Business Although most investors are focused on MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy, it is important to remember that they also operate a software analytics business. Here I am using MicroStrategy's revenue and net income as a metric to measure the company's top line growth and profitability where I normally like to use operating cash flow. I'm not using MicroStrategy's operating cash flow as its Bitcoin business has muddied up its operating cash flow statement, somewhat. What I want to understand, however is how strong and steady is its core business. I will take a look at the trend in its revenues and income to provide that for me. It'lets not forgets important to remember that if you are going to buy MicroStrategy, you should not buy it for its core business. However, its core business affords it the levers necessary to execute on its Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy Revenues and Net Income 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Q2 2023 TTM Revenue 497.6 486.3 480.7 510.8 499.3 500.2 Net Income 22.5 34.4 (7.5) (535.5) (1,469.8) 206.7 Financial Highlights From Core Business in Q2 (Microstrategy Q2 Results) The Historical Chart MicroStrategy has an interesting chart. The company was founded in 1989 and didn't go public until 1998, just prior to the 2000 tech bubble. As you can see in the chart, it rode the boom and bust of the tech bubble reaching over 3,000 dollars per share at the peak. Then, when the company began buying Bitcoin, it reached another peak as Bitcoin appreciated in 2020 and 2021. There is no technical analysis involved here except to simply say that if MSTR reaches its 2021 peak, it will have increased over 3x from current prices. And if it reaches its 2000 peak, that will have been between a 9x and 10x increase in value from current levels. I believe that with a reasonable amount of time, each of these scenarios is possible. MicroStrategy Stock Chart (TradingView) Risks Despite admiring Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy, there are obvious risks involved. First, if there is such a large disparity in energy prices between natural gas, oil, and electricity kWhs of energy, there is a risk that as these come into greater equilibrium, one of the factors for these to come into equilibrium will be a lower Bitcoin price. The argument against this happening is that kWhs are sold at a very sticky price. Therefore, the more likely outcome is for there to be increases in hydrocarbon prices. Second, as the Bitcoin halving approaches, there are Bitcoin miners that are overleveraged. This is well-known. Following the halving in April 2024, I expect there to be some liquidations as the weak miners get washed out. As their inefficient hashing power is removed by the market, there will be a temporary dip in Bitcoin's hashrate. This will likely cause some people to sell their Bitcoin, depressing Bitcoin's price. I can see a scenario where Bitcoin revisits the 2022 low near $15,000 per coin. If one thinks this is a probable scenario, then waiting to buy MicroStrategy until after the halving may be wise. Third, MicroStrategy could make a mistake in financing their Bitcoin strategy. Right now, each of MicroStrategy's bond issuances is a convertible issuance except the $500 million due in 2028. However, MicroStrategy has approved a large at-the-money equity issuance and I assume they will still have one in 2028, effectively making the 2028 bond a convertible bond as well. Some will see this dilution in shares as a risk, which may or may not be true but ultimately depends upon Bitcoin's price. Fourth, MicroStrategy could straight up lose their Bitcoin. I don't know every detail in how the company has chosen to custody their Bitcoin, but it is always a risk that they can lose it, although this is extremely unlikely. I see the largest risk coming from market disruptions as money markets and energy markets search out greater equilibrium prices. I'm not naïve enough to think that perfect equilibrium will be reached, especially thanks to government market intervention in both energy and money markets at the moment, but it is something to be aware of. Conclusion When you dig under the hood, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy appears to be a on solid footing. There are certainly risks involved but so far, the company has hedged itself effectively and protected itself from the wall-street ""shorts"" by using financial leverage very strategically. When Bitcoin reached roughly $15,000 in 2022, there were many who thought MSTR had overleveraged itself and that if Bitcoin continued to fall the company would be in serious financial straits. It seemed like MicroStrategy and its Bitcoin holdings were about to fall into a vicious debt spiral. But if you think Michael Saylor is going to be outsmarted by the market, then you should think again. Saylor has not only been running a company for many years but has also been a successful retail investor himself. A seasoned veteran like Saylor likely already understood the risks of falling Bitcoin prices prior to 2022 and was prepared. Regardless, the company made the appropriate adjustments as the Bitcoin environment changed. I'm rating MicroStrategy a ""hold"" as I believe it is more prudent to take a wait and see approach until after the Bitcoin halving. And based on the energy differential in the cost to mine a Bitcoin between natural gas, oil, and kWh, it is possible that Bitcoin trades down and sideways, maybe even for a few months after the halving occurs. Furthermore, there may be some debt liquidations for Bitcoin mining companies following the halving. That said, for the person who has a much longer time horizon and is simply dollar-cost averaging, I would rate MicroStrategy a long-term buy. And let's not forget that the company has a steady software business. What are your thoughts? Is it better to own Bitcoin outright OR a Bitcoin mining company, or own a company that owns Bitcoin like MicroStrategy? And do you think MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy is a good one?",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4636590-microstrategy-mstr-buying-its-bitcoin-macro-strategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17905484.jpeg

42409660,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMni3,1695316012,"Polygon Emerges as Suitor for Celo’s New Layer-2 Blockchain, Competing With OP Stack","As the Celo blockchain prepares to migrate into a layer 2 network on Ethereum, there's suddenly competition to provide technology to the project.  Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs, submitted a proposal to the Celo community on Wednesday, pitching that the blockchain make use of Polygon’s Chain Development Kit – a codebase that developers can use to create their own customizable layer-2 chains powered by zero-knowledge technology.  Celo, which announced the migration plan in July, had originally signaled plans to rely on Optimism's OP Stack, a similar customizable kit that makes use of Optimism’s “optimistic” technology. Coinbase’s new Base blockchain is built on the OP Stack, a so-far successful launch that has helped to position the Optimism tech as a top contender in the arena.  Celo may be inclined to consider the Polygon proposal as well as potentially other project teams that might float their own competing offers: “Frankly, would not be surprised to see other stacks chime in too,” a person close to the Celo ecosystem told CoinDesk.  ""Looking forward to having us discuss this here in more detail with cLabs team and the broader community!"" Celo co-founder Rene Reinsberg wrote in response to Nailwal's proposal.  When asked for comment, OP Labs provided a statement attributed to CEO Karl Floersch: ""Projects expanding into L2 strengthen the entire ecosystem, and we're all working towards the same mission. The Celo community will evaluate its options and make a decision, and we’re excited to soon welcome them to the L2 community.""  Ethereum scaling  What’s at stake is the race for a first-mover or leading position among teams competing to provide the dominant technology for Ethereum’s rapidly growing world of interconnected layer-2 networks – pitched by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as the primary strategy for making transactions cheaper and faster across the overall ecosystem.  So landing Celo, which currently runs its own standalone blockchain but has plans to migrate into an Ethereum layer-2 network, could represent a coup for whichever layer-2 project team wins the mandate – not just in revenue potential but bragging rights.  Layer 2 blockchains have been battling it out over the past few months to get projects to make use of their blockchain kits, releasing free tools for developers to clone their codebases to create their own customizable blockchains.  Most visibly, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase tapped Optimism’s OP Stack to roll out its Base layer 2 network last month. Other layer 2s like Polygon, Starkware, zkSync, and Arbitrum have all come out with their own versions of customizable blockchain kits (or as we like to call them, blockchains in a box.)  Blockchain experts have long signaled that the zero-knowledge or ZK technology might be superior to that of optimistic technology, but the folks at Optimism’s OP Labs have shared that they don’t see any threat from ZK stacks overtaking their product.

42409668,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMo8V,1695312699,Is Crypto-AI Really a Match Made in Heaven?,"Trent McConaghy’s father was a pig farmer in rural Canada. There wasn’t much to do for fun. His father bought him a computer when he was a kid, in the 1980s, along with a reference manual. Trent couldn’t play video games at an arcade, so he taught himself to code and whipped up his own version of Pac-Man. When he was around 10-years-old, he found a used book at a garage sale.  The book was about AI.  “I’ve been super excited about it ever since, for my whole life,” says McConaghy. In the 1990s, he downloaded neural networks from “bulletin boards” before the internet was even a thing; he pioneered research on using AI for circuit-board design; and he worked on AI-related startups until “getting the blockchain bug in 2013.”  While many in the crypto space have recently “pivoted to AI,” McConaghy has been there since the beginning. “Blockchain has been my focus for several years,” he wrote in 2017. “But AI was always my first love, and I never let go.”  McConaghy’s project, Ocean Protocol, is one of a growing number of crypto-meets-AI startups that’s trying to leverage blockchain to improve AI. But this is where things get fuzzy. What does “crypto-meets-AI” even mean, exactly? Ever since the exploding hype of ChatGPT, many in the Web3 space, including me, have written about how crypto and AI could somehow fit together. But often the idea is hazy and abstract and framed in a vague sense of “let’s combine chocolate and peanut butter.”  Perhaps tellingly, you usually see the hopeful “Web3 and AI need each other” takes from the Web3 space, and rarely from the AI camp, which has the feel of a one-sided college rivalry. Even many web3/AI champions are frustrated by the hopium. “I’m actually quite disappointed with the narrative out there,” says Mrinal Manohar, CEO of Casper Labs, which is working on blockchain-meets-AI solutions. “There’s a sense of, ‘Let’s throw a little blockchain fairy dust on it, and it gets better.’ That’s not really how stuff works.”  So the goal here is to go deeper and explore how, more concretely, Web3 can help in the development of safe and ethical AI. There are dozens of projects working on a wide range of use cases, from spotting deep fakes to making AI safer -- Allison Duettmann gives an excellent overview -- but here we’ll focus on two essential areas: Data and compute.  Any AI model is only as good as its data. And training these AI models requires so much computational power -- and energy -- that it makes bitcoin mining look like a pocket calculator.  So how could Web3 help?  Let’s start with data. As anyone who has dabbled in ChatGPT knows, the AI has a tendency to “hallucinate,” which is a nice euphemism for “bullshitting.” I like to think of ChatGPT as an employee who is so eager to please you, so hungry for your affection, that it will lie so you’ll think it’s doing a good job.  The problem of hallucinations is complicated. There’s no clear answer. Once the data is hoovered up by the LLM it’s essentially a black box, and even the brightest engineers in the business can’t point to precisely which data inputs caused given data outputs. (Here I’m imagining a brilliantly written academic white paper that ends in a shrug emoji.) On top of that, as we’ve seen from recent lawsuits from writers like Sarah Silverman and Michael Chabon, there are charges that AI is illegally built from copyrighted work.  “Blockchain can eliminate all of that,” says Manohar. “Blockchain is the world’s strongest copy protection technology.” Blockchain, with its ability to track every chunk of data along the chain, could in theory -- heavy emphasis on “in theory” -- let you audit the data for copyright infringement, bias, or inaccuracies.  An embrace of blockchain could not only vet the data used to feed the models, it could even, potentially, expand the pool of useful data. Think about health care or financial information. Given the obvious concerns over privacy, “these are two data sources that we cannot touch,” says Duettmann, CEO of Foresight Institute. “Large data models cannot go there.”  But what if individuals are incentivized to offer our own personal data, assuming this could be done in a way that preserves privacy? Ali Yahya, a General Partner at blue-chip VC fund Andreessen Horowitz, has called this the “long tail” of data, and argues that Web3 is the only way to harness it. “There’s just data out there in the world that doesn’t exist except for the long tail,” says Yahya.  The way that AI teams have traditionally built data models, explains Yahya, involves a “top-down” framework where you scour the earth and hunt for data, like how Waymo slaps cameras atop cars with a mission of filming every road on the planet. “But maybe a better way to do that is bottoms-up,” says Yahya, “where you just have normal people out there contributing data from their own driving.”  But these normal people wouldn’t do it for free. They need an incentive, and that brings us back to Trent McConaghy. As far back as 2017, he envisioned Ocean Protocol as a data marketplace that could “connect data-haves with data-have-nots,” which in turn would spread out “data-AI network effects, in turn spreading power and wealth.”  In the very next sentence McConaghy added, almost as a reality check, “But the technology is not easy.” The challenges: “It needs to store who owns what data, with tight user control and privacy,” McConaghy explains. “It needs to reconcile with governments and regulators on privacy and data sharing. It needs to be decentralized. It needs to be at scale, not just some shiny toy technology. Decentralized tech at scale is hard.”  Read more: Allison Duettmann - How Crypto Can Help Secure AI  This is why it took five years to build out the infrastructure of Ocean’s marketplace. (Another OG crypto-meets-AI project, SingularityNET, has also been building out decentralized AI marketplaces for the past five years.) At times it didn’t even look like an AI-focused project. A recent blog post, for example, said that the next phase of Ocean is to “drive value-creation loops,” and that “the most promising and mature vertical is decentralized finance.”  The point of all this minutia is that before the chocolate-meets-peanut-butter of crypto-AI becomes a reality, there’s an unfathomable amount of plumbing that needs to be put into place. McConaghy is a lifelong AI addict and he’s been building this for years, but he acknowledges that, “We haven’t been able to build much AI stuff directly yet.”  That could soon change. He says the data marketplace now exists, the incentives are in place, and “Now we get to play with the AI a lot more again.”  Hard to compute, hard to verify  Playing with AI requires computation, and computation requires computer chips -- like Nvidia’s H100 -- and these chips are in short supply. (OpenAI even announced that they are delaying the training of their next models because of a lack of chips.)  While perhaps the shortage is only a short-term pinch, it’s also possible that it will continue -- or even get worse -- as the appetite for data processing grows. What happens when OpenAI is training ChatGPT 7? Could the need for chips outpace the supply?  “We’re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,” says Ben Fielding, co-founder of Gensyn, another crypto-meets-AI project. “You hear about people going to Antarctica [to build data centers]. It’s getting a lot harder.” So Gensyn is working on an audacious plan to unlock more global supply. “You don’t just have one big data center,” says Fielding. “Now you have every data center on the planet.”  The idea of Gensyn: Users will be compensated (via some type of token) for loaning their idle computing power to a network, and this will morph into a decentralized system that can train AI. There’s actually precedent for these kinds of crypto projects. Filecoin incentivizes users to give unused data storage to the cloud; Helium rewards people for providing local WiFi. Both projects started as moonshots, and now they both have traction.  Read more: Chris Coll-Beswick - AI Is Killing Crypto Venture Capital Interest  Gensyn is up against longer odds.  The team faces one fundamental challenge that complicates everything they do: Verification. In some ways their task is even trickier than securing the bitcoin network. “Bitcoin is hard to compute, easy to verify,” says Harry Grieve, Gensyn’s other co-founder, explaining that while Proof of Work demands enormous computing power, the actual math itself is relatively straightforward. “Machine learning is hard to compute, also hard to verify.”  The challenge involves the old “trustless” issue. If you’re sending me bitcoin, you don’t know me and you can’t trust me, so the genius of the network is to verify both ends of the transaction. But that’s static. If you’re actually computing data that will train AI -- such as images or movies -- that’s literally a moving target that needs to be verified against other checkpoints in the network, and it all needs to happen on-chain.  Then it gets even harder. The fluid nature of neural networks means the entire system is always in flux. “You can’t just take two pieces and check them separately,” says Fielding. The details get awfully weedy, but the key idea is that each piece of the puzzle needs to be checked against the entire puzzle -- which is in motion -- at all times, and it needs to be done using some kind of Zero-Knowledge Proof to preserve privacy.  Then there’s the “distributed system challenge.” Let’s say you, me and Taylor Swift are all offering our computers to help train AI models. Sounds great in theory. But in this kind of decentralized system, who exactly is deciding what chunk of the task is being performed by your idle computer, what part by mine, and what part by Taylor Swift while she’s onstage? This is the type of infrastructure that needs to be built. “It’s a hard problem,” says Yahya (a16z is an investor in Gensyn), “but it’s not an impossible problem.”  Centralized systems, in contrast, are relatively simple. It’s easy to coordinate resources. Verification is a given. You don’t have the headache of latency. This is why centralized solutions from the likes of OpenAI and DeepMind have leapt out to such a head start. The pitch from Gensyn and Ocean and many other projects like them is that, yes, what they are doing is harder and slower (for now) and will take time to build, but in the end the payoff -- AI that’s unshackled from big tech – will be worth the wait.  Then again… do these decentralized solutions even need blockchain?  Blockchains necessary?  I ask Yahya this point-blank. What if the real secret sauce is cryptography, yes, but not necessarily cryptocurrency?  For him this is simple. “Cryptography by itself cannot create this incentive field,” says Yahya. “It cannot create this decentralized marketplace for resources in the way that a blockchain can.”  Maybe that’s true, but it also might be a stretch to conflate every merit of cryptography with the perks of cryptocurrency. “You don’t need blockchain for everything related to cryptography,” says Duettmann, explaining that a good chunk of the AI field is focused on cryptographic solutions that have nothing to do with Web3. And while it’s true that decentralized AI is a goal embraced by many, it’s also true that plenty of open-source solutions -- such as the promising work from Llama 2 -- seem indifferent to tokens or cryptocurrency.  It’s also possible that Web3 is not only unnecessary for the development of ethical AI, but might even be harmful. Think of the darkest elements of crypto -- rug pulls, scams, phishing attacks -- and now combine that with the worst fears of runaway AIs. Imagine an AI-controlled-DAO that’s on some kind of privacy-preserving chain, and this AI is good at making money and then using it to spread chaos, a la Ultron.  Nightmares aside, even in the best-case scenarios for crypto-infused AI, the experts generally agree that mainstream solutions are nowhere imminent. The infrastructure will take time.  “Timing is always hard to predict,” Yahya says guardedly, when I press him for an estimate. He suspects that the technical solutions might be in place in “one to two years,” perhaps using a model of progressive decentralization. Gensyn’s Fielding says, “Lots of things we need will take multiple years to build.”  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse)  It’s also not clear exactly how the data solutions (like Ocean) will ultimately plug into the computing solutions (like Gensyn). And even if these solutions are able to snap together and work as advertised, the UX needs to be clean and simple and easy to use. “The actual user experience has to feel as if you’re using something like the cloud, that’s centralized,” says Yahya. “If it’s much, much harder to use something like Gensyn than Amazon, then I think that’d be difficult, even if the price is lower.”  Clean UX has never been Web3’s strong-suit, but let’s imagine that developers pull it off. Let’s envision a world where all of these solutions work. And now let’s explore an AI-plus-blockchain scenario that’s truly wild.  Nature 2.0  McConaghy has obsessed over AI since his childhood on the pig farm. He has spent years building crypto-AI-solutions. “Can blockchain help with AI alignment? In the near-term, it can help,” he says. But ultimately, he thinks there’s little -- or maybe nothing -- that can be done to curb AGIs in the long-term. And he believes it’s naïve to think AGIs will spare our “meat bags” out of benevolence.  Consider the ants.  McConaghy thinks that AGI is a fait accompli, and the only question is when. So he imagines a metaphor of humans and ants, where the future AGIs are the humans and we are the ants. “Let’s say the ants come to you, and they can talk, and they say, ‘Hey, we’d like you to stop being as smart as humans. Please, please, please only be as smart as ants.’” Humans are 100 times as smart as ants, says McConaghy, and it’s “completely obvious that AI will get to be 100 times as smart as humans and beyond.”  We wouldn’t bow to the ants wishes; we’d just stomp them with our boots.  If you accept this premise, logically, there are only two ways to crack this problem. The first is the one that most people are talking about -- regulation, slowing down, or somehow “nerfing” large language models to keep the growth of AI in check, or aligning them to our values.  McConaghy sees this as a losing battle. (Perhaps a battle we should fight nonetheless, but one that we will likely lose.)  So, instead, he’s bullish on the second solution, the one that almost no one’s talking about, and this is where things get spicy: Leveraging AI to let humans become “super intelligent” and add functionality to our brains. He thinks of this as “Nature 2.0,” and as the next phase of human evolution. This is a future of humanity where, as McConaghy puts it, we are “not bound by our blood bodies.”  The exact solution is still a whopping TBD, but maybe our brains are scanned and uploaded to a computer, or perhaps even our entire body is replicated atom-by-atom. Eventually, McConaghy thinks that when you are 90 years old and your body is withering, maybe your new cyborg-ish self realizes that this “meat-bag stuff is getting in the way,” and you “clip it like a finger-nail.” (He unpacked the idea way back in a 2016 essay “The AI Existential Threat: Reflections of a Recovering Bio-Narcissist.”)  He then gives a compelling, step-by-step scenario that I find surprisingly plausible  Clearly this is all still, at this point, just the stuff of science fiction. McConaghy recognizes that the tech is still years or even decades away. But he then gives a compelling, step-by-step scenario that I find surprisingly plausible.  He starts with something that is very much in our current world: Imagine you’re wearing Apple earbuds and walking around with them all day long. You’re interacting with friends (sending and receiving texts) and chatting with an upgraded version of Siri. This is not far-fetched.  Now imagine you’re doing the same thing, but, instead of AirPods, you’re wearing glasses that have a simple LCD screen -- a souped-up version of those Google Glasses that never took off. The glasses let you send and receive texts, interact with an AI chat-bot and query the internet.  Maybe the glasses have “eye-tracking,” so you glance at prompts on the screen like you’re clicking a mouse. Again, not at all far-fetched, as this is precisely how Apple’s new Vision Pro goggles work.  Now imagine a twist. The glasses get an upgrade with “brain-scanning,” meaning you can click a link by thinking instead of pressing a button or even looking at it. This is not as outlandish as it sounds. “That’s pretty practical right now,” says McConaghy. For example, a brain-computer interface was recently used to allow a paralyzed woman -- who had no physical control of her vocal cords -- to speak again through her brain signals. One of Elon Musk’s roughly 347 companies, Neurallink, is quietly working on these kind of brain-interface solutions.  The next twist: These glasses are taking video of everything around you, always, and yes, this was indeed the plot of a Black Mirror episode. The glasses store the video. It’s now a powerful database that you can access at any time, just by thinking. As McConaghy says, “When you try to remember what you had for breakfast you can do a query, ‘What did I have for breakfast?’” This would give you a literal photographic memory.  And the glasses will also, of course, be equipped with some form of advanced chatbot, giving you instant access to the entirety of human knowledge, and letting you fetch results just by thinking. Let’s say you have a problem to solve. You could have silent and rapid-fire conversations with this chat-bot to help you brainstorm, strategize, map out scenarios, challenge assumptions, check your math, consider what Socrates would have said about your predicament, and then Immanuel Kant and then David Hume and then Jean-Paul Sartre.  You are now super-smart. You have swallowed the “Limitless” intelligence pill. You are now a member of Nature 2.0, and perhaps you are now, finally, a match for the inevitable AGIs. Now it’s a fair fight.  So, does blockchain have a role in this world of AI-powered super-humans?  McConaghy had a vision for this in 2018, an idea that (as he said then) “combines and extends AI [plus] blockchain into a symbiosis of biology and machine, for a future of abundance.” The gist of the idea: Just as today’s Web2 data is owned by the corporate giants, tomorrow’s thought-data could be up for grabs. “How do you make sure your thoughts are not being watched by Google?” McConaghy asks. Some kind of blockchain solution would give you privacy, agency, and ownership over your very thoughts that are now linked to this larger network.  “You need to basically own [your thoughts] in the same way you own bitcoin,” says McConaghy. And he leaves me with one final concept: “Not your keys, not your thoughts.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/21/is-crypto-ai-really-a-match-made-in-heaven,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dbd31b40895aa3104e6f22c835bd139488332c4-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Funding Rates On Binance & Deribit Are Deep Red Right Now According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, traders on the derivative market have continued to bet against the cryptocurrency recently. The relevant indicator here is the “funding rate,” which keeps track of the periodic fee that derivative contract holders on an exchange are paying each other right now. When this metric has a positive value, it means that the long traders are paying a premium to the short traders in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend suggests that the majority sentiment on the given exchange is bullish currently. On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark implies the traders on the platform hold a bearish mentality at the moment, as the shorts are the dominant force. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Coming Soon? What Network Fundamentals Say Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin funding rates for Binance and Deribit over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite red in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin funding rate for both of these exchanges had been mostly positive during the last third of August and the starting third of this month, implying that the majority of the traders had been longs. The bets of these holders had failed, however, as the price had seen an overall downtrend in this period. Since the rebound earlier this month, though, the sentiment has flipped in the market as shorts have piled up on both of these platforms. These short traders haven’t been successful so far, either, as the value of the cryptocurrency has seen net growth since they have appeared. Historically, the market has actually been more likely to go against the expectation of the majority, so this pattern may be in line with that. The reason why the asset would move against the bets of these contract holders is that mass liquidation events, called squeezes, become more likely to happen the more lopsided the sector is. A large amount of long liquidations can amplify crashes, while short liquidations can provide the fuel for upward surges. Since Bitcoin is still seeing aggressive shorting, it may be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency’s current price rise, as a potential short squeeze could help it extend further. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Not See Lasting Bullish Momentum Until This Happens Interestingly, while Bitcoin is being bet against right now, Ethereum’s funding rates are positive, as pointed out by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X. The two metrics have diverged recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X From the graph, it’s visible that the funding rates of the top two assets in the sector have gone opposite ways recently. This means that while BTC may be able to build an uptrend off the shorts, ETH could face the opposite effect if the longs end up being liquidated.

Bitcoin began just over 10 years ago and a lot has happened – good, bad and ugly. Over 100,000 tokens and crypto projects have launched, and many have failed, seemingly designed from the outset to scam investors.  Still, many projects are standing the test of time and building real-world value. Many of these projects are considered transformational from a technology basis (the underlying blockchains), with many associated cryptocurrencies having seen a meteoric rise in value.  How can advisors help navigate this asset class and support their clients? Christopher Jensen from Franklin Templeton Digital Assets dispels some common crypto myths, allowing you to navigate your fear, uncertainty and doubt in this space.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Mythbusting: Three Things Investors Often Get Wrong About Crypto  Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade now but remain largely misunderstood by the investment community. In this article we dispel a few of the biggest myths surrounding crypto to help you assess the opportunities and risks for clients.  Myth #1: Cryptocurrencies are purely speculative  Many investors like to lump cryptocurrencies in with tulips and Beanie Babies, believing that they have little to no intrinsic value. And with headlines of bubbles in certain “meme coins” – risky, speculative, often backed by nothing but a comical concept – it’s easy to see why.  The underreported side is that there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that are backed by an actual business (a protocol) complete with employees (developers), customers, and revenues. Protocols in crypto are basic sets of rules that allow data to be shared between computers and thus establish how a specific blockchain or decentralized application operates. A protocol may have a native token, a type of cryptocurrency, that is used to transact on its blockchain. The two largest native tokens by market capitalization and their respective protocols are BTC (Bitcoin) and ETH (Ethereum). Tokens are what the vast majority of crypto investors hold.  Evaluating protocols is not so dissimilar from evaluating companies to invest in via stocks or bonds. Major considerations include the protocol’s purpose, customers and value created, as well as the competitive landscape. What is different from traditional investments is that there is not always a mechanism for the value of a protocol to flow through to the token. Fundamental analysis of a protocol and its respective token, sometimes referred to as tokenomics, can help determine whether the token has meaningful capital appreciation potential that might make it suitable for client portfolios.  Myth #2: Cryptocurrencies are mainly used to fund illicit activity  Investors are accustomed to the traditional and highly regulated banking system where banks require identification documents and are bound by strict Know-Your-Customer or KYC regulations. Banks are required to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and governmental sanctions may be applied at any time in the form of accounts frozen or seized in the event of illicit activity.  In contrast, cryptocurrencies can be traded anonymously, practically instantaneously, and are not controlled by a central authority. This makes them a likely target for enabling illicit transactions – in theory. The catch is that all transactions that occur on a blockchain are kept on the public record, and in order to use the money outside of the digital asset ecosystem a criminal needs a “fiat off-ramp” like a centralized crypto exchange. The centralized exchanges that exist today are extremely censorable, thus making stolen crypto extremely hard to cash out of without getting caught.  The data reinforces that the vast majority of crypto transactions are not used for illicit activity. According to Chainalysis, the illicit share of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2022 was 0.24%, down from its peak of 1.90% in 2019. The 0.24% of the crypto market translates to $20.8 billion of illicit activity, which is a very small fraction of the United Nations estimate of the $800 billion to $2 trillion laundered globally on an annual basis.  Myth #3: Cryptocurrencies are bad for the environment  Cryptocurrencies – particularly bitcoin – have traditionally been portrayed as “energy gluttons,” receiving harsh criticisms related to their energy consumption. Because of their perceived energy intensive nature, many investors, especially those with ESG considerations, overlook digital asset investments entirely. Recent studies, however, have shown that bitcoin’s network may be significantly less energy intensive than we originally believed, and ultimately possesses several efficiencies over the traditional monetary payment system.  Bitcoin’s network relies on a mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW) to operate. This means that for the network to verify transactions, bitcoin requires computers to solve increasingly complex math problems that consume a considerable amount of energy in the process.  However, a recent peer-reviewed publication estimated that the Bitcoin network consumes at least 28 times less energy than the traditional monetary payment when accounting for banknotes and coins, cash management in ATM systems, card payments, point of sale (POS) payments, banking and inter-banking energy consumption and several other contributing factors.  Additionally, Ethereum’s energy usage, which was in the general ballpark as Bitcoin’s when it had a PoW mechanism, has declined by 99%since changing to the less energy intensive Proof-of-Stake mechanism in September 2022.  Disclosure statement link.  – Christopher Jensen, Head of Research, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets  Ask an Advisor: Myths Clients Bring up Relating to Crypto  Cryptocurrencies Are Completely Anonymous - Cryptocurrencies are not anonymous. They are pseudonymous. The fact that crypto wallets are a long, random string of letters and numbers means it is extremely difficult to figure out what wallet belongs to whom. But once a wallet’s owner becomes public knowledge (for example you receive crypto from someone which reveals their public address) the entire history of that wallet becomes public knowledge. It is the double-edged sword of a transparent, public ledger.  Cryptocurrencies Are Only Used for Illegal Activities - Crypto can be used for illicit activities but as mentioned previously once wallet addresses become public knowledge there is no way to hide how much crypto you own, how much you have sent, and how much you have received. Just because you aren’t dealing with a bank doesn’t mean you are staying hidden from authorities. As a matter of fact, fiat is still the best way to transact if you are doing something you shouldn’t be doing and want to fly under the radar.  Cryptocurrencies Are Guaranteed to Make You Rich Quickly - For every crypto millionaire you’ve read about there are thousands more who lost it all. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, it’s just the winners who are most vocal. Crypto, like investing in stocks, presents opportunities to make money for those who put in the time and effort to do due diligence on projects and have the patience to let things play out. If you think you’ll become a millionaire overnight you’ll be disappointed.  – Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  Anne Connelly has written and spoken about how charities can benefit from receiving donations in the form of cryptocurrency, due to its transparency and ease of sending funds to the recipient.

17901351,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552317,1695308421,What The SEC’s Latest Announcement Means For The Crypto Industry,"A recent announcement by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suggests that the crypto industry may be in for more pain as it continues to endure the far-reaching consequences that the Commission’s enforcement actions have had on it. More Pain Incoming For Crypto? During the Securities Enforcement Forum Central 2023, David Hirsch stated that his office plans to bring action against other crypto companies that were breaking the law. Hirsch heads the agency’s unit (Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit) that handles crypto enforcement, including the lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges in the world, Binance and Coinbase, and another against Ripple. Related Reading: Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF These actions are already negatively impacting these companies and, by extension, the crypto industry. As such, any further action could dampen the mood in the crypto market further. For instance, Binance US, the American arm of Binance, has seen a significant drop in its trading volumes since it began to face regulatory scrutiny. In June, the SEC sued Binance US for a range of infractions, including misrepresentation of trading controls and oversight on the platform. This forced the company to suspend trading for more than 100 token pairs, causing a significant drop in trading activity and investor confidence. Also, despite securing a major victory against the SEC, Ripple’s XRP has lost most of its gains that resulted from the judgment. The XRP price has remained tepid overall, and one of the reasons for this could be that the Commission’s regulatory stance on Ripple has cast doubts in the minds of potential investors, especially with the SEC contesting Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling. The SEC’s continued clampdown on companies in the industry evidently influences how outsiders interact with stakeholders in the industry as they may be looking to avoid the SEC’s wrath. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, also recently revealed how the SEC’s lawsuit made the company lose a deal with a stablecoin issuer. Meanwhile, others in the industry may be forced to leave the market or shut down certain parts of their operations, as in the case of crypto exchange Bittrex, which had to shut down its US operations earlier this year. DeFi Not Exempted From SEC’s Wrath So far, the SEC has been known to have largely gone after crypto projects that are more centralized. However, Hirsch stated that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects, which could be a direct reference to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), would not be exempted from his unit’s enforcement actions as the “label of DeFi” will not deter them from conducting investigations and doing their job. Related Reading: Bearish Signal? Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 6-Year Slumber And Transfers $56 Million He, however, admitted that the Commission might not have enough resources to go after all these projects as they are already burdened with several lawsuits. This is in line with pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli’s reasoning that the Commission may be looking to avoid any further legal battle as they do not have enough manpower to handle any additional lawsuit.

17899857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552326,1695304824,Optimism To Sell 116 Million OP Tokens Via Private Sale: Will The Price React?,"Optimism has revealed its plans to sell 116 million OP tokens to seven private buyers. According to the update, this sale is for treasury management tokens. Based on current prices, this sale will transfer approximately $159 million worth of OP tokens to the buyers. Given the sheer amount of the sale, some traders believe it will likely cause a decline in OP’s price. Optimism Announces Sale OF 116 Million OP Tokens Following Third Airdrop Event In detail, Optimism posted a community update on September 20 on selling approximately 116 million OP tokens. The tokens are from the unallocated portion of the OP Token treasury, and these tokens are part of the Foundation’s original working budget of 30% of the initial OP supply. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price According to the update, the tokens are subject to a two-year lockup. During the lockup period, the purchasers can delegate the tokens to third parties for on-chain governance. Also, the announcement stated that from September 20, several transactions will take place with the released tokens. It noted that the transactions are pre-planned. It bears mentioning that this token sale comes a few days after Optimism announced its third OP airdrop to reward community members for participation in on-chain governance. Optimism released over 19 million OP tokens to over 31,000 unique addresses. Meanwhile, the OP community received the announcement with mixed reactions, with one user expressing disappointment. He expressed concerns that the token sale will increase Optimism’s circulating supply, impacting the price. Optimism’s Private Token Sale: Will It Affect OP’s Price? Some observers have expressed concern that the sale will affect OP’s price negatively, as the buyers may dump their tokens. However, there are a few reasons why this is unlikely to happen. Firstly, the sale is private, meaning the buyers are not required to disclose their identities or intentions for the tokens. Therefore, it makes it difficult for traders to anticipate the buyers’ actions. Secondly, the tokens are from the OP treasury’s unallocated portion and are not part of the circulating supply. It means that the sale will have a minimal impact on the availability of OP on the open market. Related Reading: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bearish-signal-price/ Furthermore, the tokens are subject to a two-year lockup period. The lockup prevents buyers from selling them on secondary markets until at least 2025, reducing the likelihood of a sell-off that could depress price. Overall, Optimism can fund its development by raising capital from investors without relying on the public. Such action could lead to increased demand for OP from bullish investors on the project’s long-term prospects. Historical Data Suggests Private Sales Could Boost OP Price Other projects have held similar private sales in the past. Recall that Polygon raised $450 million last year in a private token sale led by Sequoia Capital India. Also, in 2021, Arbitrum raised $120 million in a private token sale led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. In both of these cases, the private token sales positively impacted the price of the respective tokens. The Polygon MATIC’s price increased by over 50% in the two weeks following the announcement of the private sale. Similarly, the price of AAVE increased by 20% in the two weeks following Arbitrum’s private sale announcement. Therefore, based on this historical precedent, the private sale could benefit OP in the long run. However, note that the cryptocurrency market is volatile, and OP’s price is not guaranteed to increase.

Clemente suggests that the United States is currently facing an unavoidable predicament, where it must increase its money supply significantly to manage its mounting debt burden. This, he argues, sets the stage for substantial currency debasement in the near future. Clemente’s analysis hinges on the growing probability of the United States further expanding its money supply over the coming years. With the relentless trend of rapid money printing, he raises a critical question: Which assets will emerge as the top performers in this volatile financial landscape? Among the contenders, including the stock market, commodities, real estate, and venture/angel investing, Clemente’s resounding answer is Bitcoin. Despite being down nearly 70% from its 2021 highs, there is still a high likelihood that Bitcoin succeeds.

He emphasizes that while gold has long been considered the go-to asset during periods of currency debasement, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event will significantly bolster its stock-to-flow ratio, surpassing even that of gold and silver. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s advantages of being highly transportable, divisible, verifiable, and provably scarce position it as a superior alternative to traditional commodities. BTC market cap pegged at $521 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com The sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s potential is not limited to crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki, has echoed similar sentiments. Kiyosaki emphasizes the urgency of taking action in the current economic climate. He dismisses questions about future price predictions for Bitcoin, gold, and silver in 2025 as “silly.” Instead, he urges individuals to focus on their present holdings, emphasizing that time is running out to seize the opportunities presented by these assets.

42409651,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnKu,1695299276,"Bank of Japan a Major Source of Uncertainty, Crypto Volatility Trader Says","Move over the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is now likely to cause major shifts in global market flows. That's the message from Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin.  ""I think the BOJ will be the most significant uncertainty factor in the future. Whether it is the Fed or the ECB, their policy paths have been clear, but the BOJ is not, which means that the BOJ is likely to 'surprise' us beyond expectations,"" Ardnern told CoinDesk.  Since 2016, the BOJ has guided short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield at around 0%, known as yield curve control (YCC). It has also set an allowance band of 0.5% above and below the 10-year yield target. In July, the bank said it will allow the yield to move above the cap as long as it stays below 1.0%.  These liquidity-boosting policies have put downward pressure on global bond yields for years, adding trillions of dollars in global liquidity. The persistent easing bias over the years has popularized carry trades, which involve borrowing in yen and investing in high-yielding risk assets.  So, a potential unwinding of the negative interest rate policy and the yield curve control by the BOJ may strengthen the Japanese yen (JPY) and have knock-on effects on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The tightening cycles of the Fed, ECB and others are widely believed to have peaked. Meanwhile, the BOJ is yet to move the needle on rates.  ""Once the BOJ begins unwinding the ultra-easy policy, many assets previously obtained through the JPY-USD arbitrage channel [carry trade] may be sold off to repay debt denominated in JPY. That, in turn, may have an unexpected impact on the crypto market,"" Ardern said.  Charles Schwab voiced a similar opinion early this year, saying the carry trade can unwind quickly, leading to ""outsized cross-market volatility.""  Most economists polled by Reuters between Sept 8-19 poll expect the BOJ to end the negative interest rate policy and abolish the curve control program next year.  According to ING, the central bank may drop hints of the eventual hawkish move on Friday.  ""The BoJ is likely to stay pat [on Friday]. It could, however, send a subtle hawkish message to the market after higher-than-expected inflation and a weak JPY, combined with rising global oil prices, pushed inflation up further,"" ING said, per ForexLive.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/21/bank-of-japan-a-major-source-of-uncertainty-crypto-volatility-trader-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db098663204a34ba46394ebc74f1a9958c9571e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409671,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMoLj,1695297747,First Mover Americas: NFT Platform ImmutableX's IMX Token Rallies,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Mt. Gox has pushed back the date for its planned repayments by another 12 months, the trustees for the firm said on Thursday. The defunct crypto exchange had earlier said the deadline for repayments would be Oct. 31, 2023. That has now been pushed back to Oct. 31, 2024. The creditors of Mt. Gox have been looking for some sort of relief for a decade. The prominent crypto exchange was hacked in 2014, which led to 850,000 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $23 billion at current prices, being stolen. The exchange managed to recover around 20% of the tokens after the hack.  Bitcoin struggled to gather upside traction even after defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox pushed out its pending bankruptcy repayments by a year, delaying the return of extra supply to the market. Some analysts, including those at UBS, had warned the repayments could cause an increase in BTC's active supply, leading to price weakness. The assumption was that creditors would quickly liquidate their holdings, having waited for nearly a decade, adding to supply. The crypto market depth has deteriorated significantly since the collapse of FTX, which means a few large sell orders can have an outsized negative impact on prices.  IMX, the native token of non-fungible tokens platform ImmutableX, surged on Thursday, led by South Korean traders. The cryptocurrency rose 35% to 74 cents during Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show. Major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP and BNB traded 0.5% to 1% lower. The IMX price rally is accompanied by an over 22% increase in the 24-hour global trading volume, which rose to $556 million. The IMX-Korean won (IMX/KRW) pair listed on South Korea's Upbit exchange accounted for nearly 20% of the global activity, followed by Binance's IMX-tether (IMX/USDT) pair, which contributed 7% to the total volume, according to data source Coingecko.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's dominance rate, or the top cryptocurrency's share in the total crypto market, is again trending north.  The latest breakout in the dominance rate comes as bitcoin trades well below its peak in July. In other words, money is likely being rotated out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin.

17896750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552319,1695297658,Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price,"Ethereum has been one of the cryptocurrencies to maintain a reasonably high level even through multiple price crashes in the market. However, it seems like the altcoin will not be able to hold as it has done in the past with a dreaded bearish signal resurfacing to threaten the asset’s price. Ethereum Addresses Holding More Than 1,000 Coins Fall Over the last few years, the Ethereum whales have fervently held on to their coins. The large holders were some of the most convinced when it comes to the altcoin, with the number of wallets holding more than 1,000 coins maintaining above 2018 lows. However, the support has broken as conviction has declined. Related Reading: Report Says Ethereum Is Trading Well Below Fair Value, What’s The Correct Figure? Glassnode reported on Wednesday, September 20, that the number of ETH addresses holding more than 1,000 coins has finally fallen to 6,082. The last time that the figure was this low was back in 2018 when the bear market was in full bloom. Addresses holding more than 1,000 coins fall to 5-year low | Source: Glassnode This means that for the last five years, this number has held, until now. The significance of this decline is evident in what happened the last time when the figure was this low. With the bearish trend that was recorded in 2018, expectations have turned to a decline for Ethereum’s price as well. What Happened The Last Time? In 2018 when this Ethereum metric was at this level, the altcoin’s price suffered massively. The year saw its price plunge from as high as $1,367 to as low as $80 in the span of 12 months. The low conviction that followed this would carry on into the next year, triggering a long bearish winter for ETH. Ethereum’s already tepid hold on the $1,600 level is also threatened by massive sell-offs. Over the last few days, there have been a series of large transactions all carrying massive amounts of ETH toward centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF The most recent of these transactions include 22,343 ETH worth $36.2 million at the time of the transaction being moved to Coinbase. Two hours later, Whale Alert flagged another large transaction carrying 16,500 ETH ($26.77 million) to the OKEx crypto exchange. Since one of the major reasons why investors transfer tokens to centralized exchanges is to take advantage of their deep liquidity and sell their tokens, it is possible these whales are looking to sell these coins. In such a case, investors could be looking at massive selling pressure on the horizon for ETH, which could send its price back below the $1,600 support.

42409666,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMo1t,1695297646,Binance Warns of Multiple Stablecoin Delistings as Lawyers Puzzle Over EU's MiCA,"The EU’s crypto law MiCA is set to take effect next year, setting a framework for stablecoins within the bloc.  With remaining legal gray areas and no approvals yet, there could be a bumpy landing in June.  New European Union rules due to kick in a few months from now could mean large-scale delisting of stablecoins, a Binance executive warned on Thursday, as lawyers attempt to decipher the implications of the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.  There are still gray areas in how the EU’s landmark law will apply to decentralized and foreign issuers, and officials from the European Banking Authority (EBA) have stressed there’s no grace period for coins already on the market.  MiCA was finalized last June, and is set to make the EU the first major jurisdiction in the world with a comprehensive crypto regulation, allowing exchanges and wallet providers to operate across the bloc with just a single license.  MiCA's provisions on stablecoins – crypto assets whose value is tied to other assets like fiat currency or gold – will take effect in June 2024 and in the meantime the finer details are being consulted on by the EBA and its sister agency, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  “We are heading to a delisting of all stablecoins in Europe on June 30,” given that no project has yet been approved, Marina Parthuisot, head of legal at Binance France, told an online public hearing hosted by the EBA. “This could have a significant impact on the market in Europe compared to the rest of the world.”  In response to a social media post referring to this story, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said the company has ""a couple of partners launching EUR and other stablecoins, in fully compliant manners.""  In a post on X, previously Twitter, Zhao said Parthuisot's comments had been taken out of context, and wrote ""4,"" his usual shorthand to allege attacks and fake news. A blog published by Binance on Thursday said the company was ""confident that there will be a constructive solution in place"" before June in order to avoid an undue impact.  Zhao has hailed the clear rules brought in by MiCA, but regulatory pressure has already forced the exchange to flee many European jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, Cyprus and Germany.  Yet they aren't the only ones with issues. Others are scratching their heads over provisions requiring issuers to be EU-based undertakings, a wooly phrase that could rule out the innovative governance models favored by many blockchain foundations.  “A lot of the stablecoin issuers will be, or will purport to be, completely decentralized, therefore without any point of decision or issuance” and hence unable to meet MiCA strictures, Thomas Vogel, a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins, said. “This has become a sort of threshold question for a lot of the people we talk to, and as far as I can tell there is not much guidance.”  Ian O’Mara, a partner at Matheson law firm, told the hearing the rules could allow foreign issuers to register via a crypto provider based within the bloc – avoiding fragmentation of major international initiatives like Circle’s USDC.  “There are foreign firms who are seeking advice on their options here,” O’Mara told CoinDesk. “I am skeptical the EBA/ESMA will facilitate this but arguably the legal text allows for this.”  Officials held out little hope they’ll show regulatory largesse in implementing the rules, whose main features are already set out in stone.  “There is no transitional arrangement for these types of [stablecoin] tokens. The rules will apply from the end of June next year,” Elisabeth Noble, team leader for MiCA at the EBA, told Parthuisot.  Meanwhile, her colleague Isabelle Vaillant, who is director of prudential regulation and supervisory policy at the EBA, described concerns over decentralization as “very practical, difficult questions,” and added that in reality there’d always be a contractual link between issuers and customers as a point of contact.

According to a recent tweet from the analyst, “#XRP Color Code To $1.4: If XRP triumphantly closes above the Fib 0.5 level at $0.57 with undeniable confirmation, we’re setting our sights on the $1.4!” The detailed analysis of the chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO reveals key price points that are significant for the future movement of XRP. The “wicking” range is indicated between $0.3875 and $0.4719. A dip below $0.3875 would be a cause of concern as this would invalidate the chart setup. The “ranging” area where XRP does not have any clear direction and is just moving sideways, is defined by the analyst as the range between $0.4719 and $0.5119. But iff the cryptocurrency manages to push past $0.5119, it enters the “bullish” territory that extends up to $0.5738, which is also the pivotal 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Related Reading: Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move? According to EGRAG CRYPTO breaching this price level is the key catalyst for an extensive XRP price rally. The analyst assumes that XRP will not experience any significant resistance after pushing above the 50% Fibonacci level and could eventually break through the yearly high at $0.9310. However, according to the analyst, this is not the end of the road. According to him, the final target of a 250% rally is the 1,618 Fibonacci extension level, which is at $1.4694. Long-term XRP Price Prediction EGRAG’s broader perspective on XRP’s price performance is rooted in his analysis of the historical accumulation trends. The concept revolves around the notion that the longer an asset remains in accumulation, the more formidable the subsequent breakout. A few days ago, he identified multiple accumulation zones for XRP, with each phase leading to significant price multipliers. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions With XRP currently in its longest accumulation zone of 68 months, EGRAG CRYPTO believes this could be the prelude to an explosive rally. The analyst has provided potential price scenarios based on XRP’s all-time high (ATH) of $3.3. The most aggressive of these predicts a 27x surge from its all-time high, positioning the cryptocurrency at nearly $89.1. The second assumption is a 6.75x increase from ATH elevating the token to approximately $22. Third assumption predicts a 2x multiplier from ATH landing at $6.6, whereas the fourth assumption by the analyst targets a 14x target concluding to $46. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5093 after an attempt to regain the trend line (black) failed.

Gox's Repayment Delay Fails to Bouy Bitcoin Prices","Toncoin dropped 8% after jumping nearly 35% last week, while ImmutableX's IMX jumped 30% on Thursday.  Optimism's OP token slid 5% after the Optimism Foundation sold 116 million tokens.  BNB, XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies nursed losses as market leader bitcoin (BTC) showed low signs of euphoria after a key Mt.Gox action was delayed another year, suggesting investors had likely priced in rumors of the delay.  The defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox pushed the deadline for its repayments to Oct. 31, 2024. The exchange was hacked in 2014, which led to 850,000 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $23 billion based on current prices, being stolen.  Some investors expected these sales to influence the crypto market, given early investors were likely sitting on several multiples of their initially invested capital and had incentive to lock in gains.  In a broadcast message early Thursday, trading firm QCP Capital attributed bitcoin's recovery above $27,000 to rumors that the start of the distribution of funds to Mt. Gox customers has been delayed until 2024.  Bitcoin, however, failed to hold above those levels and slid to $26,900 as of European afternoon hours.  Major alternative currencies sold off Thursday as traders likely locked in gains from earlier this week. In the past 24 hours, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP slid as much as 2%, ether (ETH) shed 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE) was little changed.  Toncoin (TON) dropped 8% after rising 35% in the past week, following messaging giant Telegram’s endorsement of the tokens. Elsewhere, ImmutableX’s IMX tokens rose 30%, dominated by South Korean trading volumes.  Layer-2 network Optimism’s OP tokens fell 5% as the Optimism Foundation said it had sold 116 million OP tokens, worth $157 million at current prices, to seven separate buyers. These buyers are expected to use their tokens to vote on Optimism’s governance forums.  Meanwhile, some traders said that data suggested investors were accumulating bitcoin in expectations of a bull market, even as the short-term bearish outlook remained intact.  “Long-term BTC holders are accumulating the coins they sold to short-term investors in the spring, which promises positive prospects for the future, said FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich in a note to CoinDesk. “This is the kind of behavior hoarders exhibit at the beginning of bull markets.”  On-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant said in a note that current price action mirrored past cycles and displayed an accumulation period.

42409656,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMnbR,1695290400,Here’s How FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s Trial May Play Out,"FTX founder and onetime CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will stand trial in just under two weeks to defend himself against allegations he deliberately committed fraud and conspired to defraud crypto investors and customers in FTX and Alameda Research.  The estimated six-week trial itself is scheduled to kick off on Oct. 3, 2023, a mere 10 months after Bankman-Fried was first arrested and not even 11 months after FTX collapsed.  To better understand the trial process, CoinDesk spoke to several legal experts, some of whom asked for anonymity to discuss a high-profile case.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Jury selection  Though the trial is scheduled to begin next month, there's still some time before the actual arguments are made. The first step, which may occur as soon as next week, is a final pretrial conference where Southern District of New York Judge Lewis Kaplan will lay out what a final witness schedule may look like, how long the trial date may be and rule on any final outstanding motions. Judge Kaplan may also entertain a few motions after the jury is selected, said Martin Auerbach, an attorney at law firm Withersworldwide.  The second step is voir dire, which is what will actually begin on Oct. 3.  The jury selection process will see the judge ask potential jurors a number of questions. He will likely start broad, asking if any potential jurors have travel planned within the next few weeks or might otherwise be unable to disappear from their jobs for weeks, one of the legal experts – an attorney with experience in white collar litigation – told CoinDesk.  He will also likely ask if any of the potential jurors had an FTX account, and dismiss those individuals immediately, they said. Once these broad jury questions are completed, the judge will start asking individuals questions like those proposed by the prosecution and defense teams.  “What will take a long time is the defense and prosecution will likely fight over each juror,” they said. “It’s not going to be a yes [or] no, it’s going to be a back and forth, so I think it will take days.”  And while lawyers may be able to question potential jurors at the state court level, this is federal court, so only the judge will ask questions, Auerbach said.  Some potential jurors may be dismissed if they can demonstrate financial hardship or similar issues. Others may be dismissed through a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can just strike a limited number of potential jurors for any reason.  Other potential jurors may exhibit clear bias against Bankman-Fried as the defendant or the government, and may be struck without counting against a peremptory strike quota.  This process is generally speedy. Given how high-profile Bankman-Fried’s case is, the process could take days just to seat 10 or 12 jurors, though the DOJ estimated in a filing on Sept. 19 that it would only take “the better part of a day.”  There will also be a few alternate jurors, who may be excused at the end unless one of the original jurors has to drop out of the case, Auerbach said.  Both the prosecution and defense have filed proposed questions for the judge to ask each potential juror in a bid to weed out anyone who might be heavily biased or otherwise unsuitable to sit on the jury, suggesting Judge Kaplan ask these individuals if they’re familiar with the case, if they have any opinions on the case or if they know (or know about) Bankman-Fried or the attorneys involved.  Bankman-Fried’s team also proposed a number of questions around effective altruism, political donations and lobbying and ADHD. The DOJ objected to these questions, arguing they seemed intended to prime jurors about his proposed defense.  Reasonable doubt  Once the trial itself begins, jurors, reporters and members of the general public in the gallery will see the DOJ and defense make their opening statements, followed by the DOJ presenting evidence and questioning witnesses. Pretrial filings from the DOJ suggest that in addition to written documents, prosecutors will present audio recordings during the trial.  Through this, there will be cross-examination of witnesses.  Who the DOJ calls as its first witness may help signal the strength of its case, at least in the eyes of prosecutors, one of the experts told CoinDesk. The DOJ may call an FBI agent as its first witness, or it might “go big” and call members of the FTX inner circle immediately.  Both parties have also sought to present certain expert witnesses to describe details such as FTX’s code and even to explain crypto basics, though there is an ongoing dispute over whether some or all of these potential witnesses should be allowed to testify.  The DOJ must prove guilt ”beyond a reasonable doubt”, given that this is a criminal trial. By contrast, in a civil case, there is a lower, “preponderance of evidence” standard.  “Beyond a reasonable doubt, there's no specific percentage but you can think of that as 90+%,” one of the legal experts told CoinDesk. “You have a deep and abiding conviction in the guilt of the defendant.”  The assistant U.S. attorneys trying the case will likely demonstrate each element of each of the charges and illustrate what evidence they have that would support a conviction for each charge, they said.  “They’re tracking each piece of testimony, each document to make sure that they’ve got enough in the record to withstand,” they said. “[Bankman-Fried] will inevitably argue – because every defendant argues after trial – [that] they fell short on this element or another.”  Once the prosecution rests, the defense will have its own opportunity to present additional witnesses. One outstanding question is whether or not Bankman-Fried himself will testify in his own defense.  An increasing number of defendants in white collar cases have been waiving their Fifth Amendment rights and testifying, one of the individuals told CoinDesk, pointing to Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes (who was convicted last year and sentenced to over 11 years in prison) as an example.  “The thinking now goes that juries are so celebrity-conscious that even if they didn't know who [the defendant was at] trial, they're almost all probably going on Twitter and going online, to research them during the trial,” the individual said. “The judge will tell them not to do that … [but] because you have this celebrity culture that emerged around these cases, the thought is if they don't testify, essentially, the presumption will be they didn’t simply because they just didn't want to admit [their crimes].”  This concern about a tainted jury pool has already popped up during some of the pretrial hearings. Bankman-Fried’s defense team argued that over a million negative articles have been written about the FTX founder, which created a media narrative around him.  Unanimous verdict  A federal criminal trial requires a unanimous verdict for a conviction. If there is a 12-person jury, all 12 must believe Bankman-Fried is guilty at the end of the trial –that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The defense’s job may be as (relatively) simple as convincing just one juror that there is insufficient evidence or that prosecutors did not make their case on the different charges.  Auerbach said the judge will read out a set of instructions, explaining how they should evaluate what they heard and saw. Both the DOJ and Bankman-Fried’s team have proposed their own sets of jury instructions.  “[It’s] a piece of paper that lays out the legal elements that they have to find beyond a reasonable doubt to convict, and which if they don’t find beyond a reasonable doubt, they have to acquit,” he said. “If they can’t agree upon themselves, they hang on that particular [count].”  The jury can ask questions, though usually those are reserved for the deliberation period. Jurors can send written questions to the judge, who would read them out in court and work with the various attorneys to provide answers.  “I have to believe in a case this complicated, you're going to have one or more jury questions,” one of the legal experts said.  The other one told CoinDesk another complicating factor is that much of the conduct at the heart of the allegations isn’t really in question. What prosecutors will have to do is convince jurors that Bankman-Fried’s actions met the provisions of the statutes he’s being charged under.  One example is extraterritoriality. Neither wire fraud nor anti-fraud rules under securities law provisions would apply “against a defendant who largely acted outside the U.S.” In other words, prosecutors would have to prove that Bankman-Fried’s actions not only met the definition of wire fraud, but also that he targeted U.S. citizens or otherwise was acting in the U.S.  Bankman-Fried lived in the Bahamas, where FTX’s global entity was headquartered.  If the jury is split, the judge has certain tools he can use to tell deadlocked jurors to “go back and try again,” the other individual told CoinDesk.  “It’s not like if in the first round of voting, one juror says ‘I’m not convinced,’ that’s it,” they said. “They’re going to be told to go back and keep trying to get to a unanimous verdict.”  If the jury comes back after several attempts at agreeing to a verdict and say they have an irreconcilable conflict on all counts, the judge may declare a mistrial, Auerbach said. Otherwise, the jury may agree to a conviction on all or some counts, or an acquittal on all or some counts.  Sentencing  Should Bankman-Fried be convicted on one or more of the charges he faces, how much time he’ll spend in prison will depend in large part on Judge Kaplan.  While sentencing guidelines used to be mandatory a few decades back, they’re now, following a Supreme Court ruling, seen more as a starting point than strict rules, one of the individuals told CoinDesk.  There are still statutory requirements, which the judge would be required to stay within, but those are distinct from the guidelines.  The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System would first create a report which would include “an initial calculation of the recommended sentencing range,” the individual said. The DOJ and defense teams could then make any objections they have, advocating for longer or shorter sentences.  Judge Kaplan would then look at the various recommendations and – taking into account a number of other factors like the seriousness of the offenses – hand down the actual sentence.  Oftentimes, in cases where there are multiple convictions on similar charges, the judge may choose to distill the charges down to the “core wrongful conduct.”  Given the way the case has played out so far, it’s also likely that if Bankman-Fried is convicted, his team will appeal. The DOJ cannot appeal a verdict of “not guilty” due to “double jeopardy” rules, the other individual said. “The government doesn’t get to appeal in all but the most rare circumstances. … Once you’ve been released by a jury, you’re essentially released on those same charges for life.”  Either way, this isn’t Bankman-Fried’s final criminal trial. Early next year, he will face an additional set of DOJ charges brought after the initial indictment.  Logistics notes  Judge Lewis Kaplan has signed off on the DOJ's request to treat Friday, Oct. 6 as a trial date.

17893382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552288,1695289545,Terra Classic Forecast: Anticipating A 25% Price Surge With Bullish Patterns,"Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) has been on the radar of crypto enthusiasts and investors, but its recent price performance has left many scratching their heads. Since mid-August, the altcoin has been caught in a pronounced downtrend, drawing the attention of traders worldwide. This intriguing price movement is marked by the presence of two distinct descending trend lines, which have consistently acted as dynamic barriers of support and resistance. The continuous interplay between Terra Classic’s price and these trend lines has given birth to a descending channel pattern. This pattern, shaped by the seesawing between support and resistance, holds the potential to offer insights into the altcoin’s trajectory in the days to come. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Comeback Challenges – What’s Holding It Back? Terra Classic At A Crossroads The current LUNC price, as per CoinGecko, hovers at $0.00005745 with a modest 24-hour gain of 0.3%. However, over the past seven days, it has seen a slight decrease of 0.4%. The price chart has been marked by short-bodied daily candles adorned with extended wicks, indicative of market indecision. Yet, history suggests that within falling channel patterns, such as the one LUNC is currently in, a bullish breakout often occurs. This hints at the possibility of LUNC breaking through the upper trend line and potentially experiencing a 6.3% surge. LUNC currently trading at $0.000057. Chart: TradingView.com Analyzing The Potential For A Bullish Rally Experts in the crypto space suggest that such a bullish move could amplify the demand pressure for Terra Luna Classic, potentially propelling the coin to rally by as much as 25%. This would put the next major resistance level at $0.000075 squarely in the altcoin’s sights, offering hope for those holding LUNC tokens. However, it’s worth noting that the crypto market is currently under the shadow of uncertainty. Renowned crypto analyst Nicholas Merten recently sounded a cautionary note in a YouTube strategy session. Merten predicted a prolonged bearish trend for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, expressing concern that this downturn could lead to widespread liquidations and the removal of excess money from the system, potentially contributing to economic challenges. Related Reading: Chainlink: Analyst’s Vision Of A 20% Rally And How It Could Happen Terra Luna Classic’s price behavior, ensnared within the confines of a descending channel pattern, is a topic of keen interest among crypto enthusiasts. While historical patterns hint at the possibility of a bullish breakout, the broader market climate remains uncertain. As investors brace for potential turbulence, all eyes are on Terra Classic to see if it can break free from the gravitational pull of its descending trend lines and defy the prevailing market sentiment.

42419570,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEwPt,1695287016,Bitcoin Bulls Missing in Action After Mt. Gox Delays BTC Repayments,"Bitcoin stays below the 50-day simple moving average after the defunct exchange Mt. Got delays bankruptcy-related creditor repayments.  The delay was expected and priced in.  Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to gather upside traction even after defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox pushed out its pending BTC bankruptcy repayments by a year, delaying the return of extra supply to the market.  In 2014, the erstwhile Tokyo-based dominant exchange was hacked for 850,000 BTC ($23 billion). The exchange recovered 142,000 BTC, 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) ($30 million), and 69 billion Japanese yen ($465 million), which it had planned to distribute to creditors on Oct. 31 this year.  Some analysts, including those at UBS, had warned that the repayments could cause an increase in BTC's active supply, leading to price weakness. The assumption was that creditors would quickly liquidate their holdings, having waited for nearly a decade, adding to supply in the market. The crypto market depth has deteriorated significantly since the collapse of FTX, which means a few large sell orders can have an outsized negative impact on prices.  The deadline has now been pushed out to Oct. 31, 2024, removing supply overhang concerns for the time being. Even so, bitcoin is trading 0.4% lower on the day, near $27,000 at press time, though it's still more than 8% higher since testing support near $25,000 on Sept. 11.  ""A large reason we're seeing for this bounce are rumors of a Mt. Gox delay to 2024,"" QCP Capital said in a market update published Tuesday. ""With the prior expected date just a month away, we believe many went short on this, and an official announcement will surely drive a short squeeze identical to the release of the SEC vs. GBTC judgment last month.""  In other words, the delay in creditor reimbursements was expected and priced in.  Lack of bullish catalysts  The delay also means a fresh bullish catalyst is needed to drive prices higher. Unfortunately for the bulls, the approval and launch of a U.S.-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is still several months away. Meanwhile, there is little respite on the macro front.  While the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady between 5.25% and 5.5% on Wednesday, it raised the interest-rate target for the end of 2024 to 5.1% from 4.6%, signaling lesser liquidity-boosting rate cuts for next year.  Some analysts, however, expect markets to look past the Fed's hawkish rhetoric.  ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell isn’t ready to back down yet, but markets might look past the rhetoric. Investors know he’s wary of declaring victory against inflation after his infamous transitory call two years ago,"" David Russell, the global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in an email.  Crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital said the Fed's acknowledgment that inflation is finally moving in the right direction may see some investors scale up exposure to risk assets. Still, there is little scope for outright optimism.  “While it's a relief that the Fed see us at the peak of rate hikes with their forecast of fewer rate cuts in 2024, it is hard for us to take today’s announcement with too much optimism,"" AltTab said in an email.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/21/bitcoin-bulls-missing-in-action-after-mt-gox-delays-btc-repayments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/625e2745521d8f2810615f50daeac09bd9970a03-4382x2465.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17891760,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552287,1695285954,"Crypto Analyst Predicts More Trouble Ahead For Bitcoin Price, Here’s Why","Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten has given an insight into the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price, suggesting that the flagship cryptocurrency may experience turbulent times ahead. The Calm Before The Storm For Bitcoin In a recent episode of his YouTube channel DataDash, Merton mentioned that Bitcoin, other altcoins, and the broader asset market were on the brink of a major move as several macro factors were coming together. He further went ahead to discuss how these different “dominos” could “potentially cause a lot of pain in the economy.” Related Reading: Bearish Signal? Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 6-Year Slumber And Transfers $56 Million The first macro factor he mentioned was equities. According to him, the direction of equities and the broader assets are going to have a “direct impact” on Bitcoin. He showed a direct relation between the equity market and the crypto market as coins began to pick up at the beginning of the year, right around when the former was on a high. However, he pointed out that the equity market has been relatively quiet as the narratives that are meant to push it higher haven’t done the job. As such, he believes that if stocks like Apple’s, Microsoft’s, and Fang’s (basically the stocks of major tech companies) don’t start picking up, then there could be a “really big problem” (most likely in reference to the crypto market). Re-Inflation On The Rise Another factor that he emphasized was the inflation data. Merton seemed to suggest that the Fed wasn’t doing enough to curb inflation and bring it down to the target of 2%. According to him, the Fed could have taken a more stringent approach by raising the rates by 75 basis points or even 100. The inflation rate is known to have a significant impact on the crypto market, as a higher rate means that investors may have little or nothing to spend in the crypto market. Merton noted that it is evident that the Fed isn’t doing enough as the prices of several goods and services (including energy) seem to be re-inflating. He made a comparison to the ‘70s when inflation was also at an all-time high and stated that if this time is nearly similar to then or if there is a trend, then it could be a “huge problem.” Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In Some may argue that the ‘70s were extreme times, especially with the oil embargo, which makes it different from this period. However, Merton noted that there isn’t much difference as we have the situation with BRICS, which suggests that the world is de-globalizing and nations are less trusting of one another. This would invariably affect trade deals and foreign relations, something which Merton believes would have “inflationary pressures,” and the Fed is well aware of this. He stated that the major reason we are experiencing this re-inflation is because supply and demand aren’t balanced. According to him, there is excess money in the system due to the “excess printing of money” which people got rich off and the stimulus checks during the COVID era. As such, there is so much purchasing power without there being enough supply to meet these demands.

As part of its ambitious expansion to enhance its “Everything app”, X is introducing a range of payment integrations, and with Elon Musk at the helm, many speculate that Dogecoin could be among the supported cryptocurrencies. Linda Yaccarino, X’s CEO, today unveiled a video outlining the app’s prospective features. From sharing information and participating in community discussions to making calls and tuning into community chats, the updated app promises to be a comprehensive platform. Particularly striking is the video’s revelation that X aims to evolve into a payments app, revealing features that allow users to promptly make online purchases, remit money, and harness income from ad revenues when participating in Elon Musk’s creator community. Related Reading: How Much Will Dogecoin Trade At If It Attains The Market Cap Of Bitcoin Or Ethereum? This step is significant, solidifying rumors and speculations that had been swirling in recent months regarding X’s ambitions in the payments domain. Elon Musk, having taken the reins of Twitter last year and rebranding it to X, is known for his holistic vision of creating an all-in-one app experience. Given his vocal support for cryptocurrencies, especially Dogecoin, there’s been rampant speculation about the potential introduction of DOGE payments on X. Notably, there’s not (even a small) hint about the integration of DOGE or crypto in general in the video released today. a hint of what’s to come. who’s in? https://t.co/TYEevYJlfL pic.twitter.com/G0DTLeHQic — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) September 20, 2023 Cause Of Concern For Dogecoin Investors? Nevertheless, the DOGE community remains hopeful. Dogecoin’s price trajectory witnessed a sharp surge last year when news of Musk’s acquisition of Twitter began circulating. Although the coin has seen a downtrend since, it remains firmly within the top ten cryptocurrency assets by market capitalization. While Musk has not recently made overt Dogecoin-related posts, such as sharing a DOGE meme or donning a DOGE shirt like in the past, he continues to be deeply engaged with its community. Evidence lies in his interactions on X, where he frequently communicates with notable Dogecoin figures, such as DogeDesigner (@cb_doge). A look at his X feed and communications reveals that Dogecoin community member DogeDesigner is one of his favorite accounts to interact with. In the last 24 hours alone, Musk has written 11 replies to tweets from DogeDesigner. Musk is also in regular communication with Dogecoin creator Billy Markus. So there are good reasons to argue that Musk’s fondness for Dogecoin has not diminished. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Prediction – Bulls Face Uphill Task Near $0.064 In a noteworthy development, three weeks ago, X procured money or currency transmitter licenses in seven US states, including Maryland, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island and has thus laid the groundwork for today’s revelation. Interestingly, while the Rhode Island license does encompass crypto payments, it also covers more general payment providers like PayPal and Venmo. Since June, X has secured similar licenses from other states, including Arizona, Maryland, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, and New Hampshire. These licenses, though broad in scope, are important building blocks for Musk’s ambitions to potentially venture X into a worldwide payment processor. DOGE Price At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.0627. Thus, the Dogecoin price is trading almost exactly at the same level as a month ago.

On Oct. 21, 2021, Bitcoin traders on the crypto exchange Binance.US were left scrambling after the asset plunged within minutes, with no apparent reason, while other bitcoin markets operated normally.  As previously reported, bitcoin prices fell from around $65,760 to as low as $8,200 at 11:34 UTC (7:34 a.m. ET), then quickly bounced back up to almost exactly where it was before. A Binance.US spokesperson told CoinDesk at the time that the crash was due to a bug in the trading systems of one of their “institutional traders.”  The actual identity of the investor remained a mystery so far, but new tweets from a former Alameda Research employee reveals that the trading firm may have been the cause of the ruckus.  Baradwaj claims that while most of Alameda trades were executed using algorithms, there were times when traders could manually send orders during times of market volatility or take advantage of a profit opportunity. And this why the apparent mishap took place.  “The trader was trying to sell a block of BTC in response to the news, and sent out the order via our manual trading system,” Baradwaj tweeted. “What they missed was the decimal point was off by a few spaces. Rather than selling BTC at the current market price, they sold it for pennies on the dollar.”  Arbitrage traders quickly took advantage of the mispricing and restored bitcoin to normal levels. Alameda, however, lost millions of dollars.  “Alameda's losses on the fat-finger trade were staggering - on the order of tens of millions. But because it had been an honest mistake, there wasn't much to do except to implement additional sanity checks for manual trades,” Baradwaj added.

A low is formed near $1,606 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,659 swing high to the $1,606 low. Ether is now trading below $1,640 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,630 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next resistance is near the $1,640 level and the trend line. The trend line is also near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,659 swing high to the $1,606 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The main resistance is now forming near $1,660. A close above the $1,660 resistance might send the price toward the $1,720 resistance. The next major barrier is near the $1,750 level. A close above the $1,750 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,820. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,640 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level. A downside break below $1,600 might accelerate losses. The next key support is close to $1,540, below which the price could even test the $1,500 level. The next key support is $1,440.

The crypto platform was forced to shut down operations after roughly $70 million worth of cryptocurrencies were drained from its hot wallets a week ago. On Saturday, September 16, the CoinEx team offered an update on their investigation, which showed that 18 different crypto assets, including BTC, ETH, XRP, and BCH, were stolen from the exchange. The exchange, however, asserted that assets in its cold wallets were not affected by the September 12 attack. Furthermore, CoinEx revealed that it is working with various blockchain security firms to trace the hackers’ addresses and recover the stolen assets. Interestingly, many security organizations and on-chain investigators have linked the attack to the North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group. CoinEx To Allow Deposit And Withdrawal Of These Cryptocurrencies In the latest update published on September 20, CoinEx disclosed its plans to resume deposit and withdrawal services for certain crypto assets on Thursday, September 21. Users will be able to interact with about ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USDT (on the ERC20 and TRC20 networks), USDC (on the ERC20 network), Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), etc. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Balancer Under Attack, Users Receive Warning As per the announcement, CoinEx will resume operations after implementing a new wallet system. During this process, the deposit addresses for certain tokens will be upgraded and new ones will be generated for all users. However, CoinEx warned users not to deposit into any old wallet addresses, as this could result in the permanent loss of transferred assets. The crypto exchange added: Please be sure to double-check that you are using the new address before depositing. After addressing that, CoinEx assured users that it will gradually resume deposits and withdrawals for other cryptocurrencies. The crypto exchange also asked customers to exercise patience, as there may be many pending withdrawals over the next few days. Hence, processing all withdrawal requests for the available assets may take longer than usual. Will Users Be Able To Withdraw 100% Funds? CoinEx has maintained that users’ assets were not lost in this exploit. In the September 16 update, the company said that its User Asset Security Foundation would cover the financial losses from the incident. Moreover, CoinEx CEO Haipo Yang posted on X (formerly Twitter) two days after the attack, assuring “affected users” of 100% compensation. “Your assets with CoinEx remain safe. That’s our commitment to all of you,” Yang added.

The contraction was recorded when the broader market steadied after posting sharp losses in the better part of August and the first half of September. As of September 20, BTC prices are still below $30,000, but with important sideways movement over the past few weeks. Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Falling According to trackers, exchanges control 2.09 million BTC when writing. In total, the Bitcoin network will issue 21 million coins. However, as of 2023, over 19.7 million are in circulation, and public firms such as Tesla—the electric car automaker—and MicroStrategy—the business intelligence firm—have been loading up. Generally, entities can hold cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets or exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Exchanges offer custodial wallets where users can store their coins to trade or even HODL. Users who hold their coins on exchanges can easily swap them for USDT or other altcoins. As mentioned, the number of coins held in exchanges continues to contract—which, while on the surface can be bullish, doesn’t necessarily mean prices will recover. Related Reading: Ethereum Path To $1,700 – Predictions For The Week Ahead Typically, coin outflows from exchanges can signal a firming market and expectation of price expansion. However, considering the current regulatory environment, traders and Bitcoin holders might prefer taking control of their coins as fear sets in. Accordingly, more holders secure their coins in their non-custodial wallets as a protective measure, possibly explaining the dropping Bitcoin exchange reserves. SEC, Regulators Tough On Exchanges The number of Bitcoin held in exchanges has been falling throughout 2022 but appeared to have dropped faster in late 2022. Around that time, FTX, a popular crypto exchange, collapsed, locking billions worth of clients’ funds. Outflow slowed down in Q1 2023 following the collapse of some regional banks in the United States but has since continued falling. The dip can be attributed to the bear market but primarily because the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking the whip on Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of non-compliance. Related Reading: Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move? In June, Binance and Coinbase were sued by the SEC.

MATIC Sees Modest Gain, Holding Significant Seven-Day Increase Despite ongoing developments within the Polygon ecosystem, the native token of the protocol, MATIC, has remained range-bound for the past two days, failing to test upper resistance levels. Currently, the token is consolidating between the price range of $0.536 and $0.5472, trading at $0.5426. It has maintained relative stability for over 24 hours, with a slight gain of 0.5% during this time frame. However, MATIC has still held significant gains over the seven days, with a 5.9% increase. This allowed the token to reclaim the $0.500 level after losing it and experiencing a decline to $0.419 on September 11, following the overall market trend. This marked the lowest point of the year for MATIC. Related Reading: Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF MATIC faces resistance at two key levels, namely $0.5587 and $0.5930. These resistance walls pose challenges for the token’s recovery and upward momentum. MATIC must surpass these obstacles in the short term before it can regain the $0.600 mark. On the other hand, a concerning factor is that MATIC only has a support level at a 1-year low of $0.4614. Bulls must defend this threshold to prevent a significant downtrend leading to new yearly lows. However, MATIC could break free from the lower lows zone if the market conditions become more favorable for altcoins, potentially leading to a price surge.

Moreover, looking at the trends, whale and fresh wallet activities have been heightened over the previous week. With more accumulation, the token has been tracking higher in tandem. Parallel data from Lookonchain confirms this development, especially from early September. Earlier this month, a whale sold $1.13 million of Ethereum and bought an equal amount in MKR on Binance. This transaction comes a day after another entity moved $12.3 million of MKR from Binance. However, while whales appear to be loading up more MKR, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, sold his stash of MKR for ETH on September 2.

As of September 20, the protocol had a total value locked (TVL) of over $4.8 billion, according to DeFiLlama. More data shows that the platform held $109.56 million of MKR, its native token, and different stablecoins worth $49.58 million. DAI Yield Rising, New Burning Structure Implemented Fueling Bulls MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), manages DAI, an algorithmic stablecoin that passes yield to the holder. Holders of MKR, the native token of Maker, can also vote on proposals. Following the brief USDC depegging in March 2023, the DAO reduced its reliance on the USDC, a centralized fiat-backed stablecoin. In early August, the community also voted to temporarily increase the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) from 3.19% to 8%, incentivizing users to mint DAI via the Spark Protocol. Related Reading: Bearish Signal? Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 6-Year Slumber And Transfers $56 Million Besides changes to the DSR, MakerDAO also introduced an improved smart burn mechanism where collateralized debt positions (CDPs) to back circulating DAI can be closed freely without causing stablecoin shortages in the market. In this new arrangement, circulating MKR would be bought and burned independent of CDP closure, allowing the protocol to be more flexible in light of market changes. However, with this, every burning reduced circulating supply, which has supported prices as price action revealed.

17881391,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552212,1695254449,Whales Abandon Ship? Ethereum’s Value In Jeopardy As Major Holders Liquidate,"Ethereum (ETH), a significant player in the crypto space, has recently come under scrutiny due to some concerning on-chain activities. Notably, the number of addresses holding significant amounts of Ethereum has declined, and some long-term holders appear to be liquidating their positions, potentially posing threats to Ethereum’s value. Related Reading: Ethereum Path To $1,700 – Predictions For The Week Ahead Whale Watch: A Steep Decline In Ethereum Holdings On-chain analytics have been instrumental in offering real-time insights into crypto market trends. Recent revelations have highlighted a downturn in Ethereum’s holding patterns that might have deeper implications for the digital asset’s value and the market. According to Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytic platform, the number of addresses holding 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) coins or more has plummeted to a 5-year low. Precisely, these addresses, often termed ‘whale addresses’ in the crypto world, have decreased to 6,082. Such a sharp decline can be attributed to the liquidation activities of some of Ethereum’s long-term holders. It is worth noting that this contraction in whale holdings could potentially increase the susceptibility of Ethereum to market bears, potentially initiating a downward price trajectory. The impact of such sales on the market is apparent. When large quantities of a cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, are offloaded, it often leads to a considerable influx of selling pressure. This can cause panic among smaller investors, prompting further sales and possibly leading to a price drop. Additional Pressures From Dormant Wallets Interestingly, another layer adds to Ethereum’s selling pressure alongside the decrease in large-scale holdings. According to data from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain data analysis firm, a dormant Ethereum wallet, untouched for around four years, has suddenly sprung into action. The wallet in question liquidated its entire ETH holding, quickly pushing roughly $4.81 million worth of the altcoin into the market. A wallet that had been dormant for 4 years sold all 2,591 $ETH for $4.18M stablecoins 6 hours ago.https://t.co/et78rXHG5u pic.twitter.com/pJanMLxwA3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023 Such unexpected sales from long-inactive wallets could raise alarms in the market. While the exact reasons behind such liquidations often remain concealed, they invariably amplify the selling pressures on the affected cryptocurrency, which, in this case, is Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Balancer Under Attack, Users Receive Warning Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price has seen a slight bullish trajectory over the past week, up 1.4%. The asset has moved from a low of $1,596 seen last Wednesday to trade above $1,650 on Monday before retracing to $1,626, at the time of writing down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours.
