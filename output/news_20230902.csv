16968693,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549853,1693692026,"Toncoin (TON) Continues To Ride Bullish Wave, Eyes To Reclaim $2 Level","Over the past 24 hours, the majority of the crypto market has been moving slowly, with the premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin falling below the $26,000 mark again. Toncoin, on the other hand, continues to defy the current market conditions, registering a significant price climb in the past day. The TON price experienced a substantial increase on the first day of September, which is consistent with its overall trend in August. TON Soars By 11% In A Single Day Toncoin currently leads the altcoin market as one of the top gainers following an 11% price rise in the past 24 hours. In the same period, altcoins such as ETH and XRP appear to have succumbed to general market sentiment, suffering a 1% and 2% price dip, respectively. Interestingly, TON’s latest price spike only underscores its impressive performance in the past few weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of the cryptocurrency has swelled by more than 35% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Load Up Their Bags As Majority Of Cryptos Nosedive A broader look at Toncoin’s price history shows that the token has been on an ascent since the start of August. After plunging to a year-to-date (YTD) low of $1.18 on the 4th of August, TON is currently on a nearly 64% price rally. The TON token is currently valued at $1.93, according to CoinGecko data. If this bullish momentum and the buying pressure continue to build, investors could see Toncoin return to the $2 mark. However, technical indicators do not seem to be in favor of the bullish momentum continuing. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), an indicator that tracks the balance between the buying and selling pressure of a token, is currently in the oversold region. The daily RSI in the oversold zone can be an indication of a potential trend reversal. In this situation, this means that investors could see Toncoin reverse all its gains and embark on a downward trend. Can Toncoin Break Into The Top 10 Crypto Ranking? This recent positive performance has catapulted Toncoin onto the verge of becoming one of the top 101 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. According to CoinGecko data, TON is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $6.64 billion. This puts it ahead of Polkadot, Polygon, and Litecoin, who occupy the 13th, 14th, and 15th positions, respectively. If TON continues its current price rally in this existing market condition, breaking into the top 10 ranking might be a possibility. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? Interestingly, a significant 92% increase in the token’s daily trading volume adds further optimism to this scenario. An increase in trading volume can be a signal that investors are still dabbling into an asset. With this, it would only be short-sighted to rule out more gains for the altcoin in the coming weeks.

According to data from blockchain tracker Whale Alert, XRP whales conducted transactions involving over a billion XRP on Friday, September 1. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless Bulls Clear This Hurdle Ripple Transfers 75 Million XRP To Unknown Wallet In Whale Buying Spree Through a series of posts by Whale Alert on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), it can be inferred that the XRP market witnessed four major whale transactions. The biggest of these transactions was the transfer of 424,354,912 XRP – valued at $214,293,666 – from one unknown wallet to the other. In this context, unknown wallets refer to addresses with no affiliation to a crypto exchange. Furthermore, there was the move of XRP, 19,920,318 XRP worth $10,167,904, from another unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. It was also noted that a whale transferred 66,666,659 XRP, worth $33,065, 809 from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. However, the most notable transaction that caught most traders’ eye came from Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency. Whale Alert reported that Ripple transferred 75,000,000 XRP, worth $37,058,145, from its Binance wallet to an unknown wallet. Following this move, some crypto enthusiasts believe that this particular unknown wallet also belongs to Ripple, as the company could be intending to soon offload those tokens on an exchange. This speculation has led to most investors predicting an incoming market dump. Ripple also conducted other transactions on September 1, locking about 800,000,000 XRP in escrow. However, this does not raise any concern as the crypto payment firm is known to release 1,000,000,000 XRP at the start of every month before proceeding to lock up about 80% of the new tokens a few hours later. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond XRP Records 7-Month Highest Transaction Volume Among Other Positives Following the massive transactions in the XRP market, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has provided a report highlighting some of the effects of these whale movements. According to an X post on September 1, Santiment reports an on-chain transaction volume of 4.8 billion XRP, marking the seven highest value of this metric in the XRP market over the last seven months. The analytics firm also noted that there are currently about 2.03 billion XRP in circulation, representing the token’s highest-circulating supply since May 31. In addition, XRP development activity was also reported to be on the high side. At the time of writing, XRP still finds itself struggling amid a general market downturn.

Cowen, known for his data-driven approach to cryptocurrency analysis, shared his insights regarding Bitcoin’s historical performance in September and its potential trajectory for the current year. Cowen acknowledged that September has traditionally been a challenging month for BTC, often characterized by negative price movements. He emphasized that while historical trends suggest a red month for Bitcoin in September, there are no guarantees, and occasional green September does occur. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin had experienced six consecutive red September from 2017 to 2022. The average return for Bitcoin in September has historically been around -6.6%, with a standard deviation that adds to the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency’s performance. Examining Potential Price Declines Cowen then delved into the potential price decline for Bitcoin in September. Given Bitcoin’s opening price of just below $26,000 for the month, a 7% decrease would bring its value to approximately $24,000. He further pointed out that in the pre-halving year of 2019, Bitcoin witnessed a 14% drop in September, potentially pushing its price down to $22,000. To bolster his argument, Cowen referred to a recent tweet in which he speculated a substantial chance of Bitcoin reaching $23,000 in September. Although he stressed that this prediction is far from a guarantee, he underscored the seasonal pattern, the downward momentum, and the recent monthly close below certain support levels as factors that make a dip to $23,000 plausible. Moreover, Cowen discussed the average returns in all pre-halving years for the month, revealing a drop of approximately 17.7%, which could result in Bitcoin trading at around $21,500 if history repeats itself. On August’s performance, Cowen noted that Bitcoin had already experienced a 10% drop. While August’s long-term average is approximately 21%, averaging only the last two pre-halving years (2015 and 2019) suggests a more modest -11% to -12% average drop. This highlights that Bitcoin may follow a similar pattern in September, potentially softening the blow to around $24,000. The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $25,813, with a 24-hour price change of -0.99%. As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin commands a significant market cap of $502,654,681,515, securing its position as the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a trading volume of $17,603,174,408, making it the second most actively traded cryptocurrency by volume. This high trading volume indicates strong interest and activity within the Bitcoin market, contributing to its liquidity. Navigating Bitcoin’s Cyclical Nature Cowen emphasized that despite the uncertainty, the seasonality of Bitcoin and the existing downward momentum make a test of the $23,000 level highly likely in the near future, possibly in September or October. Cowen reflected on the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price movements in a broader context, stating that it often alternates between bullish and bearish phases. He stressed that during pre-halving years, Bitcoin tends to rise significantly during the first half and experience declines in the latter half. According to Cowen, this pattern is designed to “wreck” both bulls and bears before entering a period of sustained growth. He also pointed out that while BTC may face challenges in the short term, once quantitative easing (QE) returns and the cryptocurrency market sentiment improves, altcoins could regain momentum.

He urged caution, citing past data and market dynamics as indicators of a potentially challenging month ahead. While the future remains uncertain, Cowen’s data-driven analysis serves as a valuable resource for those navigating the turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and enthusiasts will undoubtedly watch closely to see if Bitcoin’s performance aligns with his predictions in the coming weeks and months.

Data from crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals a significant uptick in the accumulation of Bitcoin by addresses holding at least 0.1% of the total BTC supply, valued at over $500 million each. These entities collectively added a staggering $1.5 billion to their holdings during the final two weeks of August. This surge in accumulation coincides with the excitement surrounding the potential introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. This substantial accumulation of Bitcoin by crypto whales serves as a clear testament to their growing confidence and heightened interest in the cryptocurrency, irrespective of recent price oscillations and regulatory ambiguities.

While Bitcoin’s price experienced a dip, it experienced a transitory resurgence subsequent to a pivotal court ruling linked to Grayscale’s pursuit of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The verdict translated into a price upswing exceeding $2,000, propelling the alpha coin to a two-week zenith, slightly exceeding the $28,000 threshold. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? Nevertheless, just as the cryptocurrency community was poised for jubilation and pinned hopes on the ETF’s ratification, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced an unexpected regulatory twist. A dopting a circumspect stance, the regulatory authority deferred its verdict on all active Bitcoin ETF applications. Consequently, Bitcoin relinquished all its gains stemming from the brief rally triggered by the Grayscale ruling, regressing below the $26,000 mark.

As of the latest data from CoinGecko, SHIB is currently trading at $0.00000786, marking a 1.3% decline in the past 24 hours and a 3.2% slump over the past week. These numbers reflect the ongoing bearish sentiment in the market. Source: TradingView Shiba Inu Market Sentiment And Volatility One notable aspect of SHIB’s recent price movement is the low trading volume in the market. Low volumes often indicate a lack of conviction among traders, which can result in subdued price action. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? While this may suggest that the downward momentum is not particularly strong, it also leaves SHIB vulnerable to sharp price swings should a significant volume of trades occur. Traders are closely watching for signs of increased activity that could either exacerbate the decline or potentially reverse the trend. SHIB market cap currently at $4.6 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Shibarium: Glimmer Of Hope Amid the uncertainty surrounding SHIB’s price, there is a ray of hope for the Shiba Inu community. The successful relaunch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 scaling solution, has garnered attention. Shibarium aims to address some of the challenges facing the Shiba Inu ecosystem by reducing transaction costs and increasing transaction speed. Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? These improvements could make SHIB more attractive to users and potentially drive up demand for the cryptocurrency. While this development offers a counterbalance to the bearish technical indicators, its ability to reverse the trend remains uncertain. SHIB finds itself at a challenging position as it contends with the bearish pennant pattern and declining prices. The cryptocurrency market’s low volumes reflect a cautious sentiment among traders, leaving SHIB susceptible to potential price swings. The relaunch of Shibarium brings a glimmer of hope for SHIB’s future, as it seeks to enhance its utility and appeal. However, investors and traders are advised to exercise caution and closely monitor the market dynamics as SHIB navigates these challenging waters.

As of the latest data available, MATIC was trading at $0.540840 on CoinGecko, reflecting a 1.4% slip in the past 24 hours and a 0.6% decline over the last seven days. This dip in price has sparked discussions about the coin’s immediate future. The cryptocurrency market has been characterized by considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the industry, also grappling with price fluctuations. Analysts suggest that BTC might enter a narrow consolidation phase before establishing a clear direction in the coming week. Given this backdrop, MATIC could follow suit by consolidating above the critical support level of $0.50 before attempting an upward move toward the 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at either $0.60 or $0.65. Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? MATIC seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Polygon Key Chart Indicators Raise Concerns Technical indicators have painted a cautious picture for MATIC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in the lower range, signifying bearish momentum, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has struggled to breach the zero level, indicating limited capital inflows and heightened selling pressure. Additionally, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has slightly dipped, further suggesting a waning demand for MATIC in the current market conditions. In the midst of this market turbulence, Polygon has made an intriguing proposition. In July, the project unveiled plans for a token upgrade aimed at enhancing the capabilities of MATIC holders within the Polygon ecosystem. MATIC market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Polygon’s Ambitious Proposal The proposal seeks to enable MATIC holders to validate transactions on multiple blockchain networks, potentially increasing their utility and influence. However, it’s important to note that this proposal is currently pending approval from the Polygon community. If this proposal receives the green light, it would mark a significant shift for Polygon, as the coin would transition from MATIC to POL. Such a transition could have far-reaching implications for both the Polygon network and its community of users, potentially influencing MATIC’s price dynamics in the long run. Related Reading: The ApeCoin Quandary: Why Additional Losses Could Persist Polygon finds itself at a critical juncture amid the recent market turbulence. While the short-term outlook remains uncertain due to negative chart indicators and wavering demand, the potential token upgrade proposal from Polygon offers a glimmer of hope for MATIC holders. As traders and investors closely monitor market developments, the path forward for MATIC will largely depend on broader market trends and the community’s decision regarding the proposed upgrade.

With this in mind, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, shared a quote from the recently published ShibPaper highlighting the token’s importance in the ecosystem and the roles holders will play. Related Reading: On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates SHIB Remains The Core In a tweet, Lucie shared the second chapter of the whitepaper, where SHIB is mentioned as the “core” of the ecosystem. The document also labels the token as “one of the greatest currencies in the history of mankind.” To emphasize the importance of SHIB in the ecosystem, The ShibPaper states that the token would take a “new, yet critical role” in the governance of the Shiba Inu State. The token will be the community’s voice in many decisions. The ShibPaper, in chapter one, revealed that SHIB would be one of the governance tokens for the SHIB Inu State. In chapter two, it went further to give an insight into how governance of the decentralized state will look like. According to the document, every Shibizen (citizen of the Shiba Inu State) would be allowed to vote on important decisions as long as they hold “One SHIB.” @LucieSHIB serious question: don’t you think allowing holders of just 1 Shib to vote is enabling malicious actors? They can distribute small amounts of Shib into many wallets, then vote in a way that is not the best for the ecosystem. Any thoughts from #SHIBARMY and @Shibtoken? https://t.co/SvMDEKmJEg — Mike S (@crypto_is_great) August 31, 2023 However, following Lucie’s tweet, a user quickly pointed out a downside of this move as he questioned whether or not this move could enable “malicious actors” who would simply distribute 1 SHIB across many wallets and then vote against proposals that may benefit the ecosystem. Shiba Inu’s Growth SHIB has tremendously grown since it launched in 2020, becoming one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (currently 16th at the time of writing). As part of plans to continue to bolster the token, the team plans to maintain its deflationary nature as several SHIB tokens are set to be burned in a move that will decrease its supply. According to data from Shibburn, SHIB currently has a total supply of 589 trillion SHIB, with 410 trillion SHIB already burned from its initial supply of 999 trillion SHIB. SHIB market cap currently at $4.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This move is expected to increase SHIB’s value as a reduced circulation supply creates an increased scarcity, thereby making the token more valuable. However, the team is cautious about promising the community that SHIB’s price is bound to increase significantly in the future. Related Reading: Grayscale Victory Sends Bitcoin Open Interest Surging After Hitting One-Year Lows Meanwhile, Shibarium’s success is also projected to help boost SHIB’s value, considering that increased trading activity on the layer-2 network invariably means more utility for the token. Wallets on Shibarium crossed over 100,000 just a day after it relaunched. Wallets on the network have surged massively since then, as there are over 1 million wallets created on the network, according to data from Shibarium Explorer.
