Most especially the victims of these attacks. Bull markets always seem to come with an increased number of attacks. So with a bull market that has raged on for the better part of a year, 2021 has definitely had its fair share of attacks, despite just entering its ninth month of the year. Related Reading | These attacks have accelerated with the recent crypto surge. Prices have been up across the board and it seems like this has been a cue for the attackers to ramp up their operations. This could be due in part to the high prices of the cryptocurrencies bringing much higher returns on their attacks. Whatever the case may be, attacks in 2021 have increased and data shows that the number this year will most likely surpass the record for last year. Accelerated Crypto Attacks In 2021 Crypto hacks and scams had previously reached a record number in 2020. At a total of 32 identified cases in 2020, it was the year with the highest number of hacking and fraud incidents in the crypto market. In just eight months, there have been 32 identified cases of hacking and fraud in 2021. With six months to go and the bull rally raging on, more of these attacks can be expected to happen before the year runs out.

Fantom has performed exceptionally well when compared to other cryptocurrencies. It has been trading with a bullish outlook jumping from $0.4 on 27th August to the current price of $1.2. This huge surge in price brought the attention of major investors and traders, resulting in a new all-time high for the coin. The trading volume for the currency is currently down by 27.71 percent. The price movement was unable to break the resistance at the $1.11 price level yesterday, although today, it was broken, and the current price of the FTM/USDT pair is at $1.2. According to our Fantom price analysis, the FTM/USDT pair can make a move for another resistance at $1.314. If the price action doesn&apos;t fall at this point and the resistance remains broken, higher prices are possible after a cool-off period. Bitcoin price analysis for today reveals that the cryptocurrency broke a minor resistance at $50K and has found support at that price level.

42394446,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZ9r,1630875000,Crypto Long & Short: The Trouble With Ticker Symbols,"Would the real USDP please stand up?  Last month, Paxos, the issuer of the seventh-largest stablecoin in the $2 trillion global cryptocurrency market, renamed the token, previously called the Paxos standard, to the Paxos dollar. As part of the rebranding, the crypto exchange changed the ticker symbol from PAX to USDP.  There was one hitch: Another stablecoin was already using the ticker.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Unit Protocol, a decentralized lending platform that went live in February, had been calling its token USDP since at least July of last year, when it published a white paper. For a hot minute it seemed the plucky team was not about to let a bigger rival use the four-letter identifier without a fight.  “We are currently disputing Paxos’ trademark application for USDP,” Benjamin Meredith, a representative for Unit Protocol, told CoinDesk on Aug. 27.  To show that the original USDP was a known quantity in the market, Meredith pointed to blockchain data indicating that 138 million units of the token had been minted, each worth just under $1. He also shared writeups on the market data sites CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap as further evidence this stablecoin was an established asset – even if the Paxos stablecoin’s market cap was 7.5 times larger.  As of this writing, however, no formal objection was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In a later email, Meredith said the Unit Protocol team decided to first talk to a Paxos executive. Still later, he said the call didn’t happen.  “We’re just going to go along our merry way for the time being,” Meredith said.  Paxos, for its part, seemed unwilling to budge when contacted by CoinDesk. “It’s common for projects to share tickers in the cryptocurrency space,” said Paxos spokesperson Becky McClain. “There are dozens of instances of shared qtickers or tickers that share letter strings, and we feel confident these uses are distinguishable and coexist without confusion for consumers.” She did not answer a follow-up question about whether Paxos checked if the ticker was already in use before choosing it.  This anticlimactic tale highlights an issue that has come up a handful of times in crypto and may do so more often in the future as the industry grows. Without a standard for exchanges to assign identifiers, investors are apt to get confused.  “Tickers are designed to make assets instantly recognizable to clients, so it’s important each ticker refers to a single asset,” said Kevin Beardsley, lead product manager for pro trading at the Kraken exchange. “However, two projects sometimes claim the same symbol, and the winner is mostly decided de facto by the community.”  $ETH(an Allen)  Unlike a stock, which is usually listed on a single exchange that has final say over ticker assignments, a crypto asset can be bought and sold on hundreds of venues throughout the world.  “Whenever two, usually smaller, token projects claim the same ticker, it’s often the one [that] gains more public momentum and exchange listings early on that retains the symbol,” Beardsley said.  At Coinbase, “we take the issuer’s recommendation under advisement, but we have an opinion, too, as do all exchanges,” said a spokesperson for the crypto exchange powerhouse. “In case of conflicts, we’ve so far followed a first come, first serve model.”  (Coinbase itself ruffled feathers this year by choosing the ticker COIN for its watershed Nasdaq stock listing; Coinsilium, a blockchain investment firm, already used the identifier for its shares, which trade on the London-based Acquis Exchange.)  Another recent example of the problem was when Ethan Allen, a furniture retailer, changed its stock ticker to ETD from ETH to avoid confusion with ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Amazingly, a big run-up in Ethan Allen’s share price earlier this year had been attributed to retail traders mistaking the stock for the crypto. The furniture chain’s ... ahem, the merchant’s CEO also said the ticker change would help with search traffic because people googling news about his company won’t end up wading through stories about the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.  Early crypto advocates saw that standards mattered. In 2014, the Bitcoin Foundation, then in its heyday, lobbied the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to make XBT the original cryptocurrency’s ticker symbol for foreign exchange.  Why not BTC, which even then was already the customary abbreviation? “The code XBT was selected because the prefix ‘X’ denotes a non-national affiliation or a monetary metal such as gold or silver,” explained Jon Matonis, one of the foundation’s leaders, in a CoinDesk op-ed at the time. “Technically, BTC would be unavailable due to the fact ‘BT’ already represents the country of Bhutan.”  Matonis predicted that an ISO-standard ticker would spur worldwide adoption. “When a new currency code becomes adopted by the [ISO], it immediately enters the database tables upon which Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, SWIFT and other clearing networks rely,” he wrote.  ISO never madehttps://www.six-group.com/dam/download/financial-information/data-center/iso-currrency/amendments/lists/list_three.xml ithttps://www.six-group.com/dam/download/financial-information/data-center/iso-currrency/amendments/lists/list_one.xml official, however, and XBT was only sparsely used to represent the mother of all digital assets. In April, seven years after adopting the would-be ISO ticker, Kraken, one of the few exchanges from those early days that survived and thrived, scrapped XBT for most purposes in favor of the more familiar BTC.  “Being that Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no standard, nor governing body, to dictate what notation should be used for it. Nonetheless, ‘BTC’ has been the generally accepted abbreviation for Bitcoin stemming from the early days of Bitcoin,” the company explained.  Which BCH?  Perhaps the most dramatic ticker story in crypto involves Bitcoin Cash, the breakaway blockchain whose creators seceded from the Bitcoin network in 2017 following a protracted, vitriolic debate over how to scale the system.  “While both the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities claimed the BTC ticker ahead of the hard fork in 2017, the fact the general public continued ascribing the BTC ticker to the segwit chain ultimately settled the dispute,” Beardsley at Kraken recalled. (Segregated Witness, or segwit, was the scaling method preferred by the Bitcoin faction.)  Thus the new cryptocurrency went by the ticker symbol BCH.  To existing holders of BTC, the chain split was a windfall. If your private key controlled, say, 2 BTC before the contentious hard fork, afterward you could still use it to unlock that much on the original chain and to access 2 BCH on the new one. Even if you didn’t care much for BCH, you could claim it on the new chain, send it to an exchange and swap it for BTC.  The following year, Bitcoin Cash itself split into two, again over technical differences between warring camps. Once again, the upshot for holders was free money on the new chain.  Exchanges that custodied BCH for clients thus found themselves holding two assets where there had been one. And for a time, they used a befuddling nomenclature to tell them apart.  The exchanges labeled one coin BCH ABC or BAB, the other BCH SV or BSV. Eventually, the ABC faction reclaimed the BCH ticker (sans suffix) and the Bitcoin Cash moniker, and the other coin became known as BSV (Bitcoin: Satoshi’s Vision).  Last November, the pattern repeated. Bitcoin Cash again split into two. Again, one chain was temporarily called BCH ABC. This time, the other was briefly called BCHN (the “n” stood for “node”). It attracted more computer processing power, became the “official” Bitcoin Cash, and the ABC chain was eventually renamed eCash, with the ticker XEC.  The beauty of blockchains is they let strangers on the internet come to agreement on things without a boss in charge. But these ticker dramas show technology doesn’t solve all coordination problems.  As institutions enter the market, the industry may need to educate them on the idiosyncrasies of crypto tickers. No portfolio manager wants to have to explain to her board, “no, not that BCH – we bought the other one.”",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | FORKS,"Marc Hochstein, Nate DiCamillo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/05/crypto-long-short-the-trouble-with-ticker-symbols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d899269d8def0f5e14104dae7b61e58a41425cd-3998x2666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Without any mention of pro-crypto regulators and lawmakers, the article says officials are trying to figure out how to curb what they see as the potential dangers from an industry “whose short history has been marked as much by high-stakes speculation as by technological advances.”  The Times story notes efforts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to staff up with experts to help it deal with the exploding industry. Observing that as it could take at least a year to write rules or get Congress to act, regulators could issue guidance in the interim.  The article notes the recent $600 million hack of PolyNetwork and singles out crypto lender BlockFi, noting that company’s explosive growth and recent legal troubles, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Compound, which the article says “operates completely outside the regulatory system.”  The article compares BlockFi’s offers of up to 8% annual interest rates on cryptocurrency deposits with U.S. banks’ average rate 0.06% for savings deposits but makes no mention of the macro factors behind the latter, such as the Fed’s unprecedented monetary expansion policy.  “Crypto is the new shadow bank,” the article quotes U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a vocal crypto critic as saying. “It provides many of the same services, but without the consumer protections or financial stability that back up the traditional system.”  Read more: BlockFi Is in Regulators’ Crosshairs. DeFi Is Next  The article notes that regulators are concerned about the adequacy of the cash reserves and algorithms that back stablecoins, in which many DeFi loans and deposits are denominated. Warren floated the idea of banning U.S. banks from holding the cash deposits that back many stablecoins.  The article also posits that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could make cryptocurrencies redundant, quoting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent statement that a U.S. CBDC ”could undermine the entire crypto ecosystem.”  The article states that many traditional financial institutions are nervous about potential disruption at the hands of DeFi but makes no mention that many are themselves starting to provide crypto services or that a number of crypto companies.
