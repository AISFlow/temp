42426282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhph,1423781738,Overstock's Top 10 US States for Bitcoin Spenders,"New Hampshire residents are the most likely to pay for Overstock items in bitcoin, according to new data released by the e-commerce giant.  Overstock  indicates that the company has seen 131 bitcoin orders per million residents in the Northeastern US state. Utah and Washington, DC, placed second and third in the rankings, with 89 and 85 orders when adjusted for population, respectively.  Rounding out the top five states were Washington (77 orders per million residents) and Vermont (72 orders per million residents). Data represents all purchases since the company began accepting bitcoin in January 2014.  Judd Bagley, general manager of Overstock's Cryptocurrencies Group, indicated that the research is part of the company’s regular analysis of the habits of its shoppers, a process that includes tracking orders and purchases.  Bagley told CoinDesk his company was particularly pleased with the results, stating:  “We're quite proud to see that Utah, where we're headquartered, ranks second in the nation.”  One of the first and still most prominent companies to accept bitcoin, Overstock recently established an cryptocurrencies division to oversee the development of its decentralised exchange project, Medici.  The company also recently installed a bitcoin ATM at its Utah headquarters.  North-South divide  A look at the data reveals that bitcoin purchases appear more common by this metric in northeastern states, with Vermont and New Hampshire comprising two of the top five slots.  Further, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New York all ranked within the top 20 US states by this metric.  By contrast, Georgia, the highest ranking southern state, place 23rd on the list. No state from the South Atlantic, East South Central or West South Central region placed within the top 20.  Of states in the Midwest, Nebraska placed the highest at number 19, with 39 orders per million residents. Utah was the highest-ranking Western state.  Mississippi was the lowest ranking state at just eight orders per million residents. South Dakota, Wyoming, Hawaii and West Virginia rounded out the bottom five.  Notably, the data didn’t suggest any correlation with the average income of the state. While some like Washington DC, rank toward the top of such lists, others like Nevada rank 26th in income in the US.

42426274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhZh,1423778424,Former US Treasury Secretary: Bitcoin Needs More Than Math to Succeed,"Former US Department of Treasury Secretary and advisor to President Barack Obama Lawrence Summers has argued that, in order for bitcoin succeed, the technology and those who support it will need to embrace regulation.  Summers' latest comments came on 11th February at the Museum of American Finance (MOAF) during an event entitled ""Bitcoin and the Future of Payments Technology"". The conversation was moderated by Wall Street Journal senior columnist Michael Casey and sponsored by investment company Voya Financial.  During the event, Summers voiced his opinion that bitcoin needs greater regulation if it is ever to achieve mainstream adoption, according to a report by The New York Times.  Summers remarked:  ""If the day ever comes where bitcoin counts for an appreciable fraction of commerce that takes place in the world economy, on that day it will be because that commerce is regulated and subject to safeguards and people believe that something other than a mathematical algorithm is ensuring that their money will not be stolen.""  To Summers, this means elements of the bitcoin community – including those who reject any form of financial regulation for the technology – will hamper the future development of bitcoin.  In the past, Summers has offered a cautiously positive perspective on bitcoin as a technology.  For example, he suggested in an April interview with The Wall Street Journal that critics shouldn't ""write [bitcoin] off"" or fight against the tide of innovation.  During the National Association for Business Economics policy conference in February of last year, Summers called bitcoin ""an innovative approach"" to solving problems in today's transaction infrastructure.  ""Very serious economists thought that the Internet was going to be no more important than the fax machine, so I’m not willing to dismiss bitcoin,"" he said at the time.  In addition to his past accolades, Summers is also an advisor to Andresseen Horowitz, the VC firm that recently participated in bitcoin services provider Coinbase's recordbreaking $75m Series C.

42426292,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLi5h,1423773043,Bitcoin Pitched to New Generation of Developers at DevCore Boston,"Despite record snowfall in the region, a dedicated group of technology enthusiasts, business owners and cryptocurrency supporters gathered in Boston to pitch bitcoin to a new generation of developers this Wednesday.  Hosted by the Bitcoin Foundation, the DevCore event series is intended to support the trade organisation’s now primary goal of fostering the open-source development of bitcoin. The event follows the Bitcoin Foundation's renewed emphasis on this mission, and its shift away from policy and outreach initiatives.  A wide range of speakers featured at the event, including the Bitcoin Foundation’s executive director Patrick Murck, chief scientist Gavin Andresen and core developer Cory Fields; Circle Internet Financial’s Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville; Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht; and James Gatto and Marco Santori from New York-based law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.  During one notable panel, Neville told the audience that both present and future cryptocurrency developers should consider focusing efforts on creating mechanisms by which value – and trust in that value – can be exchanged more reliably, stating:  “We have all these protocols for communication and commerce, but the layers missing have been a set of protocols and formats for value exchange and protocols and formats for identity.”  The event also featured workshops by the non-profit CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which debuted a proposed set of standards for companies that handle customer funds.  Bitcoin evangelist and author Andreas Antonopoulos was present at the event, giving a short talk on bitcoin and later signing copies of his latest book. Later, Blockchain developer Kevin Houk led a session on API development.  The event is the first of a series, with other meetings to take place this year around the world.  Legal risks outlined for new developers  Gatto and Santori outlined two areas – patents and securities law – which new developers, particularly those who are considering the creation and issuance of tokens through an initial coin offering, should look at closely before pushing further on a particular project.  The two later conducted informal sessions with developers throughout the conference.  Acknowledging the shared hatred among open-source developers toward the idea of patents, Gatto pushed attendees to consider patents as a defensive tool to protect their work.    “I encourage you, even those who think patents are evil, think about the good side of it,"" he suggested.      Santori cautioned that regulators are actively looking at how tokens are being issued, and said that developers need to tread carefully or risk eliciting attention from agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      “If there is some use beside mere speculation, then you’re working in the right direction,"" he said. “The SEC is going to want to see immediate, non-speculative, non-investment uses.”    Exploring standards  During another session, C4's Michael Perklin and Joshua McDougall walked through the company's proposed CryptoCurrency Security Standard and explained how, as it stands today, companies in the exchange and wallet service ecosystems are relying on asymmetrical approaches to security.  This approach, they argued, creates systematic risks and leads to potential roadblocks for future development.  Perklin positioned the proposal as being modeled after others of its kind, arguing that auditors need both a standard to base their assessments on and a frame of reference when looking at companies in an experiemntal and constantly evolving space.  “[The standard] applies to businesses and cryptocurrency systems that need to store bitcoin, store litecoin or any cryptocurrency. Without this, everyone was left to do security on their own,"" he said.  Perklin later told CoinDesk that demand for a security standard exists among companies in the bitcoin space that handle client funds. He pointed to the exchange ecosystem in particular as being especially receptive of the proposal, and said he hopes the comment period to follow will yield additional feedback that improves the proposal.

42426277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhfh,1423768227,Why Bitcoin's Star is Rising in the Czech Republic,"Bitcoin's public image may have taken a beating recently, with its price dramatically falling at the beginning of the year and the recurring coverage of the Silk Road trial dominating the headlines.      However, there is evidence to suggest that bitcoin's popularity may be rising in the Czech Republic. Downloads of the free bitcoin-QT client in the country have soared in the last month, surpassing the US – the former world leader – and topping the downloads table with 777.    Martin Stránský, CEO of Prague-based bitcoin center wBTCb, attributed the rise in part to the country's ""strong community"", one that he said extends beyond what he called ""the hardcore anarcho-capitalists, libertarians and hackers"" usually associated with bitcoin.  Stránský added:  ""We have noticed an increase in our bitcoin services as the word about bitcoin is spreading to larger groups and people are starting to notice this technology.""  Alena Vranova, director of the Czech startup behind the Trezor bitcoin vault, Satoshi Labs, also commented that ""bitcoin is quite big and growing quite fast"" domestically.    Despite these on-the-ground reports, though, the Czech Republic has ranked 157 in the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI), a study that conceptualises and ranks the potential utility of bitcoin across 178 countries.      So, what is the actual state of bitcoin in the country and what is driving its seeming popularity?    Good technical education  Vranova said that she can ""only speculate on a number of influences"", but pointed out that the emergence of bitcoin-related businesses may be partly due to its strong education system, ""particularly when it comes to technical training"".  Marek Palatinus, creator of Slush Pool, the first pooled bitcoin mine, attended the Hradec Králové University – whilst his colleague, Pavol Rusnak, was educated at Prague's Charles University where he read computer science.  Czechs have a long-standing engineering history. Under socialism, Czechoslovakia was considered, together with the German Democratic republic, the most technically advanced country in the Soviet bloc.  The Czech Technical University in Prague, one of the largest in the country, is also the oldest non-military technical university in Europe.  The university's long tradition of cutting edge science and engineering ensues from the work of many great personalities – including the famous physicist Christian Doppler and renowned engineers such as FJ Gerstner and J Bozek.  The Czech education system has also produced a significant amount of video game developers, who have created many successful games.  Lack of trust, DIY tradition  Despite the long-standing reputation of their public education system, Czechs have traditionally had a low level of trust in national political institutions.  A public opinion survey conducted by the European Commission in 2009 found that only 28% of people trust the Czech Government, compared to the 32% of people who trust governments and parliaments in the EU.  Vranova agreed that the country's totalitarian past has had an effect, stating:  ""The Czech government and public institutions have a very poor public image. The economy is struggling between poor efficiency and low innovation.""    She continued to say that ""[the government] has the biggest innovation opportunity of the last two decades [in bitcoin] before their eyes and yet they miss to see it"".    An OECD economic survey about the Czech Republic states that ""innovation is overly dependent on foreign patents and researchers, making production vulnerable to relocation"".  Unlike the US, where there is a strong capital investment culture which saw it raise $260m in 2014, Czechs are much more reliant on their own resources.  Vranova said that bitcoin startups are ""not emerging because of good market conditions or governmental support"", adding that ""luckily there is a strong DIY tradition here"".    ""Our nature allows us to find solutions even with very limited resources"", she explained. ""There is no secure hardware wallet? Okay, let's create it. There is no solution to decreasing rewards from mining? Do a mining pool.""    Fringe ideas flourish  The ramifications of totalitarianism in the Czech Republic are also affecting the way in which people are embracing technology.  Paralelni Pollis  is a non-profit organisation based in Prague that focuses on the ""potential sociopolitical impact of new technologies, particularly those based on the idea of decentralisation"".  It is a unique space, comprising of a hackerspace, café, cowering space and a workspace for 3D printing. Bitcoin is the only valid form of payment.    The cryptoanarchists set out to provide ""tools for unlimited dissemination of information on the Internet and encouraging a parallel decentralised economy, cryptocurrencies and other conditions for the development of a free society in the 21st century"", because they believe that ""new technology brings the possibility of choice"".      Petr Žílka, a spokesperson, said:      ""Czech people are very open to some new technologies. These spread relatively quickly once they become available.""              There seems to be a prevailing libertarian sentiment among some cohorts of the population, who challenge the status quo by seeking alternative ways of doing things.      Žílka attributed this attitude to the Czech Republic's communist heritage. He explains that there is an old custom which reads ""if you don't cheat the state you cheat your family"", meaning that if one finds a way of avoiding regulation then it is acceptable to do so.    Long way to go    However, Žílka said that it is still early to quantify the real increase of bitcoin users.      ""It is year 6 AD, after decentralisation, so we are still at the very beginning. All we need now is to show people that it can benefit everyone both on a small and large scale,"" he said.    Stránský also pointed out that there have been some ""good and bad"" articles about bitcoin ""in major newspapers"".  Despite bitcoin's seeming popularity among the Czech population, he said that bitcoin is still in its early stages in terms of reaching daily adoption, adding:  ""I spoke to a restaurant manager, who said that they had only four customers during the six months that they had been accepting bitcoin.""  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Stránský added that ""people hold bitcoin for speculation or investment"" but its volatility means that they still find it hard to pay with it.  A cobbler, whose repair shop is located in Prague, also said that he had been accepting bitcoin for a year but is yet to be paid in bitcoin.

42426272,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhXh,1423760176,LazyCoins Launch Highlights Challenges for UK Bitcoin Businesses,"A British startup has launched a cryptocurrency exchange and plans a merchant payment processor focused on businesses in London soon.  Notably, the self-funded firm, called LazyCoins, is a registered Money Services Business (MSB) with the country's tax authority. That is something no other British exchange can claim.  ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can while waiting for the legislation to catch up,"" said LazyCoins' managing director Peter Heigho.  Hazy regulatory landscape  The startup's attempts to gain government oversight throws a spotlight on the UK's regulatory regime for digital currencies, which is far from settled.  Industry players await a Treasury report currently being prepared, which could provide clarity for how the financial regulator, banks and other agencies like the tax authority deal with companies that handle cryptocurrencies. No release date has been announced for that publication yet, however.  In the meantime, local bitcoin businesses attempt to interpret a mish-mash of official guidance statements from regulators and unofficial advice from other sources.  The widely held view among digital currency businesses in the UK is that an MSB registration with the tax authority is a regulatory credential that holds little weight. As a result, no bitcoin exchange operating in the UK is registered as a MSB with the tax authority.  Registering as an MSB brings a firm under the UK's anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Companies operating as bureaus de change and money transmitters are required to register, and their operators must pass a 'fit and proper' persons test.  These rules are designed for government agencies to detect illegal money movements and do not provide, for example, any additional protections to consumers, according to Adam Vaziri of Diacle, who consults on regulatory matters for cryptocurrency companies.  He said:  ""AML is not about consumer protection, it's about public and governmental policy.""  Still, LazyCoins' registration is more than just marketing, according to Heigho. The firm must register because it's operating a payment processor and deals in fiat currencies, Heigho said.  ""If we were purely an exchange platform we probably wouldn't have got the licence. But we are a merchant platform attached to an exchange platform,"" he explained.  Tax authority stance unchanged  The tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), confirmed that a company dealing in fiat currencies is required to register, but companies dealing only in digital currencies do not. The agency said it continued to ""review"" market developments and that the rules could change in future.  ""We do not currently require bitcoin exchanges to register for supervision under the money laundering regulations ... A bureau de change doing exchange businesses in other currencies as well as bitcoin must register in the normal way for non-bitcoin businesses,"" a HMRC press officer wrote in response to questions from CoinDesk.  Although MSB registration is no regulatory panacea, a registered company might give customers slightly more confidence in their dealings with it because they know it can be held to account to an outside entity, Diacle's Vaziri said.  He said:  ""The exchange is accountable to a certain degree to an external body. Although HMRC is not a regulator per se ... the accountability side may be of some importance.""  One thing LazyCoins has already achieved is securing a UK banking relationship, which founder Danial Daychopan said will remain stable because the bank is aware of his firm's dealings in cryptocurrency. He wouldn't say what bank his firm uses.  UK banks have been notoriously strict about doing business with bitcoin companies. Cryptocurrency firms of all stripes, from hedge fund managers to exchanges, have had their bank accounts closed on short notice and with little explanation.  Daychopan has ambitious plans for his firm, aiming to sign up 100 merchants for his payment processor, LazyPay, in the first month of operations. Two merchants have agreed so far: a fine French restaurant and a grocery store, both in London.  The processor is due to launch after it becomes registered as a 'small payment institution' with the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. That is likely to happen within a month, Daychopan said.  UK firms launch in tough market  LazyPay's merchants will comprise of local London businesses like newsagents and other high street firms supplying daily necessities. The idea is to then route merchant payments to the LazyCoins exchange.  Daychopan said.  ""[The way] to make bitcoin go mainstream, which everyone wants, is to make places for people to spend it. So people can buy bread, buy milk with it. London is a good place for it. There are newsagents all over England, but very few that accept bitcoin.""  Lazycoins joins two UK startups that have launched in recent weeks to address the nascent digital currency exchange and more competitive merchant processor space.  London-based exchange DSX will be launched with a unique agency arrangement with an e-money issuer licensed by the financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority – also in an attempt to gain regulatory oversight for its business. The same management team runs both the regulated e-money issuer and the exchange.  And a service called ChainPay aims to serve merchants' needs in the UK and Europe with a payment processor model and the promise of personalised service, something that it claims is absent from its well-funded competitors Coinbase and BitPay, both of which have operations in Europe.  The sterling market is small compared to the well-developed euro and US dollar markets. Some $5.2m was traded in the bitcoin-GBP markets in the last 30 days according to Bitcoin Charts. Bitcoin-euro trading volume was about 10 times higher for the same period, at $53.6m. The US dollar market saw more than $800m traded in the same period.  LazyPay hasn't set out to compete with the big firms, Daychopan said, but he believes there is enough of the merchant payments pie to go around.  ""We haven't gone out to compete with the big brands. There are only so many Dell Computers and Virgin Galactics out there. But if your local shop around the corner is [going to start accepting] bitcoin, it will only happen if someone goes to educate them,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/12/lazycoins-launch-highlights-challenges-for-uk-bitcoin-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8995223b654e06bd343503bb4cf11eac485500ab-1280x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
