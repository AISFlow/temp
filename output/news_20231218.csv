The coin which has been performing quite well in the last few weeks is still miles away from its current all-time high of $3.1. However, the machine learning algorithm has revealed when it will cross this level once more. Cardano Price Will Hit $6.5 According to the CoinCodex machine learning algorithm, the Cardano price may be locked into years of performing below its 2021 all-time high prices before finally revisiting It around five years from now. Apparently, while the next few years will see the price jump another 200% from its current price, breaking above $3.1 will remain elusive. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Faces Make Or A Point As Analyst Identifies Critical Trading Pattern The year 2024 which is expected to be the start of another crypto bull market will reportedly see ADA only rise as high as $2.98, falling just short of its previous all-time high. Then in the years 2025 and 2026, its max performance is pegged even lower with $2.42 in 2025 and $0.8 in 2026. The year 2027 is expected to follow the same trend as 2026 with a min value of $0.5 and a maximum value of $0.86. However, in 2028, this is expected to completely change to the point where the ADA price will reach a brand-new all-time high. Cardano’s max price for the year 2028 is said to be $6.52 by the machine learning algorithm with a minimum price of $0.73. Then in the following year of 2029, it expects a minimum value of $1.1 and a max value of $4.99. Finally, the year 2030 is placed at a minimum of $0.65 and a maximum of $1.36. ADA price recovers from dip | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com ADA Sees Bullishness Across The Board Contrary to the CoinCodex machine learning algorithm saying that the Cardano price will not reach a new all-time high until the year 2028, crypto analysts have come forward with their own bullish predictions. One analyst Psyclops expects the price to climb to $10 amid the rapid growth that is being recorded in the Cardano ecosystem. Related Reading: Terra Classic Validator Presents ‘Legally Absolved Route’ To Burn 800 Million USTC Another crypto analyst known as Crypto Crow says that they expect the price to reach $32. The time frame from this analyst is that they expect this to happen in the next bull market and since the next bull market is expected to take place between 2024 and 2025, it gives it a two-year timeframe. Finally, crypto analyst Dan Gambardello has predicted that the Cardano price will reach $11. His reasoning lies with the past performance of the digital asset which has performed very well in each bull market. Gambardello expects that if ADA sticks to historical performance, then the market cap of the altcoin will climb to $400 billion by the year 2025.

21568075,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565870,1702938651,Key Factors That Bitcoin Needs To Keep Bullish Momentum,"Amid the bearish impression circling the cryptocurrency market lately, a prominent crypto analyst has revealed a recent trend for Bitcoin (BTC), which will help bolster the continuation of its price rally. What Bitcoin Needs To Sustain And Expand Its Rally A cryptocurrency analyst known as Ali recently shared this crucial information with the entire cryptocurrency community on December 18, 2023. The analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) to highlight what Bitcoin needs to maintain its upward trajectory. Ali said the crypto asset experienced a dip in network growth over the past month, which raised concerns about the stability of BTC’s recent price move to $44,000. He added that creating new Bitcoin addresses must expand to guarantee a robust continuation of its rally. This will provide the much-needed support for the crypto asset to maintain its bullish momentum. The post read: There’s been a noticeable dip in #Bitcoin network growth over the past month, casting doubt on the sustainability of $BTC’s recent move to $44,000. For a robust continuation of the bull rally, it’s crucial to see an uptick in the number of new $BTC addresses. This would provide the needed support for sustained bullish momentum. BTC needs further investor and institutional support to sustain its rally. A chart accompanied the crypto analyst’s X post to support his projection further. This prediction means further corrections may be a scenario for the digital asset. This is because of the discrepancy between the creation of new addresses and the current price increase of Bitcoin. Nonetheless, approving a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US might create an avenue for more institutional investment, thereby reversing this trend. As of the time of writing, BTC was trading at $40,980, indicating a decrease of over 2% in the past 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization decreased by the same percentage in the past 24 hours. Digital asset prices have increased by 146% in the last year, demonstrating amazing growth throughout this timeframe. Its performance over the same year exceeded 73% of the leading 100 crypto assets, putting it among the top performers. The Crypto Asset Fell Below Its Crucial Supply Area Ali has also shared another post on X showing that Bitcoin has witnessed a dip below its key supply zone. The analyst pointed out that the zone ranges from $41,200 to $42,400, of which the asset has recently fallen below this range. He added that 1.87 million addresses in this region have accumulated about 730,000 BTC. With this decline, these holders may sell the token to reduce losses. The crypto analyst also highlighted a potential decline to the next demand zone ranging from $37,500 to $38,700. Meanwhile, about 1,28 million addresses in this region have accumulated 553,000 BTC tokens.

He also gave a timeline of when it will hit this price level. When XRP Price Will Hit $22 In a YouTube interview with Zach Rector, Patrick Riley, the founder of Reaper Financial, mentioned that XRP will hit $22 at the peak of the next bull run. He further stated that the crypto token will hold above $10 in the next bear market after that bull run. The next bull run has been projected by many to occur in 2024, meaning that XRP could hit $22 next year. Related Reading: Changelly Releases Updated Predictions For XRP Price, When Will It Cross $10? Riley sounded so optimistic about the future of XRP. This isn’t surprising, considering that Reaper Financial is built on the XRP Ledger. The $22 price prediction isn’t the only bold assertion that the crypto founder made. He also foresees XRP surpassing Bitcoin at some point, although he didn’t give a particular timeline for that. When that happens, he believes that will see XRP materialize as the global reserve currency. He alluded to the dollar failing and many possibly looking to cryptocurrencies for succor. There is a general belief that cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, can act as a hedge against inflation. However, going by Riley’s prediction, XRP instead of Bitcoin will be the go-to token. Talks about Inflation and the declining value of the US dollar have been discussed much of late. Renowned economist Peter Schiff recently warned that the fall of the US dollar was imminent and that the country’s economy is going to take a hard hit. Many believe that this could be a great avenue for cryptocurrencies to swoop in and save the day. XRP falls below $0.6 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Making A Case For XRP In a more recent video on his YouTube channel, Zach Rector made a case for XRP instead of Bitcoin as the future of finance. He hinted at how the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network affect its utility, as many are unable even to afford to transact on the network. Therefore, he believes that XRP is in a “better to change the world” and possibly the global financial structure. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Faces Crucial Turning Point That Could Trigger 50% Rally, Analyst Says Indeed, many believe that XRP is in a better position because of the transaction speed and fee of the network. The XRP ledger is said to be able to process 1,500 transactions per second and settle them in three to five seconds. Transaction cost on the network also stands at 0.00001 XRP, which is way below the average gas fee on the Bitcoin network.

New subscribers to Helium Mobile must wait eight days before they can claim any MOBILE tokens they're set to receive in exchange for having shared their location through Discovery Mapping, according to the company's terms of service, updated Dec. 18.  The shift is meant to combat growing pains at Helium's partially crowdsourced cellular network. Since launching nationwide at the beginning of December, the low-cost phone plan has seen an explosion of new customers as well as interest in its unique mechanism for paying its users in cryptocurrency.  Helium Mobile's cell service runs on a mix of T-Mobile towers and Helium's own hotspots, which are hosted by individuals. Those hotspot operators receive MOBILE tokens as payment, as do phone subscribers who opt into Helium Mobile's location tracking service, theoretically meant to help guide where new hotspots should go.  At current levels, subscribers to Helium Mobile who use Discovery Mapping are earning over 2,000 MOBILE tokens per day, CoinDesk found. That is enough to cover the cost of Helium Mobile's $20 monthly subscription in just two days.  The booming price of MOBILE – it's up over 2,000% this month – has helped attract thousands of new customers to Helium Mobile as well as its mapping service. On Sunday, over 6,700 wallets received MOBILE rewards, per data site Helium Geek, more than double the number a week earlier.  ""Helium Mobile has seen so many sign ups, with some a bit more suspicious than others,"" said Coco Tang, director of product for Helium Mobile's parent company Nova Labs, in a Discord post Monday afternoon.  Apparently, some customers were farming MOBILE tokens for seven days and then canceling the phone plan, walking away with a full refund and potentially hundreds of dollars in MOBILE tokens.

42409173,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEREj,1702932000,How Index Coop is Capitalizing on ETH's Price Momentum,"The Index Coop, a decentralized autonomous organization and leading provider of on-chain structured products, recently announced the launch of theIndex Coop CoinDesk ETH Trend Index (cdETI), a tokenized implementation by Index Coop of Coindesks Indices’ ETH trend indicator (ETI). CoinDesk Indices, the publisher of the ETI, sat down with Index Coop’s Head of Product, Allan Gulley, to talk about the DAO’s product strategy and cdETI.  The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  The Index Coop was one of the first organizations to launch on-chain indices, notably with DPI and MVI. Can you share more about what you’re working on now?  Yes, that’s right. We were early to the on-chain structured product market. Our early products, like DPI and MVI, were thematic baskets of tokens built on Set Protocol, and “diversification” was the simple strategy that we effectively tokenized. We later ventured into more sophisticated structured products, like ETH2x-FLI, that allowed us to tokenize more complex strategies.  Our on-chain indices did well during the bull market, but like everyone else we've been building through the bear market so that we can be well positioned as the overall environment improves, as it is now. We’re branching out and experimenting with different automated strategies and on-chain asset classes. We’ll still create index-style products, but the market is signaling that people are interested in earning yield, using leverage, and executing more complex strategies, so we’re responding to those needs as well.  As you know, we launched the Index Coop CoinDesk ETH Trend Index (cdETI). The idea for this product is that it will reduce the volatility from holding ETH by dynamically allocating between WETH and USDC based on CoinDesk Indices’ Ether Trend Indicator, which uses current and historical data to measure momentum in the ETH price.  You mentioned that cdETI aims to reduce some of the volatility associated with holding ETH. How does that work?  A truism in the financial world is that most people are bad at timing the market. With cdETI, we’re tokenizing our implementation of the CoinDesk Indices Ether Trend Indicator so that users can benefit from positive ETH price action while dampening volatility to the downside. This is intended to mitigate the need for users to constantly monitor the market or engage in active trading.  To state it simply, the trend indicator works by comparing recent prices to historical prices using a series of moving averages. When the indicator signals strongly that the direction or strength of ETH price is stalling or falling, the token rebalances from WETH to USDC. When the indicator signals strong positive price momentum, the token reallocates to WETH. ETI levels between these strong indications maintain a 50/50 allocation between WETH and USDC.  By automatically rebalancing between WETH and USDC, cdETI has the potential to capture bullish price movements for token holders while preserving capital during bearish scenarios. As a result, passive holders may maintain their WETH position while having some protection to the downside due to the data-driven methodology under the hood.  Looking ahead, where do you see the on-chain structured product market going in the next year?  One thing I expect to see is the blending of on-chain technology with Web2-style interfaces, platforms and custody solutions. While there are some DeFi purists out there who don't want on-chain assets anywhere near Web2 platforms, we think there can be productive partnerships between on-chain products and off-chain distributors.  We’ve pursued a number of partnerships with platforms and custodians like Matrixport, BitGo and Copper to give our users as many ways as possible to access our products. It’s imperative that users always have the option to self-custody on-chain products, but for the broader base of users who have different preferences, we want to ensure our products are available to them where they are the most comfortable and convenient.  You sound optimistic about the future of on-chain products, but on-chain products, as of yet, have not captured significant market share. Why do you think that is?  It’s true, the on-chain structured product market is small right now. When we published our industry report in June, the on-chain structured product market made up 0.21% of the overall crypto market with a combined Total Value Locked (TVL) of $2.5bn. At the same time, there was $48.3bn of assets in the DeFi market and $1.19tn in assets in the crypto market.  Why the on-chain structured product market is so small is something we looked at in our white paper. We also recently published an article where we asked six experts in our space this exact question. Several of these experts cited the lack of access to these products, especially in the U.S. where ambiguous and antagonistic regulatory efforts are shutting down many on-chain providers. Many structured products are also not as cost-effective as they should be, especially since most of them are on Ethereum mainnet where transaction costs can be prohibitive for smaller users who may want to dollar cost average in.  As the digital asset market continues to mature, we expect the on-chain structured product sector to grow and gain market share relative to the rest of DeFi. Things have evolved rapidly in the last few years, and we’re optimistic that the next several years will bring regulatory clarity and improved infrastructure for building these products.  What are the advantages to having these product on-chain?  That’s a great question. At the Index Coop we believe that on-chain structured products ultimately create the best user experience. First and foremost, on-chain products are transparent. Users can independently verify the holdings, strategies, and smart contracts supporting our products in real-time. Our products can also be permissionlessly issued with or redeemed for their underlying assets at any time, allowing arbitrageurs to keep their price in line with their net asset value (NAV) and avoiding persistent premiums or discounts commonly observed with off-chain structured products.  We also see security as a selling point for these products. Though there have been a number of high profile hacks in other areas of DeFi, we ultimately expect on-chain products to be extremely secure as the infrastructure is stress tested and audits are performed on a routine basis.  On-chain products also have the potential to be globally accessible. Obviously there are limitations in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory issues, but like many in the DeFi space, we’re excited by the possibility of offering globally-available products that are accessible 24/7 to anyone with an internet connection.

Analyst Finds Market Top Signals With BTC At $40,000","Bitcoin is walking back on some of its gains over the past few days. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap might be on the verge of a more significant retracement, which could push it back to the $30,000 zone. Related Reading: Internet Computer Loses Grip On $10, But Still Inks 82% Rally – Details As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $40,950 with a 2% loss in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the cryptocurrency records a 3% loss, with all tokens in the top 10 by market recording a similar performance, except for Avalanche (AVAX). Bitcoin Hits Local Top? Bull Run Slows Down Over the weekend, Bitcoin was rejected from the critical resistance level at $43,500. According to a pseudonym analyst, as the BTC price dropped to its current levels, a significant player placed a “substantial resistance block.” The chart below shows that the selling order is 1,562 BTC, or around $7 million. It also shows thick support for BTC as the bullish momentum fades. In other words, Bitcoin might slow down, but the area around $40,000 could provide critical support for a potential bounce. The analyst stated on the increasing selling orders appearing on the books: Massive resistance added on BTC Binance Spot. This is what a top looks like. A substantial resistance block of 1562 BTC has just arrived in the order books. BTC Whales On The Move While many believe that the market can absorb the spike in selling pressure, crypto analytics firm Material Indicators showed that Bitcoin is losing the support of major players. Over the weekend, players selling orders above $1 million “dumped” their positions. The firm has been warning traders about this possibility by arguing that the recent bullish price action was a strategy to suck in liquidity from retail investors. Once this smaller player jumped in, whales began to “distribute” or sell their coins into the rally. Related Reading: Solana Threatens To Unseat Ethereum In Trade Volume With $1 Billion In Single Day In that sense, the firm set a potential local top for BTC at $45,000. Keith Alan, one of Material Indicators senior analysts, stated the following on the current price action: The good news is, at some point the market does flip to accumulation, and prices moving lower will get us to that point. As bad as it looks for bulls right now, I’m not expecting a straight line down. Time to exercise some patience and see how things develop from here.

According to a blog post from Electric Coin, Wilcox has served as the project's leader since 2015, when the company, then known as ""Zcash,"" was created.  Swihart, formerly senior vice president of growth at ECC, will return to the company to take on the CEO role, responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions, according to the post.  ""We feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability and increasing adoption,"" Electric Coin said. ""In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical and product background.""  Wilcox will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC, according to the post.  In a separate blog post, Wilcox wrote that ""Zcash took over not only my life but also my identity.""  ""It was hard for others to see Zcash as something separate from me. sometimes it was hard for me to do that myself,"" Wilcox wrote. ""However, in the long run, I don’t think this conflation of Zcash with me personally is healthy for me, and I don’t think it’s healthy for Zcash.""  He wrote that he was looking forward to a ""couple of months to think about how I can best help,"" but that ""anything that I would commit myself to in the future would need to include Zcash, because the Zcash community is freedom’s best hope.""  ZEC, the native cryptocurrency of Zcash, was down 5.8% over the past 24 hours, in line with a broader slide in digital-asset markets on Monday. The price didn't appear to move much on the announcement of the CEO change.  Bitcoin fork  The Zcash network, officially launched in 2016 as ""fork"" or copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, is known for its ""shielded addresses,"" in this case ""z-addresses,"" which allow for encryption on one or both sides of a blockchain transaction.  According to Zcash's technical documentation, Zcash relies on a type of mathematical proof called a zk-SNARK, derived from so-called zero-knowledge cryptography, which has become one of 2023's hottest trends in blockchain architecture.  ""The owner of a z-address can share its transaction details with trusted third parties via a view key – a key that grants read access but not spend authority over the address,"" the documentation reads. ""This allows for “selective disclosure”, where transactions are auditable but disclosure is under the participant’s control. This allows compliance with payment for auditing, tax regulations, or anti-money laundering rules.""  Electric Coin, in its blog post on Monday, credited Wilcox for leading Electric Coin in its delivery, in Zcash, ""the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs.""

42409180,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcERbs,1702924877,"New Kind of Crypto Insider Trading? SEC Might Take a Look at These Trades, Experts Say","Crypto derivatives trading platform Hegic recently made millions of dollars by placing a trade of its own, loading up on tokens issued by an affiliated project. The strategy paid off in days, when Hegic shut the smaller business down.  It might not just be a savvy trade, but a perilous one as well. Experts interviewed by CoinDesk warn that the chain of events could render Hegic vulnerable to what would be a first-of-its-kind insider trading investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Hegic, a platform for trading crypto options on the Ethereum blockchain, could reap $17 million because of a highly profitable trading strategy executed by its pseudonymous developer, Molly Wintermute. She's the sole developer for Hegic and its less popular platform, Whiteheart.  Late last month, Molly gave up on developing Whiteheart. In a message on the Discord server that Hegic and Whiteheart share, Molly said Whiteheart would return its $28 million treasury to investors and shut down.  The redemption news caused Whiteheart's token to rally sixfold to $3,500 under heavy buying pressure from arbitrageurs eager for a piece of the treasury liquidation, a process Hegic is facilitating.  But no one is profiting more than Hegic. That protocol's treasury, which is separate from Whiteheart's, bought nearly a third of WHITE's token supply three days before the shutdown announcement, according to blockchain data. Between that purchase and another in September, it can lay claim to almost half of Whiteheart's treasury: $17 million of ether [ETH].  It seems like there's smoke here, and it may be worth an investigation to see if there's a fire.  Securities experts who reviewed the situation told CoinDesk the case speaks to the ""grey area"" that decentralized finance protocols such as Hegic and Whiteheart purport to exist in and profit from. Their proponents have argued the old rules shouldn't (or can't) apply to new financial innovations built on blockchains.  When executives at publicly traded companies know their business is about to do something potentially market-moving, they're barred from trading on that information until it's revealed to the public. If they do trade, that's insider trading – and it's illegal.  Hegic and Whiteheart are not organized as conventional corporations and WHITE isn't a stock, so the same rules don’t apply. But as the SEC ventures into regulation of cryptocurrencies, that could change. What happened here could newly be considered illegal, the experts said. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has stated that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities that ought to be subject to the same rules as stocks and bonds.  ""I think he would think it was a security and maybe an enforcement case would be appropriate,"" James Park, a law professor at UCLA who studies securities regulation, said of the WHITE situation.  Molly Wintermute did not respond to a request for comment.  Whodunit  When examined through the securities law angle, the Whiteheart trading could raise questions about fiduciary duty, shareholder rights and information asymmetries on unruly crypto markets that would rather not be subject to such questions.  According to Park, the U.S. prohibition on corporate executives trading using valuable secret information is part of their fiduciary responsibility. They can't, for instance, just frontrun earnings announcements.  Things get tricky when one tries to graft this standard onto DeFi. Project founders – the likeliest stand-in for an executive – could say they don't control their creations, and thus don't have a fiduciary responsibility to tokenholders.  Even so, Whiteheart and Hegic's relationship with Molly undercut this argument, according to Park. She created them, wrote their white papers, conducted their token sales and controlled their treasuries as their ""solo core developer."" She also announced the decision to close Whiteheart on Nov. 30.  Molly's activity ""shows that they are not some random person who is trading, but some person who tokenholders entrusted to develop this project in a way that would help them increase their profits,"" Park said.  Some projects seek to bolster their decentralization by letting tokenholders vote on key business decisions. Whiteheart was not one of them. The only thing holders of WHITE were entitled to was 30% of the revenue generated by the protocol. If anything, that makes WHITE look more like a security, two lawyers said.  Still, Whiteheart and Hegic exist in a world of legal uncertainty, and it's far from clear that securities laws should apply to them or their tokens, said Nejat Seyhun, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.  Despite that, ""it seems like there's smoke here, and it may be worth an investigation to see if there's a fire,"" he said.  Insider trading?  WHITE spent most of 2023 in the forgotten corner of the crypto market. Three years after its founder raised13,667 ETH (then worth over $8 million) to fund Whiteheart's novel hedging contracts, it had devolved into, at best, an afterthought to Hegic.  ""Molly delivered on the promise (protocol was up and running like it should) but the idea did not get as much traction as people thought. Even today, options in DeFi are the lowest used derivative, people don't trade them nearly as close to as much as perps/futures,"" said a longtime user of Hegic and Whiteheart, who goes by the screen name Parad0xPrince.  Traders stopped trading WHITE, too. In the first three weeks of September 2023, Uniswap processed 14 total trades worth less than $9,000 total. It was priced at $78 – 87% below its value during the December 2020 sale.  Then Molly started bidding. In 10 minutes of trading on Sept. 21, her wallet bought $158,000 worth of WHITE – over 16% of all the tokens. She paid for this trade using 100 ETH from Hegic's treasury. Two months later, she sent its WHITE proceeds to Hegic's current treasury wallet.  This wallet traded WHITE again on Nov. 27. In a single trade, the Hegic treasury bought 2,900 WHITE tokens, paying $2.3 million worth of ETH. Again, the price of WHITE ballooned: from $193 to $2,000, before settling down near $500 three days later.  Seven hours after roiling WHITE's Uniwap market, the Hegic Discord account promised ""further announcements"" about Whiteheart's future and advised holders against ""hasty action.""  The news came three days later. Whiteheart would shut down and ""refund"" all WHITE holders at the price original investors paid in 2020: 1.7 ETH.  A larger problem?  There is evidence of “frontrunning” throughout crypto. According to market surveillance firm Solidus Labs, more than half of Ethereum-based tokens ""experienced insider trading activity"" right before their debuts on centralized exchanges, in the period between January 2021 and June 2023.  Decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap are ""a game changer for insider traders,"" said Chen Arad, chief external affairs officer of Soludius. They lack the monitors and regulations to stop such activity and make it easy for manipulators to strike, he said.  But they're also a boon for those trying to catch them because every transaction is recorded publicly on the blockchain, creating a digital trail of breadcrumbs that regulators can follow, he added. That is ""a point we emphasize in discussions with regulators,"" he said.  Federal prosecutors have taken action. In a pair of cases against insiders at OpenSea and Coinbase, the U.S. Department of Justice cracked down on frontrunning as a form of ""wire fraud."" The distinction highlights how the government can allege illegal activity even if securities law – and the SEC – don't come into play.  There hasn't yet been a case against insider trading in the DeFi markets. Arad expects that to change.  ""Many regulators are considering insider trading prevention as a key element of applying market abuse regulation to crypto and DeFi,"" he said.  Winners and losers, but mostly winners  Regardless of its status under securities law, the Whiteheart redemption plan gives investors in WHITE an uncommonly happy ending.  Most crypto projects fall into obscurity only after their treasuries have gone to zero, leaving nothing for the tokenholders. A cottage industry of activist investors has developed around forcing struggling decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, to buy out their investors before they run out of money.  But Whiteheart never ran out of money. Molly and Hegic have set up a market on Uniswap that will buy every single WHITE token at 1.7 ETH apiece. That's the same ETH-denominated price WHITE's original investors paid three years ago.  ""I never saw a founder return money to ICO investors 1:1 even though he delivered on what he should,"" said Parad0xPrince, using the acronym for initial coin offerings.  The biggest winner is undoubtedly Hegic protocol itself. Molly's trades netted a nearly 600% return on investment. Whiteheart may be dead, but nearly half of its riches will live on in Hegic.  And the market approves. On Nov. 30, when the shutdown announcement went live and WHITE pumped to $3500, Hegic's token price climbed alongside its swelling treasury.  The market drove the HEGIC token 60% higher in a single day.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/18/a-new-kind-of-insider-trading-hegics-defi-bets-might-attract-secs-attention-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/455c39f3c70ec7b794789017ce6ca40d321d0320-4436x2495.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409174,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcERI2,1702922638,Ethereum Staking and Investor Adoption,"Methodic Capital Management (MCM), an industry innovator in bringing fiduciary responsibility and thoughtful execution to bridge blockchain with broader financial markets, recently announced the launch of the Methodic CoinDesk ETH Staking Fund. CoinDesk Indices, which provides the fund’s benchmark, sat down with Jason Hall, CEO of MCM, to talk about Ethereum staking and investor adoption.  The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  Why is ETH staking considered to be a more stable digital asset investment?  In the long term, we believe ETH Network usage will be the ultimate determining factor of returns. By nearly any metric, the majority of blockchain activity occurs within Ethereum’s ecosystem, making Ether the most utilized token. We think this positions ETH to be the greatest beneficiary of future blockchain technology adoption. Digital assets can be volatile, however, when volatility coincides with high network activity, Ethereum’s well-established baseline adoption rate promotes asset stability and can exhibit a flight-to-safety quality, especially relative to other crypto assets. There are also mechanical benefits to how the Ethereum blockchain functions. The token supply is adjusted based on network activity which can reduce supply when transaction volume is high. The ETH staking reward rate also increases in periods of high activity, leading to an increased total return, if your ETH is staked. While it’s difficult to net these forces out, together we believe they can amount to increased stability for asset owners.  What will investors miss out on by not having total return on ETH staking rewards in their portfolio?  Staking ETH allows investors to access the power of compounding rewards. Staked ETH rewards are paid in-kind which increases an investor’s ETH position, creating a flywheel effect. People tend to over focus on their long-term price appreciation goals and lose sight of the power of accumulating a larger holding through staking. In sideways markets, staking rewards improve your total return and, in down markets, staking acts almost like a dollar cost averaging strategy. Interestingly, we’ve seen instances where the staking reward rate increases during periods of volatility, further benefiting the asset. So purely from a rate perspective, you have a barbell effect where you can do well in up and down markets, all else equal.  How does MCM help investors gain access to ETH staking rewards?  MCM has expanded the accessibility of staked ETH by enabling investors to gain exposure to the asset through fiat currency, stablecoins, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the investment itself is a private fund, which means the shares can be held on a traditional balance sheet if the investor isn’t crypto native, or tokenized if they are. Operationally, we focus heavily on mitigating externalities that investors face in crypto such as: regulatory, reputation and operational risks in addition to compliance and balance sheet issues. We also seek to provide accountability through our benchmark, the CoinDesk Ether Total Return Index (ETXTR).  How did MCM come to be an established fund manager in the digital asset space?  At MCM we are dedicated to elevated partnerships and committed to precision and transparency. Our team has worked at the highest levels of the traditional finance industry and understands the requirements of sophisticated investors. Throughout our processes you’ll find multiple levels of redundancy. The nascent nature of the asset class, the steep learning curve, and the hostile regulatory environment make crypto a challenging place for institutional investors, yet interest in the space is growing rapidly. We planted our flag in the digital asset realm by employing exceptional risk management that focuses on the main concerns of investors.  How is MCM navigating the regulatory environment around digital assets?  Our mission is to introduce people to the generational wealth building opportunity that we believe is available through blockchain technology. Clear, thoughtful regulatory frameworks are required to create an enduring partnership with investors. At the moment, crypto/digital assets lack a coherent framework from regulatory bodies. Most of the ambiguity lies in how crypto is classified within securities laws, how the SEC classifies certain service providers, and what regulatory body should govern crypto. We have a strong view on regulation but we don’t assume we’re right, and don’t assume we can predict how regulation will evolve. Rather, we operate within the existing parameters and focus on the risks we can manage. We hope regulations evolve in a way that supports innovation and adoption but our job is to reduce risk, not create it by taking interpretive liberties.  Where would someone go to receive additional information?  Our approach to navigating the intricacies of digital asset investment is multifaceted and tailored to individual investor objectives. Whether aiming for blockchain exposure, expressing a view on crypto, accumulating assets for future on-chain business, or managing treasury reserves, we adopt a consultative strategy. We are happy to connect with those pursuing these objectives, providing tailored guidance and support to achieve their goals. Visit us at methodiccapital.com.

Despite currently being up around 77% from its bear market lows of $0.053 in June 2022, the crypto has lagged compared to top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana so far in 2023. On the bright side, DOGE’s on-chain metrics have exploded recently, pointing to a potential rebound on the horizon which could see Dogecoin spike to new highs. Dogecoin Market Overview DOGE has grown exponentially from its first days as the only meme coin in the crypto industry to now being the 10th-largest crypto asset in terms of market cap. According to Galaxy Digital, DOGE is worth almost two times as much as Wyndham Hotels & Resorts and almost as much as Nissan with its current market cap of $13 billion.

DOGE is now 940 days into its current bear market, 217 days less than the historical average. According to a report from Galaxy, this extended bear run has only happened twice in DOGE’s lifetime. In the last two cycles, the meme coin went on 1,192 days and 1,117 days of depressive price action, reaching more than 85% below previous all-time highs. Source: Galaxy Digital Although DOGE is now trading 543 days above its 2022 low, it is still underperforming in comparison to the last two cycles. In the first cycle, it took DOGE 977 days to climb to reach its all-time high from the 2015 low. Similarly, it took only 423 days to jump from its 2020 lows to the current all-time high. DOGE price succumbs to bear pressure | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com What’s Next For DOGE? Things started to change in the middle of October 2023, as the wider crypto market entered into a bullish sentiment. The crypto has been on a run since then, recently pushing its price over $0.1 for the first time this year to register a yearly high of $0.1018.

42409190,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcES8w,1702920099,Bitcoin Fees Spike to 2-Year High as Ordinals Bonanza Gives Windfall Profit to BTC Miners,"Bitcoin network fees surged to over $37, the highest since April 2021 as Bitcoin NFTs called Ordinals surge in popularity.  High transaction fees are a boon for publicly listed bitcoin miners and outperform range-bound BTC price.  Bitcoin [BTC] miners enjoy windfall profits as transaction fees spiked to the highest since April 2021 due to rising Ordinals inscriptions.  The average price of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain surged over $37 Sunday, a level last seen in April 2021, at the height of the bull market peak, data by BitInfoCharts shows, up from an average of $1-$2 in September and early October.  The surge is mainly driven by the resurgence of Ordinals, a protocol that allows users to store non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain called inscriptions.  Users created over 1.2 million new Ordinals inscriptions from Friday to Sunday, according to a Dune Analytics chart by crypto asset management firm 21.co, clogging the network with some 300,000 transactions waiting for confirmation.  The popularity of Ordinals have divided the Bitcoin community, with core developer Luke Dashjr calling them ""spams"" in need of fixing. However, sky-high fees have proved a boon for BTC miners.  Miners, who earn BTC for processing blockchain transactions, now generate some $63 million daily income from fees or $23 billion on an annual basis, almost quadruple of the two-year average, a Monday report from 10x Research noted.  ""Despite bitcoin being range-bound, the BTC mining stocks are still performing well and are on fire with extraordinarily high fees being generated,"" said 10x Research's Markus Thielen, who is also the head of research at Matrixport.  Bitcoin mining stocks have also outperformed BTC price recently, Thielen added. While BTC is up 7% in December, mining stocks such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platform (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) rallied 15%-40% during the same period.  Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, noted that BTC mining stocks may also benefit from a strong performance of the equity markets.  ""Bitcoin miners have continued to perform well over the past several trading sessions, despite stagnation in the underlying price of [BTC price],"" he posted on X.

21558407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565821,1702917035,XRP Gets Rejected Down: Analyst Predicts Bottom Target,"An analyst has revealed the level of XRP might observe a pullback following the latest rejection in the cryptocurrency’s price. XRP Has Seen Rejection At Mid-line Of An Ascending Parallel Channel As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, XRP has appeared to have been moving inside an Ascending Parallel Channel recently. An “Ascending Parallel Channel” refers to a pattern in technical analysis that’s used for identifying uptrends and potential reversal points for any asset’s price. As the name already suggests, the pattern involves two parallel lines that make up the “channel” within which the price action is mostly contained. The upper line is made by connecting higher highs, while the lower one strings together higher lows. Related Reading: Analyst Rates Bitcoin As Most Promising Asset For 2024, Predicts Price Potential Of $120,000 At the upper line, the asset might be more likely to feel some resistance and get rejected back inside the channel, while the lower line could provide support to it. In the scenario that the price makes a breach of these channel lines, a sustained break might take place. Naturally, a breakout above the upper line would be a bullish one, while that below the lower one could signal the continuation of the bearish trend. Like the Ascending Parallel Channel, there is also the “Descending Parallel Channel,” which is obviously a pattern used whenever the market is showing a clear trend towards the downside. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows an Ascending Parallel Channel that XRP has been stuck inside for quite some time now: The parallel channel that the asset has been moving inside recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, XRP’s price top back in July of this year coincided with a temporary break above the upper line of this Ascending Parallel Channel pattern. Since this rejection, the asset hasn’t yet been able to revisit the level. In the chart, the analyst has also drawn a third line: the mid-point between the two parallel trend lines of the pattern. This line has also appeared to have acted as resistance for XRP during the duration it has traveled inside the channel, as it has often hit local tops on interactions with it. Recently, after bottoming out at the lower level following the earlier rejection, the asset climbed towards this middle line and made a retest of it. The coin appears to have been rejected from it, however, as it has been sliding down since then. “After facing rejection at the channel’s mid-line, XRP might see a pullback toward the lower boundary, around $0.55,” explains Ali. At the time the analyst had posted the chart, the asset had been trading around $0.618, but since then, it has observed a further 5% drawdown.

42409208,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEb9j,1702916637,2024: The Year of Regulatory Compromises,"In the wake of the implosion of multiple crypto operators in 2022, a phalanx of administrative agencies descended upon the industry, declaring it “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies, and money laundering.” In an effort to remedy these perceived defects, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) collectively brought more than 200 enforcement actions against crypto industry participants over the course of 2023.  Like an autoimmune response that is unable to distinguish good from bad, the agencies filed lawsuits against both those that skirted the law and those that attempted to comply with it. Among those ensnared by the agencies’ enforcement dragnet were a distributor of uniquely-generated animated cat JPEGs, a decentralized autonomous organization and numerous celebrity “influencers,” including Kim Kardashian, Paul Pierce and Lindsay Lohan.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  The regulators deemed seemingly every industry participant to be running afoul of Depression-era laws with questionable applicability to crypto and dismissed petitions for more fulsome rulemaking. But, as the year winds down, the SEC is nursing two black eyes from losses against Ripple and Grayscale in federal court and the CFTC now seems more interested in settling actions with crypto exchanges than engaging in protracted litigation with them.  If 2023 has been the year of regulation versus decentralization (as I predicted last December), next year may very well be one of regulatory compromises. It is unlikely that Congress will pass comprehensive crypto legislation during an election year, but regulators may opt to pare back a failing regulation-by-enforcement strategy and instead work collaboratively with industry to develop an interim regulatory framework through a combination of notice and comment rulemaking and no-action relief.  Crypto industry participants and regulators have a common interest. Both were caught in the same rug-pull late last year (following FTX’s implosion) and should want to prevent bad actors from once again crippling the good despite the unlikelihood of an immediate legislative solution.  While it is unlikely SEC Chair Gary Gensler will let up on his crusade against the perceived “wide-ranging noncompliance” within the industry, the SEC and other crypto regulator hopefuls will need to make compromises next year. Grayscale’s legal challenge to the SEC’s rejection of its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application resulted in a unanimous three-judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel holding that the SEC’s action was “arbitrary and capricious.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit also required the SEC to respond to a petition for rulemaking on crypto asset securities.  This uprising against administrative agency overreach extends well beyond the crypto industry. In a lawsuit brought by the Chamber of Commerce against the SEC, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to address industry comments and conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis with respect to a rulemaking related to share repurchase disclosures.  And the SEC must defend against a lawsuit brought by six industry groups alleging that the agency exceeded its statutory authority in adopting new private fund adviser regulations. Additionally, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently told the CFTC that the agency abused its discretion by withdrawing a no-action letter without providing any supporting reasoning and a CFTC-registered exchange is suing the agency for arbitrarily and capriciously rejecting its bid to list new event contracts on its platform.  These types of legal challenges to administrative actions are likely to continue to circumscribe and force the hand of the regulators next year. As a result of the Grayscale decision, the SEC recently authorized a futures-based ether ETF and it is rumored that the agency will approve a spot bitcoin ETF as soon as January.  Read more: Marc Hochstein - What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024  After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit mandated that the SEC respond to an industry petition for rulemaking, the SEC opted to reject the petition. But Chair Gensler’s accompanying public remarks were a far cry from his prior statement that “probably only a few” crypto assets “may not be” securities. “Of course, . . . not every crypto asset is necessarily offered and sold as a security . . . [and] I look forward to working with crypto projects and intermediaries that wish to comply with the law,” he now says.  Although the SEC does not intend to propose a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, the agency has proposed a handful of new regulations subject to finalization next year that would impact crypto industry participants. SEC proposals to redefine the definition of an “exchange” to include “communication protocol systems” and require investment advisers to custody crypto assets with a qualified custodian, if adopted in current form, are likely to result in similar administrative law challenges. Multiple industry groups and crypto firms claim that the SEC has violated the so-called “major questions doctrine” by proposing these regulations without clear Congressional authorization to do so, among other complaints. The reality that these regulations may be held up by legal battles and then abandoned in the event of a change in administration may prompt the SEC to make significant concessions.  Crypto industry participants will also have reason to expand interactions with agency staff beyond those compelled by a subpoena next year. As institutional demand for crypto continues to increase, industry participants seek to offer a broad swath of products that will require collaboration with regulators.  For example, many types of tokenized real world assets (RWAs) are very clearly within the SEC’s jurisdictional ambit and will require SEC staff buy in. Exchanges that hope to offer crypto margin trading and perpetual futures within the U.S. will need CFTC approval. And prudentially-regulated financial institutions that seek to offer stablecoins and other crypto products will not be able to do so without the authorization of their supervising regulators.  After a long year of legal battles, in the new year we can expect the crypto industry and regulators to warm up to one another (if ever so slightly), and this will be a net positive for all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael Selig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/18/2024-the-year-of-regulatory-compromises,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7213529b64306c22f1498b258903ff562fbba7-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409213,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEbJe,1702912404,"Under the Hood, 2023 Was a Highly Constructive Year for Crypto","Bringing bad actors to justice has been the single most important accomplishment in the world of crypto and blockchain in 2023. Go back in time to November 2022. At that time, as the largest fraud in the history of crypto was being exposed (well done CoinDesk!), many feared that those responsible would never be held accountable. More than a few of my acquaintances thought that all the money given to the politicians would act as protection, clearly not.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  Fast forward to December 2023 and we pile on convictions and settlements and record fines for bad actors. Many people are going to spend real-time in real prisons for stealing customer money, misusing it or violating other laws.  As basic as this might seem, it's enormously helpful in laying the foundation for a better future. In case you've never experienced it, competing against a company that's a fraud is remarkably difficult. They can promise things you can't, because they have no intention of delivering. And have you tried selling regulatory compliance or audit services to companies where the executives are committing fraud? They always seem to have a reason why they're not ready to invest yet.  Justice matters for consumer confidence as well. The crypto markets have risen in price significantly this year, but on volumes that are much lower than in the past. Restoring some sense of trust in the markets as a whole and the offerings of exchanges, which are the main consumer on-ramps into the ecosystem, is going to be especially important.  Critical, invisible  Beyond the pursuit of justice, I think few people will look back upon 2023 as a pivotal year in the history of blockchain. It won't be because nothing important happened, but because all the really critical things that did happen were largely invisible.  Historians may say that Ethereum's triumph happened with the ""Merge"" in 2022. In reality, that was a culmination of many years of work. Even more so, it took much of 2023 for everyone to really absorb that and adapt to this new environment. The explosion of Layer 2 traffic on Ethereum, which now exceeds the Layer 1 traffic, took place this year. Ethereum might have officially been 2022's big winner, but the real work to build on that at scale happened in 2023.  Read more: Marc Hochstein - What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024  Similarly, I think future historians will mark 2024 as the beginning of a new regulatory era for crypto and blockchains, with ETFs being added in the US market and the opening of regulated trading under the Markets In Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation in Europe. Again, from ETF applications to the legislative and regulatory details to enable MiCA, much of it happened in 2023.  If you pay attention to the progress of blockchain and crypto, 2023 was an amazing and constructive year. As we approach the end of the year that was challenging from a business perspective, I can tell you, I still think we're going to make it. On the other hand, if you weren't tuned into the real work going on, all you heard about were criminals and convictions.

Stacks (STX) is one of the few altcoins that stemmed the bearish tide and even went against the grain of the market. According to Coingecko, the token is up nearly 21% in the weekly timeframe. However, STX is starting to feel the pressure. As of writing, the token is already down 3% in the past hour. This brings the question of whether STX bulls can continue the rally or will falter along with the others.

This event is taken as a sign that Stacks is entering a painful growing phase that may or may not signal a brighter future for the network. However, running alongside this congestion is the most recent blog post of the dev team. An exciting new project bringing Ordinals and Stacks closer together launched this weekend.

42409193,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEaW3,1702911507,The Year of Institutional Investment in Real World Assets,"The tokenization of real world assets (RWAs) has been a use case for blockchain technology for years, and yet we haven't seen substantial institutional interest in RWAs until now.  The value of tokenized assets across all public blockchains has already reached $118.57 billion and could reach $10 trillion by 2030. In other words, the potential upside for investing in RWAs is enormous.  Recent macroeconomic shifts and improvements in technology for secure custody, trading and settlement have made investment in tokenized treasuries, private equity and debt that much more attractive. Ultimately, it’s regulatory clarity and property rights enforcement that will make 2024 the year of RWAs.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Sanchit Pande is the head of BitGo’s trading and financing businesses.  Stablecoins are currently the most familiar tokenization projects. The most common form is a direct claim on fiat currency held by a custodian. Today the global market cap for stablecoins stands at around $124 billion; according to a report by brokerage firm Alliance Bernstein, it is expected to grow to almost $3 trillion in the next five years as private firms such as PayPal begin issuing them.  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are another form of tokenization. According to data from the Atlantic Council, 11 countries have already launched CBDCs, and 19 of the G20 countries are in the advanced stages of development.  See also: G20 Nations Welcome FSB's Tougher Crypto Rules  But it’s the tokenization of stocks, bonds and other traditional investment products that’s been gaining the most traction.  In the spring of 2022, JPMorgan announced the first trade on its private Onyx network, and as we head into winter 2023, it has already processed nearly a trillion dollars in notional collateral value. Just last week, JPMorgan announced that Onyx will do a proof-of-concept under the auspices of the Singapore Monetary Authority to connect portfolios to tokenized assets offered by WisdomTree.  The London Stock Exchange Group, UBS Asset Management, ABN AMRO and Citigroup have all also launched tokenization initiatives in 2023. Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Thailand have all been working out regulatory regimes to support tokenization.  Analysts at Citigroup have projected that $5 trillion worth of financial assets could be tokenized by 2030. Analysts at Bank of America predict that tokenized assets will become so ubiquitous over the next 5-15 years that “tokenized asset portfolios” will simply become “portfolios.”  Why the surge of interest?  Atomic settlement, the ability to settle even complex transactions instantaneously, is particularly appealing in the current high interest rate environment. If you're trading assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, speed matters. Delays in settlement carry an opportunity cost that scales directly with the notional value involved.  Near-instantaneous settlement via smart contracts eliminates the need for middlemen and the fees associated with their services while also reducing the potential for human error.  Big banks are also seeing margins for the private asset part of their business consistently decreasing. Programmable smart contracts built into tokenized assets can automate a number of transactional functions over the life of the asset. That removes a number of intermediaries and manual steps, creating new efficiencies that reduce overhead and boost margins.  Ultimately the biggest winners will be investors, as transactions become more efficient and costs decrease across the asset lifecycle.  Today’s robust stablecoin market further strengthens the use case for tokenizing traditional financial assets. Trades are ultimately finalized in fiat currency, which doesn’t move at atomic speed due to requirements to comply with banking rules such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC).  But if both the asset you’re buying and the currency you’re using are tokenized on chain, now you can start using the programmability capabilities of the blockchain to make the transactions even faster and more efficient, reducing settlement risk.  There are other benefits as well. Transparency of the blockchain can reduce information asymmetry, leading to more efficient pricing and increased liquidity. By nature, public blockchains make auditing simpler and more easily allow law enforcement officers to track the flow of illicit funds. Public ledgers provide a wealth of data for quantitative researchers, economists and government statisticians studying market and economic behaviors.  See also: Coinbase to Bring TradFi Assets On-Chain  There is certainly much work left to be done to develop the market. Regulation is probably the biggest piece. The Hong Kong circular broadly outlines four key areas that must be addressed: tokenization arrangement, disclosures, intermediaries and staff competence.  Ultimately, global standards will have to be determined for tokenization of real-world assets to reach its full potential. But at least in the U.S., tokenization won’t be held up by the unresolved debate around whether digital assets are securities, who should regulate them, and how.  Tokenized stocks, bonds, etc. clearly fall under existing U.S. securities regulations. Disclosures, consumer protections, KYC, AML and qualified custody requirements will all be in force.  Law around smart contracts is far from settled. Questions of ownership rights, liability and enforceability will have to be hashed out. Interoperability is also a challenge. Right now, a lot of this tokenization activity is taking place on private blockchains because of banks’ duties around compliance and controls, but the public blockchains are the ones that are becoming faster and innovating around interoperability.  That’s likely to continue, and public blockchains may prevail the same way that public clouds have come to dominate private ones. As that happens, more institutions may follow in the footsteps of Franklin Templeton, which. aggressively expanded its blockchain-based U.S. registered mutual fund product onto several chains.  See also: The Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) Explained  The market infrastructure supporting tokenization will have to be developed. In the current landscape there are many niche technologies, and few end to end solutions providers that can offer a seamless process for creation and management. This is in large part due to a scarcity of qualified custodians with the security chops to support these types of assets across the full lifecycle.  The market cap for traditional financial assets dwarfs that of digital assets. Tokenizing these assets is an extremely compelling growth opportunity for the digital asset industry. Today’s high interest rates and difficult banking climate, combined with the maturation of the stablecoin market and the digital asset industry as a whole, have made the business case for tokenization a lot more compelling for TradFi firms.  Ultimately the biggest winners will be investors, as transactions become more efficient and costs decrease across the asset lifecycle.

42409200,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEatC,1702910006,"Crypto Won't Get Long-Awaited U.S. Rules in 2024, But the Courts May Steer Its Future","Crypto's volatile relationship with the U.S. government will likely see some significant resolutions in 2024, from the arrival of a few consequential regulations to decisions in key court cases that will define how regulators treat digital assets. But the long-awaited rules of the road are likely to remain largely unwritten.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  Every year seems like the absolute tipping point in crypto's relationship with its U.S. government watchdogs, yet that moment always seems to stay just out of reach. The industry remains desperate for the U.S. to catch up to Europe and other jurisdictions (particularly in Southeast Asia) in putting formal crypto regulations on the books.  The sector's chief problem is a divided Congress that has even struggled to keep the federal government's doors open. While lawmakers from both parties in the House of Representatives have suggested they may be able to keep moving forward on crypto bills – especially one to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers – Senate Democrats have largely shaken their fists at crypto problems without stepping forward to act. There's no immediate reason to think they'll see 2024 – a presidential election year when political sniping reaches its peak – as the ideal runway for taking chances on potentially controversial legislation.  ""Expectations should be kept in check,"" Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with TD Cowen, warned in a recent client note. He said crypto legislation's best bet is as part of ""a broad package"" of other financial initiatives, such as the cannabis banking bill.  The near-term future for crypto legislation is further complicated by the pending exit of the most effective crypto advocate in Congress, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He recently decided to leave at the end of next year, raising questions about what happens to the bills he's been pushing.  As they await new laws, industry leaders' best guess is that they'll get spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. A tremendous amount of hope rides on that development from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which would establish highly liquid, regulated funds on exchanges. The sector is counting on that – a very frictionless way to get a stake in crypto – as a way to bring investors off the sidelines.  Even while the SEC may finally grant this boon, the agency and its cousin, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are likely to continue their crypto enforcement agenda with high-profile cases. However, the biggest players, like Coinbase and Kraken, are already embroiled in the most relevant accusations, and those are now being worked out in court. That leaves the U.S. regulators in the same boat as the digital assets companies they've been targeting: Everybody is just waiting for the courts to decide who is more right. The longstanding dispute between the SEC and Ripple – which has largely gone against the agency – will probably reach an initial conclusion, at which point the SEC can appeal the earlier court ruling that it partially overreached in interpreting the so-called Howey test to label XRP a security. If the SEC appeals, the judiciary's response to this fundamental legal fight could go on for many more months.  Read more: Marc Hochstein - What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024  But the legal war over the soul of crypto has many fronts. The SEC's cases against Coinbase, Binance and – more recently – Kraken as illegal, unregistered exchanges should make significant progress in 2024. As in the Ripple clash, at the heart of these disputes is whether the tokens being traded on these platforms are securities. Ripple General Counsel Stu Alderoty predicted the regulator will keep losing in court, ""setting the table for a showdown in the Supreme Court.""  ""So long as there continues to be no clear legal answer to which tokens are securities or commodities, and which may be both, it is safe to expect SEC Chair Gary Gensler to continue pursuing his regulation-by-enforcement agenda,"" Washington D.C.-based Beacon Policy Advisors said in a research note.  Federal judges won't be hurried into ruling on the weighty questions of defining tokens as securities. And if the commission led by crypto adversary Gensler chooses to make everything last as long as possible, delay costs the industry more than it costs the SEC's legal team. In the meantime, the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service each have proposed rules awaiting finalization that could rock the industry. The SEC just released an updated rulemaking agenda, and it's currently targeting April 2024 for finalizing a rule that would require investment advisors to keep customers' crypto assets with ""qualified custodians,"" which Gensler argued doesn't include today's crypto exchanges, and the agency is aiming for the same month to finish a separate rule to expand the definition of regulated exchanges to rope in crypto entities, including decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The big IRS rule to establish a system for taxing crypto also threatens to capture DeFi. On the political stage, the outcome of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections could determine whether a new administration will be swapping regulators. It could also decide whether Republicans lose their grip on the House and if the Democrats get similarly sidelined in the Senate – both outcomes are a very real possibility that could keep Congress divided – though the actual results of the elections won't develop until the following year.

42409209,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEbGL,1702908638,5 Predictions for Real World Assets in 2024,"Real-world assets (RWAs) have been a bright spot in crypto markets in 2022 and 2023. Amid depressed crypto-asset prices and elevated global interest rates, investor interest has shifted towards traditionally offchain yields (e.g., U.S. Treasurys) and away from crypto-native opportunities (e.g., yield farming). Simultaneously, the tokenization narrative gained traction with both crypto incumbents and external market participants (e.g., institutional money managers, regulators, etc.).  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  Despite momentum in the space, it should be recognized that tokenized assets are still in their infancy. Fundamental questions remain unanswered. For instance, how can regulation ensure the legal connection between tokens and their offchain counterparts? Do RWA prices sufficiently take into account novel risks (e.g., smart contracts) posed by blockchain technology? Does buy-side demand justify the current market offerings in tokenized markets?  What are the biggest opportunities and obstacles RWA builders should watch out for in 2024?  Below are RWA.xyz’s five predictions:  1. Proliferation of “Stablecoin” Products  Between Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT), the preeminent issuers of USD pegged stablecoins, there is $115 billion in circulation as of December 14, 2023. With arguably the best product-market fit among token issuers, we anticipate many teams will seek to emulate the success of these products in 2024.  To challenge the market dominance of USDC and USDT, these teams will seek to differentiate their products. by (1) using alternative forms of collateral to back a stablecoin (e.g., by way of currencies, commodities, government debt, etc.); (2) offering additional incentives to users (e.g., passing on yield generated by collateral); and (3) introducing novel compliance frameworks (e.g., “blacklisting,” or preventing wallets with certain user characteristics from holding a particular crypto-asset).  Despite the proliferation of stablecoin launches, we do not anticipate the collective market share of USDC and USDT to wane meaningfully throughout 2024. Newly introduced stablecoin products will find it difficult to compete with USDC and USDT’s vast interoperability, network effects and “blue-chip” status.  Read more: Marc Hochstein: What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024  2. Novel Asset Tokenization  The tokenization of assets unlocks new investment opportunities by enabling fractional ownership, offering programmable features, and providing enhanced traceability.  In 2024, we anticipate issuers will increasingly bring tokenized, alternative assets to market. Assets that are uniquely enabled by blockchain technology will prove to be attractive to investors seeking non-correlated and differentiated deal flow. Markets drawing more interest in 2024 could involve intellectual property rights (e.g., royalties, licenses, etc.) or potentially other assets like carbon credits or trade finance receivables.  3. A Shift Toward the Buy-side  Once novel was the notion of connecting asset originators with capital sources via blockchain. However, this concept is no longer a competitive differentiator, as the RWA.xyz Directory identifies at least 40 tokenization protocols capable of facilitating onchain private credit transactions. Historically, many of these protocols focused on developing a pipeline of borrowers, without clearly matching demand from the buy-side.  Kevin Miao of BlockTower Credit has argued that BlockTower was the first asset manager to build an RWA strategy predicated on the needs of capital providers (i.e., MakerDAO) rather than the supply of assets. BlockTower has been successful with this strategy, in that MakerDAO has committed an aggregate of $1.35 billion to BlockTower Credit across multiple investment vehicles.  Taking note of this success, we anticipate platforms will prioritize the needs of capital providers over those of asset originators. The challenge will be to ensure that the capital providers are of sufficient scale.  4. Regulatory Focus and Guidance  Early crypto-asset regulation emerged in response to the ICO boom of 2017-2018. Regulators from jurisdictions across the globe laid out novel, tailored frameworks aimed at governing the idiosyncrasies of crypto-assets.  By and large, tokenized assets were not covered by these regulations, and instead existed in a regulatory gray area. It was unclear to regulators how to simultaneously handle the token component, which called for tailored regulation, and the offchain asset component, which typically fell under existing financial laws.  As tokenized asset markets have continued to develop, regulators have been prompted to provide clarity on how tokenized assets are governed. In 2023 alone, regulators from Singapore, the United Kingdom, Japan, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and others, have all provided guidance on tokenization.  In 2024, we expect this trend to continue. Regulation will follow as tokenized asset markets become more popular and tokens come to represent a more diverse set of asset rights.  5. Institutional Tokenization Heats Up  The flurry of 2023 headlines depicting multinational financial institutions launching tokenization products, signals growing institutional interest in blockchain technology. In 2024, we expect this trend to continue.  Institutional money managers are likely to feel a sense of urgency to explore tokenization, likely motivated by a desire to keep pace with early movers. 2024 could easily be the year of significant growth in digital bond issuance – if not in volume, certainly in count.

42409199,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEama,1702908000,"Metis, Ethereum Layer-2 Network, Creates $100M Fund as Decentralized Sequencer Launch Nears","The MetisDAO Foundation, the organization behind layer 2 rollup Metis, said Monday that it has created a roughly $100 million fund to accelerate the growth of its ecosystem.  The fund, called the Metis Ecosystem Development Fund (Metis EDF), will allocate 4.6 million METIS tokens, which will all go to “sequencer mining, retroactive funding, deployment of new projects and other endeavors,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The METIS token price was $22.56 as of press time, down 8% over the past 24 hours.  The distribution of funds is planned for the first quarter of 2024, and potential recipients include those looking to build non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance, smart contract development and blockchain security in the Metis ecosystem.  According to a blog post, Metis expects early next year to become the first optimistic rollup to decentralize its sequencer, a key component of a layer-2 network that bundles up transactions from users and passes them along to the main Ethereum blockchain.  The timing of distribution of the newly announced ecosystem funds will come a week after the Metis decentralized sequencer is supposed to go live.  “So the initial incentives for the sequencer pool will come from this fund,” Jose Fabrega, head of marketing at Metis, told CoinDesk.  The Metis team, led by co-founder Elena Sinelnikova, notably includes Natalia Ameline, the mother of Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin.  “The MEDF will progressively evolve into a community-driven fund. It will be managed by the MetisDAO Foundation and Metis token holders, who will decide on grant allocation and project deployment on the Metis network,” the Metis team wrote in a press release. “Further down the project roadmap, Metis hopes the fund will become self-sustaining and ensure constant growth of the Metis ecosystem.”  Read more: New Metis Rollup Tech Addressees Ethereum Scalability for Businesses",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/18/metis-ethereum-layer-2-network-creates-110m-fund-as-decentralized-sequencer-launch-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fcc740e8fb3c6e450a6f3ead708799ac5ef77e6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company said it intends EURC to be a regulated e-money token under EU regulations.  Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial said its euro-backed stablecoin EURC is live on the Solana [SOL] blockchain, which is known for cheap, speedy transactions and the support of multiple ecosystem applications.  Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and digital wallets including Jupiter Exchange, Meteora, Orca and Phoenix have added support for the stablecoin, allowing users around-the-clock foreign-exchange transactions, trading, borrowing and lending with the token. The expansion to Solana follows native implementations on the Avalanche [AVAX], Ethereum [ETH] and Stellar [XLM] blockchains.  ""EURC is well positioned to radically enhance utility across peer-to-peer transfers and European remittance corridors,"" Circle said Monday.  Stablecoins, a $130 billion asset class, are a key piece of plumbing in the digital asset market, serving as a bridge between government-issued fiat money and cryptocurrencies supporting trading and transactions on blockchain networks. They are also increasingly used for savings in developing countries with fragile financial systems and for remittances across borders, offering faster and cheaper transactions than traditional banking alternatives.  Research firm Bernstein forecast earlier this year that stablecoins could potentially grow to become an almost $3 trillion market in the next five years as global financial and consumer platforms tap the tokens on public blockchains to power value exchange.

EURC's market capitalization currently stands around $55 million. That compares with USDC's $24 billion and market leader tether (USDT)'s $90 billion.  Circle said it plans EURC to be a regulated e-money token under the upcoming European Union-wide digital asset regulations called MiCA.

42409198,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEapt,1702907339,What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024,"December is the month when pundits make predictions for the year ahead. It's a tiresome ritual.  As George Costanza said in an infamous episode of TV's ""Seinfeld"" (you know the one): “Care to make it interesting?”  Instead of interviewing ""experts"" or, worse, suffering my armchair prognostications about what lies ahead for crypto in 2024, let's take a look at what the prediction markets are saying.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  They may not be right, but participants in these markets are putting their money where their mouths are. So we can be fairly sure they are telling us what they really think, not what they want you to think, or what they think you want to hear. Sometimes, just the questions they ask can themselves be revealing.  What are prediction markets?  (If you already know the answer to that question, feel free to skip to the next section.)  In prediction markets, participants bet on the outcome of real-world events, from the deadly serious (the war in the Middle East) to the frivolous (Taylor Swift's love life). They are typically framed as yes-or-no questions, and participants can buy ""yes"" contracts or ""no"" contracts. When the trade settles, those who bet on the correct prediction get $1 per contract purchased and those who bought the incorrect one get zero.  For example, for the market on whether Christopher Nolan will win the best director Oscar for ""Oppenheimer,"" ""yes"" contracts were recently trading at 68 cents, indicating the market sees a 68% chance he will get the nod.  More than just a speculative game, these markets arguably have positive spillover effects for the public, by offering an alternative source of expert opinion, a counterweight to fallible legacy sources of information. For example, the prediction markets reportedly called the 2020 election more accurately than the polls. Cable news pundits generally aren't punished for being incorrect. In prediction markets, bettors stand to lose money if their predictions turn out wrong, giving them an incentive to express what they truly believe.  Their beliefs might be wrong, but the financial risk should theoretically discourage uninformed wagers, and conversely the upside for betting correctly should attract traders with real insights … all else equal.  Traditionally, prediction markets have been run through centralized websites that settle bets in regular fiat currency (PredictIt and Kalshi are the two best-known examples operating today). However, prediction markets are popular among crypto traders, and, in recent years, a number of platforms have emerged that run on crypto rails.  The advantage of using crypto is that traders are free to bet on controversial questions without interference from some centralized entity. InTrade, a popular U.S. prediction market in the early 2000s, was forced to shut down by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more than a decade ago, underscoring the risk of centralized operators.  I take back what I said above. Here's one traditional analysts' prediction for 2024.  ""More than $100 million will be staked in prediction markets, which will emerge as a new 'killer app' for crypto,"" write the team at Bitwise Asset Management in their annual forecast.  ""Crypto takes [prediction markets] to the next level by making them borderless and permissionless, and by automating functions like determining winners and losers and making payouts,"" the Bitwise researchers go on. These markets will become ""a primary venue for both event-based and more traditional sports-related wagering.""  Even if that's overly optimistic, it's worth taking a look at what prediction markets are saying about what else might happen in crypto next year.  Which crypto projects will do airdrops in 2024?  Polymarket bills itself as the largest prediction market platform of any kind, and it's by far the largest crypto-based one. To make bets there, you need to deposit either USDC, a stablecoin or digital currency that usually trades at par with the U.S. dollar, or ether [ETH], the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the native token of Ethereum, the leading smart contract blockchain. (ETH deposits are automatically converted to USDC.)  Given that requirement, it's no surprise that in addition to sports, pop culture and politics, a popular topic of bets on Polymarket is crypto itself. Most of the crypto-related markets are about things that may or may not happen before the end of the year – for example, whether bitcoin [BTC] or ether will hit certain price levels. But a handful concern what's ahead for 2024.  Among those, a recurring theme is airdrops. These are giveaways of crypto tokens to wallets that meet certain criteria, e.g. if they've previously used certain services. Based on Polymarket trading levels on Dec. 12, the odds are almost 50-50 that Aleo, a privacy-minded decentralized finance (DeFi) project, will do an airdrop by April; there's an 11% chance that the Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token (NFT) collection will do one before March; and a 62% chance that Blast, a layer 2 blockchain launched on Ethereum last month, will give away tokens by May.  A big caveat here is that the trading volumes on these niche questions are small – in the thousands of dollars for each of the markets mentioned above. One reason may be that Polymarket is not allowed to serve U.S. residents under a settlement with the CFTC, excluding a broad swath of traders from the world's largest economy. Combined, there are $10,000 worth of bets on whether five different projects will do airdrops on the Solana blockchain by March 1, but again, when you break them down, they total thousands of dollars for each. Probabilities range from 16% for Kamino, a DeFi protocol, to 39% for another one, MarginFi.  It's easy to see why airdrops are a popular topic. They represent free money, after all. And if investors have an inkling of which protocols are likely to do airdrops for participants in a certain timeframe, and which ones aren't, it can inform their decisions about where to put money to work.  Kraken IPO? OpenSea token?  Other interesting questions posed on Polymarket include whether the Kraken exchange will go public by June (a 21% chance as of Dec. 12), and whether OpenSea, the NFT marketplace, will issue its own token by May (a 13% chance, though if you widen the window to ""sometime in 2024,"" the probability rises to 67%).  Some Polymarket bets are spicy: Will a certain bridge connecting blockchains fall victim to an exploit by a given date (a question that garnered more than $100,000 in bets as of Dec. 12, making it the third largest crypto-related market on Polymarket)? Will a certain centralized platform seek bankruptcy protection?  At first blush, these reminded me of the insinuations made by newspaper gossip columnists in “blind items” and by internet trolls ""just asking questions."" Once again, however, the fact that the traders making the doomer forecasts have skin in the game gives those forecasts some weight – though their value as signals is discounted by the small amounts of money involved.  Interestingly (suspiciously?) enough, the same bridge exploit question appears on Zeitgeist, a prediction market platform on the Polkadot blockchain network. Zeitgeist also hosts markets on the fallout from the FTX collapse – including whether convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried will get 50 years or more in prison when he's sentenced in March (42% chance, market says) and whether any account on the exchange will sell for more than 60 cents on the dollar before May (30%). Volumes here are even leaner than on Polymarket, in the low thousands per market. (In October, Zeitgeist announced a deal to use market benchmarks from CoinDesk Indices, which is part of the same company that publishes this website.)  Given their limitations, it's premature to call prediction markets a complete replacement for other sources of forecasting and expertise. But they're a useful supplement, part of a balanced informational diet.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/18/what-prediction-markets-are-forecasting-for-crypto-in-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2926b033889870ad911024fd624c6169bbd5548b-711x659.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The application was, however, rejected at the time. Asset manager VanEck’s relatively early interest in Bitcoin seemed to have been driven by their CEO as he narrated how his interest in Bitcoin grew. Van Eck mentioned how he began to listen to podcasts and went as far as reading Bitcoin’s whitepaper. Back when the crypto token was trading at $3,000, he said he had predicted that it would still do a 10x from there. VanEck’s CEO further stated that Bitcoin is “the obvious asset that is growing in front of our eyes.” He likened Bitcoin’s growth to China’s and how the country was underdeveloped years ago but now has one of the largest economies. Therefore, he suggested that BTC is still going to attain unprecedented heights. BTC price falls below $41,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Nothing Like BTC At some point in the interview, Van Eck was quizzed about whether or not there could be something else that surpasses Bitcoin, just like it did with Gold.

He also alluded to the macrocycle, especially with interest rates expected to keep falling, and how this is bullish for the crypto token. He believes that this, alongside with the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event are the factors that will make BTC outperform in the coming year. Asset manager VanEck is one of the numerous asset managers who have applied to the SEC to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF. With approval possibly on the horizon, the firm’s CEO believes that the Commission is likely to approve the pending funds simultaneously. His belief stems from the fact that the SEC did the same thing with the Ethereum futures ETF.

42409212,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEbMx,1702905375,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Struggles to Gain Momentum; FTX Files Plan to End Bankruptcy,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin [BTC] opened the trading week down 2% at $41,000. Ether [ETH] fell 3% to $2,100. Data from Coinglass shows there have been $103.5 million in liquidations of token-tracked futures in the past 12 hours, and $95 million of them have been longs, or bets on higher prices. Bitcoin has struggled to gain momentum over the past few days and is likely to start to look thin on volumes as traders take time off for Christmas, according to Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro. He notes that there is little in the way of on-diary events that could affect crypto prices this week. “A higher-than-anticipated inflation reading could chill U.K. markets on bank rate expectations, but this is very much a sideshow relative to the overall crypto market at the moment,” said Peters. Altcoins such as Helium’s HNT gained 9% over the past 24 hours, and Stacks’ STX added 6%.  The estate of collapsed crypto enterprise FTX submitted a proposal to end bankruptcy with a Delaware court, a filing from Saturday shows. The exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried imploded in November 2022, shortly after CoinDesk reported on the shaky balance sheet of the firm’s trading unit, Alameda. The bankruptcy plan was expected by Dec. 16 following earlier informal proposals, which included plans to return up to 90% of creditors’ funds. In the new proposal, creditor and customer claims are classed according to the priority the estate plans to give them, and the value of claims will be calculated based on asset prices as of the date the company filed for bankruptcy. In a separate statement, the estate said the plan was designed to ""maximize and efficiently distribute value to all creditors.""  Historically, cryptocurrency markets have been dominated by unregulated trading venues and retail investor activity. Still, this year shows how much market structure and participation has evolved and become institutionalized, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a report last week. The crypto market saw a growth of regulated, centrally cleared derivatives venues in 2023, including Coinbase Derivatives, CBOE, Eurex, GFO-X, AsiaNext and 24 Exchange, the bank observed. “The institutionalization of the market was most evident in the derivatives market,” the report said, adding that “CME saw a consistent increase in bitcoin and ether futures and options trading, and in Q4 has become the top BTC futures exchange by open interest.”  Trending Posts  Belgium to Push European Blockchain Network During EU Council Presidency, Digital Minister Says  Major NFT Indicies Stable After NFT Trader Hack  U.S. SEC Denies Coinbase’s Push for Crypto Regulations as 'Unwarranted'",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/18/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-struggles-to-gain-momentum-ftx-files-plan-to-end-bankruptcy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0485df26e5843b3360fa4813c0a2efd056763347-1166x765.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This historic accomplishment has garnered widespread attention from crypto leaders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a notable shift in the dynamics of decentralized finance (DeFi). As the news reverberates through the crypto space, additional elements of Solana’s success come to light.

42409204,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEb37,1702900281,"Belgium to Push European Blockchain Network During EU Council Presidency, Digital Minister Says","Belgium is set to take on the presidency of the EU Council, which gathers government ministers from member states.  During its six-month presidency, Belgium's Digital Minister Mathieu Michel plans to gather political support for an EU-wide blockchain initiative.  Belgium will give Europe’s ambitious blockchain initiative a political push when it takes the EU Council presidency in January, the country’s digital minister said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Mathieu Michel has already shared his grand vision for an EU-wide digital infrastructure that – at the very least – could store records such as driving licenses and property titles on a common blockchain controlled by the bloc’s governments.  Key to that plan is the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) initiative, which began in 2018 as a technical project. Michel said the goal is to rev up political support for it during Belgium’s six-month Council presidency and that eight member states are already on board.  “In the coming months, what we will do is to propose to other European countries to be involved in the project or to use the project for application,” Michel said.  The Council gathers government ministers from the European Union’s 27 member states and is the bloc’s highest political entity.  Prolific regulation  According to Michel, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology applications could be key to the EU’s pursuit of digital sovereignty, encompassing control over data and authority over cyberspace.  When it comes to guardrails for the digital space, the EU has been prolific in recent years, introducing legislative plans for everything from crypto to artificial intelligence, data sharing, a digital euro and even the metaverse. In fact, with the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation finalized this year, the bloc is set to become the first major jurisdiction in the world to have a comprehensive regime for the digital asset space.  Enough regulation, Michel says. Now, it’s time for Europe to put those digital innovations to good use.  EU countries were told in 2020 how to join the EBSI blockchain network by setting up their own nodes. But to avoid data silos, applications built on it should be interoperable across member states – something Michel said blockchain can help achieve.  “We are really bringing a lot of attention to privacy, but also transparency, control of the data. And with the blockchain, there is a technical aspect that can bring us that. And that's really, for example, the interoperability between the application in France, Italy and Spain,” Michel said.  To be first  Inviting political scrutiny to a technology project isn’t going to be a walk in the park. The EU’s big plans for a digital version of the euro have faced opposition from lawmakers in the bloc who are concerned about privacy implications and the expansion of government control.  Michel assures a unified blockchain infrastructure won’t be designed to collect any new data from citizens.  “Today, a lot of governments have data of the people, of the citizens. What we are talking about is a little bit of a paradigm shift,” he said, adding that the shift is in the way the government offers that data back to citizens.  It’s not mandatory to use blockchain, especially if it’s not going to help, Michel said, noting there is also a chance that blockchain tech could be replaced by something else altogether. Quantum computing, which promises ultra-fast problem-solving but is still some distance from coming to fruition, is already viewed as an existential threat to blockchain.  But that doesn’t mean the EU shouldn’t try, according to Michel.  “If you look at the sovereignty of Europe, we were not the first at connectivity. We were not the first in cloud services. Here, with blockchain technology, we could try to be the first,” Michel said.  “If we are not in advance, it means that we are already too late,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/18/belgium-to-push-european-blockchain-network-during-eu-council-presidency-digital-minister-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8462edb81d12e2dae841b098a25779f07c03664e-3848x2165.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The prices in the new predictions deviate heavily from their previous predictions, and this time around, the predictions include when the XRP price will cross $10. XRP Price Will Cross $10 In 2030 While the XRP community members remain very optimistic that the XRP price will cross $10 in the next few years, with a number of crypto analysts presenting chart data to support this, Changelly does not believe that this will happen anytime soon. In fact, for the next couple of years, the crypto exchange expects a lot of growth but double-digits is seemingly off the table. Related Reading: VeChain (VET) Set To Explode: Analyst Predicts 7,500% Rally To $2.3 By 2024, the crypto exchange predicts that the XRP price will reach a max price of $1.11, but still expects it to stay relatively high with a minimum price of around $0.94. In the next few years, the growth is expected to continue, rising to as high as $5 in 2028. Source: Changelly However, for the XRP price to reach $10, investors would still have to wait another extra two years according to the report. In 2029, it predicts a maximum price of $8.07. And then finally, in 2030, Changelly expects the price to beat the coveted $10 mark. Moving further from 2030, expectations are that the price will not fall below $10 again. Rather, it is expected to double in the next two years, hitting as high as $24.95 by the year 2032, which is nine years from now. XRP trending at $0.596 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Expecting A Very Underwhelming 2024 The price predictions by Changelly for 2024 broken down into the individual months paints a picture of lackluster performance from the coin. The highest point expected for the XRP price puts it at only a 35% increase from the current price of $0.59 at the time of writing. The expectation given is that the highest price point would come at $0.8.

According to Coingecko, the broader crypto market is down nearly 3% as major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP drop from year-to-date highs. As the sector cools down, altcoins are pulled downward. Synthetix is one of the sufferers of the massive bearish pressure engulfing the market. Coingecko data shows that the token is bleeding, with the biggest drop occurring in the weekly timeframe at over 16%. Related Reading: Internet Computer Loses Grip On $10, But Still Inks 82% Rally – Details Big Things Coming For Synthetix Although SNX isn’t faring well within the market environment, the Synthetix dev team is hot on its tracks to remain competitive within the world of crypto. Last week, Synthetix announced on X that they are nearing the launch of the Andromeda Release on their mainnet and the Ethereum Mainnet. Andromeda Release is the implementation of the Perps V3 which, according to their recent blog post, is focused on enhancing trading efficiency, usability, and resilience on the network. It will also add new features like Native Cross-Margining, Expanded Collateral Options, MEV-Resistant Liquidation Process, and many more. Synthetix Perps V3 is set to launch with the Andromeda Release on Base, soon to be followed by an Ethereum Mainnet version for medium to whale traders and protocols like @ethena_labs! 👇https://t.co/72QmySbAfb Check out the TLDR and read the blog post to learn more. – Perps V3… pic.twitter.com/YbsFjj0Hnt — Synthetix ⚔️ (@synthetix_io) December 15, 2023 The biggest add-on from the update is the deployment of Core V3 and Perps V3 on the Ethereum mainnet. “The Core V3 + Perps V3 release on Ethereum Mainnet represents a significant evolution for Synthetix, targeting medium to large traders and protocols in need of perps on L1,” the Synthetix team said in their blog post. SNX market cap currently at $1 billion. Chart: TradingView.com More Pain On The Crypto Front? Disregarding the positive internal news for SNX, the market has other plans for the token. As of writing, the bears are coming out strong, wrestling SNX bulls on the $3.59 price level. If the bears are successful in solidifying their gains, more pain could be in store for traders and investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Just Spiked 12% Overnight – What’s The Next Move? However, the upcoming implementation of Perps V3 might be able to offset this as it focuses on medium to large-scale whales to become active on the platform, thus driving more throughput to the network; but investors and traders shouldn’t disregard the broader market before making a decision. Right now, the market is entering its cool-down phase with cryptocurrencies reverting to more sustainable price levels. For SNX, that level is around the $3.287 price point. Once the bears hit this level, the bulls will be able to regain some ground, stabilizing the price on this level in preparation for a bigger breakout.

Several Saga phones on online marketplace eBay (EBAY) have been sold for upward of $2,000 apiece, site data shows. Most of these phones are listed as “sealed and unopened,” and their sellers are predominately from the U.S.  One phone was sold for as high as $5,000, The Block earlier reported.  Sales of Solana Saga phones picked up last week as some arbitrage traders appeared to be chasing a 30 million BONK token airdrop given to every phone owner. The airdrop was worth over $700 at peak last week – for a phone that costs $599.  Earlier in November, the dog-themed BONK gained rapid popularity among blockchain users, spiking as much as 110% during one 24-hour period and extending 30-day gains to over 700%.  That seemingly lifted the fortunes of the Saga phone, whose disappointing sales prompted uncertainty about its future previously  “We haven’t seen a ton of signal whether that’s a compelling enough thing to sell 50,000 units,” Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said during an interview at the time. “I think 25,000 to 50,000 units to feel like there is a hardcore user base for developers to be compelled to ship applications.”  The phone first went on sale earlier this year, and in August, its price was cut to $599 from $1,000.  Saga has since sold out in the U.S. and European Union, Solana co-founder Raj Gokal posted last Friday.",POSITIVE,BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | BONK | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/18/bonks-surge-send-prices-of-solana-saga-phone-flying-to-2k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b34166cb93482dc9e59bda87411f0a6e5b7376a0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
