42384864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlkjL,1602105096,Google Cloud Does Not Intend to Take EOS Rewards as a Block Producer,"Google Cloud is not getting into EOS for the tokens.      ""Google Cloud is not getting into crypto mining. This is really an infrastructure play for us,"" Google Cloud Developer Advocate Allen Day told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.      On Tuesday, Block.one, the company that made the EOSIO software that runs the EOS blockchain, announced Google Cloud had begun preparations to list itself as a candidate to serve as a block producer – one of the 21 nodes chosen by the EOS community to serve effectively the same role as miners on Bitcoin or Ethereum. EOS, however, allows for much faster transactions than either of the two largest blockchains but has been dogged by governance issues.      In Tuesday's release, Day confirmed Google Cloud's intention to declare its candidacy, adding, ""We are committed to ensuring that the information on public blockchains are securely stored, reliably available and can be accessed in meaningful ways.""      In an email to CoinDesk, Day said the partnership comes in the same spirit as the company's February announcement of a partnership with Hedera Hashgraph. Google Cloud also recently became a network validator for Theta Labs, a video content relayer.      Read more: Google Signs On as Network Validator for Blockchain Video Network Theta      When asked if the startup that ran a $4 billion initial coin offering had paid the cloud giant for expressing interest in validating the EOS blockchain, Block.one declined to comment further, redirecting CoinDesk to Tuesday's announcement.      As for Google, Day said, ""We're broadly interested in open-source protocols and distributed ledger technologies, which is why we're joining the EOS community,"" adding:    ""There isn't a revenue model for Google Cloud in connection with participating in open-source protocols. Of course, various protocols provide rewards to incentivize node operators to secure network services, but we don't intend to claim those rewards at this time.""    Day explained that as more companies show interest in participating in this kind of technology, Google Cloud believes it can learn how to better support customers who wish to run validation nodes on projects such as EOS.      ""We're also providing cloud infrastructure to Block.One, helping them host their own development efforts, so that obviously provides revenue to us as well,"" Day wrote.      The Mountain View tech giant did not specifically say whether it would attain network tokens to stake in support of its own candidacy.      ""There is always a bit of a learning curve to participating on these protocols. We can’t comment on our internal strategy or whether we will support other block producer candidates, but we will be working to support our own candidacy as a block producer,"" Day wrote.    Block producers    To support block producer candidacies, each holder of EOS stakes their tokens and then casts their votes in a continuous election for their chosen validators. They can vote for up to 30 block producer candidates and change their votes at basically any time. The top 21 candidates with the most tokens staked in their favor have responsibility for validating transactions and share in the token inflation from EOS.      As of this writing, the least-supported block producer has more than 273 million EOS staked in their favor, or roughly $728 million worth of assets, according to EOS Network Monitor.      Read more: Everyone’s Worst Fears About EOS Are Proving True      Since launching, EOS Block Producers have been more and more likely to share block rewards with those who stake to support their candidacy, which Vitalik Buterin famously foresaw prior to the mainnet launch.      Block.one is one of the largest token holders and it began voting for block producers sometime around late May. At that time, the company controlled a little less than 10% of all EOS, making its support quite powerful for any block producer.    Larimer speaks    In an interview with Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel Tuesday, Block.one co-founder and EOSIO architect Dan Larimer said that Google's participation should allay some of the persistent fears surrounding the world's 14th-largest blockchain by market capitalization.      He said that if Google Cloud's node is elected into a block producer role, that could ""represent a major shift in the decentralization of EOS.""      Larimer went on to speculate that Google's participation might lead other companies to follow its lead. If Google has a good experience, he said:    ""Other big companies will want to get involved. Then that has the potential to really transform the image of EOS. Instead of being perceived as a group of Chinese of questionable quality, if we can get big tech companies to take the slots of block producers, now it's decentralized among a lot of companies with a lot of reputation.""    EOS token price went from $2.50 to $2.88 following the news yesterday, settling back down to around $2.66 as of this writing.      Day declined to indicate a timeline for declaring Google Cloud's block producer candidacy, writing, ""We hope to do so soon.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/07/google-cloud-does-not-intend-to-take-eos-rewards-as-a-block-producer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/773ad03b7f8e7ef8489a8d786ca04b384493351b-1500x1022.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,651 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.66% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,524-$10,683  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price is making gains Wednesday, recovering from a spate of selling Tuesday that coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet calling off stimulus negotiations with lawmakers. Bitcoin was able to hit $10,650 on spot exchange such as Coinbase before settling to $10,651, as of press time.      Read More: Analysts Can’t Agree on What Prompted Big Spike in New Bitcoin Addresses      In its weekly investor note, quantitative trading firm QCP Capital indicated bitcoin’s ability to stay above $10,000 in the face of a less-than-optimistic news cycle is promising. “We’d need to see a break below the key $10,000 level to have any downside follow-through,” QCP stated. “We are likely just treading water and building momentum until after the elections, when we think the coast will then be clear for a new bull trend to develop.” Since early September bitcoin has remained in the $10,000-$11,000 price range.      “The crypto markets are still very highly correlated to traditional markets and the broader economy as a whole,” said Michael Rabkin, head of institutional sales for cryptocurrency market maker DV Chain. “We believe that any time markets tick up or tick down this is exaggerated in crypto. The correlation is still very high.” Bitcoin may be operating in tandem with traditional markets as of late, but its returns over the past month have been beating global stock indexes.      In the options market, traders have over 36,000 BTC in open interest set to expire by Oct. 30.      Based on the probability of those options, bitcoin has a 68% chance of closing out the month over $10,000, a 53% chance of being over $10,500 and just a 37% chance to hit $11,000.      DV Chain’s Rabkin noted that as more sophisticated investors jump into crypto, it may ebb and flow with the traditional market more than ever before. “As bitcoin is becoming a new asset class for institutional market participants, its sensitivity to macro events will rise over time.”    Ethereum high-balance addresses dropping    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was flat Wednesday, trading around $341 and in the red 0.03% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Amid US-China Tech War, Can Neo’s DeFi Stack Rival Ethereum’s?      The number of Ethereum addresses with a balance greater than or equal 1,000 ETH is at a three-year low.

It’s important to note this data from Glassnode don’t include smart contracts, which may help explain why the number of addresses has dropped in 2020. George Clayton, a managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, says many large ether holders are likely moving some of the crypto into smart contract-based DeFi protocols for additional profit opportunities.      “Ethereum believers ought to be DeFi believers as well,” said Clayton. “With billions flowing into DeFi, major ETH holders might be getting in on the action by participating in automated market making pools or staking ERC-20 tokens, thereby reducing ETH balances.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

42384872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlks9,1602102043,"As DeFi Deflates, Ethereum Users Get Reprieve From Soaring Fees, Congestion","A slowdown in cryptocurrency trading on so-called decentralized exchanges has helped to alleviate congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, at least temporarily mitigating concerns that the network was becoming overloaded.      The trading lull comes as prices tumble for many of the hottest tokens from the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi. SushiSwap's SUSHI token, one of this year’s splashiest debuts, has fallen by 77% in the past 30 days, while the DeFi lender Compound’s COMP tokens have lost 37%.      On Uniswap, the biggest decentralized exchange, or DEX, daily trading volumes have crashed to $224 million, versus a record high of $954 million on Sept. 1.      ""Low volatility in the crypto market as a whole has contributed to lower transaction volume and costs,"" said Connor Abendschein, a crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data.      Read More: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      DeFi, a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are developing semi-automated trading and lending platforms atop blockchain networks, had surged in popularity in recent months among investors and traders alike. But the resulting congestion had raised concerns that elevated fees for sending transactions over the blockchain might stymie some users, or push application developers to consider alternative networks.      Total collateral locked into DeFi platforms jumped to a record $11.2 billion in September, from below $2 billion at the end of June, according to the data website DeFi Pulse. The amount has since subsided to about $10 billion.      The pullback has contributed to a drop in Ethereum's daily transaction count to 1.3 million from about 980,000 over the past 2.5 weeks.      And with less traffic on the second-largest blockchain network, congestion has dropped, helping to reduce fee rates that had jumped as users paid up for priority transaction processing.      The average cost of executing a transaction on Ethereum's blockchain has dropped to just above $2, from a record $14.58 on Sept. 2, according to the data firm Glassnode. The rate is still well above the 8-cent level that prevailed around the start of this year.

42384871,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlkpd,1602094321,The Best Blockchain University Programs Actually Pay Students to Learn,"Out of all the universities with blockchain education programs, two stand out by offering students paid opportunities to learn by working.      At MIT and Berkeley, students can take accessible and well-paid jobs at blockchain startups, often for part-time arrangements like 12 hours a week.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 university package. See our exclusive ranking of blockchain universities here.    MIT Bitcoin Club President Nate Foss said his student organization has a dedicated Slack channel for crypto-related job openings. Plus, the MIT Bitcoin Club’s alumni network includes local companies like Skynet Labs, which often hires undergraduates.      “We don’t have any formal programs or pipelines, but plenty of people are at early-stage startups so they reach out to their network,” Foss said.    UC Berkeley    Meanwhile, in California, Blockchain at Berkeley is more formal than a student club but separate from like-minded university research labs. This organization, BaB, is another one of the leading conduits for students seeking Silicon Valley jobs.      BaB is mostly self-funded and student-run, thanks to a consulting service utilized by companies like Qualcomm, ExxonMobil, Ford and PG&E.      “It gives our members experience in the industry and to make an impact they can see by the time the semester is over,” said Katherine Plotz, head of business development at BaB.      See also: CoinDesk U - The Top Universities for Blockchain      Dozens of club alumni launched crypto companies since BaB started in 2016. The startup Opyn, which raised $2.16 million earlier this year, the venture fund Dekrypt Capital and the feminist advocacy group She265 are just a few examples founded by alumni. Several BaB members said they know friends who raised venture capital and dropped out of school. But, for those who stay in school and work part-time, there are many unique opportunities.      “I’ve only taken one computer science class at Berkeley, yet I work as a software engineer for a payments company in the blockchain lab,” said BaB co-President Liam DiGregorio. “I took the BaB developers course and I got the job because of the reputation that BaB brings.”      BaB helps run student-led courses, including the “Blockchain Fundamentals” edX course reaching more than 160,000 students over the past two years, plus a separate accelerator program. Since more students are now looking for online courses, BaB is expanding these open source offerings in 2020.      “I did quite a bit of blockchain work in high school and ended up interning at a blockchain-focused venture fund,” said Alpin Yukseloglu, director of fundraising for the Berkeley Blockchain accelerator. “The person I was working for said Berkeley had the best blockchain programs. I was applying on the East Coast as well. [BaB] was a pretty big factor in terms of deciding which university to go to.”      This industry-centric approach stands in stark contrast to the student culture at MIT, where bitcoin enthusiasts learn how to work with bankers and lawmakers on projects like central bank digital currencies.    MIT effect    Over on the East Coast, MIT is perhaps home to one of the least shilly crypto cultures.      Much like BaB alumni, members say MIT Bitcoin Club participants have a higher propensity for dropping out to launch startups than their peers in other sectors. Since the pandemic started, some universities are also being more flexible about students taking a leave of absence. Such is the case with MIT’s Nate Foss, who recently finished his undergrad studies and is now taking a break before starting an MIT graduate program focused on distributed systems.      He didn’t even know what bitcoin was before 2017; now, his passion for this technology has completely reshaped his world view. Foss has pastel-dyed hair and speaks fluent crypto-believer.    I’ve only taken one computer science class at Berkeley, yet I work as a software engineer for a payments company in the blockchain lab.    “We’re all set on building a decentralized metaverse,” he said, describing the startup Gather he is co-founding with three friends, including another MIT student. “It would be quite a shame if we could monopolize it the way Apple monopolizes iPhones. … The thing we want to build is an open platform that anyone can build on. We don’t control it. We just facilitate the underlying protocol.”      This startup doesn’t have anything to do with cryptocurrency, because Foss isn’t a fan of superfluous marketing widgets, but it does relate to the core ethos he learned from the Bitcoin community. MIT’s campus culture is more focused on bitcoin or conservative distributed systems than token trends. And, despite being president of a decade-old bitcoin club, one of the most influential networking groups in the nation, Foss said MIT’s scene isn’t a student-driven culture like BaB. It is research-driven.      He said MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, led by director Neha Narula, is the most influential organization on campus. Narula is involved with several projects and forums related to central bank experiments. This year the research center is working with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, among other projects.      “Tons of club members have worked with them on undergraduate research opportunities,” Foss said. “These are usually for pay for credits, but most people go with pay.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/07/the-best-blockchain-university-programs-actually-pay-students-to-learn,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bd0ca4f43ad5c5b1e25add6984979438275ab1b-1420x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xRh,1602088185,"Blockchain Bites: Crypto's Top Universities, Bitcoin's New Addresses, MetaMask's Token Swaps","Making consensus  Featured panel    CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us.      The Top Shelf news you subscribed to is down below.      Now, a few words from CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper.      Centralized stablecoins      Stablecoin use on DeFi applications has exploded in 2020.      Approximately $20 billion of crypto dollars are floating around, and a few billion of these have found their way into the ether by way of yield farming and lending. Even Ethereum’s flagship DeFi application, MakerDAO, is flooded with USDC, making the stablecoin the largest collateral for Maker’s DAI stablecoin.      That’s right, a stablecoin is the primary collateral for another stablecoin. That’s how deep crypto dollars go into DeFi’s liquidity. Outside of Maker, DAI, USDC, TUSD and USDT are the most popular pools on Aave, with a collective market size of $650 million. Uniswap has roughly $780 million in USDC, USDT and DAI staked in market pools. On Compound, DAI and USDC are the first and third most popular markets with a staggering $1.4 billion locked.  As crypto dollars liquidity floods DeFi markets, will these tokens, which are centrally issued, threaten these application’s presumed decentralization? With bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX facing legal actions from U.S. regulators, questions have floated whether exchanges like Uniswap should worry about being targeted next.      Most DeFi proponents argue the “decentralized nature” of the exchange will excuse it from scrutiny. While the act of trading these assets may be considered decentralized, the assets themselves (namely, stablecoins) are not always decentralized. USDC, USDT, TUSD and PAX can be frozen and revoked by their central issuers.      If regulators wanted to come for DeFi, one weak point could be the stablecoin providers. This would even have implications for DAI, Ethereum’s so-called decentralized stablecoin, considering the bulk of its collateral comes from USDC.      Crypto dollars are obviously beneficial to DeFi’s market structure for the price stability they provide. This is largely why they have taken over as the dominant source of liquidity (even over ETH) in most markets.      But they are inherently centralized entities, and it remains to be seen how regulators are going to approach their use in DeFi lending and DeFi markets in general. This finally raises the question: Do stablecoins threaten DeFi’s perceived decentralization?      At CoinDesk’s virtual invest: ethereum economy program on Oct. 14, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Aave Finance founder Stani Kulechov will discuss how integral stablecoins have become for DeFi in their talk “Stablecoins, Hyper-Collateralization and the DeFi Economy.”      Looking beyond this question, stablecoin use in yield farming and elsewhere has contributed to Ethereum’s skyrocketing fees. MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen and Near protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin will discuss DeFi’s impact on Ethereum in their talk “The Fees are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum To its Limit.”      One may ask, how stable is a crypto ecosystem built atop stablecoins?  -Colin Harper      Frontends: Winning the Race for the DeFi User The emergence of new infrastructure such as automated market makers, portfolio managers and aggregation tools has kick-started an arms race for end users.

Weird DeFi Ethereum’s highly anticipated 2.0 upgrade is poised to bring the network ever closer to fulfilling its original vision to be a “world computer” that plays host to a parallel, decentralized financial system.      At invest: ethereum economy on Oct. 14, we will address the ramifications for investors as decentralized finance takes the crypto world by storm.      In a run-up to the event, our two-part CoinDesk Live: Inside the Ethereum Economy virtual miniseries on Oct. 8 and Oct. 12 introduces trending narratives we will break down at the main event: Why all the hype behind yield farming and food-inspired tokens? Should investors take them seriously or are they a fading trend?      On Oct. 8, CoinDesk senior business reporter Brady Dale hosts Priyanka Desai of Open Law, Mason Nystrom of Messari and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX to assess the newest crazes sweeping the DeFi landscape.      Watch DeGeneration: How Ethereum Is Making Finance Weird on Oct. 8.    Ethereum 101    Decentralized finance (DeFi) has seen explosive growth in 2020. This time last year, the total value locked (TVL, a way to quantify how much capital is following through the various decentralized protocols) was around $530 million. Today, there’s more than $10 billion sloshing around.      In February, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale covered the moment the ecosystem crossed the $1 billion milestone, opening the door to further heights and raising questions about its longevity. Here’s why that mattered:      $1B moment It was only December when the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) market was worth less than $700 million. [On Feb. 7,] it hit $1 billion, a figure that even the most fervent blockchain skeptics would have a tough time dismissing as meaningless.      That figure is the measure of all the crypto held in projects that lend, hedge, abstract, swap or otherwise make structured bets using ethereum’s smart-contract powers, as totaled by DeFi Pulse.      To be clear, $1 billion is not how much money people are making on DeFi, but how much they have committed. Their “locked-in” collateral is used on various protocols to make a wide array of bets, from simple loans to complex derivatives.      “It proves that people around the world want access to more efficient, less biased, money,” Rune Christensen, the creator of DeFi leader MakerDAO, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.      Investor Spencer Noon of DTC Capital struck a similar note in an email to CoinDesk:      ""No other smart contract platform comes close in terms of its developer mindshare, tooling and infrastructure, to the point where I don’t believe DeFi could exist anywhere else today. And perhaps most surprisingly, we’re finally seeing a credible case for ETH to accrue a long-term monetary premium as the only truly trustless collateral type in decentralized finance.""      But nothing big happens on Ethereum without Bitcoin diehards mocking it. In this case, former bitcoin developer Peter Todd weighed in, tweeting, “Decentralized smart contracts can’t hold people accountable for debt. For that you need guns.”      And rapid growth doesn’t always continue. For comparison, Kickstarter, the leading crowdfunding site, launched in 2009. It hit $1 billion in pledges in 2014. Six years later, it still hasn’t quite touched $5 billion.      Still, DeFi got there a lot quicker, and it’s much more complex than crowdfunding.      Ryan Sean Adams, a crypto investor and ETH booster on Twitter, tweeted the news, writing: “Software eating money. Software eating banks. The next decade will be wild.”      - Brady Dale    At stake    Of course, much of this explosive growth was prefigured by the success of the decentralized lending platform MakerDAO. One of the earliest DeFi protocols, how Maker works still boggles many minds.      CoinDesk’s multimedia team broke down how “the Godzilla of DeFi” creates DAI, why stablecoin interest rates fluctuate and what it means to collateralize crypto in this video from 2019.      Making MakerDAO Stablecoins. The name is a bit of a misnomer. In theory, stablecoin prices are pegged to various fiat currencies or hard monies, like gold or silver, in an effort to keep the crypto tokens price, you guessed it, stable.      The benefits to a business that a stable token could provide are great. A stablecoin makes finance far easier than a volatile coin. Since the price is predictable, budgeting becomes less of a headache. But in practice this is a tough solution to make work. Take dai (DAI) for instance, the stablecoin designed by the Ethereum project MakerDAO.      In the last four years MakerDAO has become the most popular decentralized finance application on Ethereum. The MakerDAO project includes two tokens: MKR and dai: Dai is the stablecoin, MKR is the governance token.      While both tokens can be purchased directly on exchanges, dai is created when users of the system lock up ether (ETH). When users lock up ETH they can withdraw dai, which maintains a soft peg to the U.S. dollar.      Users can withdraw up to two thirds of the value of ether that was locked up. So someone depositing three hundred in ETH at today's prices could then borrow up to around 50,000 dai, which would be worth roughly $50,000.      Yet, because the price of ether fluctuates so much, the MakerDAO system encourages users to over-collateralize. Meaning they'll have to lock in more ether than they'll get back in dai.      Much like a traditional credit card, dai loans accrue interest. In January of 2019, the interest rate, or stability fee, for a dai loan, was 0.5%. Sounds like a good interest rate compared to what banks offer.      Fluctuations But that low rate hasn't remained. Over the spring of 2019, dai interest rates have fluctuated dramatically. Dai's price is kept one-to-one with the dollar by backing the token with an equal amount of debt. If there is more dai in the world than the market demands, an oversupply, the price will drop. So the system began to adjust by increasing the interest rate on all borrowers in order to encourage them to pay down part of the amount they took a loan for or close the line of credit altogether.      When people pay down their debt they pay it with dai, that dai gets burned or destroyed, which contracts the overall supply. A smaller supply should drive the price back up.      In order to close a loan, the user can only repay the principal with dai. They have to repay the interest accrued in MKR, both those coins are then burned as debt gets retired. Dai is destroyed because dai is only backed by debt. So without that debt in the ecosystem those coins are not needed. MKR is destroyed as an incentive for the MakerDAO community.      A dai loan could also be liquidated automatically. Should a person's collateral dip below the minimum 150% collateralization, the system will liquidate their ETH holdings with a 13% penalty fee. That's on top of the interest owed as well.      It's a fee big enough few users want to get hit with. This is why rapid increases in the interest rates has been so controversial.      DAOs and decision makers So who decides when to increase the interest rate and by how much. To explain that we have to explain one more concept: decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs.      The idea of the DAO is that lots and lots of people can manage and run an organization taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowd to make the optimal choice.      MakerDAO is a programmatic loan system but it's also a DAO, governed by people who hold its MKR token. They get to decide on things like the interest rate, how much of one type of loan can be issued and more.      The MKR token has been attractive to hold: As long as people keep taking out dai loans and repaying them, the value should go up as MKR tokens get burned and interest is repaid.      Holding MKR also gives participants the chance to be a decision maker in an interesting new kind of financial organization. Collectively these people pay attention to the price of DAI and decide whether or not the interest rate needs to go up and down.      As pioneers of a new financial instrument there's not much prior data for MKR holders to draw on to make an optimal decision. Nevertheless, as of this recording dai's price appears to have returned to a steady dollar valuation across major cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks.      In that way MakerDAO functions as one of the best versions of a decentralized autonomous organization the industry can point to so far.      – Christine Kim, Brady Dale and Bailey Reutzel    The ledger    Snap back to 2020 again and you can see how much the ecosystem has evolved. MakerDAO is just one of many multi-billion dollar protocols. A range of other lending, trading and minting tools have either launched or finally gained tractions.      Last month, during the heady days of the “Weird DeFi” moment, my former colleague Leigh Cuen wrote about the“normies” getting filthy rich using this ecosystem of products.      Making money Ethereum whales undoubtedly drive the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement, but many people making money on DeFi trends are just regular Joes, so to speak.      One such trader, Joe, is a math student at a Canadian university. Just by playing with Ethereum software and his own calculations, he managed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2020. This wasn’t his first rodeo, however; he’s been trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for more than a year.      “I’m not a whale in the crypto world but I’m one of the top users of the DeFi protocol I use,” he said. “Before, when DeFi was smaller, there was a lot less competition.”      Since Weird DeFi’s food craze began, Joe said “high yields” are now available to newcomers “without a lot of technical knowledge.”      DeFi infrastructure The DeFi mentality emphasizes open-source access to tools, services with low barriers to entry and distributed teams. Sometimes, this includes low barriers to entry for high-risk games.      According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams in June 2020, most of the Uniswap ecosystem relies on ConsenSys infrastructure services, like Infura. This has also proven to be the common pattern for copycat DeFi projects like SushiSwap. ConsenSys spokesperson James Beck said the Ethereum conglomerate restructured to make infrastructure and wallet services, like Infura and the DeFi-friendly wallet MetaMask, pillars of the company’s “core software business.”      ConsenSys’ head of product for Infura, Michael Godsey, said his team handled the “increased usage” from the food-themed yield farming spike, watching closely to understand “these new usage patterns.” Such DeFi experiments provide inspiration and research data for Ethereum startups, not chagrin.      In reference to the DEX tools people use to access these trading games, Godsey added, “Uniswap and MetaMask are two of our amazing customers and many yield farmers are utilizing their platform to participate in this new activity.”      As for Joe, the Canadian college student, he said he plans to keep stacking tokens because the broader DeFi movement is “sustainable and has been growing at a relatively slow pace for years.”      On the other hand, he said the trends over the past few months were heavily influenced by Compound’s token model. Joe reasoned these DeFi experiments might end in a “big crash” or slow fizzle.      “As long as risk-adjusted yield is higher than for other opportunities, I will keep using them,” he said.      – Leigh Cuen    Top shelf    U.S. constraints Ripple Executive Chairman Chris Larsen threatened to pull his fintech firm out of the U.S. if what he termed the country’s hostile stance toward cryptocurrency companies does not soon change, according to Fortune. Ripple is battling investor allegations that XRP is a security as well as mixed signals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Larsen acknowledged that Ripple's leaving the U.S. would do little to stop top-line federal regulatory oversight but said a softer host government would nonetheless help, adding nearly every other country has a better handling of crypto than the U.S. Larsen named Singapore and the U.K. as possible countries to rebase in.      New addresses Bitcoin has seen a rapid rise in the creation of new addresses on the blockchain so far this month, with one industry executive saying it’s likely due to traders moving funds off the legally troubled BitMEX exchange. Others point elsewhere. Glassnode’s ""entities net growth"" metric rose sharply by 244% from 9,750 to 33,620 in the first six days of October. The surge in new entities picked up pace in the wake of BitMEX’s legal woes users' panicked migration of funds to other exchanges. However, on-chain analyst Cole Garner said the spike probably represents an entry of new investors into the market, because the growth in new entities has kept pace, even after BitMEX withdrawals slowed.      CoinDesk U CoinDesk researched and assembled a ranking of universities that provide the best blockchain education. This in-depth analysis measured the school’s scholarly impact, post-graduation job prospects and campus blockchain offerings – as well as survey responses – to determine the 46 top U.S. universities. Topping the list are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Cornell University; University of California, Berkeley; Stanford University and Harvard University. Many smaller regional, or liberal arts, universities also made the list. Read the full methodology.      Digital yuan An official for China’s central bank has unveiled usage statistics of state-backed digital currency trials that were conducted in three Chinese cities. Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said on Monday the bank opened 113,300 consumer digital wallets and 8,859 corporate digital wallets for residents of Shenzhen, Suzhou and Xiong’an to pilot a digital yuan. The digital wallets processed RMB 1.1 billion ($162 million) across 3.1 million digital yuan transactions between April and August when the pilots launched and ended, Fan said, making it the most widely used central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a commercial setting.      Token swaps MetaMask announced a new feature Tuesday: token swaps directly within the popular Ethereum browser extension and mobile application. The token-swapping feature will release first on its Firefox browser extension, before adding extensions for other browsers and MetaMask mobile. Up to now, to make a swap of tokens, an Ethereum user would need to go to the website of a specific decentralized exchange or exchange aggregator, sign in and run the swap. By building a token-swapping function into MetaMask itself, it should improve the user experience by automatically routing users to a service, cutting out a step.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich, speaking to the Atlantic Council during a digital seminar on trans-Atlantic economic relations, said the administration is studying a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) tied to the dollar, alongside the Federal Reserve, the U.S.’ central bank.      “It’s something we’re studying … [T]his is really a decision which sits as much with the Fed as it does with Treasury,” he said.      Muzinich noted the Boston branch of the Federal Reserve is already evaluating CBDCs, pointing to Governor Lael Brainard’s recent comments and the group’s work with MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative to research different technologies.      The Boston Fed has confirmed it’s evaluating a potential CBDC, though it may take years to proceed.

So there are a variety of factors that we are thinking through,” he said.    Regulating crypto    During prepared remarks prior to the Q&A, Muzinich also said the U.S. and Europe must cooperate in regulating cryptocurrencies.      “Cryptocurrencies are a fascinating topic, because they have implications not only for private business but also for a number of activities,” he said.

However, he said the government would be concerned by the fact that cryptocurrencies can be used to evade anti-money laundering (AML) rules. There are also monetary base and financial stability concerns.

Even digital currency efforts that comply with the spirit and letter of AML laws might raise concerns, such as if a stablecoin shifts from being fully reserved to being partially reserved or decides to change the makeup of its underlying basket of reserve currencies.      “This could alter money supply or cause financial disruption when such a decision is being made by a private governing association, or by a majority of coin holders,” Muzinich said. “What if foreign actors had acquired a majority of the coins?

A spokesperson for the derivatives exchange told CoinDesk that, despite the significant withdrawals, “It is business as usual for the BitMEX platform.”  Total BTC held on BitMEX addresses dropped from 192,986 BTC on Sept. 30 to 135,619 BTC Tuesday, a 29.73% decline, according to data provided by Coin Metrics.  Aggregate open interest for BitMEX BTC futures also took a hit in the past week, falling by over $100 million from $732 million on Sept. 30.  The “fundamentals” of the exchange “remain strong,” however, according the spokesperson, specifically BitMEX's “resilient open interest and liquidity.”  On-chain transaction data reviewed by CoinDesk suggests that much of the withdrawn coins were deposited to addresses at Binance, which also prohibits American users, and U.S.-based Gemini and Kraken.  Even though customers are withdrawing coins, one BitMEX balance that is not shrinking is the exchange's Insurance Fund, a pool of funds nominally used to prevent auto-deleveraging of traders’ positions.  Since Thursday, the fund has grown by nearly 20 BTC (or over $200,000) to 36,588 BTC (or over $388 million), by far the largest insurance fund of any cryptocurrency derivatives exchange.

42432882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1x7h,1602083225,Coinbase's 'Mission' Violates the Spirit of Bitcoin,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently sparked a firestorm by announcing his company would now be “apolitical.”      In a memo posted on Medium, Armstrong argued that political divisions were undermining productivity, and Coinbase should remain laser-focused on its mission. The company then offered severance packages, giving employees until Wednesday, Oct. 7 to send a form signaling their interest. Staying at Coinbase would indicate you are on board with the company’s new direction, Armstrong wrote.    Emily Parker is CoinDesk's Global Macro Editor.    Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey pushed back on the memo, pointing out that Armstrong’s position is incongruous with Bitcoin, which is direct activism at an exclusionary financial system. In response, Armstrong said: “We are political about one thing: our mission. (This includes Bitcoin, crypto, economic freedom, etc.)”      Armstrong would like to have it both ways. He wants to be apolitical about the disruptions that make him uncomfortable, but political about Bitcoin’s mission to disrupt the world. This position is not only somewhat incoherent, it undermines the core principles of Bitcoin.      Here are a few reasons why.    Bitcoin is value-neutral    It is not controlled by any government or political party. It is designed to be resistant to censorship and cannot be shut down. It can be embraced by freedom fighters and money launderers, human rights activists and scammers, liberals and conservatives alike.      Yes, as Dorsey points out, Bitcoin is meant to disrupt the status quo – i.e., the power of banks and the traditional financial system. At the same time, Bitcoin aims to change the world without pledging allegiance to any political camp. So in that sense, Bitcoin is apolitical.      Hear Emily Parker discuss this column with Jill Carlson and Ben Schiller on the Opinionated podcast:      Armstrong’s position is nothing like this. Rather, he is pushing for a status quo that many Americans, including his own employees, are actively rejecting. You can disagree with those employees or dislike their tactics, but it is illogical to say their position is political while Armstrong’s is not.      This post by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk sums up Armstrong’s stance: “Political apathy is not a neutral stance, but a strongly conservative one, almost by definition. When there are competing forces, one trying to pull you in [one] direction and another forcing you to stay where you are, saying that you'd rather not move is picking a side, not removing yourself from the equation.”      Unlike Bitcoin, Armstrong’s mission is not value-neutral. It is advocacy disguised as neutrality.    Bitcoin is censorship-resistant    The beauty of Bitcoin’s decentralized technology is that it can’t be shut down by any person or entity. Bitcoin makes governments nervous, and for good reason. It gives individuals power over their own money in a way that can dilute the power of the state. In countries like Russia, where political dissidents are targets of bank freezes, Vladimir Putin's opponents use bitcoin to raise funds. The Kremlin doesn’t like it but it doesn’t have the ability to shut the Bitcoin network down. China has cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges and public sales but has not been able to stop people from buying and selling bitcoin.    Unlike Bitcoin, Armstrong’s mission is not value-neutral. It is advocacy disguised as neutrality.    Censorship resistance is not the spirit behind Armstrong’s memo, which is a top-down directive that declares: “We won’t debate causes or political candidates internally that are unrelated to work.” Clearly, not all employees are on board with this direction, and some appear to have different ideas about which causes are “related to work.”      According to reporting by Wired, the memo has left Coinbase employees confused about which topics are off-limits. Rather than say clearly what you can and can’t say, Coinbase has issued a vague edict that will cause people to curb their own speech. Often, they will err on the side of excessive caution. At the risk of sounding melodramatic, creating an atmosphere of self-censorship is a classic authoritarian tactic.      See also: Coinbase Offers Severance Package to Employees Unsatisfied With ‘Apolitical’ Mission      Armstrong’s argument is that the company can’t focus on everything, and he is just trying to cut out noise that distracts the company from its larger mission. Some may be sympathetic to this position but it’s hard to call it censorship-resistant.    Bitcoin cuts out the intermediary    Bitcoin was created to be a decentralized form of money that cuts out the intermediary.      Just look at the Bitcoin white paper. Satoshi Nakomoto wrote: “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.”      Armstrong’s memo highlights an awkward truth about Coinbase: Rather than disrupting the third party, Coinbase is that third party. Far from being a punk rock “disruptor,” Coinbase is a centralized financial institution. While bitcoin is supposed to be a relatively private form of money, setting up a Coinbase account feels a lot like setting up a bank account, and the company knows a great deal about you.      See also: Coinbase Employees Have Begun to Take Severance Packages      Coinbase has not consistently adhered to Bitcoin’s ideals of freedom and privacy. One well-known example was its acquisition of the spyware firm Neutrino, which sparked a #deletecoinbase campaign.      This battle for the soul of crypto is much bigger than Coinbase itself. Some compromises may be necessary for Bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption, but where do you draw the line? At what point does Bitcoin lose the characteristics that made it special in the first place?      Bitcoin is revolutionary. It was born in the wake of the global financial crisis, with an explicit mission to disrupt the banking system. It allows billions of dollars to flow around the world without government oversight. And revolutions, especially decentralized ones, tend to be messy. Coinbase is trying to embrace disruption in some areas while chilling it in others, based on a CEO’s judgment over which disruptions are more important.      For better or worse, Coinbase plays an outsized role in the cryptocurrency industry, which is why the memo is getting so much attention. So when Armstrong claims that his mission is about “Bitcoin,” it’s worth asking what that really means.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/07/coinbases-mission-violates-the-spirit-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c8f7b6f904b0545db9db961bd1b7fe5f635ac4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xNh,1602083133,Bitcoin Correlations Depend on What Phase It Is In,"Bitcoin has multiple long-term and short-term variables that affect its price, and many folks debate what its major correlations are, if any. It turns out, the same factors that affect bitcoin’s price – real rates of inflation, monetary and fiscal policy and market exuberance – also partially determine to which assets bitcoin is correlated.      Over the long run since its launch, increasing user adoption, ever-strengthening security and the widening network effect have propelled bitcoin’s market capitalization to greater and greater heights. Those are the long-term variables.    Lyn Alden is the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.    The halving periods tend to act as fundamental catalysts for the next bull market within this long-term trend, as new supply gets cut in half while incoming demand remains robust. As long as that demand indeed remains strong, upward pressure builds on its price, and then when it eventually breaks out, momentum traders hop on board with a new influx of demand and drive it up further.      All pre-programmed halving events occurred during periods where bitcoin had been off from its all-time highs for at least a year, and usually more than one year. On the other hand, the year after a halving has always been great for its price, without exception so far (albeit with a very small sample size), and has eventually led to the next blow-off top and a period of consolidation.      See also: Noelle Acheson – Crypto Long & Short: How Bitcoin Correlations Drive the Narrative      During those long consolidations, bitcoin becomes more correlated to short-term variables related to global liquidity and other risk assets. This becomes especially true as it reaches wider adoption and is invested in by the financial community. Basically, the ongoing debates about the degree to which bitcoin is correlated to other assets would do well to break bitcoin’s price behavior into two phases: bull runs and consolidation periods.      If we look at percent drawdowns in bitcoin compared to drawdowns in the S&P 500, for example, we can see a lot of correlation over the past two years in this consolidation phase, particularly when sharp drawdowns occur and investors broadly de-risk their holdings.      More interestingly, during bitcoin’s consolidation period, it acts a lot like digital gold.      Gold investors have long since known that the single biggest variable for gold price movements has historically been real interest rates. Real interest rates measure the difference between a “risk free” yield, like the 10-year Treasury rate, and the prevailing inflation rate or expected forward inflation rate.      Whenever real rates go lower, especially if they turn negative, gold tends to spike in price. On the other hand, when real rates rise, gold usually suffers. The period from 1980-2000 was particularly bad for gold because real rates were strongly positive for the entire duration.      This relationship is due to the opportunity cost of holding gold. Gold is a scarce but yield-less asset and has fees for minting, verifying, purchasing, transportation and secure storage. When bank accounts and Treasury bonds pay a yield much higher than the prevailing inflation rate, your purchasing power can grow within the fiat system.      On the other hand, when bank accounts and Treasury bonds no longer keep up with inflation and are being debased with negative real yields, the opportunity cost for gold vanishes. Its inherently inflation-protected “zero yield” becomes a lot more attractive.    System-wide debt and wealth concentration, unfolding in the backdrop of civil unrest and slow growth will keep pressuring policymakers to stimulate.    Over the past two years, we can see that bitcoin behaved in a similar way during its consolidation phase. This chart shows the inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury rate in blue on the left axis and the year-over-year percent change in the price of bitcoin in red on the right axis.      See also: Nathaniel Whittemore – Why Bitcoin Investors Aren’t Worried About This Price Pullback      Real Treasury yields peaked in late 2018 and have been on a multi-year downtrend into negative territory. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price has been in a volatile rebound from the depths it experienced in late 2018 and early 2019.      In this period, whenever real yields stalled or reversed upward bitcoin’s price usually would either stall or reverse downward. The same phenomenon continued into the second half of 2019 and increased sharply in March 2020 during the deflationary shock. Most recently, it has occurred gradually since the beginning of September 2020.      There are multiple reasons that real yields can change direction and it particularly depends on what part of the yield curve we are looking at. Longer-term rates are mostly controlled by the market. For instance, inflation expectations were on the uptrend this year from their March lows due to stimulus, but stalled and rolled over at the beginning of September when second-round stimulus talks weren’t going well.      Due to where we are in the long-term debt cycle and current trends of currency debasement, most of the developed world (and particularly the U.S.) is likely to experience negative real yields for its bank savers and sovereign bondholders for quite some time. This won’t be a linear process; there will likely be occasional political gridlocks on stimulus, deflationary shocks and other roadblocks, but the trend itself is almost inevitable. System-wide debt and wealth concentration, unfolding in the backdrop of civil unrest and slow growth will keep pressuring policymakers to stimulate.      Going forward, bitcoin’s price is likely to continue to be affected in the near-term by stimulus outcomes, and consequently shifts in inflation expectations and real yields. Thus, it could very well be correlated to some extent with other risk assets and inflation hedges, like stocks and precious metals.      See also: Nico Cordeiro – Why the Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Valuation Model Is Wrong      Over the past month, fundamentals have served as a headwind for these various assets, including bitcoin, because we’ve been in one of these gridlock, counter-trend, no-stimulus, rising-real-yield periods.      However, when fundamentals turn back into a tailwind, likely due to another stimulus bill being passed and a renewed decline in real rates at some point, bitcoin likely has a lot more upside potential than similar asset classes. The network effect for the protocol remains very strong, and whenever it breaks out to new highs, momentum investors and institutional money have plenty of capacity to propel its market capitalization upwards.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyn Alden,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/07/bitcoin-correlations-depend-on-what-phase-it-is-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37073a37fd6f0b305f29f3515008634a192d8a23-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1wth,1602075608,New Non-Custodial Crypto Exchange 'Brings Bitfinex Liquidity to EOS',"Eosfinex, a non-custodial digital asset exchange, has launched a beta version of its mainnet, saying it brings liquidity from the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange to the EOS community.    Direct access to Bitfinex's liquid markets will provide an opportunity to ""economically"" trade large orders of EOS, tether (USDT) and other cryptos, Eosfinex product lead Steven Quinn said in a press release Wednesday.  The beta mainnet launch is said to enable off-chain order matching while retaining custody and settlement on-chain.  This would increase the speed of trades since they are not tied to (sometimes tardy) block confirmation times.  The usual large-cap digital assets will be supported including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and stablecoin tether, Eosfinex spokesperson Chi Zhao told CoinDesk via email.  Eosfinex – which is built on EOSIO technology – will also offer Equilibrium (EOSDT), Everipedia (IQ) and interoperability bridging assets known as pTokens at launch.  The firm said the launch would help solve the issue of illiquidity in token trading for the EOS community, which it called a ""major obstacle to growth.""  In addition, Eosfinex said it will stake assets on behalf of users, ""covering the costs of network resources for traders.""  This would free up users' locked EOS tokens on the network, further increasing liquidity within the EOS ecosystem, Zhao said.  Verification of an Eosfinex account is not mandatory to trade or transact with its various digital assets; it features a three-tiered system of individual authentication levels.  According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitfinex is the sixth-largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

42432891,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xPh,1602075350,First Mover: Bitcoin Steady as Trump Tweets and Neo Takes on Ethereum,"Chinese tech companies were once seen as copycats of their Western peers: Alibaba was a knockoff of eBay and Baidu imitated Google. More recently, Chinese firms like TikTok and Huawei have established such dominant international positions that U.S. authorities have tried to hold them back.      Now, the technological arms race is playing out in the cryptocurrency industry, where one Chinese company is taking on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain, which U.S.-based developers have used to build semi-automated trading and lending networks under the rubric of decentralized finance, or DeFi.      Neo took aim at DeFi in late September with its launch of a new platform called Flamingo. Da Hongfei, a Neo co-founder, told CoinDesk in an interview the protocol will eventually provide users with features found on popular Ethereum-based projects like Uniswap, Curve Finance, yearn.finance and Synthetix.      Flamingo is not simply a product of “copy and paste,” the co-founder said in an interview. “It’s like rebuilding a parallel universe.”      - Muyao Shen      Read More: Amid US-China Tech War, Can Neo’s DeFi Stack Rival Ethereum’s?    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin defended the psychological support of $10,500 early Wednesday as Asian stocks shrugged off overnight weakness on Wall Street, reducing haven demand for the U.S. dollar.      European stocks, too, are trading higher at press time alongside gains in the S&P 500 futures.      Risk sentiment, which weakened Tuesday following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abort the fiscal stimulus negotiations, was restored earlier today after he reversed course and urged Congress to approve a series of coronavirus relief measures, including a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks.      That said, a large-scale stimulus is unlikely to come through any time soon. As such, both bitcoin and stocks may have a tough time scoring significant gains.      Indeed, minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, due at 18:00 GMT, are expected to reiterate tolerance for high inflation. That dovish message, however, has already been priced in by markets.      For now, the cryptocurrency remains trapped in a narrowing price range. Contracting triangles usually end with violent moves on either side.      Growth in the new bitcoin addresses has recently picked up. According to blockchain analyst Cole Garner, that has bullish implications for price. However, according to Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium & EOSDT stablecoin, the address growth has been fueled, at least in part, by the recent mass exodus of bitcoins from controversial crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX to other major exchanges like Kraken, Binance, and Gemini.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Analysts Can’t Agree What Prompted Big Spike in New Bitcoin Addresses    Token Watch    XRP (XRP): With Ripple executives threatening relocation from the U.S., volatility could be expected for the world's fourth-largest crypto by market cap.

42432889,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xJh,1602071717,Analysts Can't Agree on What Prompted Big Spike in New Bitcoin Addresses,"Bitcoin has seen a rapid rise in the creation of addresses on the blockchain so far this month, with one industry executive saying it's likely due to traders moving funds off the legally troubled BitMEX exchange. Others point elsewhere.    The ""entities net growth"" metric from analytics firm Glassnode, which measures the daily change in unique entities or clusters of addresses controlled by a single participant, rose sharply by 244% from 9,750 to 33,620 in the first six days of October.  Tuesday's tally of 33,620 was the highest since Oct. 3, 2018.  The surge in new entities noticeably picked up the pace in the wake of U.S. authorities' recent decision to bring civil and criminal charges against cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform BitMEX and users' resulting panicked migration of funds to other exchanges.  BitMEX has witnessed an outflow of at least 40,000 BTC (worth around $424 million at press time) since the charges were announced on Oct. 1.  Many of these coins have migrated to addresses belonging to major exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Gemini, and a good number of these addresses have been newly generated, according to Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin.  ""That has been a viable reason for the spike in new entities,"" Melikhov told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  However, on-chain analyst Cole Garner disagrees, saying the spike in new entities probably represents an entry of new investors into the market and has little to do with the BitMEX issue.  That's because the metric has continued to rise over the past five days even though BitMEX withdrawals cooled following an initial spike from Oct. 1–2.  ""If BitMEX were responsible for address growth, the metric would have moved in lockstep with the outflow of funds from the exchange,"" Garner tweeted Tuesday.  Melikhov countered that bitcoin's flat price undermined that argument, adding, ""If new investors entered market, the cryptocurrency would have rallied."".  A third theory making the rounds is that Chinese media's recent and unusual reports calling cryptocurrency the year's best-performing asset maybe have caused local investors to put some cash into the bitcoin market.  Melikhov said that was a more speculative theory.  The cryptocurrency is trading near $10,600 at press time, having faced rejection near $10,800 on Tuesday.

42432879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1wzh,1602067526,"Huobi, Dragonfly, Coinbase Invest $500K in New DEX With Alternative Oracle Solutions","Decentralized exchange CoFiX, which aims to offer more accurate and less costly trading with a new oracle solution, has raised half a million dollars from several crypto investors including Huobi’s DeFi Labs, Dragonfly Capital and Coinbase Ventures.      Many existing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Uniswap and Compound use oracles that rely on external data from centralized exchanges and other DEXs to provide price feeds on-chain.      See Also: Coinbase's 'Mission' Violates the Spirit of Bitcoin      This process can create a deviation between oracle price and the actual market price, where arbitrage trading occurs during price discovery and liquidity pool rebalancing. Traders and market makers will bear the arbitrage cost.      However, CoFiX claims to have better token price feeds based on a pricing mechanism derived from a decentralized price oracle called NEST and the DEX’s risk-assessment model.      In NEST Protocol, miners receive NEST token rewards by paying commissions and providing price quotations, while verifiers profit from the difference between miners’ quotations and market price. Thus, CoFiX said, the protocol can have a set of financial parameters to verify prices and generate arbitrage-free price feeds.      CoFiX will also factor in other price risks such as time via a mathematical model. In particular, it receives a market price ""P"" from NEST and factors a risk coefficient ""K"" into P to account for time delay and volatility. The platform then produces a new reference price that traders and market makers refer to when making transactions.      “CoFiX is trailblazing a new path in DeFi with an innovative solution that can truly attract institutional traders and market makers to the space,” said Chief Investment Officer Sharlyn Wu. “It leads DeFi into a new chapter of ‘Computable Finance.’”      Founded in March, the development team behind CoFiX include developers from DeFi project AlphaWallet and blockchain security team SECBIT, according to AlphaWallet founder Victor Zhang.      The new funding will be used to cover the costs of protocol auditing and early development.

In a service update early on Wednesday, the Seychelles-based platform said it is once more allowing deposits and withdrawals for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the tether (USDT) stablecoin after upgrading wallet security for those cryptocurrencies.  KuCoin noted that wallet addresses for these coins had been refreshed and, while the older addresses would still work, it recommended users update.  The USDT version for the Ethereum blockchain is now open for deposits and withdrawals, while those for Tron, EOS are deposit only. Tether on Omni cannot yet be deposited or withdrawn.  Full services have been resumed for 65 other cryptocurrency projects, it added.  After the breach, which saw $281 million in various crypto assets such as XRP and Ethereum-based coins stolen, KuCoin had moved to freeze all wallets and disable services.  On Oct. 3, the company's CEO, Johnny Lyu, claimed the suspected hackers had been traced and that it had informed law enforcement agencies.  Lyu further claimed that another $64 million of stolen cryptos had been recovered, bringing the total value of recovered assets to $204 million at the time.  In its latest update on the incident, also posted Wednesday, the exchange said other entities are continuing to help retrieve funds, with Tether having frozen ""about $22 million"" in stolen USDT.  Other projects like Ocean Protocol have returned recovered coins to KuCoin wallets, though the amount involved wasn't disclosed.  KuCoin also provided a list of suspicious addresses related to the hack and recommended they be added to blacklists.

As reported by The Korea Herald Wednesday, the move follows the progress of research to the technical phase in the summer and will see testing of distribution and circulation of the digital coin.  With China fast moving toward the launch of its CDBC and having already held tests across the nation assisted by banks and firms, South Korea moved to accelerate its work on a CBDC in April.  The BoK reportedly said the tests do not necessarily mean it will go ahead with the CBDC launch.  Originally saying it saw no need for a CBDC, the central bank has quickly shifted gear on the project: Phase one – designing and reviewing the technology – was completed in several months and phase two – looking at the likely infrastructure with an outside partner – started at the end of August.  While China has been testing its digital yuan with other entities, the BoK will test the blockchain-based CBDC in a virtual environment initially, said The Herald.  According to the Korea Times, the BoK said it will simulate transactions on a blockchain platform that would be similar to those for cash or traditional means of payment.  ""The CBDC will be issued and circulated in the virtual world and we are going to test a number of transaction scenarios under a variety of circumstances,"" an official said.  In June, the central bank formed a legal committee to advise on the possible launch of the digital currency.  Edit (14:20 UTC, Oct. 7 2020): This article previously stated that the BoK tests would be held in conjunction with banks, as per the Korea Herald report.

42432888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xHh,1602061234,"Amid US-China Tech War, Can Neo’s DeFi Stack Rival Ethereum’s?","Chinese tech companies were once seen as copycats of their Western peers: Alibaba was a knockoff of eBay and Baidu imitated Google. More recently, Chinese firms like TikTok and Huawei have established such dominant international positions that U.S. authorities have tried to hold them back.      Now, the technological arms race is playing out in the cryptocurrency industry, where one Chinese company is taking on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain, which U.S.-based developers have used to build semi-automated trading and lending networks under the rubric of decentralized finance, or DeFi.      Neo took aim at DeFi in late September with its launch of a new platform called Flamingo. Da Hongfei, a Neo co-founder, told CoinDesk in an interview that the protocol will eventually provide users with features found on popular Ethereum-based projects like Uniswap, Curve Finance, yearn.finance and Synthetix.      Flamingo is not simply a product of “copy and paste,” the co-founder said in an interview. “It’s like rebuilding a parallel universe.”      Within a few days of its launch, Flamingo had attracted more than $1.6 billion of collateral locked into the protocol, according to a tweet from its official Twitter account. That was despite unexpected delays in the project’s early days due to “an overwhelming amount of network traffic,” as company officials described it.      The amount represents more than half of the $2.35 billion of crypto collateral locked into Uniswap, the top-ranked DeFi project, according to DeFi Pulse.      Some developers focused on the Ethereum blockchain say Flamingo is little more than a knockoff.      “It’s the first credible, wholesale, blockchain-scale ‘vampire’ attempt,” money market protocol Compound’s founder Robert Leshner tweeted on Sept 27. He described Flamingo as an attempt to “clone and launch” all the popular DeFi projects on Ethereum at the same time.      “The success or failure of the project has extremely important ramifications for how we think of Ethereum’s network effect and composability lock-in,” Leshner wrote.      Neo is not the first project that has been trying to challenge Ethereum's dominance and on the list of ""Ethereum Killers."" The roster also includes EOS, Tron and Algorand. And for Neo, one of its biggest ""selling points"" to developers has been its nearly zero-transaction-fee model since its birth.      As of Tuesday, Ethereum's average transaction fee was at $2.24, according to BitInfoCharts.      Neo’s DeFi ambition comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. While there’s no evidence yet of any intervention on behalf of either country’s government, the brewing competition for Ethereum’s business might represent a new front in the technological arms race.      Ethereum’s native token, ether (ETH), has been beating its Chinese challenger in digital-asset-markets this year, with an approximate 170% gain in 2020 versus around 100% for Neo’s NEO token, according to data from Messari.      A rare recent report from Chinese state-controlled media labeled cryptocurrencies “the top performing investment” of the year, seen as a sign the central government is encouraging development in the space.      Da says approximately 90% of the people he talks to on Neo’s group chats on Discord are English speakers. That suggests Neo has a broad, geographically diversified user base, he said.      “We are not attracting people,” Da said. “We are attracting crypto assets. As long as it’s an asset, then it is welcomed.

42432890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1xLh,1602057600,Inside the Estonian CBDC Experiment That Could Shape the Digital Euro,"At the height of 2017’s ICO boom, European Union member Estonia said it had the digital backbone to issue its citizens a national cryptocurrency, an “Estcoin.”      At the time, then-European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi slapped down Estonia’s plans. But in an interesting indication of how far things have come, Estonia’s latest round of experimentation in building a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, is a rare example of a project publicly linked to the ECB’s now-energetic digital euro ambitions.      The ECB’s changed position today signifies how serious the discussion around a digital euro has become, said Luukas Ilves, head of strategy and innovation at Guardtime, the technology provider assisting Eesti Pank, the central bank of Estonia.      It’s a plum assignment for Guardtime, which has a long history helping secure Estonia’s core government infrastructure using a novel industrial-grade blockchain system called KSI (Keyless Signature Infrastructure).      “We know the ECB is going to be appraised of the work we are doing with Eesti Pank,” said Ilves. “Looking ahead, we hope to pull in other eurozone central banks and make a compelling case that a retail CBDC can be deployed at scale for the entire European economy.”    Weighing scale    The appropriate technical solution for wholesale or retail CBDCs may incorporate elements of blockchain architecture, but these have to be arranged in a way that can meet the necessary scaling requirements, said Guardtime CEO Mike Gault.      Building such as a system for a large economy and taking into consideration areas like micro-payments and internet of things (IoT), could run to millions of transactions per second, Gault said. That sort of scale really rules out the notion of multi-party validators reaching consensus to provide proof of a transaction being submitted to the ledger, he said.      “The only reason you have these multiple validators is for censorship resistance,” said Gault. “We’ve yet to meet a central bank or a government that is interested in having censorship resistance. They are the censors.”      Eesti Pank did not return requests for comment by press time.      Read more: Digital Euro Would Provide Alternative to Cryptos, ECB President Lagarde Says      Working within the security parameter of a central bank, Gault explained that the KSI mechanism provides proof the system is operating without fault, using a system of hashes rather than slowing things down with public key infrastructure (PKI).      Current blockchain technology might be fine for launching a wholesale CBDC, added Ilves, which basically amounts to “better clearing of transactions, and bringing some tokenized assets on top of the way banks do things today.” But a retail CBDC requires a different approach.    Identity politics    Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for more digitization of the financial system, particularly in adverse circumstances when a government may want to disburse funds directly to its citizens. So would Estonia’s lauded e-government and digital identity system make this an easier lift from the perspective of the central bank?      The exact question of how Estonia’s CBDC will interface with other services is what the research is setting out to explore, said Ilves. What’s clearly the case, he added, is that Estonia’s existing payments and banking landscape is much less prone to things like fraud and identity theft.      “There are all sorts of ways that digital signatures and a government-issued digital identity could be built into how to manage a wallet and authorize transactions,” said Ilves. “We don’t have any one particular scenario in mind, but we’re sure that a CBDC ecosystem that uses e-ID will work better, faster, safer, cheaper.”      Read more: Estonia’s Central Bank to Research if Blockchain Can Support a Digital Euro      It’s also worth noting that the European Commission, the executive arm that implements the decisions of the European Parliament, has an ambitious proposal to make digital identity systems more interoperable across its various member states.      “I think by the time a CBDC gets deployed across Europe, the different ID systems will play better with each other and that interoperable infrastructure will be in place,” Ilves said.      Summing up, Guardtime chief Gault acknowledged CBDCs have become a busy and febrile space but reiterated the need for speed when it comes to deploying a truly retail offering.      “We think there are a lot of horses in this race,” said Gault, “but we’ve invented the first combustion engine.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/07/inside-the-estonian-cbdc-experiment-that-could-shape-the-digital-euro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf20cb469ab5c70f7537609394eeaaacae431c91-2000x1308.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
