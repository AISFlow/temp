A type of short-term trading modality, scalping is performed by an operator to take advantage of an asset&apos;s price fluctuations in low timeframes. In previous versions, the app allowed users to &apos;freeze&apos; the price of Bitcoin giving traders an edge to perform this practice by comparing it to exchange rates. The Chivo Wallet allows users to move Bitcoin via the lightning network to other Chivo users or external BTC wallets. Thus, traders can make a profit by scalping the app&apos;s BTC price. The team behind the app clarified the following on the reasons for the decision: The &apos;scalping&apos; performed consisted of taking advantage of Chivo keeping the rate frozen for 1 minute and taking advantage of that minute to compare the rate with other exchanges and see if the Bitcoin price went down or up.

The company said Monday it would no longer attempt to launch an ETF linked to bitcoin futures in the U.S., a day before a competing product by fellow issuer ProShares begins trading.  The company could not immediately be reached for comment. However, a spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement that it would continue efforts to launch an ETF in the U.S. that tracks the price of bitcoin directly.  “We have determined not to pursue the launch of a bitcoin futures ETF in the immediate near term. However, we will continue to work in partnership with Galaxy Digital to offer investors [a] full shelf of products with exposure to this transformative asset class, including pursuing a physically backed, digital asset ETF,” the statement said.  A bitcoin futures ETF, such as the one that will begin trading on Tuesday, tracks the price of CME’s bitcoin futures rather than the price of bitcoin directly. A physical bitcoin ETF would track the underlying cryptocurrency’s price.  While there may not be a huge difference in returns in the short term, the returns might diverge by a few percentage points over the course of a year. Still bitcoin futures ETFs are likely the only crypto ETF products to launch in the U.S. at the moment. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has expressed a preference for futures ETFs due to the investor protections outlined by the law that governs these ETFs.  Invesco has yet to file a notice with the SEC formally withdrawing the ETF filing. A filing Monday announced that it was delaying the effective date of its Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the name of its futures fund, to the end of October. These filings are typically filed by issuers if they have yet to secure all of the necessary permissions to launch an ETF.

CBDCs are digital forms of a jurisdiction’s legal currency and are designed to be available via smartphones. Kwame Oppong, head of fintech and innovation at the Bank of Ghana (BoG), said the country’s digital currency, the e-cedi, would work offline through the use of smart cards, according to the report.  Smart cards are physical cards embedded with a chip, similar to modern bank cards.  Speaking at the Ghana Economic Forum on Monday, Oppong said that efforts to bring financial services to people without access to bank accounts are hindered by “the availability of connectivity and power.” He suggested that a CBDC that could be used offline might be a possible solution to this problem.  “What we hope to be able to do – and we’re one of the people pioneering this – is that the e-cedi would also be capable of being used in an offline environment through some smart cards,” Bloomberg quoted Oppong as saying.  So far, China might be trying a similar smart card-based solution for its digital yuan, in which users would be able to transfer their digital currency from bank accounts directly to an offline card. But based on an offline payments solution proposed by global financial service provider Visa earlier this year, offline transactions with CBDCs are not a given and could lead to counterfeiting or double spending.  The Bank of Ghana has been planning to issue a CBDC since at least 2019, and said it was in advanced stages earlier this year. In July, Ghana announced it would be piloting the e-cedi in September, but it hasn’t officially kicked off yet.  More than 80 jurisdictions around the world are studying the implications of CBDCs. Nigeria is setting up to launch its eNaira while, in October, the European Central Bank began a two-year experiment into a digital euro.

42376295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Tr,1634589873,"Put America’s Geeks to Work, Don’t Cage Them","As we progress into the digital age, America needs its computer geeks. Yet the U.S. government, rather than mine their ideas and talents, has thrown too many of them into prison. If we want to beat the Chinese and Russians in cyberspace, we’ll need our nerds – even those with a criminal past. Our adversaries encourage their best tech minds and innovators to break into America’s servers, while we too often imprison ours. We don’t even know exactly how many tech geniuses’ talents are being wasted as they languish in federal prison for various cybercrimes.  Lyn Ulbricht is an activist and public speaker. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  What we do know is that the federal government has thrown the book at many exceptional, often idealistic, young nerds who break the law. Inspired by the potential of a new digital frontier and lacking the maturity, or mentors, to guide their talents, some of the most brilliant end up outside the law. They then become targets of prosecutors and FBI agents intent on making a name for themselves by incarcerating them. Many of our most gifted minds are being squandered in this way, to the detriment of us all. Too many innovative ideas and dreams are dashed at the courthouse steps or the prison door.  Using – instead of caging – our geeks would benefit society and make us all much safer. An example is computer security researcher/hacker Marcus Hutchins, who once committed cybercrimes but was released after he helped foil a massive ransomware attack. He is living proof that our society and nation benefit when we give second chances and offer redemption.  Hutchins is one of a long list of young techies who began as hackers but, whatever their personal flaws, went on to have a significant impact on our world. They include Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Sean Parker.  Two young men who have suffered a far harsher fate are Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz and my son, Ross Ulbricht. Tragically, Swartz committed suicide when faced with the possibility of a 35-year prison sentence for illegally downloading academic articles to make them free and accessible. As for Ross, he faces death in prison, not for hacking anything but for his role in the Silk Road website. Both cases are horrendous, wasteful tragedies inflicted by a destructive system of extreme and cruel punishment.  Languishing behind bars  Ross Ulbricht was handed an unheard-of sentence for a nonviolent, first-time offense: double life plus 40 years without parole. Not one of his trial charges involved violence of any kind. An Eagle Scout, scholarship winner and scientist, Ross followed his free-market ideals and interest in new technologies to innovate new ways of trading, using the then-little-known cryptocurrency bitcoin. He created the online marketplace Silk Road, which was based on privacy and the non-aggression principle of voluntary interaction. On the site, people could buy and sell what they chose, as long as they didn’t harm a third party. Most commonly exchanged were small quantities of marijuana, now legal throughout much of the U.S., including in three states where Ross has been incarcerated.  Now almost 38, Ross Ulbricht is not the same person he was in his twenties. Who is? His impetuous behavior is long gone, but his commitment to people and humanity is still there and apparent in what he says. He writes and has spoken about forgiveness and gratitude, and uses his creativity and knowledge to bring solutions to current problems in society. He uses his time constructively. He prays and meditates, studies and writes, creates art, leads classes and tutors his fellow prisoners. He spent months in protective isolation, in an 8x10 windowless cell, rather than commit violence against a fellow inmate. He has been a model prisoner in every sense and a light in a dark place. And yet, as of now, this peaceful man is condemned to leave prison in a body bag for something he created online when he was 26 years old.  See also: No Visits, No Parole: Ross Ulbricht Is More Alone Than Ever During COVID-19  Like so many others languishing in our prison system, Ross has much to contribute and we, as a society, are being deprived of that to our detriment. Almost half a million agree and have signed an online petition asking the president to commute Ross’ unjust and cruel sentence. His numerous supporters include congressmen and governors, criminal justice advocates, technology entrepreneurs and many more. Those who believe Ross’ punishment does not fit the crime and is profoundly unjust come from all parts of the political spectrum.  The majority of Americans oppose the draconian methods of the U.S. criminal justice system. They oppose spending multiple millions of taxpayer dollars to cage and warehouse nonviolent people for years, decades and lifetimes. This includes cyber offenders. Instead, we need those geeks working for us. As the television host and commentator John Stossel wrote about Ross Ulbricht and others, in order to move forward with innovation and new discoveries we need our rule breakers.  Let’s put our geeks to use, not cage them.

42412139,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIZTL,1634589029,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Above $60K as Crypto Market Cap Reaches New High,"Bitcoin rose toward $62,000 as the first U.S. futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF) was set to go live this week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up about 2% over the past 24 hours as the total crypto market cap reached an all-time high near $2.5 trillion on Monday.  Most of the price rally was attributed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF on Friday, which will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow. Bitcoin rallied about 30% over the month as bullish sentiment improved ahead of the bitcoin futures ETF announcement.  “An Ethereum ETF will likely follow soon after as CME [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] already offers Ethereum futures contracts,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement.  “A lot of good news has already been priced in, although with bitcoin’s all-time high just $3K away, a fresh attempt to break this is very likely to happen in the short term,” Nicholas Cawley, analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Technical charts show strong price resistance around the $63,000 BTC all-time high reached in April, which could cap upside moves over the short term. Indicators also show price is the most overbought since July, which preceded a near 10% pullback.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,450, +1.6%  Ether (ETH): $3,747, +0.3%  S&P 500: +0.3%  Gold: -0.2%  10-year U.S. Treasury yield closed at 1.585%, +0.011 percentage point  Crypto market cap near $2.5 trillion  The total cryptocurrency market capitalization reached an all-time high on Monday, just shy of $2.5 trillion. The previous attempt at an all-time high was in May, which preceded a sell-off in cryptocurrencies. However, the total crypto market cap remained above $1 trillion as the sell-off stabilized in July.  Overheated futures market  The amount of money locked in the bitcoin futures contracts on the global derivatives giant CME surged to record highs on Friday as the SEC gave the green light to futures-based ETFs tied to the cryptocurrency, reported CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  The chart below shows that the dollar value of open interest (OI) – or the number of futures contracts traded but not liquidated with an offsetting position – stood at $3.64 billion on Friday, more than doubling the total for the month, according to data provided by bybt. The previous lifetime high of $3.26 billion was recorded during the bull market frenzy in February.  Some analysts warned about overheating in the futures market given the recent rise in leveraged positions.  “Today’s volatility seems to be driven by a high-leveraged future market,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post published on Monday. “The strongest support levels (based on UTXO price distribution histogram) are [$]54K, [$]56K BTC,” the firm wrote.  Crypto-fund assets at all-time high  Total assets under management in cryptocurrency funds tracked by CoinShares have been climbing – and could swell further as one or more U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds launch this week.  The rise of fresh capital contributed to a boost in total assets under management, now $72.3 billion, the highest on record.  Bitcoin funds continue to dominate inflows, totaling $70 million last week. Polkadot and Cardano products also saw inflows totaling $3.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Read more here.  Altcoin roundup  Stablecoin risk warning from Fitch: The credit-rating firm projects that stablecoin issuers’ holdings of short-term debt instruments such as commercial paper will grow to exceed that of money market funds over the next two to three years. Commercial paper is a type of short-term, unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically used for the financing of payroll, accounts payable and inventories. The scale of run risks and stablecoin-related turbulence posed to the $1.1 trillion commercial paper market will depend on the evolution of regulations affecting the crypto asset class, Fitch said in a press release.  Terra to see ecosystem growth: More than 160 projects will launch early next year on the Terra blockchain project, CryptoSlate reported. Those include Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol and Wormhole support, according to the publication. As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, Terra’s Columbus-5 upgrade recently went live, letting users easily transfer the native LUNA token and stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) to other networks, and vice versa. The LUNA price has jumped 54-fold in digital-asset markets this year, for a market capitalization of $14 billion.  FLOW now on Kraken in U.S., Canada: Crypto exchange Kraken said Monday the FLOW token will now be available for trading and staking for U.S. and Canadian clients, after making the token available to many clients elsewhere earlier in the year. Funding, staking and trading go live Tuesday at 15:30 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET), according to the announcement. The Flow blockchain, pioneered by Dapper Labs, has attracted attention this year as fans flocked to non-fungible tokens (NFT). The FLOW price has doubled this year, for a market cap of $4.4 billion.

On Friday, ProShares got the green light from the SEC to start trading its bitcoin futures ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It is set to begin trading on Tuesday, which would make it the first to do so, a step that the crypto community has long been waiting for.  About 30 other applications are yet to be reviewed, however, and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has hinted that only futures ETFs will be approved this year.  The move to approve any bitcoin or cryptocurrency-related ETF is a result of his leadership, according to Bragança.  “I don’t think this would have happened if we had another chairman from the old guard,” she said, adding that Gensler seems “far more willing to experiment” than he’s often credited for.  “He’s not trying to cause the SEC to bungee jump with bitcoin, but he is … pushing the agency to learn more and be out of the usual comfort zone,” she said.  Bragança said the watchdog agency still has concerns about whether bitcoin’s price is susceptible to manipulation, the usual reason for delaying decisions on financial vehicles.

42394404,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczaN,1634585338,The NFT Market Is Already Centralized,"One of the problems non-fungible tokens (NFTs) purport to solve is the idea of “platform risk.” Buy an in-game add-on for a video game and your purchase really exists only on the publisher’s platform; files are hosted on company servers until the game is retired, at which point everything vanishes into the ether.  By contrast, NFTs interact directly with a blockchain, which means each computer in the network retains a complete record of what’s actually going on with the files. No single company is responsible for storing the data; the thinking is that if one front-end interface crumbles, another can step in.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     But there’s a difference between how decentralized systems are supposed to work and how they are working in practice. In fact, the market is already highly centralized.  Take NFTs on the Ethereum network: Foundation, KnownOrigin, Nifty Gateway, Rarible, SuperRare and Zora are among the major marketplaces vying to become a sort of Web 3 eBay, but as any NFT enthusiast will readily admit, there’s only one site that’s even close to getting there.  That would be OpenSea, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed site valued at $1.5 billion this past summer. According to blockchain data aggregator DappRadar, OpenSea has facilitated more than $600 million in trades since last Monday. SuperRare, the next comparable marketplace on the list, had $6 million in trading volume during the same span.  Part of the reason for OpenSea’s incumbency is that it’s more like a listings aggregator than a gallery. While platforms like Foundation and SuperRare support trades only with specific, curated NFT collections, OpenSea supports a much wider range of projects. You can’t trade SuperRare NFTs on Foundation, or Foundation NFTs on SuperRare, but you can trade both on OpenSea. (Rarible has the same kind of cross-project flexibility, but isn’t nearly as popular.)  OpenSea is also a little more lawless than either Foundation and SuperRare, both of which are trying to cultivate a reputation for dealing in digital artworks. OpenSea is where you go for your Lazy Lions, your Bored Apes – the more self-consciously artsy stuff tends to start on other platforms before finding its way to OpenSea’s secondary market.  As a few publications pointed out last week, OpenSea briefly played host to a collection of Hitler-themed NFTs, which were created using the marketplace’s own template. (Sophisticated developers might code their own NFTs, but everyone else can just opt for OpenSea’s “Shared Storefront” smart contract, which simplifies the process with a handy interface.) And although the site has delisted the tokens, the smart contract remains live on the Ethereum blockchain.  This is the other side of the platform risk question – the prospect of “uncensorable” information. Because that data lives on the blockchain, not on OpenSea, any Hitler-lovin’ developer could just build a front end that specifically supports those tokens. The Hitler tokens aren’t even gone from all the major marketplaces; they are still available to view on Rarible, along with their original accompanying description, which refers to Hitler as an “antihero.”  Two major centralized crypto exchanges, Coinbase and FTX, just announced their own NFT marketplaces last week, which will no doubt bring more moderation to the market. But top-down moderation is controversial in the more libertarian corners of crypto. We can all probably agree that NFTs venerating Hitler shouldn’t be sold on the open market, but is giving individual platforms that sort of discretion a slippery slope?  See also: Why I’m Skeptical of FATF’s ‘Extreme Right Wing’ Watch | Opinion  To that I’d say, the reality is that these platforms already have that discretion. The vast majority of NFTs are passing through OpenSea, a private company that’s clearly game to make those sorts of calls. Open markets tend to centralize in tech. It’s true of Web 2, where Amazon and Microsoft have come to dominate, and it’s true in the NFT market, at least so far.  I think there’s a good chance Coinbase’s and FTX’s marketplaces could accelerate this trend, drawing more potential traders toward centralized systems. More than 2.3 million people have already joined the waiting list for Coinbase’s NFT platform, no doubt thanks to the company’s cachet in the crypto sector. And FTX has the benefit of working with the Solana blockchain, which does away with Ethereum’s cost-prohibitive fee system.  Decentralized computing doesn’t necessitate a decentralized market structure, as Coinbase, FTX and others have proven.

42417108,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4qj7,1634585181,Crypto Learns to Play the DC Influence Game,"Facing a head-spinning array of new legislative and regulatory action out of Washington, D.C., the crypto industry is reacting the way any sector flush with cash would: It’s throwing money at the problem.  Established trade associations are bulking up their lobbying operations, and individual firms seeking more bespoke treatment are hiring their own representatives from D.C.’s enormous pool of Congress-whisperers and regulator-persuaders.  The crypto industry is late to the game. With the exception of a few well-established trade groups, and some firms that saw the importance of having a seat at the federal table before it became painfully obvious, crypto companies have largely avoided engagement with Washington.  This article is part of Crypto 2022: Policy Week, a look at how regulators and legislators are shaping cryptocurrency and how the industry is fighting back.  As a whole, the industry has suffered from a “short-sighted lack of commitment to, and investment in, Washington,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director for the DeFi Education Fund, a new Washington, D.C.-based organization that aims to educate policymakers about the benefits of decentralized finance and governance.  The lack of engagement was partly down to the deep vein of libertarian sentiment running through the crypto world, and partly a result of wishful thinking.  “There’s obviously a pretty anti-centralized authority streak throughout the industry, and the U.S. government is the biggest, baddest, centralized entity in the world,” Whitehouse-Levine said. “There’s just a natural aversion to engaging with it in the crypto industry.”  At the same time, he added, there was a misguided hope that crypto would “fly under the radar” of government regulators, much as internet firms did in the early days of the World Wide Web. “That has not been borne out in any shape or form,” he said.  A rude awakening  It’s difficult to pinpoint a moment when the industry really woke up to the need to have a larger presence in Washington. For some, it was as far back as 2019 when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced intense pushback from Congress over the company’s plans to create a stablecoin called libra (since renamed diem). For others, it was in December, when outgoing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin issued a proposed rule that would have barred many anonymous transfers of cryptocurrency.  But for most it was this summer, when the crypto industry was rocked by the news that an amendment attached to a bipartisan infrastructure spending bill would raise $28 billion in taxes from the industry by requiring cryptocurrency “brokers” to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service. The trouble was the definition of “broker” used in the legislation was so broad it would have included bitcoin miners and software developers working on digital wallets.  The outcry raised by the industry’s representatives in Washington was enough to convince a number of influential members of Congress that the legislation needed to be changed, though a final version of the bill is still pending.  “The infrastructure bill fight made it real for a lot of people who weren’t paying attention to D.C., that D.C. is paying attention to crypto,” said Neeraj Agrawal, communications director at Coin Center, one of the handful of crypto-focused organizations that has been on the front lines of federal policy battles for years.  “The crypto industry as a whole kind of realized [it needs] to beef up lobbying efforts, or policy will be left to congresspeople who maybe don’t fully understand the technology, as evidenced by some of the language that was put into the infrastructure bill,” said Nisa Amoils, a securities lawyer and managing partner of A100X Ventures.  “The infrastructure fight, especially, really woke everyone up,” agreed Ron Hammond, director of government affairs for the Blockchain Association. He described the effort to change the language about brokers in the infrastructure bill as a unifying moment for the industry’s lobbying representatives.  “The core group of subject matter experts and lobbyists just said ... ‘we’ve got to get together on this front,’” he said. “We all combined forces to be a big strong voice.”  Stablecoin regulation looms  The recognition that the industry can successfully wield influence on Capitol Hill comes at a time when crypto is facing a slew of new legislative and regulatory challenges.  In addition to the infrastructure bill, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets is finalizing a set of highly anticipated recommendations that are expected to guide the regulatory treatment of stablecoins. Securities and Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler is taking every opportunity to say he thinks crypto markets belong under the SEC’s watch, and the Federal Reserve is about to release a report indicating whether or not the federal government ought to launch a central bank-backed U.S. dollar coin.  It’s on the question of how the government will treat the $100 billion-plus stablecoin market that the industry is likely to see clarity soonest. The President’s Working Group could deliver its findings at any momen; when it does it will be in the form of recommendations, not hard-and-fast rules.  Teana Baker-Taylor, chief policy officer of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said it is possible that a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers is something that could come together in the next 12 to 18 months.  It’s in that middle phase – where regulators and/or lawmakers turn recommendations into real policy – when D.C. lobbyists really earn their fees.  Unsurprisingly, Circle, whose USD coin (USDC) is the second largest stablecoin on the market, is also building up its lobbying presence.  Circle’s goal has always been to be subject to regulation, something the company’s founder and CEO, Jeremy Allaire, has been saying for years. But the path to some sort of regulatory certainty is a tricky one, made even more so by Circle’s biggest competitor, Tether, and its eponymous dollar-denominated stablecoin. Tether has spent years sparring with regulators and law enforcement agencies over whether it truly holds the reserves necessary to back tether’s nearly $70 billion market capitalization.  On top of trying to distance its client from Tether, Circle needs to allay the concerns of the Biden administration that stablecoins and other digital assets are making it easier for the perpetrators of ransomware attacks to get away with their victims’ money.  “We will continue to advocate for effective policies that position the U.S. as a global leader in fostering the growth of new digital economic infrastructure. We know that, much like with the creation of the internet, it’s only through rigorous public-private sector collaboration that people everywhere will be able to tangibly benefit from public blockchains and we are engaging with policymakers to make that a reality,” Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer and head of global strategy, said in a statement provided to CoinDesk.  More money, fewer problems?  Even before the infrastructure bill came to light and the issue of stablecoin regulation began to heat up, the industry was beefing up its lobbying muscle.  Lobbyists who work with Congress have to file regular disclosures indicating for whom they work, how much they are being paid and on what specific issues or pieces of legislation they are working. The data is compiled into a searchable database by the government transparency organization Open Secrets.  That database shows the Blockchain Association spent $290,000 on in-house and external lobbyists in 2020. This year it spent $290,000 by the end of June, the most recent filing date.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce, another lobbying group, in 2020 spent $120,000 and listed just one in-house lobbyist working on its behalf. Through June 2021, the organization had already spent $92,000 and listed four lobbyists, three from the firm FS Vector, which began representing the Chamber in April.  In addition to increased spending by the trade groups, individual companies in search of bespoke representation have been adding both internal and external lobbyists to their teams.  Coinbase has been increasing what it spends on lobbying every year since 2017, and shelled out $230,000 last year. By June of this year it had already spent $160,000 and had increased its roster of registered lobbyists from seven to nine.  Ripple Labs, which spent $330,000 in 2020, has blown past that figure already, spending $550,000 through June. Since 2019, the firm has doubled the size of its stable of lobbyists, from six to twelve. The firm knows the dangers of Washington better than most, having been taken to court by the SEC last year over sales of its XRP token, which the agency alleges amounted to an unregistered securities offering.  The spending figures for the third quarter of the year haven’t been released yet, but the trend is clear. In the months since the infrastructure fight began, well over a dozen new disclosures have been filed documenting new lobbyist hires by crypto firms and trade groups. For many, it was their first recorded hiring of a lobbyist.  That includes Hedera Hashgraph, which has been represented by Key Bridge Advisers since Aug. 31.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Brett McDowell, executive director of the Hedera Council, explained the organization’s thinking, saying, “The Council Members and the broader Hedera community have an interest in ensuring that legislators and regulators, in the U.S. and elsewhere, are well-informed about distributed ledger technology and the broad range of issues faced by those who are building valuable businesses that leverage the technology or otherwise participating in the industry.”  Another firm new to the game is Digital Currency Group, the owner of CoinDesk, which hired its first lobbyist, the Klein/Johnson Group in April, and took on Capitol Counsel in August.  Not all bids to influence federal policymakers are taking the form of traditional lobbying operations. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) recently launched a new $2.2 billion crypto venture fund and has hired, among others, former federal prosecutor Katie Haun, who investigated the Mt. Gox hack; Bill Hinman, the former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance; Tomicah Tillemann, a former adviser to Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton; and Brent McIntosh, a former Treasury Department official who specialized in the regulation of digital assets.  While none of a16z’s hires are officially lobbyists, several were expected to be in Washington for meetings with the administration and Congress this week. The plan was to raise awareness of a lengthy proposal a16z released last week for regulating what it refers to as Web 3, which it defines as “a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain, cryptographic protocols, digital assets, decentralized finance and social platforms.”  Also last week, Coinbase revealed what some of its recent policy hires have been up to. The largest U.S. crypto exchange by daily trading volume, which went public this year, released a model regulatory structure for the crypto industry. The proposal called for separating digital assets from the existing financial regulatory structures by creating a single regulator for digital asset markets.  The object, said Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, is “to start an open and participatory national conversation on the future of our financial system.”  A ‘cash grab’  There are signs that not all the money the crypto industry is pumping into Washington is being well spent. Experts at some of the established advocacy groups said they were surprised at the large number of lobbying firms being hired, because the number of lobbyists with true expertise in the subject matter is relatively small.  On the other hand, lobbyists can be very persuasive.  “There’s an industry with a lot of money, and lobbyists are really good at seeing opportunities. So it’s not surprising to me that there’s a marriage happening there,” said Agrawal, of Coin Center.  But while lobbying firms may talk a good game on conference calls with their potential clients, it’s in the halls of Congress where the rubber meets the road. There, the results of the latest spending splurge have been uneven, at best.  “It’s a bit of a cash grab right now,” said one Capitol Hill staffer who works on crypto issues. Many of the newly minted crypto lobbyists, the staffer said, don’t really know what they’re doing.  “I deal with people all the time who aren’t good at their job, and with some of the newer folks it’s painful,” the staffer said. “I don’t want to have to explain to you how to do your job and you make money off of it.”  The staffer urged industry participants looking for representation in Washington to understand that a good lobbyist will sometimes have to tell clients things they don’t want to hear. If that’s not happening, it’s a good idea to maintain “a healthy level of skepticism.”  Another Hill staffer close to crypto issues said it’s obvious that some of the firms hiring lobbyists right now have been prioritizing access over subject matter knowledge.  “They’re hiring people who have a good foundational lobbying background, and teaching them as they go,” the staffer said.  ‘Maximizing resources’  The situation reminds Baker-Taylor, of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, of the market for legal representation crypto companies faced several years ago.  “Five years ago, everybody was looking for lawyers that could help guide and advise them,” she said. “And we all knew the lawyers were learning on the job.”  “There are two elements here,” she said. “There is understanding the subject matter that you’re advocating for at a level of technical and commercial detail. That’s critically important. … And then there’s understanding how Washington works. And I think that there are people who are good at one of those, but there’s not a lot of people who are great at both. I think that that’s part of an industry that’s maturing.”  Whitehouse-Levine, of the DeFi Education Alliance, said crypto companies need to be more careful about who they hire to represent them. “You can’t just hire a lobbying firm here in D.C. and then forget about it except for paying the retainer once a month. To maximize those resources will require a massive amount of education before lobbyists can be depended on to get out there and educate.”  The DeFi Education Alliance is in the process of hiring lobbyists, Whitehouse-Levine said, and it is doing so very deliberately.  “We put together a briefing book of ‘DeFi 101′ readings that ended up being 450 pages that we’re going to ask our firms to read before getting started,” he said. “We also intend to do a five-day sprint curriculum to try to get our lobbyists up to speed.”  The good news is that once those lobbyists know their stuff, they’re going to find a willing audience among many members of Congress who, just a few years ago, didn’t want anything to do with crypto issues.  “Early on, on the crypto lobbying side, most members didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole,” said Hammond, of the Blockchain Association. “It was just so complicated and so daunting to know that you have to invest so much time into it. But now it’s getting to the point that they understand they have to learn this issue.”  These days there is as much outreach coming from Congress as there is going in the other direction. “It’s not as much me reaching out as the opposite,” he said, with congressional offices asking the industry to help educate senators and members of Congress on the issues.  “There’s a big thirst for education on both sides of the aisle,” Hammond said.

42424654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVfrh,1634585121,Crypto Is Too Big for Partisan Politics,"Every major American issue seems to get sucked into the “red vs. blue” political dichotomy these days, and now it is cryptocurrency’s turn in the barrel. Following somewhat tense recent testimony between U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and the Senate Banking Committee, Politico confidently declared “Crypto becomes partisan.”  While Capitol Hill fireworks might make it seem that way, the reality is that crypto doesn’t have a natural partisan bent – it is a universal tool that has the potential to benefit everyone in every community.  Kristin Smith is executive director of the Blockchain Association, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  Attempting to frame cryptocurrency as either a Republican- or Democratic-leaning technology demonstrates a woeful lack of understanding about digital currency and its origins. Bitcoin emerged during the Great Recession, a period when millions of Americans were suffering due to the cascading failures of centralized-government watchdogs and large, overly powerful financial entities. Crypto innovators wanted to create a system that gave everyday Americans complete control over their financial futures and their digital lives.  By the tenets of decentralization, digital currencies are designed to be inherently inclusive and open to all. Whether you live in Manhattan, New York, or Manhattan, Kansas, and have the ability to go online, you have equal access to blockchain networks and all their benefits.  That’s one reason why crypto’s public popularity is growing. According to one survey, roughly 46 million Americans own some form of digital currency, and a clear majority of the country will consider owning it in the future. Crypto’s growth won’t just benefit those who have always had access to traditional financial markets and services. According to a study by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, cryptocurrency traders are younger and more diverse along racial and ethnic lines, as well.  The universality and open access to digital currency makes it impossible to be inherently partisan, which is why bipartisan groups of lawmakers support it. Progressives like Rep. Ro Khanna (D.-Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D.-Calif.) and conservatives like Sen. Pat Toomey (R.-Penn.) and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R.-Wyo.), who have sharp ideological differences in most areas, all agree that nurturing crypto growth represents a common good for all Americans.  Lost in the partisan bickering and media analysis from the Washington-based press are the real-world benefits that crypto networks provide to users. A central benefit in the era of constant data hacks is that blockchain networks are significantly more secure, given the nature of decentralization. If the network’s data is stored across thousands of computers, it’s that much harder for hackers to access a meaningful entry point to collect and exploit users’ data.  How about basic access to financial services? According to research by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), roughly 7 million Americans still lack access to a bank account – people living in areas ranging from rural areas to urban centers. Many of these people struggle because of the entry costs of opening or maintaining a bank account or because they have trouble getting to a physical bank.  By moderating the power of traditional middlemen such as banks and other financial clearing houses, blockchain networks offer users a much easier and more cost-effective option to handle their money. They eliminate onerous fees, remain accessible 24/7 and, frequently, process transactions faster.  We have not yet touched on the power of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to open up the financial services universe even further. Crypto lending platforms, like Compound and Aave, have the potential to revolutionize peer-to-peer, global lending practices. Filecoin, the decentralized storage network, is taking steps to completely change the way we think about storing our most important data.  See also: Rep. Tom Emmer Wants Stablecoins Over CBDCs – Interview  And, if we return to a source of the last financial crisis, DeFi protocols could open up another market: home loans and mortgages. What if a DeFi protocol could be designed to constantly analyze all available mortgage offers to ensure that a client got the best deal possible, rather than relying on the traditional process where a user is at the mercy of whatever rate their bank is willing to give them?  Surely, the scenarios described above could be considered nonpartisan. We believe they enjoy broad support among the American people, and likely in Congress too, if we strip away the tried “red vs. blue” comparison that we’ve been so conditioned to think is natural. We have a choice: Continue to nurture the nascent crypto industry in this country or let the demons of our partisan political system hamper the next wave of cutting-edge financial technology.

Ethereum Supply Shock: Exchange Reserves Go On Decreasing While ETH 2.0 Staking Contract Grows In Value As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, ETH exchange reserves have been decreasing while the coins locked in the staking contract have been rising. The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an Ethereum indicator that highlights the total number of coins stored in wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means there is an increase in the supply of ETH on exchanges. Such a trend may show that there is a selling pressure in the market as investors are sending these coins to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or altcoin purchasing. A decrease, on the other hand, would imply the supply of ETH is going down as investors take their crypto off exchanges for hodling or selling through OTC deals. This behavior may show that buyers feel bullish on the coin&apos;s future.

In February, Minerd predicted that bitcoin could hit $600,000 after saying in December that bitcoin could reach $400,000.  In late June, when bitcoin was floating around $30,000, Minerd predicted that bitcoin could fall to around $15,000 at its low point.  Bitcoin today is trading over $63,000 and has climbed more than 40% this month.  “We were long going into that, we sold, it pulled back to where I thought it was and really after looking at it thought you know, we gonna probably go lower,” Minerd said. “Well, we didn’t, so we’re not in.”  In November, shortly before Minerd’s first bullish price prediction, Guggenheim filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to be able to invest up to almost $500 million in bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a unit of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.

But Emmer understands cryptocurrency better than most – especially among his peers in office – and has emerged as one of the industry’s fiercest political advocates. Decentralized technology is “inevitable,” he says, and elected and appointed officials can either support the growth of a homegrown U.S. crypto sector or see it advance elsewhere in the world.  This interview is part of a series called “Gensler for a Day,” where we ask industry leaders in a position to set or influence law about concrete policies they would implement. Check here for more “Policy Week” coverage.  “I’ll go down any rabbit hole when it comes to this because you’ve got to learn it, you’ve got to understand it,” Emmer said last week in a phone interview, reprinted below, on his legislative efforts in the House of Representative. “You do have to play with it a little bit. You got to touch it, you got to smell it, you got to manipulate it, see if you can throw it, catch it.”  Emmer is a powerful ally to have on Capitol Hill. In addition to co-chairing the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which works to educate other legislators, he is chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which works to elect more Republicans to Congress, and is a ranking member of a powerful financial oversight subcommittee.  But his crypto-related work can be seen as an uphill battle. Emmer has spoken at length about how the digital asset industry is already “over-regulated.” Among policymakers, he’s also identified something of a bias against digital privacy and private monies. And now that Congress sees the $2 trillion (and counting) cryptocurrency industry as a potential tax revenue source and a driver behind a growing ransomware problem, there are risks of heightened oversight or misinformed policy being shoehorned into unrelated legislation.  See also: Here’s How the US’s Infrastructure Bill Crypto Tax Provision Might Be Implemented  Emmer recently put forward or co-signed a series of bills looking to clarify cryptocurrency regulation. His “Securities Clarity Act” would work with the “Digital Commodities Exchange Act” to answer once and for all when a cryptocurrency network or company should be overseen by federal securities regulators.  Crypto is one of the few areas that seems to transcend partisan, left versus right, politics. Many Democrats and Republicans see the technology as transformative, hold bitcoin and incorporate it into their brands (check out these campaign non-fungible tokens [NFT] – from blues and reds).  Emmer is a leading voice in this pro-tech camp, but like all decent politicians he knows this policy issue isn’t about him. Crypto, he says, is for the people.  In a recent interview on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” you suggested the government is looking at crypto as a potential revenue source. Are you opposed to the notion of taxing crypto in general and what would sensible policy look like here?  I’m absolutely opposed to the [Oregon Sen. Rob] Portman amendment in the [Biden administration’s] bipartisan infrastructure bill, because I think it was based on, I don’t want to say a false premise, but I just don’t think the $28 billion they expected to collect off of this tax [would be forthcoming].  First, let’s back up. Americans realize the value of crypto and blockchain innovation – and it’s those people who could be harmed by misguided legislation.  That debate over on the Senate side of the Capitol seems to have awakened some elected officials and their staff. When a Senate office receives 40,000 calls in one day, Daniel, like they did during the debates over the infrastructure bill, it really forces those elected representatives to care. It started with the idea of taxing the industry as a revenue source but it turned into a lot more. A lot of heads are popping up out of the sand saying, “What is this crypto thing?”  You know, I had no idea 55 million Americans are now involved in crypto. It’s got a market of more than $2 trillion. It’s one of the fastest-growing things that we’ve seen in decades. Because of all of that, the government is taking notice.  Along those lines, it looks like the “crypto provision” is going to be passed intact within the infrastructure bill. Do you think that matters?  We’ll have to see what happens with the bill. Depending on what room you’re in and with whom you’re talking, it’s either coming together slowly or it’s going farther apart. If we start with the hypothetical that the bill finds its way back to the floor and passes the House, gets signed by the president’s office and becomes law, that provision would be in there. But it’s not effective until 2023, so we will have time to change it. Is it the optimal situation, Daniel? No, I prefer that [language] never got there. But I’m confident that cooler heads will prevail – that amendments will be made – and we will be able to take action.  What does overregulation look like and how big of a risk is it?  Just take a look at our [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] Chair Gary Gensler if you want to know what overregulation is all about or why creating laws, if you will, through enforcement or regulatory enforcement is bad.  As I told him during a hearing [earlier in October], his conclusory public statements and threatened enforcement actions hurt everyday investors the most. Gensler actually believes that most tokens are securities – or at least he claimed to believe that most tokens are securities – because people buy them and expect to profit off of the work of developers and computer scientists. Since he thinks that most tokens are securities, he also believes that crypto exchanges that trade securities should be under SEC jurisdiction. These are his words.  I asked him specifically if someone who issued a token goes to register it with the SEC if they can trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. The answer right now is no. It couldn’t. I believe the most tokens are commodities or currencies once the project is decentralized.  We’ve got to remember this technology is decentralized after a project is fully developed, there’s no centralized group behind it, whose work investors would be profiting on. So at that point it should not be a security.  I’m going to suggest to you that Gary Gensler and other members of the [Biden] administration are ignorant as to how this area works, which is a big problem for the industry. I don’t believe that, though, I believe he’s very smart and he’s trying to expand his jurisdiction.  See also: Gary Gensler Says Crypto Is a ‘Wild West.’ Others See Pure Capitalism | Opinion  I’ll give you an example. He talks about “stable-value” coins. There is no such thing as a “stable-value” coins – they’re stablecoins. He used this term in his testimony before the Banking Committee in the Senate and in his testimony before the Financial Services Committee in the House. Why would he use that term? Did he just fumble with the words? No. Stable value funds are under the SEC’s jurisdiction, which might suggest “stable value” coins would be, too.  This throws the whole investment marketplace into a confused state. That is bad for individual investors and, frankly, I believe violates his mandate, which is to protect individual investors.  If you were in Gensler’s shoes, what would you do about stablecoin regulation?  I’ve got a bill out there right now called the Securities Clarity Act to try and deal with this problem of the overreaching regulator. A little clarity would go a long way towards solving this jurisdictional question between the SEC and its sister agencies. [Ed. note: Namely, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.]  The bill would help token issuers easily determine when a token is actually part of a securities contract and when it’s not. You wouldn’t do this by amending the existing securities law, but in creating a new definition called an “investment contract asset.”  This particular bill would help the SEC understand what its jurisdiction is and encourage it to work with the industry to develop a bigger framework that we can all operate under. Then there is the sister bill carried by former Ag Chair [Kenneth Michael] Conaway (R-Texas). My office has been working with Republican ranking member “GT” Thompson (R- Pa.) of the [House Agriculture Committee] on this bill, which would give the CFTC the authority to regulate crypto spot markets, which are the crypto exchanges, obviously. This way, crypto exchanges can have one federal regulator rather than going through the burdensome process of getting 53 different licenses to operate across the United States.  The Securities Clarity Act in combination with the Digital Commodities Exchange Act, which is that other bill, will clear up jurisdictional boundaries and allow the marketplace to do what it does best: allow investors to do their homework, get involved in projects and grow new opportunities for themselves and others. That’s what makes this country great.  Shifting gears a little bit, do you think the United States needs a central bank digital currency (CBDC). And, if so, how can we guarantee strong privacy rights in digital public money?  By now people have to know that I am absolutely, adamantly opposed to the United States government or Federal Reserve, specifically, creating a central bank digital currency.  If it’s permissionless and maintains the privacy of cash, I suppose that’s workable. But until you can prove that would work, I adamantly oppose one. The Federal Reserve should never be competing with private business.  There are two main forms of a CBDC. One would impose central bank accounts, users would have bank accounts at the Fed. The Fed would collect KYC [know your customer] information on users and then be able to track their transactions. This is modeled, I would argue, after the Communist Party of China. This is the United States of America. Why would we ever want to emulate the Communist Party of China? I just disagree that we should never mobilize the Fed into retail banking.  The second way would have financial institutions like banks maintain all KYC information and serve as access points. [CBDC supporters will] probably try to argue this is better for financial institutions – but the Fed would still be able to track all transactions on the blockchain.  Bottom line is, CBDCs aren’t much different than swiping a credit card or a debit card, besides the fact that the central bank is involved and can oversee transactions. Neither one of these examples would maintain any element of privacy. [Meanwhile], stablecoins actually maintain certain elements of cash because they run on open, permissionless and private blockchains. That’s probably your best solution. The government should allow private citizens to develop this thing.  See also: Regulate Stablecoins, Don’t Smother Them | Michael Casey  You said in an interview last spring that crypto is succeeding in part because people are losing faith in the system. Is there a way to square the support of crypto with the American Dream?  Crypto started, right, with Satoshi’s white paper released after the 2008 crash. I think this all comes out of the fact that the United States’s monetary policy, as well as the monetary policy around the globe, is suspect. When a government has a floating currency, when it can seemingly print as much cash as it wants, that’s good until it’s not.  We’re going to back this up. The people who started the crypto craze, way back when, they’re kind of like the financial preppers of our day. They were trying to anticipate a country where you couldn’t trust the currency. Bitcoin is a lot like gold. It holds its value.  I do think it’s compatible with the American Dream because Americans have always been pushing the frontier. Americans have always been free to innovate and this is what our government is going to have to understand: This is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of how far.  If our government wants to continue to put up roadblocks because of ignorance, because of fear, if you will, and the desire to control, [the crypto sector will] develop elsewhere. You’re going to have very intelligent, creative Americans and others that continue to develop new methods for transacting between individuals and or entities. Crypto is not going away. It’s just a matter of whether we will have a light touch regulatory framework that recognizes the potential crypto presents. This is an entirely new opportunity for different groups of people who may never have had access to the financial system.  See also: How Do You Know Crypto Is Winning? Look Where the Talent Is Going | Opinion  That’s why I’ve been so outspoken, I want to see that happen right here in this country.  How far down the rabbit hole have you gone? Do you hold bitcoin, play around with decentralized finance?  Well, every time they open another door or trap door, if you will, I fall into it. Personally, I’m going to be careful, because I can tell you I know people very close to me that are actively involved in this marketplace. I will tell you, on an official level, more policymakers need to understand this industry.  A while back we started accepting cryptocurrency for campaign contributions. We did that in selfish self-interest. But if you think about it, we’re trying to appeal to my colleagues and their selfish self-interest, who might notice I started accepting cryptocurrency in my campaign and ask, “What is he getting that we’re not?”  I’ll go down any rabbit hole when it comes to this because you’ve got to learn it, you’ve got to understand it. You do have to play with it a little bit. You got to touch it, you got to smell it, you got to manipulate it, see if you can throw it, catch it. For some of us my age – we weren’t built the same way you were, Daniel, so it takes us a little bit longer – a virtual wallet is something that you really need to get used to.

42412121,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIYFf,1634575355,"Argo Blockchain’s Texas Mining Facility Will Propel Shares Higher, Analysts Say","Five Wall Street firms, including Jefferies and Barclays, initiated research coverage of Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ: ARBK) on Monday with buy ratings – all of them expecting the company’s Texas crypto mining facility to be a catalyst for the shares to move higher.  Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen has the highest 12-month price target of $30 per share for the London-based miner. “BTC mining should remain a high margin business, and ARBK’s margin should improve as they build out in Texas, where power rates (largest OpEx) are half the rate of the in-place portfolio,” Petersen wrote. He also thinks Argo’s investment in sustainable energy and decentralized finance (DeFi) is the differentiating factor versus its mining peers.  The flood of Argo initiations comes after the expiration of a 25-day “quiet period” where investment firms must hold off on issuing ratings until a set time after a given initial public offering (IPO).  D.A. Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler said Argo fits well within his “survive and thrive” thesis for the miners. He expects its new Texas facility will enable the company to grow its hashrate and franchise value and provides access to one of the cheapest power rates in the industry. Brendler has a $27 per share price target for Argo.  Read more: Argo Blockchain Raises $112.5M in US Share Sale  Furthermore, Canaccord’s Joseph Vafi said “after adding 600 petahash of new hydro-driven mining capacity in Quebec during Q2, all the pieces are coming together for the company to further, materially expand its hashrate capacity in 2022, leveraging 200 MW of cheap, Texas wind power and recently placed orders for new Bitcoin (BTC) miners.” His 12-month price target is $24 for the miner’s stock.  Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal sees Argo’s current share price as a “compelling entry point” for investors due to its relative value versus the mining peers, rising popularity of bitcoin and near-term margin expansion potential through its new mining facility in West Texas. His 12-month price target is $22 per share. (For context, shares of other mining competitors such as Riot Blockchain are trading near $30 per share; Marathon Digital is above $50 per share.)  Meanwhile, Compass Point analyst Giuliano Bologna slapped a price target of $21 per share, lowest among the analysts, but still recommended investors buying the shares. Bologna sees securing a power purchase agreement and completing the construction of its Texas facility as potential near-term catalysts. However, he noted that “visibility” is needed to justify additional upside for the shares.  The American depositary shares of Argo have not kept pace with its peers since the miner’s Nasdaq IPO in September.

According to the Brazilian monetary authority, May was the peak of the cryptocurrency acquisition, with $756 million in purchases. Since then the figure dropped to $695 million in June and $583 million in July, but was still higher than in February and March. At that time $386 million and $357 million were acquired, respectively, Brazilian media outlet Portal do Bitcoin reported.  Doing a mark-to-market estimation, total digital assets held by Brazilians would add up to nearly $50 billion, compared to $16 billion held in U.S. stocks, BCB’s monetary policy director, Bruno Serra, said on Friday.  In August, BCB’s president, Roberto Campos Neto, said that Brazilians held about $40 billion in cryptocurrencies.  “It’s a very big business, it attracts the attention of regulators all over the world, it’s not just in Brazil,” he said.  According to Serra, Brazil’s monetary authority has a “very controlled foreign-exchange market” that allows it to be aware of crypto-related transactions. “We have foreign-exchange contracts for all transactions, 100% of them we are able to map,” he said.

According to Serra, crypto investing is a search for wealth diversification by investors. “I think this offshore diversification dynamic is a dynamic that may be here to stay. Diversification channels have opened up a lot. Foreign exchange regulations are loosening in this regard; it’s something we need to address,” he said.  “It’s a one-way flow.

42407254,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKpVK,1634572456,Introducing Crypto 2022: Policy Week,"For years officialdom wanted nothing to do with the crypto sector. Whatever bitcoiners said about changing the world, policymakers largely ignored it.  Even during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom, which involved plenty of money and plenty of fraud, regulators were arguably slow to react, issuing market guidance only months after the fact. Crypto was hardly a priority.  In 2021, everything changed.  Also in Policy Week:  Nik De: What I Learned About Crypto Regulation From a Week in DC  David Z Morris: Lassoing the Stallion: How Gensler Could Approach DeFi Enforcement  Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  Stablecoins Not CBDCs: An interview with Rep. Tom Emmer  Crypto Learns to Play DC’s Influence Game  Kristin Smith: Crypto Is Too Big for Partisan Politics  Lyn Ulbricht: Put America’s Geeks to Work, Don’t Cage Them  Preston J. Byrne: Decentralization’s Challenge to Policymakers Is Coming  Bitcoin ETFs Aren’t New. Here’s How They’ve Fared Outside the US  The View From Brussels: How the EU Plans to Regulate Crypto  Raul Carrillo: In Defense of OCC Nominee Saule Omarova  The fight in the U.S. Congress over a crypto tax provision in President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill was widely seen as a turning point. For the first time, politicians saw an opportunity to raise revenue from a flush industry. And crypto realized it had to fight like any other Washington lobbying group.  At the same time, central bankers started talking about crypto’s systemic importance, even comparing digital assets to the subprime mortgages that blew up the world economy in 2008. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) even likened crypto to COVID-19 and climate change.  Just last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved bitcoin’s first futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), another major milestone on the road to adoption.  Layer 2′s “Crypto 2022″ series started with Policy Week in October, followed by Future of Money Week in November and Culture Week this week. GET ALL THE CONTENT HERE.  In short: Ignored no more.  CoinDesk’s Policy Week package – part of a wider look-ahead initiative we’re calling Crypto 2022 – is a comprehensive look at how crypto is coming under increasing regulatory and legislative scrutiny and how the industry is responding.  We have special reports on how the crypto lobby is muscling up in Washington, D.C., the outlook for decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins, and how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are likely to interest the SEC next year. We report on the U.S. picture and check in with China and the European Union as well. We look at where bitcoin exchange-traded funds are already allowed and barred. And we hear from policymakers, entrepreneurs, advocates and detractors, academics and acolytes, all in the name of offering a guide for our readers, viewers and listeners.  This is Policy Week. Dig in.  Also part of Policy Week:  DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?

The platforms are in violation of offering securities and/or commodities without having registered with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), according to a statement that didn’t identify the companies.  Three other platforms were asked to provide information about their activities and products. That includes data related to loan-to-value ratios, collateral options and payout processes, the minimum and maximum amount that can be borrowed, the lending rate and all fees payable.  The actions have been taken by the OAG in accordance with New York’s Martin Act, an anti-fraud law that gives the attorney general authority to investigate any company deemed to be trading securities in the state. For the purposes of the Martin Act, cryptocurrency is classed as a security, and therefore subject to its provisions, according to the statement.  Crypto platforms offering investors in New York a rate of return on the assets deposited with them must, therefore, register with the OAG.  In example letters attached to the release, names of the companies contacted were redacted. However, the file names associated with the letters initially identified Nexo and Celsius Network before being changed.  In an email, Nexo said it does not offer its Earn Product and Exchange in New York and blocks users based on internet address location. “It makes little sense to be receiving a C&D for something we are not offering in NY anyway. But we will engage with the NY AG as this is a clear case of mixing up the recipients of the letter.”  Celsius did not respond to a CoinDesk email on Monday seeking comment. But on Tuesday, the company said in a Medium post that it had not received a cease and desist order from New York. The company said that it had “received a request for information from New York authorities” and that it was in the process of providing regulators “with information about our business and offering.”  UPDATE (OCT. 18, 15:50 UTC): Adds file names, company contacts.

At the current rate of growth, stablecoin issuers’ holdings of short-term debt instruments such as commercial paper – a commonly used type of unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically used for the financing of payroll, accounts payable and inventories – will grow to exceed that of money market funds over the next two to three years, according to Fitch.  The scale of run risks and stablecoin-related turbulence posed to commercial paper markets will depend on the evolution of regulations affecting the crypto asset class, Fitch said in a press release.  “Stablecoin-related turbulence could both affect the CP [commercial paper] market itself and transmit shocks to other market participants. Risks could be aggravated if the infrastructure and partners used by stablecoin operators to engage with traditional markets lack a record in the smooth handling of transactions during periods of market stress or volatility,” said Fitch, mentioning both USDT and also the potential impact of the Facebook-launched Diem project (formerly known as Libra).  Tether, which was fined $42 million last week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over misleading claims about the stablecoin’s backing, holds about half of its $62.8 billion of reserves in commercial paper, according to a disclosure made by the company in June.  Carpe diem  The prospective launch of Diem’s dollar-backed stablecoin could further spur the sector’s market value growth, according to Fitch.  Diem had previously proposed to hold at least 80% of its reserves in short-term high-quality government securities and the remaining 20% in cash, noted Fitch, with overnight sweeps into daily liquid government money market funds.  “We believe it will not directly affect the CP market due to the government-securities focus of Diem’s declared reserve allocation plan, but alternative allocation strategies remain possible and, depending on its scale, the operator may become an important participant in other short-term markets,” Fitch said.  Fitch did not respond to interview requests by publication time.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | SPONSORED | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/18/stablecoins-like-tether-could-pose-new-risks-to-securities-markets-warns-fitch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/987f3618977ef7f03d0c20df50f67032d0673f5c-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The figure is 30% higher than for all of 2020, the City of London Police said Monday.  The U.K.’s national reporting center for fraud and cyber crime, Action Fraud, has received 7,118 reports of crypto fraud since the start of the year, equating to an average loss of over £20,500 ($28,000) each time.  Detective Chief Inspector Craig Mullish described the significant increase in crypto fraud over recent years as “unsurprising,” given the increased time that people are spending online.  One of the most common methods of defrauding victims is through a fake celebrity endorsement, in which pictures of well-known figures accompany advertising for fraudulent schemes in order to make them appear legitimate.  Action Fraud received 558 such investment-fraud reports between April 2020 and March 2021, with 79% of them involving crypto.

The round was led by Konvoy Ventures and Pantera Capital with investments from Alameda Research, Old Fashion Research, Solana Capital, Xoogler Ventures, Mechanism Capital and Animoca Brands.  The game pulls data from users’ phones and wearable fitness devices to convert steps taken in the physical world into rewards within the game. Genopets CEO Albert Chen said in a press release he wants the game to provide “passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay physically active.”  Unlike the popular GameFi title “Axie Infinity,” where users must purchase three NFT characters that can cost hundreds and even thousands of dollars before starting the game, the NFTs required to begin Genopets will be free to mint.  After minting, users can choose to purchase a virtual “habitat” for their characters to expedite the earning process. Once the habitat is purchased, a marketplace of additional NFT items becomes available.  By combining free-to-play and play-to-earn style gameplay, Genopets is looking to bridge the gap between crypto and non-crypto gamers to attract a mainstream audience. The company also foresees future partnerships between “move-to-earn” style games and wearable tech companies, Chen told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Play-to-earn pinpointed an intersection of gaming and blockchain that has struck a chord with users: earning real money proportional to in-game performance,” said Pantera Capital Partner Paul Veradittakit. “This is a trend we’ve been monitoring very closely.

ProShares filed for its Bitcoin Strategy ETF this past summer. The fund is linked to bitcoin futures that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  With the SEC mulling dozens of bitcoin ETFs, Chairman Gary Gensler has made it clear that funds linked to the futures market rather than the underlying asset were more likely to win regulatory approval.  “This is an exciting step but not the last,” Douglas Yones, head of exchange-traded products at the NYSE, told the New York Times’ DealBook,  News of long-awaited approval for a bitcoin-related ETF sent the world’s largest crypto by market value to levels not seen since April. Bitcoin climbed above $60,000 for the first time in nearly six months on Friday.

The newly formed HBAR Foundation has set aside $2.5 billion worth of Hedera’s native currency to dole out as ecosystem grants, a significant portion of which will be dedicated to DeFi development and onboarding, according to a press release.  Enterprise attraction  As well as breaking new ground in DeFi, the introduction of USDC will also vitalize the enterprise players that run nodes on Hashgraph – Hedera’s Governing Council includes Google, IBM, Boeing and Deutsche Telekom, to name a few. Higdon said it could also bolster use cases like securitization and ledger-based supply-chain platforms.  USDC creator Circle knows that integrating its $30 billion-in-circulation digital dollar into blockchains like Solana and Algorand has coincided with accelerated growth of DeFi and NFT platforms on these platforms.  That said, the Circle team, being somewhat accustomed to DeFi and the endless promise of an NFT-fueled metaverse, was attracted by Hedera’s enterprise achievements and the prospect of USDC being used in permissioned settings.  “We decided to prioritize Hedera Hashgraph earlier this year because we felt it has the power for more enterprise use of USDC, and interesting features for the build-out of more enterprise applications,” Circle VP of Product Joao Reginatto said in an interview.  Hedera becomes the sixth blockchain on which Circle supports USDC. In July, Tron joined Ethereum, Algorand, Stellar and Solana shortly after Circle announced plans to expand USDC to roughly 10 more networks.",POSITIVE,HBAR | USDC,ALGO | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | HBAR | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/18/usdc-added-to-hedera-hashgraph-as-enterprise-minded-network-eyes-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff20dcdc35d547860c8ad6486814ba8fbab8d78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412142,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIg9L,1634545984,CME Sees Record Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures Ahead of ETF Debut,"The amount of money locked in the bitcoin futures contracts on the global derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged to record highs on Friday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) tied to the cryptocurrency.  The dollar value of open interest (OI), or the number of futures contracts traded but not liquidated with an offsetting position, stood at $3.64 billion on Friday, marking a more than doubling for the month, according to data provided by bybt. The previous lifetime high of $3.26 billion was recorded during the bull market frenzy in February.  Glassnode data shows the total number of outstanding contracts on the CME has increased by 60% to 56,410. The spread between the CME-based front-month futures contract, also known as premium or basis, and the spot price has surged from an annualized 1% to over 16% this month alongside bitcoin’s 40% rally to $62,000.  Activity on the CME has picked up amid increased expectations that in the upcoming weeks several futures-based ETFs may begin trading in the U.S., as well as stronger participation from state-side institutional investors.  “Speculation about an imminent futures ETF really took off last week as the SEC had been uncharacteristically quiet ahead of the approval deadline for the first of the ETFs on October 18,” said Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant.  “U.S. institutions, in particular, have been fueling the rally as evidenced by activity on the CME and the basis flippening on the CME over the retail-led exchanges,” Reyes added.  Activity on the other exchanges have also picked up, albeit at a slower rate, as evidenced from the CME’s jump to the number two position on the list of the biggest bitcoin futures exchanges by open interest.  The exchange was the fourth largest last month. Total futures open interest (OI) across the globe has also risen to over $23 billion for the first time in five months.  “BTC futures OI has reached highs not seen since May, highlighting growing expectations of the listing in the U.S. of BTC futures ETF,” said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading. “One difference between now and then is the higher weighting (11% vs 17%) of cash-margined futures, implying lower leverage overall in the market.”  The impending futures-based ETFs from ProShares, Invesco, Valkyrie and others will invest in regulated bitcoin futures contracts like those trading on the CME instead of buying the actual cryptocurrency.  While the approval of futures-based ETFs is being widely hailed as an open door for more mainstream money, some observers are still skeptical.  “Demand for these bitcoin futures ETFs is likely to be disappointing. These could be of interest to a limited audience of institutions that can’t hold spot or derivatives directly, as well as retail investors that prefer the familiarity and convenience of ETFs,” Acheson said.  “Most investors, however, are more likely to continue to access BTC exposure through spot or derivatives, or through any of the many listed securities or international funds that offer spot BTC exposure,” Acheson added.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $60,800 representing a 1% drop on the day.  Also read: Dying for a Bitcoin Futures ETF?
