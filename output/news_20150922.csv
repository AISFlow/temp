42398691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMVJ,1442959443,Barry Silbert: Private Blockchains Will 'Capitulate' to Bitcoin,"Wall Street is increasingly expressing an enthusiasm for applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology, but according to venture capitalist Barry Silbert, the attention of the traditional financial community has so far fallen on its more problematic implementations.  Most of his investments, Silbert explained, have been on what he considers the two most prominent of its three use cases: as a store of value and a payments rail.  ""I didn't expect the ledger would be embraced first,"" he said in a new interview.  Silbert told CoinDesk:  ""I'm surprised they honed in on that first. A private federated blockchain doesn't solve any major problems and ultimately I don't have a high level of optimism it's going to succeed. I'm surprised they haven't figured that out yet and I'm surprised they are doing that first.""  The founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Silbert has so far invested in 56 companies in the bitcoin and blockchain space, with the full list of names spanning 19 of the 26 letters of the alphabet. One of the industry's earliest investors, Silbert has also been one of technology's most vocal evangelists, launching an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk (Genesis Trading) and a private investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust (managed by Grayscale Investments).  The new comments come amid a spike in interest in use cases for the blockchain, the distributed ledger system underpinning the bitcoin network. However, this has coincided with increasing attention to private blockchains and distributed ledger systems such as those being offered by startups such as Digital Asset Holdings, Eris Ltd and R3CEV.  Such blockchain products are primarily aimed at helping banks better facilitate information flows through shared databases and as a way to settle and clear transactions. Still, Silbert doesn't believe it's any weakness in the technology that will hold back such attempts. Rather, he believes the open-source nature of bitcoin makes it a superior solution.  ""The rail is working today ... whereas these ideas around federated blockchain, any time you put two banks in a room, let alone nine, it's a setup for a disaster or a long process,"" Silbert said, hinting at the recent partnership between R3CEV and nine major banks.  Federated blockchain projects, as described in the book Digital Gold by New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper, attempt to replace bitcoin's distributed network with a system of proprietary computers that process transactions.  ""What will likely happen is there will be a lot of interest, a lot of discussion, and I think you'll see some money get deployed, but they will capitulate and shift their attention back to the bitcoin blockchain or some decentralized blockchain solution,"" he continued.  The remarks come as part of the first wide-ranging interview between the investor and CoinDesk in which he spoke at length of the changing dynamics of the bitcoin ecosystem.  Scalability concerns  One of the most notable of Silbert's remarks was his characterization of the bitcoin network as one that, while struggling to come to consensus on issues such as the size of transaction blocks, is more reliable in its governance than any alternatives.  Despite the diversity of opinions in the bitcoin community, most recently on display at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Montreal, he said the open-source community has shown it is capable of solving hard problems and advancing the network.  ""The reason they're looking to do these private blockchains is because they have concerns about bitcoin's security or reliability,"" Silbert said. ""Those will all get addressed by time, as these groups come up with a solution.""  When asked whether DCG intended to increase its support financially for developers in the face of these concerns, Silbert cited his ongoing support of industry think tank Coin Center while expressing an overall optimism about the robustness of the development community.  ""We invest in and we build companies,"" Silbert said. ""We don't have on-staff developers at the DCG level to commit or test code. It's not the role we play, but I think it's very important.""  He suggested that he would consider ways to support development that fall within the scope of its role in the industry, adding: ""I think the pressure should create some opportunity to financially support core development.""  Speculation and greed  Silbert further addressed comments made at the American Banker Digital Currencies + the Blockchain Conference this July, in which he appealed to the audience that one of bitcoin's central strengths was that it provided holders with a financial incentive to support the network.  Rather than characterizing the statements as part of a wider branding pitch for the industry, he suggested that greed and speculation are simply a reality of how the system works, one that has historically served the network well by increasing adoption and promoting evangelization.  [post-quote]  ""Many people involved in bitcoin today got their first exposure to it through the expectation and the hope that they would buy it and that the price would go up,"" he continued. ""What I have seen is the people who do that tend to become avid readers and followers of the space, they tend to start to understand the opportunity that exists for bitcoin as a rail and ledger system.""  He framed bitcoin's increase to a peak above $1,000 as a positive instigator of change, suggesting that there are now ""five times"" the bitcoin owners because of the market activity, and that this event bolstered the ability of firms such as Coinbase and Circle to obtain investment.  However, Silbert suggested that he believes another similar price increase would likely be needed for wider adoption in the future. Greed and speculation, he said, could be viewed as positives provided they result in more liquidity in the market.  ""All of the great things that bitcoin can be, all of that is not possible unless the money supply, the amount of bitcoin in circulation is much higher and the trading in and out of currencies is more common,"" he said, adding:  ""You can create real issues for Western Union but it's not possible with [the price of] bitcoin at $230.""  Over time, he said, the market will need to create incentivizes for users to join that go beyond ""the wealth effect"". These included having merchants offer reduced prices for bitcoin.  Long-term view  In 10 years, however, Silbert doesn't believe bitcoin's low value relative to fiat currencies will continue to be an issue.  ""What I do know is that with Wall Street's awareness in blockchain as a first step and the amount of money that is being deployed in trading strategies, it will not take a lot of that money moving into bitcoin to create positive price momentum,"" he continued.  As for how consumers will interact with bitcoin, and whether they will know that their use of certain products would create demand in the digital currency's markets, Silbert was less clear.  ""On the currency store of value side of things you know you have bitcoin exposure, on the rail you may or may not know, on the ledger you won't know,"" he said.  Silbert suggested he believes more companies using bitcoin as a means to send money would begin moving the currency to the background of the user interface. The statement follows public decisions by bitcoin services provider Circle and social tipping network ChangeTip to follow such a strategy.  He expects bitcoin would likely be front-and-center for investors using the technology as a scarce commodity akin to gold, a use case he still feels is among the more compelling.  ""We will get to a point in time where ... you'll hold some portion of their wealth in bitcoin similarly to gold. For people in emerging markets, in my opinion, it's better than gold because it has utility,"" he continued.  Cautious market  Silbert also spoke about how he believes recent trends in VC funding don't speak to any larger conclusions about the technology. Just because use cases for bitcoin as a currency or payments rail may not be getting investment attention today, he said, that doesn't mean investors aren't watching.  However, he did suggest that investors are taking their time, allowing winners who can prove they can navigate the current challenging market to emerge.  ""I wouldn't take that and believe there's not a significant amount of interest in the space, just because there haven't been announcements recently,"" he said. ""There's a lot of interest in things other than blockchain for Wall Street.""  Silbert also indicated that much of this attention is now focused on areas where market leaders haven't emerged. For example, he cited BitPay's processing service and Coinbase's wallet offering as products with enough traction to ensure that the companies behind them were unlikely to be displaced.  ""The areas most interesting to VCs are going to be the 2.0 apps, the Abras of the world, and teams like Blythe Masters' team [at Digital Asset Holdings], entrepreneurs with big markets looking to solve big problems,"" he continued.  Immediate opportunities  In regards for the health of its startups, DCG suggested that it has amassed data on how to determine whether its companies' strategies are working, and that this is guiding strategy.  This includes assessing positive growth rates, how much money firms should expect to earn off customers, the onboarding cost for these customers and the places it feels represent the biggest global opportunities for the technology.  Elsewhere, he said DCG is looking at use cases of the bitcoin blockchain for settlement, attempting to ""understand who the players are and what they're looking to achieve"".  Still, he said that he feels like creative products that leverage the strength of the bitcoin network are first and foremost on the radar.  ""We are spending more time looking at businesses like Abra that are building products on top of what's been built that wouldn't have been possible before,"" he continued. ""Then we're also looking at unique use cases of the bitcoin blockchain, Filament, non-financial applications of the bitcoin ledger system.""  Citing DCG's investment in Ripple Labs, he also suggested investments in companies providing alternative ledgers wasn't ""out of the question"".  He concluded:  ""I've never been more confident about bitcoin's leadership position, but we're interested and excited about up-and-coming technologies and approaches. We're not a fund, we're a company.""  Disclaimer: Digital Currency Group is an investor in CoinDesk.

42398686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMOQ,1442952344,New Hampshire Bitcoin Tax Bill Facing Defeat,"A New Hampshire legislative subcommittee has recommended that the state's House of Representatives kill a bill that, if enacted, would allow citizens to pay their taxes with bitcoin.  The bill, filed by state representative Eric Schleien earlier this year, calls for the state treasury to select a third-party service through which it could accept bitcoin, with New Hampshire receiving US dollars in return.  A subcommittee formed to debate the issue recommended that the bill be voted ""ineligible to legislate"", a move that, if confirmed by the House, would shelve the bill. However, the measure could be taken up during the new legislative session next year.  Rep. Bill Ohm, who sits on the state's Ways and Means Committee, told CoinDesk in an email that the subcommittee voted against the measure in part because of what he called ""liquidation risk"".  ""The treasurer, Bill Dwyer, testified that he needs to pay the state's bills in currency (federal funds, etc), and bitcoin is a commodity that needs to be liquidated for the state to use to pay it's bills,"" he said.  Ohm added that he shared Dwyer's position on the risk of the state's handling of bitcoin, explaining:  ""Beyond that, I object to barter transactions involving the State that have no intrinsic value. Commodities such as gold bars, corn, wheat, chickens or cows have some intrinsic value in [New Hampshire] and can be auctioned off to an identified market when all else fails. Should the market for bitcoin collapse, like the market for our former toll road tokens, the State is likely stuck with worthless inventory.""  Ohm stressed that no final determination has been made. The Ways and Means Committee will meet on 14th October to vote on its final recommendation, which will then move to the full House for a final vote on the measure.  Andrew Hemingway, a supporter of the bill who ran for state governor last year, expressed his disappointment about the subcommittee's recommendation.  ""It is killed. I am a supporter of the bill. I am disappointed by the committee's actions and find them short sighted in the face of a new emerging economy... It's a dreadful decision,"" he said.  The news comes after California's AB-1326 bill, which sought to regulate digital currency businesses, was shelved by a state senator.  Stan Higgins co-wrote this report.

42398682,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMMS,1442945894,European Banking Federation Recommends Bitcoin Regulation,"A major European banking trade group has called for governments and businesses to develop regulatory solutions for cryptocurrencies.  The European Banking Federation (EBF), a group representing thousands of the continent's largest banking groups, recently released its vision for a digital revamp of the banking system. Included in its proposals are several recommendations to policymakers regarding bitcoin and the blockchain.  The group points to the blockchain as an innovation that ""provides a number of interesting opportunities both for financial institutions individually and for the collective ecosystem"".  The EBF proposal states that bitcoin should be regulated through the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework and the application of existing anti-money laundering statutes to digital currency transactions. It also recommended further research into the technology so ongoing evaluations of rule-making can be made.  Despite calling for digital currency transactions to be regulated to the same degree as traditional currency transactions, the EBF's manifesto noted that ""maintaining innovation should remain however a prerequisite for the development of crypto-technologies"".  The document also points to some of the potential pay-offs of the technology's wider adoption, stating:  “Using such technology offers clear opportunities to reduce costs of moving and handling money, to secure consumer spending and to introduce greater liquidity to the market. It also improves offers of products and services and increases banks' velocity in all their activities.”  Yet the group appears to dismiss the prospects of bitcoin's use case as a currency, calling its future ""unclear"".  ""'Bitcoin' cryptocurrency represents probably one of the most well-known examples of crypto-technology,"" the report states. ""However, its future as a currency is unclear, given that it was built as an experiment.""

42398684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMPP,1442934718,Australian Bank Bitcoin Crackdown Could Fuel Startup Flight,"A bitcoin business in Australia is eyeing banking opportunities abroad following a perceived crackdown from banks in the country.  The comments, made by Andrew Smith, the general manager of BuyaBitcoin follow on from reports that various Australian banks have decided to shut the accounts of some 17 bitcoin operating businesses.  Smith confirmed that BuyaBitcoin – founded in 2014 – had ""experienced bank closures in Australia recently"". He told CoinDesk:  ""It's an Australia industry-wide issue. We are not in a position to comment on the specifics ... We are currently looking at opportunities outside of Australia (such as the UK) as the banking community is more open to innovation and exploring new technologies such as the bitcoin space.""  According to the report by the Australian Financial Review, approximately 17 bitcoin companies in the country received letters from two of Australia's biggest banks – Westpac Banking Corporation and Commonwealth Bank of Australia – notifying them that their bank accounts would be closed without further explanation.  Thirteen of these companies, the report says, have already had their accounts closed.  A spokesperson from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia told CoinDesk that it was unable to comment on individual customers, but added that ""Commonwealth Bank consistently serves each customer on a case-by-case basis"".  CoinDesk reached out to Westpac for comment but no reply had been received at the time of press.  Possible investigation  Today also saw the emergence of an additional report which suggested that Australia's Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is considering investigating the actions of Australia banks for shutting down the accounts of bitcoin businesses, prompted by Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan – who reportedly urged the ACCC to check whether the banks actions had resulted in anti-competitive behaviour.  A spokesperson for the ACCC said they had no further comment at this stage.  Further news from Australia indicates that individual bitcoin traders – as well as businesses – had also been affected by bank's allegedly refusing to do business with them.  Australian banks and crypto  The reports come after the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced in May that it was planning on using Ripple technology to facilitate payments between its subsidiaries and described distributed protocols as ""the way of the future"".

42426505,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtIth,1442921978,Coinbase Files 9 Patents for Bitcoin Products,"Bitcoin services firm Coinbase has filed nine patent applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  The USPTO – the agency responsible for issuing patents to investors and businesses as well as registering product and intellectual property trademarks – received the submissions on 17th March this year.  According to the filings  , published this month, Coinbase submitted patent applications for various products including a hot bitcoin wallet, an instant exchange (which the company launched in June), a bitcoin exchange, a bitcoin tipping button alongside two off- and on-blockchain transaction systems.  Although published by the USPTO, Coinbase's applications are still pending approval, a process which Eitan Jankelewitz, a solicitor at London-based law firm Sheridans, said can take years.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The process seeks to establish that the invention is patentable (some things, such as abstract ideas, aren't patentable). Then the 'novelty' of the invention is considered – if the invention was known/or available to the public, it won't be patentable. It has to be new.""  The USPTO process also allows the public to oppose patents if they believe the application in question is not justified.  Business necessity  Speaking to the bitcoin community on Reddit, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong defended the company's decision to file for patent protection, an often contentious subject in the largely open-source community.  Armstrong further told CoinDesk that the intent is not for the patents to be used to push out smaller competitors.  ""While it would be irresponsible for Coinbase not to apply for patents (we need to protect ourselves from larger companies engaging in patent warfare), we can certainly commit to not using patents offensively against smaller companies,"" he said.  The CEO went on to say that while he does not personally believe in software patents, the company would invest effort in ensuring it would ""play nice"" while navigating the realities of the patent space.  Patents in crypto  Coinbase – which has raised $106.7m in venture funding to date – is not the only company applying for crypto-related patents.  Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported that the USPTO had published a patent filed by US financial services giant Bank of America which attempted to protect a cryptocurrency-based wire system.  Additional crypto-related patent applications have been submitted by the likes of Mastercard and IBM, while online shopping giant Amazon was awarded a bitcoin-related cloud computing patent in May last year.

42426522,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJFh,1442915493,Circle Granted First BitLicense by NYDFS,"Bitcoin wallet Circle says it has become the first company to receive a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  According to a blog post from the company today, Circle will now be able to serve customers in New York under the divisive regulatory framework, applications for which closed on 8th August.  In conjunction with news, the company is releasing a host of updates to its iOS, Android and web apps, now named 'Circle Pay'.  Alongside other functionality, Circle customers in the US can now hold, send and request dollars from their contacts and refuel their account by bank transfer or credit card.
