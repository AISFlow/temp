At least two different victims have paid hundreds of dollars in bitcoin and ether to these crooks and contacted us only after realizing something was wrong.      To be clear: CoinDesk does not, and will never, accept payment for coverage.      If you are being contacted by someone claiming to be one of our reporters on Telegram or LinkedIn, and that person asks for payment, know the account reaching out is a fraud. Please report it to the relevant social media platform, and to us right away, by emailing fraud@coindesk.com and nik@coindesk.com. If possible, please include screenshots of what was written.      If you need to confirm you are, in fact, communicating with a CoinDesk staffer please email news@coindesk.com or check our masthead.    Why are we writing this?    Scams and crypto go hand in hand. We hate that this is the case but it is the truth. Now that CoinDesk has been implicated in a number of scams, we’d like to explain what is being done and how.      Most of the victims receive a Telegram message like this one:      The back and forth between the scammer and the news editor is usually friendly and, in some countries where organizations often pay for news coverage, expected. The opportunity is simple: Send the scammer $500 or so in bitcoin and get onto CoinDesk’s front page.      Some of these scammers have gotten sophisticated to the point where they are spoofing CoinDesk email addresses to “verify” their identities (check the headers of these emails!). One con artist even forged a CoinDesk editor’s passport to “confirm” their identity.      One of the victims requested $150 in USDC to be sent to this address: 0x586Cb8bd74D6A6d69EC3AF69914eE478Ddfd4eeE.      One scammer went so far as to create an invoice for their victim to further lend the offer credibility.      CoinDesk is working with our legal counsel and tech team to find ways of thwarting these impostors.      In the meantime, please verify the handles of the accounts reaching out to you. CoinDesk’s reporters and editors list their digital accounts on their individual author pages.      You should also email the writer or editor directly if you have any questions.      Other scams    More recently, CoinDesk was made aware that our daily newsletter, Blockchain Bites, is being copied to promote questionable cryptocurrency giveaways. For the record, CoinDesk does not promote such giveaways, and certainly not in our newsletters.    Why you shouldn’t pay for coverage … ever    We understand marketing is hard for a startup. In a world full of good ideas, how do you make your voice heard?      Paying for coverage isn’t one of them. In the years we’ve been writing, many “PR people” have approached startups with sure-fire ways to appear on the front pages of multiple big organizations. Some of these people are outright frauds. Some of them will actively reach out to editors on your behalf and tell them you are building something cool and that they should write about you. The chance you will get a post out of that interaction ranges from zero to a few percents, especially if the PR person has a prior relationship with that reporter.      What is the best way to reach out to any reporter?      Prepare an email that says,“Hey, I’m doing something cool. I’m the CEO of [your company], a company in [place]. It is a [what your project does.] Can I show you how it works?”      Include a link and screenshots. Research reporters who might be interested in your topic. Find their emails, Twitter handles, etc.      Reach out exactly three times. If they don’t respond, move on. That, in short, is the best strategy for reaching out to any reporter, including ones at CoinDesk.      The bottom line?      Never pay for coverage. Never expect coverage in return for tokens or cash. Avoid any news outlet that asks for payment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ZRX,"Nikhilesh De, John Biggs, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/09/dont-fall-for-it-scammers-are-impersonating-coindesk-staff-on-social-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3292bac912b30049687dfc05878c4b8142b6b103-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN37Dh,1581238827,Coronavirus Checks China's Blockchain Ambitions,"James Cooper is a Professor of Law at California Western School of Law in San Diego.      It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of non-reciprocal trade. American nuts are to be sold en masse to the Chinese as part of the extra $200 billion worth of extra U.S. goods that the mainland promised to purchase – $40 billion of that from U.S. agricultural producers. At least that was what the new trade deal between China and the United States (so-called “Phase I”) provided for, in part.      Zhu Min, Chairman of China’s National Institute of Financial Research, looked relaxed at the Tradeshift Reserve Café on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in January, as he explained that Phase I would result in trade distortion. In agreeing to buy more U.S. agricultural goods than it needs, China has to divert its consumption of these agricultural goods away from other countries. Goodbye nuts from Australia, New Zealand and Brazil; hello nuts from California and Georgia. China agreed to cut tariffs on more than 17,000 products it imports from the United States. It would also do more to protect the intellectual property rights of U.S. corporations. The trade war was over, at least until Phase II negotiations would start later in 2020.      And then suddenly, due to the Coronavirus, China is closing up shop. Just as the Phase I agreement on trade was de-escalating the seemingly endless rounds of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, the virus was spreading around Wuhan and beyond Hubei province. The day Min spoke in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus, ordered an indefinite transportation blockade around central Hubei province.      This crisis happened just as China began its national experiment into a digital currency/electronic payment system with testing in Suzhou and Shenzhen. On October 24, 2019, a day now called “China Blockchain Day” – President Xi Jinping announced his country’s blockchain strategy. It would be about interoperability. By layering insurance, healthcare, finance, energy, and consumer purchasing into one unified blockchain, there will be economies of scale and more efficient distribution of private and public goods.    It only works if people are back on the streets spending money and in the factories, dockyards, and offices earning it.    But that will only work if people are back on the streets spending money and in the factories, dockyards, and offices earning it. It will be difficult to develop dependable and bankable use cases for China’s new RMB-backed digital currency when everyone is locked up at home under curfew due to the Coronavirus outbreak and containment strategy. As of writing, 28,000 people in the country have been infected and the Coronavirus is sure to become one of China’s growth industries this year.      With all the Chinese factories, schools, and offices extending the vacation period of the Lunar New Year, there will be more economic pain. Even Apple announced it was closing all its stores for an extra week and the company’s corporate offices have also been temporarily shuttered. Levi Strauss, McDonald’s. and Starbucks, all major U.S. brands doing big business on the mainland, have followed the Chinese government’s lead and closed their respective retail outlets.      Most airlines have suspended flights to and from the beleaguered country. Travelers from China, assuming they can make their way out of China and into the U.S. are viewed with great suspicion, if not fear. The Chinese government has openly criticized Western countries for border restrictions and flight cancellations, complaining that President Trump is overreacting.      When China gets a virus, the rest of the world gets sick too. The People’s Republic accounts for nearly 20 percent of the globe’s gross domestic product and 30 percent of global economic growth. The second largest economic power in the world is still rebounding from economic difficulties that were exacerbated in its trade war with the United States. The Coronavirus will further stall growth – both on the mainland and around the world. This was the experience with SARS some 18 years ago. Back then the Chinese economy was a fraction of what it is today and it did not control the global supply chain.      This crisis could be far worse – both in terms of death and in terms of economic damage. The Coronavirus could set back China’s ambitions to dominate the next era of technology - in artificial intelligence, 5G, robotics, semiconductor chips to name a few industries - but it could also lead to better U.S.-China relations and smoother distribution of medicine through collaborative blockchain projects.
