42401672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23c8,1532259656,"Mastercard Had An Outage, So Crypto Had a Field Day","Payments giant Mastercard suffered a severe outage last week that led to a hold-up in transactions.  As reported on July 12 by the Financial Times, it had a global impact, sparking a round of complaints from the payment firm's customer base.  As might be expected, those affected quickly took to social media to voice their frustration with the credit card giant, which eventually was able to resolve the situation and resume service for its customers.  In most cases, that would have been the end of the story. This time, however, Crypto Twitter took notice, and that made all the difference for what was likely a hectic day for the credit card giant's press team.  In fact, the company's Twitter threads soon filled up with comments from cryptocurrency supporters and enthusiasts, who were all too eager to point out the perceived benefits of their preferred payments rail.  What could be considered an inevitable question was eventually posed: why isn't Mastercard using bitcoin?  To be sure, the payments firm has very publicly moved to explore and test applications of blockchain, even going so far as trying to hire more developers to work on the tech. And as CoinDesk has reported, Mastercard is seeking a number of patents around cryptocurrency use (including one it won this week) – a suggestion, if anything, that the idea is on its radar.  But even still, critics of the company argued amid the outage that Mastercard will face a ""huge rival"" from either bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.  Supporters of specific cryptocurrencies also came out to heckle the payments giant, including supporters of XRP and the technology developed by distributed ledger startup Ripple, and those backing the cryptocurrency Dash (formerly known as darkcoin).  But would the utilization of blockchain or cryptocurrency have prevented the situation Mastercard found itself in?  Journalist David Cox tackled the question in an article for PaymentsSource, arguing that existing blockchain tech would likely be infeasible for Mastercard's present needs.  Whether the technology as applied to Mastercard could have helped is perhaps an open question, but nonetheless, the situation was an opportunity for the crypto faithful to throw a little shade the company's way.

42421897,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwpEj,1532257233,Crypto Trading 101: Stochastic Oscillators and Price Momentum,"You may have heard of a lagging or leading indicator before. Maybe your friends have tossed around terms like bullish or bearish divergences, oversold or overbought conditions and what signals you should use to enter or exit the market.  While there are many tools that can assist with this, one often overlooked indicator is called the stochastic oscillator.  Nothing unique to the world of blockchain, the stochastic is a momentum indicator that compares the closing price of the asset with its high-low range over a certain period of time, it's a handy tool. Even better, it works no matter the volatility, even in the fast-moving market for cryptocurrencies.  First, the particulars require a bit of math:  Slow %K= 100 [Sum of the (C - L14) for the %K Slowing Period / Sum of the (H14 – L14) for the %K Slowing Period]  Slow %D = SMA of Slow %K  Where:  C = Latest Close  L14 = Lowest low for the last 14 periods  H14 = Highest high for the same 14 periods  %K Slowing Period = 3.  Fortunately, crypto traders need not worry about the calculation part, as the trading platforms and chart softwares process the complex formula and produce a stochastic oscillator, as seen in the chart below.  All you need to know is how to use the oscillator to maximize your efforts.  Reading the Stochastic Oscillator  To start with, the indicator can range from 0 to 100. The area above 80 represents overbought conditions, and the area below 20 indicates oversold conditions.  So, price rallies usually stall after the stochastic reaches an overbought zone. On the other hand, stochastics reporting oversold conditions are widely considered a sign the bears have reached a point of exhaustion.  Further, trend reversal signal occurs when the %K line and the %D line cross in the overbought (above 80.00) or oversold (below 20.00) region.  Buy signal = %K line crosses %D line from below in the oversold territory.  Sell Signal = %K line crosses %D line from above in the overbought territory.  The above chart shows, bitcoin dropped 11% after the stochastic generated a sell signal on June 9. Further, it rallied more than 8 percent after the stochastic charted a buy signal on June 29 (green arrow).  Note that stochastic tends to work best in broad trading ranges or slow-moving trends.  Stochastic: a leading indicator  Still, the stochastic is one tool of many.  The difference between a leading indicator such as the stochastic or Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a lagging indicator such as Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands is that the leading indicators precede price movements, while lagging indicators follow price movements.  Their usage also differs during trending and non-trending periods because lagging indicators tend to focus more on the trend and produce fewer buy and sell signals than their leading counterparts.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-trading-101-stochastic-oscillators-and-price-momentum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d1d10b4269a3222fccda564d6627bb15b4c01ab-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
