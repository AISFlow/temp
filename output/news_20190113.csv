42430105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKjh,1547392537,Bitcoin Will Still Bite the Dust,"Kevin Dowd is a Professor of Finance and Economics in the Business School at Durham University, and the co-author of the 2015 paper ""Bitcoin Will Bite the Dust.""  For more on bitcoin’s 10th anniversary, check out our new interactive feature Bitcoin At 10.    —————————————————————    Back in August 2014, I discovered that the bitcoin mining industry had the industrial structure of a natural monopoly. A natural monopoly is a market in which production is most efficient with a single producer.  This discovery came as a shock, but the implication was clear: Bitcoin could not survive in the long run. As a check, I field tested my reasoning on various people who are economically literate. None disagreed.  When I first arrived at that conclusion, bitcoin's price was $379. Since then, its price rose to nearly £20,000 and has since fallen to a value $3,621 at the time of writing.  Does the subsequent price behavior of bitcoin mean my prediction was wrong? No. I still think that the long-run equilibrium price of bitcoin is zero. It just hasn’t bitten the dust yet.  My reasoning is based on two simple economic arguments. The first is that the bitcoin mining industry is a natural monopoly and a natural monopoly undermines bitcoin’s core value proposition. The second is that in markets with zero regulatory entry barriers, an inferior product cannot survive long-term. Either of these arguments is sufficient to produce my conclusion that the price of bitcoin must go to zero in the long term.  Together, they are more than sufficient to establish that conclusion.  I have also yet to hear a single intelligent challenge to this argument from the bitcoin community. Instead, the typical response has been personal abuse. Name-calling is no substitute for a reasoned response, however.  Let’s consider these two arguments in turn.  Bitcoin mining is a natural monopoly  To work as intended, the bitcoin system requires atomistic competition on the part of the miners who validate transactions blocks in their search for newly minted bitcoins. However, the mining industry is characterized by large economies of scale.  Indeed, these economies of scale are so large that the industry is a natural monopoly. The problem is that atomistic competition and a natural monopoly are inconsistent: the built-in centralization tendencies of the natural monopoly mean that mining firms will become bigger and bigger – and eventually produce an actual monopoly unless the system collapses before then.  The implication is that the bitcoin system is not sustainable. Since what cannot go on will stop, one must conclude that the bitcoin system will inevitably collapse. The only question is when.  I could go on at length about how this centralizing tendency will eventually destroy every single component of the bitcoin value proposition, knocking them down like a row of dominos: the first domino to fall will be distributed trust, Bitcoin’s most notable attraction; the system will then come to depend on trust in the dominant player not to abuse its power.  This player will become a point of failure for the system as a whole, so the ""no single point of failure"" feature of the system will also disappear. Then pseudo-anonymity will go, as the dominant player will be forced to impose the usual anti-anonymity regulations justified as means to stop money laundering and such like, but which are really intended to destroy financial privacy.  Even the bitcoin protocol, the constitution of the system, will eventually be subverted. Every component of the bitcoin value proposition will be destroyed. The bitcoin system will then become a house of cards: there will be nothing left within the system to maintain confidence in the system.  An inferior product cannot survive  There is also the argument that the price of bitcoin must go to zero because an inferior product cannot survive long-term in the absence of regulatory barriers to entry.  Imagine you have a market with no entry barriers. The first firm to enter the market has 100 percent of the market share, as bitcoin once did. Competitors then come along and make inroads into the market.  Some of these offer products that are superior to the product produced by the first firm, not least because their producers have learned from some of the design flaws in the first firm’s product. And eventually superior rivals displace it completely and the market share of the first product goes to zero.  There is some evidence to suggest that this process is at work in the bitcoin market: according to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market had fallen to 94.29 percent by April 28, 2013 (the first date for which they provide data) to 52.29 percent by today.  This fall has not been uniform – we would not expect that – but the direction of travel is clear: bitcoin is losing its market share. Whether its market share will continue this downward trend and gradually fade out or suddenly go pop is another issue. I suspect the end will come when something triggers a selloff that leads the Bitcoin price to fall its natural long-run level, zero.  The history of innovation also supports my belief that bitcoin cannot last indefinitely.  The innovators – the early movers in a market – rarely survive long-term under conditions of free entry. An example is the Ford Model T. This automobile was first produced in 1908 and soon came to dominate the market. But competitors learned from its design flaws and built better cars, which eventually stole its market share. The Ford Model T now survives only as an antique.  The difference between the Ford Model T and bitcoin, however, is that bitcoin has no antique value. Do I still think that bitcoin will bite the dust? You bet.

42430116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKzh,1547384396,The Time Is Now: We Need an Active Approach to Blockchain Inclusion,"Alexis Gauba is co-founder at she256, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity and breaking down barriers to entry in the blockchain space, and Mechanism Labs, which is conducting blockchain based research experiments in the domains of distributed consensus, scalability, and usability.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Blockchain technology has been challenging norms and pushing boundaries since its inception, and 2018 was no different. We saw a selection of projects on bleeding-edge frontiers, unlocking ideas that didn’t previously exist and actions that simply weren’t possible before.  This struck me personally. When I got into the space, I was not only fascinated by the technological challenges, but also ideologically drawn to these big ideas of transformative change. This wasn’t merely a subfield of computer science, but a generational movement.  Throughout all of this, however, it’s crucial to step back and also consider the wider implications of what we’re building. More and more we’re asking, who can really benefit from these technologies? Who are we building this future for? And more often than not, these potential user groups come from all walks of life.  This makes sense. This space is driven by an ethos to enable individuals to take actions they weren’t able to before, to allow for global governance based freedoms and financial autonomy, to build in choices where there may have only been a single, monopolistic option  We are still so early in this process of understanding the best ways to deploy these technologies to positively affect different groups. The thing is, we’ll never get there if we build in silos.  If we want this technology to make up our financial and governance based futures, it is crucial that those building these technologies are representative of the global, diverse population which they are to serve.  Recognizing the problem  However, the diversity gap in tech is widespread. And that doesn’t exclude this space. It’s important to recognize this and to take tangible steps towards closing the gap.  Consistent reminders to take actionable measures are important. Take this as another – what can you do in your community or workplace to break down barriers, to educate, to foster growth?  Going a step further, a vast majority of the population doesn’t understand blockchain technology.  Now, we’re still early, but if this technology is to reach a place where it can be impactful on this scale, it’s crucial to bring more people in and to build real understanding. And this isn’t just technologists, it’s necessary for lawyers, designers, economists, policymakers and more to be well informed and deeply engaged.  The cool thing about this space, though, is that because it’s still in its infancy, we have the opportunity to set a precedent right now, to build in diversity and inclusion as a priority and value from the very beginning. And there are people doing amazing work while also actively prioritizing these values.  But we still have a ways to go. We can do better. We can set a different set of norms if we consciously make an effort.  A firmer resolve  A key blocker on both fronts is the high barrier to entry. Sometimes we want to abstract away “the blockchain,” but if we want global participation in governance processes and contribution to projects, it’s necessary to build bridges and welcome members with open arms.  In order to reduce barriers, we can prioritize beginner friendly resources, use helpful abstractions and clear communication, consciously document our open-source projects in an understandable manner, collaborate to discuss standards, and more.  It starts with building a culture, in workplaces, that fosters mentorship and education. We can think about where we make decisions and discuss issues. If we want people to participate, are they even aware? If so, how can we bring them in? Passively hoping populations who aren’t contributing will somehow join in won’t work.  We need to make it easy, reach out, and be encouraging and welcoming. We need to collaborate and share what we’re doing in our workplaces and communities to empower others and hopefully inspire more people to do the same.  Just as important as laying the foundations for the next generation of these technologies, are the people laying these foundations. Let’s keep the conversation going. Let’s take action.

42430101,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKbh,1547380879,This Scaling Tech Could Let You Sync Bitcoin Straight From Your Phone,"“Maybe we don’t have to store everything ourselves.”  That’s Tadge Dryja, cryptocurrency research scientist at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, explaining the concept behind his bitcoin scaling solution, “utreexo.”  Based on an idea that has been pursued by developers for many years, utreexo seeks to streamline an aspect of bitcoin’s code that leads to heavy storage requirements over time.  Simply put, it addresses what is known as the UTXO set – or the code that gives information on whether a bitcoin has been spent.  Currently, bitcoin nodes must store the entirety of this information, what is known as the “state,” in order to verify it.  With utreexo, though, rather than having to store the entirety of the bitcoin state, bitcoin holders could simply verify if it is correct using a cryptographic proof. This approach could minimize storage requirements to the extent that it might even be possible to run bitcoin on a mobile phone.  Also known as an accumulator, the tech underpinning utreexo isn’t a new idea – developers have been discussing ways to implement similar kinds of code since bitcoin’s early days – but it was previously met with hurdles to implementation.  Now, – due to work by Dryja and others – it is swiftly becoming a reality. In an early prototype, Dryja has created functioning proof-of-concept code.  And he’s not alone. Dryja is joined by cryptography heavyweights Dan Boneh, Benedikt Bünz and Ben Fisch, who have written a paper detailing an alternate accumulator method.  “The high-level goal is basically your phone could run a full node. That is the dream,” Bünz, who is known for his work on bulletproofs, a scaling tech that allowed monero to reduce transaction fees by 96 percent, told CoinDesk.  The paper has even been picked up by ethereum researchers, who are investigating how the technology might apply to layer two scaling solution, Plasma.  And part of this flurry of activity stems from the fact that due to the nature of the technology, it doesn’t require a hard fork – a type of software update that requires unanimous support and participation – in order to safely activate. Instead, accumulators would be deployed at the wallet level, which significantly reduces the hurdle to implementation.  “Hard forks are almost impossible on bitcoin. Soft forks are hard as well,” Bünz said, adding:  “It’s great that we can just deploy it, it makes it a lot easier and it means we can have a competition of ideas.”  Growing bigger  Stepping back, accumulators have been discussed since as early as 2010, however, were previously met with an insurmountable bottleneck – what is known as a bridge node.  And that’s because, in order to function, accumulators require other people within the network to support the software. While previously, this was highly resource-intensive, Dryja has built a bridge node that doesn’t come with additional trade-offs – meaning that accumulators are now feasible for the first time.  According to Dryja, that’s notable because utreexo could address what has been a long-term pressure point for bitcoin: its increasing UTXO set.  UTXO – which stands for unspent transaction output – is the data structure that gives information about all the outstanding bitcoins on the network.  While it is known to fluctuate (the UTXO count actually decreased in 2018), the dataset tends to increase alongside bitcoin’s usage. This means that, if left unchecked, it could continue to grow, necessitating ever-increasing storage requirements.  In particular, this is something that concerns what is known as a bitcoin “full node,” a type of node that keeps a history of every transaction ever made on bitcoin. Currently, a full node requires about 200 gigabytes of storage – just beyond what a conventional laptop can store.  With accumulators, though, full nodes no longer need to store all of the blockchain data in order to order to reach consensus about where coins are on the network. Instead, they can simple provide proofs that data is correct.  “The high level is this idea of separating the consensus away from the state,” Bünz summarized, “Anyone can now be a full node without having to store the data.”  Previously, mobile full nodes were addressed by a particular type of client called an SPV client, which requires light wallets to trust other full nodes to have the correct data. Because this comes with decreased security assumptions, accumulators are heralded as a way to achieve this without trade-offs.  “My hope is that the people who are currently running SPV wallets would be able to use [utreexo] and get the same security of a full node, with the resource requirements that are more similar to SPV,"" Dryja summarized.  The competition  But while they are both positioned toward the same goal, there are ways in which Dryja’s utreexo model and the work by Bünz, Boneh and Fisch differ significantly as well.  First and foremost, Dryja’s work stands out from the fact that it is much closer to deployment. For example, it already has a working prototype and functioning code. Equally, it uses simple mathematics – hash functions that are already familiar to bitcoin.  Bünz, Boneh and Fisch’s design, on the other hand, is potentially more efficient and boasts more advanced features. Still, it uses mathematics that according to Dryja, is comparatively more risky and exotic compared to his own design.  For example, one stage of Bünz, Boneh and Fisch’s accumulators requires a kind of trusted setup – in short, the product of two secret numbers, that if revealed could be compromising to its security.  “We’re using fancier maths to get different properties,” Bunz said,  “The high level differences is [utreexo] is ready now, it’s based on a simpler thing, it’s based on simple hash function, which is a good thing, but ours has more advanced cool features like batching and aggregating which would be cool at some point.”  Additionally, the paper has a section that may have implications for the world’s second largest blockchain, ethereum, as well.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Georgios Konstantopoulos – a researcher and developer for ethereum layer two scaling solution, Plasma – said that due to its applicability, Bunz’s paper had attracted a lot of enthusiasm in the ethereum research community.  For example, Konstantopoulos said that accumulators could even be a more efficient replacement for the most fundamental data structure in ethereum, the Merkle-tree. Additionally, accumulators could help solve a problem inherent to Plasma Cash, which requires users to store large transaction histories.  The enthusiasm was such that Konstantopoulos estimated 10 new designs of how accumulators could apply to ethereum have been proposed, sparking the researcher to undertake a “taxonomy” to analyze the viability of each idea.  He told CoinDesk:  “I’m generally very optimistic that we will find a UXTO compaction scheme for Plasma.”  A ways to go  Still, there’s work that remains on all fronts before the scaling solutions can be considered viable.  Konstantopoulos emphasized that while accumulators could theoretically be useful for ethereum on both layer one and layer two scaling solutions, work remains in order to fully investigate its practical viability.  And both Bunz and Dryja emphasized similar caution as well.  For example, while accumulators have the potential to allow full nodes on mobile phones in terms of storage, they will encounter other hurdles to implementation.  In Dryja’s model, he emphasized that in its current implementation the accumulator is only really useful for bottom of the range computers.  “If you have a fast computer this actually doesn’t help. It will not make much difference or make it slower. But if you have a crummy computer it will make a really big difference,” he continued,  “We want bitcoin to work on crummy computers as well.”  For Bünz, Boneh and Fisch’s paper, work remains in order to build a working implementation of the design, which may come with its own unanticipated research problems.  Plus, using the mobile phone as an example, Bünz said that it would be technically feasible to deploy in terms of storage, the phone would need to be constantly online in order to function.  However, Bünz said that such problems can likely be overcome given sufficient research.  “This is one step of the way for getting us to a space where your mobile phone can run a full node,” Bünz said, “There’s nothing theoretically that stands in the way, we just need to be smart about how we do things.”  He continued:  “There needs to be a lot of new innovation happening, but thankfully there is, and it’s really possible.”  Phone image via Shutterstock  EDIT (9.30 UTC, January 14, 2019): This article has been corrected to more clearly state that Bünz, Boneh and Fisch’s paper on accumulators was a joint work, and not written by Bünz alone.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/13/this-scaling-tech-could-let-you-sync-bitcoin-straight-from-your-phone,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d13382429a04e222c6780a9b21f44b350bac9255-1500x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
