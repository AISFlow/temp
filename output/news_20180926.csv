42413908,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAmd6G,1537992011,"VanEck, SolidX Unfazed By SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently moved to delay their decision on yet another bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The move, announced last week, represented the second delay since the proposal was initially filed by options exchange Cboe in partnership with investment management firm VanEck and blockchain technology company SolidX on June 20. As highlighted by Jake Chervinsky, an attorney at law firm Kobre & Kim, the next deadline for a decision is now December 29.  Referencing a specific section of U.S. law governing the SEC, instituting ""proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied"" effectively gives the Commission up to 180 days to make a decision from the date the VanEck and SolidX proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register, which was July 2.  This time around, however, neither VanEck or SolidX are particularly surprised by the latest decision.  Saying that the delay was entirely ""expected,"" Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy for VanEck, reiterated to CoinDesk that the company's commitment in bringing to market ""a liquid, insured and appropriately regulated physical bitcoin ETF"" was resolute.  Echoing the same sentiment, CEO of SolidX Dan Gallancy also affirmed that last Thursday's decision had no effect on his outlook over the proposal.  Even industry experts like as Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, explained that in his view, the order looked ""like more of the same in terms of seeking comment and asking questions regarding some of their major concerns.""  Balchunas added in an email: ""My odds of approval have not changed in either direction"" – which, as of August 3rd, was between a 5 to 10 percent chance before the end of 2018.  Taking the first step  Indeed, though the chances of approval appear slim, these odds are still higher than the nine other bitcoin ETF proposals put forward by several different companies including Direxion, GraniteShares and ProShares – all initially rejected in one fell swoop by the SEC back in late August.  These rejections are now under review by the agency's leadership and are stayed until further notice, but it's no secret that the VanEck and SolidX ETF proposal differed from all these others in one fundamental way.  Unique about the VanEck and SolidX bitcoin ETF bid is that the proposed fund would hold a repository of bitcoins, rather than of bitcoin derivatives. Given that futures contracts of bitcoins are currently approved and regulated under the SEC, the other nine proposals suggested a bitcoin ETF atop the bitcoin futures market.  In addition to being the only ""physically-backed"" bitcoin ETF proposal, VanEck and SolidX would issue shares from the fund at initial starting prices of $200,000. The high share price is geared at effectively pricing out smaller, potentially less experienced, retail investors.  Calling it ""a baby step towards a real ETF,"" Balchunas told CoinDesk back in August that the game-changing aspect about bitcoin ETFs getting to market on major U.S. exchanges was in how ""anyone, anywhere"" would eventually be able to easily buy bitcoin, without the ""painful"" process of setting up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange or cryptocurrency wallet.  Still, as Chervinsky points out in a tweet thread, several of the ""tough questions"" raised by the SEC within last Thursday's order reassert rather than contest ongoing concerns about the nature of the underlying bitcoin markets and whether these are prone to high levels of market manipulation.  These ""core questions"" according to Gurbacs aren't anything new but ones that he believes have been ""appropriately answered"" in the proposed physical bitcoin ETF bid, adding that:  ""[The SEC] just needs time to understand the markets better ... We have answered pretty much every question that was asked and especially the 18 questions ... around liquidity, pricing, market manipulation, it's all part of our application how we address that.""

42401925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2yo0,1537981230,SEC Seeks Court Sanction Against PlexCoin ICO Founders,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking further action against the founders of the PlexCoin crypto scheme, which it had previously shut down as a fraud.  First reported by Finance Magnates, the SEC submitted a document to the New York Eastern District Court on Tuesday, requesting to file a motion for sanctions against the two founders, Dominic Lacroix and Sabrina Paradis-Royer.  The regulator stated in the submission that Lacroix and Paradis-Royer had been ignoring earlier court orders concerning accounting and repatriation of assets, and evidence discovery.  The SEC is calling for the court to find a default judgement against the defendants, on top of granting the sanctions request.  As reported by CoinDesk, Last December, Lacroix, Paradis-Royer and their firm PlexCorp, were sued by the SEC for securities fraud and had their assets frozen in an emergency order.  Lacroix's assets were frozen for a second time in June. The SEC said at the time that ""Lacroix had been using secret accounts, including an account in his brother's name ... to improperly dissipate for personal use digital assets obtained from investors during the PlexCoin Initial Coin Offering.""  PlexCorp was believed to have raised $15 million from thousands of investors through an ICO, of which the SEC said $810,000 was deposited with payment processor Stripe. However, the SEC suspected that much of the funds remained in cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the Lacroix.  Lacroix has a record of not complying with authorities and, in October 2017, was handed down jail time for contempt in Canada where Quebec's financial regulator said he had ignored previous court orders aimed at preventing him and another firm from soliciting investors for the PlexCoin token.  In the latest submission, according to the report, the SEC argued that Lacroix and Paradis-Royer are still flouting the court's orders and are not complying with deadlines they had originally requested. The regulator ultimately concluded that the pair do not intend to follow the earlier court instructions and could further dissipate the investors' missing assets.

The Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), a farmer-owned cooperative with more than 14,500 members, announced Tuesday that it would work to ""increase supply chain transparency"" by tracking milk products using a blockchain platform operated by food tech startup Ripe.io.  The organization hopes to increase customers' trust in its products by ensuring consumers can trace goods back to their point of origin, according to a press release.  The DFA explained it would trial the technology, and does not have a specific application or product in mind, said David Darr, vice president of sustainability and member services, in a statement.  He explained that ""consumers today want to know where their food comes from and blockchain technology, like ripe.io, gives consumers real-time data, which can really help increase trust and confidence about food production from start to finish.""  He added:  ""We know that there's a lot of application for blockchain technology within agriculture, and we ultimately want to help our dairy farmers be on the forefront ... For now, our goal is to evaluate the technology and explore how it might benefit our supply chain.""  The news comes just a day after Walmart and Sam's Club announced they would force suppliers of leafy green produce to store their products' provenance on a blockchain platform developed in part by IBM.  Announced as a response to a recent E. coli scare, Walmart intends to create end-to-end traceability. This would both allow the company to trace any potential disease outbreaks back to their source more efficiently than can be done at present, as well as help consumers establish whether they are at risk or not.  Unlike the DFA, Walmart intends to have all suppliers run the platform in mainstream production by the end of September 2019.

42381261,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Szz,1537974040,Blockchain Startups Aim to Kill the Captcha With a New Anti-Bot Protocol,"Two blockchain startups have good news for those tired of teaching AIs to recognize stops signs, announcing a new ethereum-based solution Wednesday that is aimed to tackle the current plague of automated bot nets on the internet.  Anyone who uses the web is aware at some level that bots are a problem – that's why we have to spend so much time proving our humanity. Increasingly, accessing a site involves checking a box, or more annoyingly, picking out blurry images that include certain objects like traffic signals and bikes (though this has the added benefit of teaching self-driving cars not to run into things).  These captchas (short for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"") are irksome from a user's perspective, but the underlying problem is a severe headache for companies, who can never be sure how many impressions their ads are getting from humans, versus bots.  Serafin Lion Engel, CEO of the blockchain startup Datawallet, told CoinDesk that ""37 percent of all the impressions that companies pay for on advertising networks are fraudulent impressions.""  In order to solve this problem, Datawallet has announced a new product, the ""Bot or Not protocol,"" to cut down on the prevalence of bots on ad networks. The company has developed the product in partnership with another startup, Enigma, which focuses on keeping data private in blockchain-based smart contracts.  The two companies announced a partnership in August, to be coordinated with the launch of an initial version of Enigma's ""secret contracts"" protocol on ethereum, which was initially scheduled for the end of the third quarter but has since been pushed back.  Datawallet also has yet to launch its platform, but is targeting the fourth quarter, according to Engel. Still, the two companies are proceeding with a test of the Bot or Not service. Engel said they would ""pilot this as a sandbox"" for three or four months, with a ""full rollout"" coming as early as next spring.  What bots can't fake  When it launches, Datawallet will offer what it calls a ""self-sovereign wallet,"" allowing users of digital services to own and monetize the data they generate using those services.  Using ethereum – that is, according to the current plan – the protocol will allow entities to sell social media or music streaming data, for example, to a business such as an advertiser.  The use of public-private key pairs, a cryptographic technique, will help to ensure a secure exchange. Cryptographic hashes of the data in question will be posted to the blockchain, at which point payment will be completed using Datawallet's crypto tokens, which it sold in a $40 million ICO in February.  Datawallet has explored applications for this protocol that include proving personal identity, said Engel, but the company found that a ""lite version"" of those solutions could be useful for simply proving that a user of a website or decentralized application is human.  Pointing out that bot nets produce ""very un-human data creation patterns,"" he explained:  ""The only thing which you cannot fake is the person's historic and real-time data creation. ... They will go and like 200 soccer player pics.""  Enigma, which raised $45 million in an ICO last year, will contribute its privacy protocol to ensure that users don't escape annoying captchas only to find themselves exposing personal data.  ""Bot or Not is a major step towards preventing ad fraud and Sybil attacks, both of which are important and complex problems plaguing our online world,"" said Enigma co-founder and CPO Can Kisagun. (Sybil attacks involve the use of bot nets, sometimes to overwhelm servers and take down websites or services.)  ""Decentralized technologies can be an answer for identity,"" he continued, ""but only if data privacy can be maintained. This is where we believe Enigma's protocol can be the difference-maker.""  Questions still remain to be answered regarding Bot or Not, including, Engel said, how to scale it (and the rest of Datawallet's offering).  ""By the end of Q1 we're looking to have roughly half a million monthly active users in the U.S.,"" he told CoinDesk, adding that ethereum presented a significant ""hurdle to adoption"" because of the high costs of using the network and its limited throughput.  ""Ultimately we want to be chain-agnostic,"" he said, with Enigma also aiming to apply its privacy protocol to a range of smart contract networks outside of just ethereum.  He concluded, though:  ""We're building the initial version on ethereum. Let's just leave it at that.""

42381250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94SrB,1537969361,Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain Just Officially Filed for an IPO,"Bitmain, the Beijing-based cryptocurrency mining giant, has officially filed an application to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).  Published on Wednesday, Bitmain's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) prospectus follows various news reports that the mining giant has been mulling a Hong Kong listing for a multi-billion dollar public fundraising. The process has not been without its share of controversy, with major firms denying their role in a pre-IPO funding phase in a development that cast doubt on the company.  As the application is still in draft form and pending further listing hearings from the HKEX, it remains unclear how much the firm will be valued at eventually. As shown in the posted application, a number of details remain redacted, including the number of shares that will be offered and the timetable for the public offering.  Still, the prospectus gives insight into Bitmain's financial standing as well as the company's structure and inner workings.  According to the filing, the firm made a total of $2,517,719,000 in revenue in 2017, a major increase from the $277,612,000 in revenue it generated over the course of 2016. As of June 30 this year, Bitmain has made $2,845,467,000 in revenue.  Of that revenue, Bitmain grossed profits of $1,212,750,000 last year and $1,030,151,000 for the first half of 2018, up from $151,351,000 over 2016. Before taxes, the numbers were $137,750,000 in 2016, $897,376,000 in 2017 and $907,792,000 for the first half of 2018.  CoinDesk previously reported Bitmain's profits have surged significantly year-on-year, which jumped from $100 million in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in Q1 2018, based on documents obtained by CoinDesk.  The prospectus states that, after adjusting for costs and expenses, Bitmain's net profits were $48.6 million in 2015, $113.5 million in 2016, $952.5 million in 2017 and $952.1 million in Q2 2018.  Bitmain also reported an $886.9 million balance of cryptocurrencies denominated in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and dash as of June 30 after factoring in a net loss of $102.7 million over the last 6 months, more than 10 times the net losses on previous years of holdings.  This accounted for 28 percent of its total assets so far this year, the document stated without breaking down a coin-by-coin allocation. Cryptocurrency holdings were previously valued at $56.3 million and $872.6 million, or 30 percent of assets, by the end of 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Hardware sales boom  Bitmain saw a huge boost to its mining hardware sales between 2015 and the first half of this year, according to the filing. In 2015, Bitmain generated roughly $107.8 million in revenue from its ASICs. For the first half of 2018, Bitmain made about $2.6 billion, marking a half-billion increase over 2017's $2.26 billion.  The number of hardware products sold rose in line with their revenue. Bitmain sold 230,000 miners in 2015, 260,000 miners in 2016, 1.62 million miners in 2017 and, as of Q2 2018, 2.56 million miners. For 2017, 27 percent of the funds it received from mining hardware customers came in the form of cryptocurrency.  The prospectus also shows Bitmain's mining products have diversified over the years. For example, in 2015, all of its hardware was geared toward bitcoin but, by the first half of this year, 73.2 percent of its miners could be used to mine either bitcoin or bitcoin cash (this figure dipped below 70 percent for 2017).  However, Bitmain wrote that because it anticipated a ""strong market growth for cryptocurrency mining hardware"" moving into 2018, a large order for new hardware was placed to its production partners only to be met with slowing hardware sales from the cryptocurrency market downturn, leading to an oversupply of inventory in the first half of 2018.  Land grab  Bitmain has been scooping up land in China to build domestic cryptocurrency mining farm sites. The filing claims Bitmain owns two land parcels in inner Mongolia with sizes of 31,045 square meters and 45,345 square meters, a third parcel in Ningxia that is 33,335 square meters large and a fourth in Sichuan of 9,338 square meter footage.  In terms of leased areas, Bitmain has rented 15,200 square meters of land across 5 locations and 50 properties totaling 99,700 square meters, the prospectus stated.  Bitmain is also planning to launch overseas mining operations, adding it has selected sites in the U.S. states of Washington, Tennessee and Texas, as well as in the Canadian province of Quebec where hydro-power energy is cheap, to mine cryptocurrencies.  Construction is said to be underway and the American and Canadian mining farms are expected to open in Q1 2019.  Beyond actual mining sites, Bitmain said it maintains additional spaces for business operations internationally, including offices and warehouses, in Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Georgia, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore and Switzerland.  Funding details  CoinDesk previously reported Bitmain had raised three funding rounds from investors in Asia and the U.S., but the company has closely guarded the investors and numbers involved in those deals until now.  In a $50 million Series A investment round that closed on August 8, 2017, Bitmain received $18.75 million from SCC Venture, $12.5 million from Richway Investment, $12.5 million from Sinovation, $4.25 million from Blue Lighthouse, $1.2 million from IDG China and $0.80 million from Beijing Integrated Circuit, a cap table in the prospectus shows.  SCC Venture, the largest contributor in the Series A, also led the Series B round, pitching in over $128.95 million in funding.  The Series B round closed $292.7 million on June 19 this year. SC GGFIII ($49.98 million), China Taijia ($29.99 million), Blue Lighthouse ($25.99 million), Coatue ($17.49 million), EDBI ($13.99 million), Rising Delight Enterprises ($7.99 million), FreeS Bit SPV Fund ($7.99 million), Richway Investment ($4.99 million), Han Guang Capital ($3.99 million) and FBH Partners ($0.99 million) joined SCC Venture, not long before Bitmain closed its post-Series B round.  The post-Series B, pre-IPO funding round collected $422.05 million and ended just last month on August 7. Crimson Partners contributed ($149.09 million), as did Casmain ($43.01 million), CICFH Entertainment Opportunity ($40.01 million), Lioness Capital ($33.01 million), Bluebell Global Holdings ($30 million), Gortane Avatar Investments ($30 million), Palace Investments ($30 million), Jumbo Sheen Amber LP ($30 million), Temasek's Pavilion Capital ($20 million), Xin BM Investment ($20 million), Newegg Technology ($15 million) and Shanghai Investment Corporation ($12 million).  Corporate structure and dealings  Apart from accounting statistics, Bitmain's prospectus includes a range of information about the company itself. For example, in the first half of 2018, Bitmain employed 2,594 people. 840 were dedicated to research, 701 to product management, 535 to mining farm maintenance and management, 235 to administration, 209 to customer service and 74 to sales and marketing.  Highlighting the companies that worked and advised on the IPO deal, the prospectus also goes on to list China International Capital Corporation, Hong Kong Securities Limited (the offering's only sponsor) and Commerce and Finance Law Offices on the finance side of the public offering. Maples and Calder in Hong Kong, KPMG, and Frost & Sullivan are providing auditing, legal and consulting services.  Acquisitions not publicly disclosed were revealed. Bitmain owns a 3 percent stake in the Opera Internet browser after having invested $50 million in its corporate entity Opera Limited. Global Digital Mercantile Ltd., described as a cryptocurrency financier, received $1 million from Bitmain in exchange for a 5 percent stake in the company.

Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire wrote in a blog post Wednesday that its USD Coin (USDC), developed with help from the company's CENTRE affiliate consortium, would act as a mean to tokenize U.S. dollars to easily transfer value on public blockchains.  The token was first announced at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in May.  Circle will issue USDC tokens to partner institutions at first, the post noted.  ""Individuals and institutions can enroll in this service to deposit U.S. dollars from bank accounts [and] convert those dollars into tokens usable everywhere the internet reaches,"" they wrote. Users can also cash their USDC tokens out into their bank accounts.  The stablecoin is the first ""fiat token"" that CENTRE will release, the post indicates, though no details were provided on any future projects.  ""Crypto assets and blockchain technology will enable us to exchange value and transact with one another ... instantly, globally, securely and at low cost,"" Circle said, adding:  ""A fundamental building block of this vision is the tokenization of fiat currency itself, through what are now referred to as fiat stablecoins. A safe, transparent and trustworthy layer for fiat to operate over open blockchains and within smart contracts is a necessary precondition to the broader and more revolutionary potential of a crypto-powered global economy.""  At launch, the token will be available on Poloniex, the exchange Circle acquired earlier this year, as well as OKEx, DigiFinex, CoinEx, KuCoin, Coinplug and XDAEX.  Circle is also announcing that the Kyber Network, IDEX, Radar Relay and Tokenlon are partnering with Circle at the protocol level, while Dharma, Origin, BlockFi, MoneyToken, Melonport and Centrifuge will work with the stablecoin for lending, investing or payments, according to the release.  Further, the company told CoinDesk that professional services firm Grant Thornton will ""assist management"" in verifying Circle's U.S. dollar reserves.  With the move, Circle joins a host of other startups in to have recently issued stablecoins – crypto exchanges Paxos and Gemini, startups such as Carbon and Havven, and even corporate giants such as IBM have all announced or released dollar-pegged tokens in recent months.  While these companies employ a number of methods to maintain their tokens' price – ranging from holding an equivalent number of dollars in custody to algorithmic models – they were all developed to streamline the transfer of value, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  ""Price-stable tokens are foundational requirements for enabling powerful new global financial contracts, products and services on the internet,"" Neville and Allaire explained Wednesday.

42381242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Sjd,1537963208,UN Food Program to Expand Blockchain Testing to African Supply Chain,"The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is expanding its blockchain testing from refugee aid in the Middle East to supply chain management in Africa.  Following the agency's well-publicized pilot of an ethereum-based system for cash transfers in Jordanian refugee camps – a project known as Building Blocks – it now plans to test blockchain for the tracking of food delivery in East Africa, Robert Opp, the WFP's director of innovation and change, told CoinDesk.  Specifically, the new project will monitor the movement of food from Djibouti's port, where the WFP receives shipments, to Ethiopia, where much of its food operations are located.  Opp said the pilot will seek to answer the question:  ""Can we increase efficiency by knowing in real time where the food is, be able to demonstrate the food's origin in shipment points, to have this traceability record?""  Separately, the WFP also plans an initiative to educate Syrian refugee women in Jordan about managing their personal data and controlling third-party access to it on a blockchain system.  ""We want to know how easy it is for people to interact with a system like blockchain and understand, 'this is my data, I can control access,'"" he said. ""We yet have to figure out how it will look.""  This educational project will leverage the identity system the organization has built as part of Building Blocks, which was launched last year and now serves more than 100,000 refugees. In that program, people scan their irises to prove their identities, pay for groceries and receive cash back at supermarkets, and the transactions are recorded on a private version of ethereum.  The digital literacy efforts will be directed specifically at women who receive benefits this way via the WFP's recently announced partnership with the UN Women cash-for-work program.  Opp didn't give a timetable for the educational initiative or the Africa project.  Achievements so far  Talking on a panel of the Blockchain Central event during the Concordia Summit in New York on Tuesday, Opp also discussed some of the achievements of the Building Blocks project by the WFP in Jordanian refugee camps.  ""We are reaching 106,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan every month with cash benefits transfers. By implementing blockchain system we have been able to save around $40,000 a month in the transfer fees,"" Opp said on the panel.  Talking to CoinDesk about the program, he said, currently, the WFP's network includes four nodes and stores partial personal data about the registered refugees.  ""The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees keeps the full biometric data in a secure cloud solution. We only download some basic unique identifying information, we don't put their full information on blockchain. I'm not even sure that their full names go there,"" Opp explained.  The project is running on a private version of the Parity ethereum client with a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, although Opp didn't rule out the possibility of switching to a public network in the future, if transaction speed issues get resolved.  Still, the WFP's current system, according to him, has sufficient speed and could successfully deal with a 10-fold increase in volume.

42381267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94T6H,1537960278,Bitcoin Price Volatility Hits Lowest Level In Nearly 2 Years,"A three-month long bitcoin price squeeze (BTC) could be nearing an end, with a key volatility indicator reaching its lowest level for 21 months.  The leading cryptocurrency has charted lower price highs and lower price lows (pennant) since the end of June and the lack of strong direction bias has both bulls and the bears waiting on the sidelines.  As a result, volatility as represented by Bollinger bands width – a technical analysis tool derived from +2, -2 standard deviations of a price's moving average – has hit the lowest level since December 2016. When measured by standard deviation across all exchanges, volatility is at the lowest since July 2017, according to Bitcoinity.  It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually paves way for a strong directional bias, meaning bitcoin could soon witness a big move in either direction.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,490 on Bitfinex.  Daily and Bollinger band width charts        Over on the daily chart, BTC is trapped in a pennant pattern. As of writing, the top edge (resistance) of the pennant is located at $6,900 and the lower edge (support) is seen at $6,270.  The Bollinger bandwidth (gap between Bollinger bands divided by 20-day moving average) has dropped to a 21-month low of 0.0975 today. Further, the oscillator is showing that volatility has steadily declined over the last nine months.  So, it seems safe to say that a spike in volatility (big move in prices) is overdue and going by the moving average studies on the long-term charts, it could happen on the downside, that is, the pennant support could be breached.  Monthly chart  The 5-period and 10-period exponential moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time since the second half of 2014. More importantly, the bearish cross has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC's drop from the weekend high of $6,841 to the previous day's low of $6,325.  Hourly chart  Over on the hourly chart, BTC is struggling to pick up a bid despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. All of which indicates that bearish sentiment is quite strong.  View  Bitcoin price volatility could rise sharply in the next few days.  The technical studies are calling a downside break of the pennant pattern, in which case, the June low of $5,755 could come into play.  An upside break of the pennant pattern would open the doors to July highs above $8,500.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

SBI Ripple Asia announced Wednesday it has completed registration with the Kantou bureau of Japan's Ministry of Finance as a licensed agent for handling electronic payments.  The move clears the regulatory path for SBI Ripple Asia to roll out its MoneyTap payments app – one aimed to facilitate peer-to-peer money transfer for retail users over a DLT network.  According to Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), any entity wanting to operate as an agent to handle electronic payments using banks' open APIs must be registered with local finance bureaus. This legal requirement became effective as of June 1 this year, the FSA said in an announcement in May.  SBI Ripple Asia explained that, as MoneyTap uses blockchain as the underlying technology and connects with open APIs among participating domestic financial institutions, it falls under this regulatory category as a third-party transaction agent.  CoinDesk reported in March that SBI Ripple Asia had revealed its plan to launch a blockchain-based payments app for Japanese consumers across three domestic banks, with a plan to eventually expand to more than 60 financial institutions.  Takashi Okita, chief executive of SBI Ripple Asia, said last month that the company is now looking to officially roll out the service in the autumn, adding that the application will be available on both iOS and Android devices.

42381266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94T3l,1537948825,"You Won't Have to Wait for This Ethereum Scaling Solution, It Works Now","Ethereum is running at full capacity.  At least, that's according to Afri Schoedon, the release manager for ethereum software client provider Parity Technologies. On Thursday, he warned due to the scaling challenges faced by the second largest blockchain by market cap to: ""Stop deploying dapps to ethereum.""  The tweet caused an uproar, with ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin stepping in to defend the protocol, yet others lambasting the project and pointing to other blockchains as better solutions.  And while a number of (both layer-one and layer-two) scaling technologies are in the works, blockchain company OpenST thinks it's new protocol, Mosaic, is ready to tackle those issues ""here and now, rather than just many years into the future,"" according to Jason Goldberg, the CEO of OpenST.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk after the project was first revealed at ethereum hackathon ETHBerlin, Goldberg highlighted that Mosaic requires no fundamental changes to the underlying ethereum network to deploy.  Currently, the team at OpenST is gearing up to launch a preliminary version of Mosaic in just three months time.  Once fully tested, Mosaic could then act as a scaling solution used in advance of other proposed solutions, such as sharding and zk-snarks, which require changes to the ethereum blockchain, dubbed layer-one, as opposed to changes on off-chain auxiliary systems running on a secondary layer atop ethereum.  The protocol, created in partnership with ex-Hyperledger developer Benjamin Bollen, allows tokens to be moved into an auxiliary system where the bulk of heavy computational activity is completed and later asynchronously committed back onto the live ethereum blockchain, or mainnet.  This is done through what Bollen describes as the ""gateway protocol."" In effect, any ERC-20 token, which is the widely held standard for new forms of cryptocurrency on ethereum, is able to move through the gateway protocol including OpenST's Simple Token (OST) – which raised more than $20 million in an ICO fundraise last year – and client-specific tokens based upon OST.  As a company that services non-blockchain enterprises with comprehensive tokenization services, Mosaic assists developers building token-based economies on ethereum to scale to millions of end-users in the immediate before ethereum's formal scaling roadmap executes.  Goldberg told CoinDesk:  ""We felt like it was important to show that mainstream businesses today could move their transactions onto open, cryptographically audible auxiliary chains...and then have economic finality following many of the writing on Casper and sharding back on public ethereum.""  With that, according to the OpenST team, the proposed protocol achieves two goals.  First, it increases the capacity or throughput of the network in processing larger volumes of token transactions. And secondly, Mosaic reduces transaction costs, expending smaller amounts of gas, which is the computational unit of work on ethereum.  The origin story  Stepping back, to understand how the protocol works it's helpful to note what work Mosaic builds upon – the work of Buterin and ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith.  To be more specific, it was the two's work on Casper FFG, which offers both the consensus algorithm proof-of-stake and sharding as layer one solutions geared towards upgrading the underlying framework of incentives governing the ethereum blockchain.  It is these ideas that led Bollen, lead architect of Mosaic, to the realization of how to secure off-chain auxiliary systems on ethereum without sacrificing high transaction throughput or low cost.  Calling the seminal work an ""eye-opener,"" Bollen described to CoinDesk that in order to increase the capacity of the network in finalizing transactions, the Mosaic protocol essentially created an ""opt-in system"" for developers to transfer and fully complete the bulk of computational work required off-chain, before committing these transactions back to the ethereum blockchain in batches.  Bollen calls this ""token sharding"" – building upon an early Casper proposal, in which smart contracts are finalized without the hard requirement of full node replication to uphold the integrity of the blockchain.  Though, unlike the proposed sharding behavior intended for Casper that would automatically balance off-chain loads, Mosaic requires developers to choose cost-effective shards on which to execute tokens.  Mosaic also implements a proof-of-stake incentive structure, in which token transaction validators cast votes, rather than solve computational puzzles, to process transactions and gain rewards. As highlighted by Bollen, Casper includes important ""slashing conditions"" that effectively punish dishonest voters in the system and disincentive false claims.  As such, in addition to being immediately useful in the short-term, Bollen posits that Mosaic will act as an important ""testing ground"" for ethereum. contributing back to research on both sharding and proof-of-stake aimed at eventually achieving mainnet scalability to the effect of billions of end users world-wide, which as Bollen describes is a very high-stakes endeavor.  Speaking to the high stakes involved in releasing proof-of-stake and sharding together on layer-one, Bollen said:  ""If we do [Casper] at layer one, we need to get all the components right and if it fails, we've ruined ethereum. We have one shot at doing it right. That's why it's a much harder, much longer roadmap.""  Going deeper  Mosaic relies upon two major components.  First, it uses a public validator pool to secure token transactions on the auxiliary system and commit back to mainnet at regular intervals.  However, for validators to do this, they need to be able to simultaneously observe tokens staked on ethereum, as well as the corresponding outcomes of token transfers on auxiliary chains running in parallel.  This can be done through the gateway protocol that absorbs the so-called ""state root"" of both systems. A state root refers to a hash, or a unique string of alphanumeric symbols, that identifies and stores the entire state of a system including balances and contract code.  By absorbing the state roots of both systems, validators can then construct what Bollen calls ""metablocks,"" verified by the pool of validators through a two-thirds majority vote.  With votes cast and metablocks confirmed, validators reach ""optimal targets"" to take the last finalized state of the constructed meta-blockchain and commit it back to ethereum mainnet.  As a result, this is where, as Bollen describes, ""the magic happens.""  Though the underlying ethereum blockchain itself is ""severely limited in its capacity,"" with Mosaic's token sharding process, the capacity of the mainnet to finalize transactions at any given time is multiplied. Plus, by using proof-of-stake – a less computationally expensive algorithm – the costs associated with finalizing token transactions on ethereum is also significantly reduced.  Backup plan  The second key component to Mosaic is in how the whole system is secured at its core by ethereum.  Though computationally-intensive, the guaranteed validity of transactions on ethereum is leveraged as a fail-proof for OpenST users to fall back on. For instance, in the event validators are unable to come to a two-thirds majority agreement about the state of an auxiliary chain, the ethereum blockchain will be consulted.  Bollen told CoinDesk, ""If an auxiliary chain halts and doesn't reach consensus anymore, we have the alive system of proof-of-work to continue and recover the last committed state.""  What's more, until 2020, Mosaic will possess a built-in ""safety rail"" that prevents validators from unstaking tokens and otherwise prematurely leaving transactions unvalidated.  However, the guarantee from OpenST developers is that by the year 2020, Mosaic would be fully decentralized and ""the system would be fully released to the validator pool to determine its future.""  They'll be doing all this, while maintaining their work with a growing client base made up of businesses such as the LGBT Foundation, PassKit and Animoca Brands, among others.  And like most developers, Goldberg and Bollen understand that the work, even with a successful launch, is never done, contending that it's not just about further developing more comprehensive tokenization solutions for enterprise business, but also about upgrading ethereum to better serve decentralized application developers and users.  According to Bollen, pushing Mosaic as a broader scaling solution is simply about making ethereum ""more secure for the future"" and giving it ""a much longer runway and viability to change the Internet and the way we organize.""  To this end, Goldberg said there may be several scaling solutions implemented that will be ""viable and interesting to different types of customers.""  He concluded:  ""It's not about one approach being right or wrong. It's about having a community body of work that is both improving the ethereum origin chain, as well as, providing options to how to scale on existing ethereum.""

Called Red Belly Blockchain and created by CSIRO's technology arm Data61 and the Concurrent Systems Research Group (CSRG) from the University of Sydney, the network was tested across 1,000 nodes in 14 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe.  CSIRO claimed ""the benchmark was set by sending 30,000 transactions per second from different geographic regions"" with an average latency of three seconds, adding it was the agency's first blockchain test in a global setting.  The goal of the network is to solve the common issue of scalability among major blockchains currently by using an alternative consensus algorithm instead of the proof-of-work mechanism adopted by public networks such as bitcoin.  According to a paper published by the CSIRO and the University of Sydney, the group has turned to a different algorithm called deterministic byzantine consensus. The idea, based on the paper's description, is to allow the network to complete transactions after receiving a threshold of messages instead of having to wait for confirmations from nodes that are slow.  ""Real-world applications of blockchain have been struggling to get off the ground due to issues with energy consumption and complexities induced by the proof of work,"" said Dr. Vincent Gramoli, a senior researcher at Data61 and head of the CSRG, in the announcement, adding:  ""The deployment of Red Belly Blockchain on AWS shows the unique scalability and strength of the next generation ledger technology in a global context.""  The test comes at a time when the science agency is also working with IBM to create what's been called the Australia National Blockchain.  As CoinDesk previously reported, CSIRO aims to use this blockchain network to facilitate large-scale business and financial transactions for domestic and international enterprises based on blockchain-powered smart contracts.

42381257,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Sux,1537934429,The Crowd Machine Crypto Token Theft: What We Know So Far,"Just a few days ago, Crowd Machine was working to build a crypto replacement for Amazon Web Services. Today, it is facing questions about its survival.  On Saturday, according to a post by the Crowd Machine team, a hacker compromised the company's cryptocurrency wallet and stole a large number of the application's native Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCT). Digging further, according to Etherscan, the thief appears to have made off with over 1 billion CMCT, most of which were then transferred to exchanges.  The price of the tokens fell steeply following the incident, dropping by 87 percent on Saturday to a low of around $0.0019, according to CoinMarketCap data.  ""We are working to resolve this issue as fast as we can,"" the Crowd Machine team wrote Sunday, adding:  ""Because this matter is currently under criminal investigation, we are unable to make any further comments at this time.""  Admins posted a similar message to the project's Telegram channel.  Who is Crowd Machine?  Crowd Machine attracted attention after two developers from Blockstream, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency startups, left to join the project in February this year.  One of those, Ben Gorlick, became CTO, though according to his LinkedIn page he left Crowd Machine in May. The second, Johnny Dilley became chief of system architecture for the new company, although now his LinkedIn page does not list Crowd Machine and the company's site does not include him as a team member.  Saeed Al Darmaki, a former advisor to the project who quit this month because – he alleged – Crowd Machine did not pay him the token compensation he was promised, told CoinDesk that ""poor management"" by CEO Craig Sproule had prompted employees to leave. He declined to identify the employees to whom he was referring.  Crowd Machine's goal is to build a globally distributed cloud, a sort of Amazon Web Services that would not be subject to the control of a single company or suffer from a single point of failure. According to the company's website, this ""Crowd Computer"" is scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter.  Crowd Machine conducted a pre-sale of CMCT tokens in April, but has not continued with its planned series of 390 daily public sales.  Few details have been provided about the situation. And in the absence of further updates, speculation has swirled, including unsubstantiated allegations that the thefts were an inside job.  What we know  The stolen coins have been dumped onto two exchanges so far: Idex and Bittrex.  On Saturday, Idex announced on Twitter that it was de-listing CMCT following reports of ""suspicious activity."" At the time of writing, Bittrex had also suspended CMCT trading.  Sproule told CoinDesk in an email on Tuesday that the team had requested these trading freezes (Idex previously said they'd been in contact with Crowd Machine).  Sproule added that a law enforcement investigation was underway and an ""arrest has been made."" Though he did not say who had been arrested and declined to specify what law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation, saying the agencies in question had asked him not to reveal their identity.  As some pointed out on Crowd Machine's Telegram, Bittrex requires users to upload identification, which may have allowed the authorities to make an arrest so quickly.  In an update on Medium, Sproule recommended that no one trade the tokens until the authorities had finished their investigation, though he wrote that ""purchases of stolen tokens by those not involved with the theft will be honored.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, he offered reassurance to the community:  ""Assets are currently being recovered.""
