42400320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJK67,1504038925,Mobile Messenger Kik Raises $50 Million Ahead of $75 Million ICO,"Mobile messaging app Kik has raised $50 million from the private sale of its ethereum token Kin to institutional investors, including Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital and Polychain Capital.  The announcement is notable as Kik's Kin token may well be the first mainstream adoption of a custom cryptocurrency by a well-known company – Kik claims 15 million monthly active users, about 60 percent of whom are in the 13 to 24 age demographic. The token was previously announced in May, with its fair share of skeptics, who said the idea of incentivizing social media interactions with a points system has been tried before to no avail.  The company will follow the pre-sale with a public ""token distribution event"" next month, targeting an additional $75 million by selling 1 trillion of a total of 10 trillion units to be created.  The total raise is expected to net a combined $125 million in new capital for the company.  Because the Kin token is based on ethereum's ERC-20 standard, it will be possible for exchanges to list the token for trading, and in turn, ultimately redeem them for U.S. dollars.  Tanner Philp, a manager of special initiatives at Kik, told CoinDesk the company's goal is for Kin to become a general purpose cryptocurrency, which could be used as a method of value exchange between such stakeholders as users, developers and content creators.  When asked for specifics about how Kin might achieve that long-term goal, Philp responded with a use case that is already in production at Kik today:  ""One of the areas of immediate opportunity is the over 100,000 bot developers, who have created over 180,000 bots. Those bots could be anything from entertainment to content creation to games.""  Such funding, if received, would make Kik one of the highest-charting ICOs. According to data from the CoinDesk ICO Tracker, $1.8 billion has now been raised through the funding mechanism through August 25.

42400305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIfZ,1504030521,Report: Customer Complaints Against Coinbase Are on the Rise,"A new report is shedding light on customer complaints against U.S. cryptocurrency companies.  Using data from the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the agency responsible for processing consumer complaints against companies), online student loan market LendEDU has found that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has drawn perhaps the most criticism this year.  In total, Coinbase has received 288 complaints in 2017, a figure that represents a dramatic increase from the seven complaints the startup received in 2016.  Coinbase did not reply when contacted by CoinDesk for comment, though the company has pledged to use a new funding round to boost its struggling customer service.  ""Over the past six months, Coinbase and GDAX have seen unprecedented growth. As a result, our systems have been pushed to the limit and [this] has resulted in a negative experience for customers,"" a company representative said at the time.  Still, Coinbase was not the only company to receive complaints. The CFPB has seen 277 complaints against other cryptocurrency companies, LendEDU found, a figure it projects could rise to more than 400 by the year's end.  Overall, the data is the latest that points to potential growing pains for cryptocurrency firms, which have seen a surge in new interest this year as bitcoin has set a string of all-time highs.

According to a report by online media site Sohu, the visit was made as part of ongoing research led by the IDF and SFI, which is planned to be published in a report detailing the status of U.S. fintech development and regulation.  The delegates initially met with startups Prosper, a lending company; Sofi, an initiative targeting student loans; blockchain startup Circle; cryptocurrency exchange service Coinbase and DLT payments firm Ripple.  Additional conversations were reportedly centered around regulation.  According to Sohu, Qian stated in a discussion that ""the issue of legal digital currency is of great significance"" for China, and spoke about the necessity for traditional financial system stakeholders to set a strategy for blockchain technology.

With the news, Banco de la República Colombia becomes the latest member to join the more than 80 financial institutions worldwide that are today part of the consortium. Already, R3 has completed tests with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, though both institutions are arguably now emerging as key early adopters of distributed ledger tech.  Launched in 2015, Corda is an open-source distributed ledger for financial technology, developed by New-York based startup R3.  The news also coincides with a push by R3 to diversify its membership by adding financial regulators and government agencies to the group. Revealed as key to its strategy in May, CEO David Rutter at the time said broader buy-in is needed to expand R3's existing tests.  ""Ultimately, our goal is to have the regulators involved from the start, right from the design through the experiment and the pilot and the prototyping,"" he said.  Though not the nation's financial regulator, Banco de la Republica Colombia is nonetheless backed by the government, which could lead to more widespread support.  Still, in its statements, the organization was short on details on what might be ahead.  Banco de la República Colombia responded: ""It is in our interest to evaluate the benefits of this technology for the safe and efficient management of the exchange of securities in the Colombian financial system.""

42400299,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIcc,1504013411,Bitcoin Meets Zcash: Developers Test Tool for Trustless Trades,"An in-progress blockchain project could one day help users trade bitcoin for zcash without a trusted third party.  Created by zcash developers Jay Graber and Ariel Gabizon, ZBXCAT is a new command-line tool that developers can use to exchange the two cryptocurrencies.  With today's bitcoin exchanges having a history of being vulnerable to hacks (leading to millions of dollars in customer losses), ZBXCAT uses a concept called ""atomic swaps"" to avoid the need to hold users' funds.  Say Alice has bitcoin and Bob has zcash, and they want to trade the two. Rather than temporarily entrusting their cryptocurrency to a centralized exchange, atomic swaps would let them trade directly across blockchains. To ensure there is no cheating, both users would need to send the cryptocurrencies to each other by a certain time or the trade will fail.  Gabizon told CoinDesk:  ""Basically, it seems a useful thing to me: To be able to exchange bitcoin and zcash directly with someone I don't know without having to trust them. Especially, given recent technical problems some exchanges are having.""  In its current state, ZBXCAT users need to download bitcoin and zcash full nodes (with their full transaction histories), and use the command line to instruct the network to make a trade.  However, with the tool still not finalized, ZBXCAT's developers advise using ""test"" coins rather than the real thing for the time being.  The project is the latest in a line of similar ideas for experimental exchange-free trading.  Charlie Lee, the founder of litecoin, has previously said he is committed to atomic swaps, once the Lightning Network is activated on the cryptocurrency's network. The MimbleWimble project also plans to usher in cross-chain atomic swaps, as well as other features.  ""I can't predict how it will be used exactly, I hope it will be integrated in other services in interesting and unexpected ways,"" Gabizon concluded.

42400316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIpP,1504009814,Russian Regulator: Bitcoin Should Be Limited to 'Qualified Investors',"Russia's deputy finance minister, Alexei Moiseev, has spoken out on how he believes cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the country.  According to reports issued by RT yesterday, Moiseev suggested in a televised interview that bitcoin should not be classified as a currency, but rather as a property or asset.  Moiseev further stated that bitcoin was a high risk ""financial pyramid"" and that, in order to protect consumers, bitcoin exchange should be performed only by ""qualified investors"" on the Moscow Stock Exchange. As such, ""ordinary people"" would be prohibited from buying and selling the cryptocurrency.  ""We suggest not to call it currencies, do not regulate it as currencies, regulate how ... other property, classify it as a financial asset and allow only classified investors to buy and sell them on the exchange,"" Moiseev stated according to RSN.  On the stock exchange, bitcoin would be subject to ""Rosfinmonitoring"" – a decree issued by President Vladimir Putin in order to collect and analysis financial transactions for protection against fraud.  Moiseyev indicated the proposal is currently being discussed with the Moscow Stock Exchange and the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank, and that it could soon be passed onto government.  ""I hope that we will soon submit this concept to the government, and in case of support we will write a draft of normative acts,"" he said.  Notably, Moiseyev's statements have provoked commentary from Pavel Durov, the founder of the Telegram Messenger app and VKontakte, a popular social media site.  As reported by Sputniknews, Durov wrote on his VKontakte page that, with the arrival of bitcoin:  ""For the first time in 70 years, the global financial system has a chance to escape from the hegemony of the U.S.""  Yet, rather than allowing cryptocurrencies the chance to replace the dollar, ""the Russian government is voicing ideas to ban and restrict [use of cryptocurrencies],"" he said.  It seems this charge will only apply to civilians, though, and only if Moiseev's comments are adopted into financial regulations.  As such, Moiseev's remarks build on what has generally been the strict approach to cryptocurrency regulation favored by the Ministry of Finance, the country's top financial regulator. In contrast, the Bank of Russia has generally been more supportive of the technology, though it remains to be seen which side will win out.

42400302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIdb,1504007406,Ether Prices Surge Above $360 to Hit Two-Month High,"The price of ethereum's ether token has risen sharply over the past 24 hours, reaching levels not seen for over two months.  Climbing from around $340 yesterday morning, ether peaked at almost $365 at 10:34 UTC today and has since dropped slightly, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  That figure is around $46 short of the token's all-time high of $411 set on June 13.  Notably, the price change seems at least in part driven by enthusiastic trading in South Korea.

42400304,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIgY,1504004419,Brokers Beware: Insurance Consortium Reveals Codex 1 Blockchain Prototype,"Blockchain insurance consortium B3i has revealed new details about its blockchain smart contract prototype, including advancements that could eventually remove much of the administrative work done by all counterparties.  In conversation with CoinDesk, director of global business solutions at reinsurance company Swiss Re, Paul Meeusen outlined how the platform could reduce the role of brokers, for example who seem particularly susceptible.  Internally described as ""Codex 1,"" the prototype is designed to automate many of the processes involved in catastrophe reinsurance currently fulfilled by brokers, and eventually to improve the trading of risk more broadly.  In part, the prototype does this by giving the insurance companies seeking reinsurance, brokers and the reinsurance companies that serve them, access to the same, cryptographically secure distributed ledger.  While all the counterparties involved in the reinsurance workflow today remain intact in Codex 1, the prototype shows how insurance brokers could become the latest group to have some of its services rendered irrelevant.  Meeusen, who is also a founding member of B3i, said he sees substantial impact if the blockchain prototype were to be adopted on a large scale.  He said:  ""The administrative involvement where part of what [brokers] do is collecting the papers from the different parties, then ordering them and passing them onto the next, that is of course becoming unnecessary.""  Depending how you look at it, automating the administrative tasks could pose a threat to all counterparty services, but Meeusen explained that B3i would rather look at it as a way to allow the counterparties to focus on value-added advisory products.  Work on Codex 1 began earlier this year as members of the consortium – which includes Aegon, Allianz, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Liberty Mutual and Sompo Japan Nipponkoa – evaluated several potential use cases for blockchain.  The group finally decided to convert the Property Cat XL (""Cat"" being short for ""catastrophe"") reinsurance work flow to a self-executing smart contract, specifically because its similarities around the world make it potentially widely adoptable.  ""If you look at catastrophic risk, when the wind blows or the earth shakes, in simple terms, I would say the nature of that is very uniform across the globe,"" he said.  Passing on the savings  Since the early days of the consortium, Meeusen has advocated that blockchain technology could enable reinsurance companies to compete over better products, instead of just better platforms.  For example, in a typical Property Cat XL contract, a broker would receive quotes from multiple reinsurers and help organize which combination of risk assessment and pricing is most advantageous. They would then facilitate communication between each of the counterparties while keeping private the terms of the eventual deal.  With Codex 1, however, much of the broker's role is moved to a permissioned blockchain that automates both premium settlement and claim settlement, all while still ensuring the counterparties remain unaware of one another's terms.  The end result, Meeusen hopes, is that companies can focus their attention on creating more accurate risk assessments and better rates.  ""We would expect that – just like reinsurers – when they become more efficient, over time they can offer more attractive prices,"" he said.  And according to Meeusen, if brokers don't get removed from the equation, he expects they will be able to ""offer more attractive brokerage fees because their service is going to become much more efficient.""  Broadening the use cases  While this first prototype is focused on property catastrophes, according to Meeusen, the group is ready to begin work on multiple other projects currently ""on the shelf.""  The next step will be to widen the scope of the offering to include casualty lines (such as motor vehicle accidents and worker's compensation), which Meeusen said will require little more than a ""copy-paste"" of the current smart contract.  B3i also aims to expand its blockchain work to include so-called ""proportional contracts"" that rely on pro-rated terms, as well as improving the actual creation of insurance-linked securities and bonds.  If successful, the prototype – scheduled for its first live demo at the Monte Carlo RVS conference in September – could eventually result in tokenized bonds, making trading risk as easy as trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.  Meeusen concluded:  ""That's the master plan. But we first need to walk before we run.""

42400319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIsM,1503997201,SegWit's Slow Rollout: Why Bitcoin's Capacity Hasn't Seen a Sudden Boost,"""Why do transaction fees appear unaffected?"" asked one Reddit user.  Another posted an image of a man poking the word ""SegWit"" with a stick, saying, ""C'mon, do something...""  Such comments, while sparse, have been indicative of the reaction some more casual bitcoin users have so far had to the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a code change that went live on bitcoin last week after nearly two years of testing and debate.  Though the much-hyped technology is well-known for two things – boosting average block size and paving the way for a secure Lightning Network – when SegWit finally activated on August 23, the code change didn't immediately trigger these benefits.  One caveat that some might have missed is that it will likely take some time before the technology has a noticeable impact on network capacity.  Even many ""block explorers"" (blockchain analysis tools used for browsing blocks and transactions) have yet to add much information in regards to SegWit, making it difficult to track just how widely used the new technology is so far.  SegWit.party  tracks how many SegWit-style transactions are in each block, showing they have moved from roughly 0.5 percent of transactions to 1 percent per block over the technology's six-day lifespan. Meanwhile, another graph shows the total block size.  SegWit hasn't had any visible impact so far.  OXT.me  , from bitcoin data analysis expert going by the moniker LaurentMT, tracks the total number of SegWit transactions made per day. Plus, it tracks some more other new data, such as the new ""virtual block size.""  As evidenced by these graphs, too, there's still a lot of room for adoption.  The role of businesses  So, why hasn't the increase been bigger? Well, it's up to bitcoin users and companies to incorporate and actually use the technology. Since most bitcoin users depend on a software wallet to send transactions, they need those wallets to add the technology before they can use SegWit.  And while as many as 141 bitcoin companies have at least pledged to do so in the future, their technology isn't necessarily live. Some wallets are waiting to add support for the technology for security reasons; developers argue that it's safer to test the technology further once it's live before they open it up to users.  That's why the wallet attached to bitcoin's most popular full node implementation, Bitcoin Core, doesn't support SegWit.  ""Using SegWit before the activation is buried is unsafe and could lead to funds loss if miners behave maliciously,"" Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell, a leading contributor to Bitcoin Core, argued, adding that leaving it out of the wallet's graphical interface was an ""intentional decision.""  However, he went on to add that developers can use the command line to make SegWit transactions today.  Consumer and business wallet support is trickling in. Wallet infrastructure startup BitGo (which supports a number of exchanges and wallets) is in the midst of making changes, while consumer wallets Ledger and Trezor already support the technology.  Others might not be far behind.  Watch and weight  The question, though, is how quick will they be? Where this all might get problematic is it remains to be seen how long various network participants will give the network to adopt SegWit before flaring up old debates.  One issue is how easily manipulated bitcoin's capacity issues have been. Even after months of campaigning on the idea that SegWit would redefine how the block size is calculated, there remains a contingent that believes this metric is key to scaling.  However, with SegWit, different transactions types now have different ""weights."" Old, non-SegWit transactions have a weight of 4. So, if a block was filled with only non-SegWit transactions, the block size cap is still 1MB. Meanwhile, SegWit transactions have a smaller weight of 0.25.  As for what this means in calculating a new block size, that depends on how many SegWit transactions users make. Even long-term, there's likely to be a mix of SegWit and non-SegWit transactions.  Some developers anticipate an average block size of about 1.7MB. Others argue that because of miner incentives, it could average out to about 2MB.  But, frustrated by years of inactivity, some network stakeholders may view the changes as too slight to spur bitcoin's continued growth.  Already, some bitcoin businesses are floating this argument, backing a controversial plan to hard fork the network again in November to increase the hard-coded block size. (Its lead developer, Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, has already set the stage for what could be a full-blown offensive using this argument in the coming weeks and months).  Looking ahead, the charts above might prove to be a key battleground. While SegWit remains in a grace period, with users hoping adoption will increase, it remains to be seen how likely this calm will persist, and if more debates will follow.

42400303,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIea,1503993609,Reports: China's Regulators Consider Suspending All ICOs,"Regulators in China are discussing a plan to possibly suspend all initial coin offerings (ICOs) within the country, reports say.  According to Tencent Finance, regulators proposed an action plan in a meeting on August 18 hosted by the financial market department of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank. Officials from China's insurance, securities and bank regulatory body also attended.  Quoting multiple anonymous source ""close to the regulators,"" Tencent reported that authorities are discussing a plan that would include putting limits on the size of ICOs, strengthening the information disclosure, supervising tokens and publishing investment risk alerts.  Further, should there be significant market risk, the report indicates regulators could possibly suspend all ICOs.  While that might sound extreme, it's worth noting that the PBoC suspended domestic exchange trading for months earlier this year, effectively taking the world's largest market offline overnight over concerns about customer safety.  Adding further evidence to the claim is that Caixin yesterday also confirmed a rumor that regulators are discussing a plan on ICOs, suggesting that any regulatory action will be based on an executive order published in 1998 by State Council, the executive Branch of the Chinese government.  Titled ""Order on banning Illegal financial institutions and illegal financial business activities,"" the translated text reads:  ""Illegal financial business activities include: fund-raising targeting not specific objects without legal approval, or other activities that the People's Bank of China identified as illegal.""  The reports, while yet to be confirmed, come amid an uptick in ICO regulatory announcements internationally, with the U.S., Canada and Singapore recently offering guidance as to their views on the fast-emerging market.
