42377618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VL9,1410906011,Boston Fed: Bitcoin Could Be Reducing Online Shopping Costs,"The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has released a new report that suggests the technology underlying digital currency could reshape global payments.  Authors Stephanie Lo and J. Christina Wang note in their September policy perspective, Bitcoin as Money?, that while it's not certain that bitcoin will supplant traditional currencies or payment systems, bitcoin’s ""lasting legacy"" will be the innovations it brings to payments technology.  In the full paper, the regional branch of the US Federal Reserve, examines whether digital currency as it exists today is a viable form of money, looking at it as a medium of exchange and a store of value. The paper echoes sentiments shared by many central banks worldwide – that bitcoin’s price volatility and lack of a central authority make it a risky form of money, though its underlying technology holds great promise.  Yet, the authors say that bitcoin could become a solution for online commerce, particularly as more e-tailers begin accepting digital currency. In the long term, bitcoin could be a viable candidate system to replace an existing financial infrastructure that the Boston Fed deems “fragmented” and “inefficient”.  The authors note:  “In principle, any of the functionality or services related to payment and transfer offered in the existing financial system should be, and likely will be, a candidate for reform if such reform can result in greater efficiency by using technology developed in the open-source distributed network framework that is at the foundation of bitcoin.”  Risky money  Overall, the report suggests that bitcoin can meet the primary functions of money, but not without potential risk to those who use and invest in it.  The paper examines one of bitcoin’s chief use cases – online commerce – and compared this utilization to how dollars are spent online. The data presented shows that bitcoin users, within the Fed’s sample of price changes across online retailers like Overstock and TigerDirect, experienced slight discounts when using bitcoin.  These indications, while tenuous, suggest that merchants are in fact being drawn to the idea that using digital currency is more attractive than accepting payment methods like credit cards.  As the authors state:  “Caveats notwithstanding, our finding that these retailers do not charge a premium and may in fact offer a discount, albeit slight, on purchases made with bitcoin suggests that retailers consider that payments made with bitcoin are on net at least as profitable as payments made with standard means. The most likely reason is that accepting bitcoin lowers merchants’ costs by reducing payment processing costs, chief among which are the credit card interchange fees, typically on the order of 2–4%.”  The report goes on to say that online bitcoin payments may serve as the technology's primary use case, given its increasing acceptance by retailers.  This behavior, the authors suggest, may be attributed to the fact that payments processors in the bitcoin space assist merchants by insulating them against wide price fluctuations.  Mining process flawed  The Fed explored the role of bitcoin's miners, assessing the network's strengths compared to how the broader financial system establishes and settles transactions.  Overall, the report views the industry critically, suggesting that its pre-determined increase in mining difficulty and the trend toward consolidation constitutes a long-term risk.  Specifically, the paper notes, the competitive nature of bitcoin mining – wherein miners race to solve the complex cryptographic equations and discover new blocks – is self-defeating from the standpoint of a stable network. Noting its “social inefficiency”, the authors suggest that the rising cost of mining could one day outweigh the broader benefits of cheaper transactions.  The report highlights how the composition of the mining network itself is shifting from a cluster of small entities to fewer, more powerful operations. As mining power consolidates under a few centralized mining pools, the Boston Fed suggests, the risk of collusion between parties rises.  Consolidation or outright monopolization in the mining network may require greater oversight, the paper states. Yet even if the network maintains a level of distribution consistent with where it is today, the Boston Fed posits that regulation should be explored.  The paper stated:  “Regardless of the exact future structure of the mining operation, the inevitable increase in concentration suggests the need for enhanced oversight, either by the players themselves or by an independent third party, to guard against the likelihood of collusion or other non-competitive behavior.”  Such a process would not be easy. As a global industry, mining would require the oversight of supragovernmental organizations, as well as agreement among nations with significant mining industries, including China, Europe and the US. Regulating sources of hashing power that are more difficult to track would also complicate the matter.  Too early for remittances  The authors briefly touch on the subject of remittances, described by many as a potential catalyst for bitcoin use expansion worldwide. In the Boston Fed’s view, however, it’s still too early for digital currency in its current form to be a viable vehicle for cheap global payments.  At the same time, the report says, the prevalence of mobile devices in developing economies could make digital currency-based remittances more popular should information about how to use the technology become more widespread.  The report states:  “To the extent that a mobile application for international remittances using the Bitcoin network can be developed and accepted by a broad range of providers around the world, it can be possible for Bitcoin to capture a nontrivial share of this market.”  The global remittance marketplace is worth an estimated $500bn, and companies in the bitcoin space are already targeting this application. The Boston Fed says that the deciding factor will be the willingness of businesses that offer payments processing in developing countries to integrate bitcoin.  Bitcoin's future  The Boston Fed says whether or not bitcoin succeeds depends on many factors, the evolution of digital currency technology itself notwithstanding. Any outcome rests in the hands of the broader currency-using public, who may or may not see bitcoin as worth using compared to existing methods.  The report’s authors also highlight the fact that information about bitcoin is still disseminating among consumers, business and regulators.  They write that questions exist that need to be answered before any conclusions can be drawn about bitcoin’s future, saying:  “For example, what are the fundamental needs satisfied by digital currencies such as bitcoin? How, if at all, should bitcoin intermediaries be regulated? What are the main drivers of bitcoin price movements?""  The paper concludes: ""Many interesting questions remain to be explored.”  Image via Wikimedia",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/16/boston-fed-bitcoin-could-be-reducing-online-shopping-costs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5d05df68c2c51e774b4b450f093119945a98f1c-2032x1524.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VQB,1410899757,Reddit Challenges Community to Prove Demand for Bitcoin Ad Payments,"Reddit has issued new statements suggesting that it is currently conducting a trial to determine whether to integrate bitcoin payments more fully into its overall marketing strategy.  In a post on the bitcoin subreddit, a moderator informed the community that one of its advertising partners, BuySellAds, is now accepting bitcoin payments, and that Reddit's marketing team intends to actively monitor the support its partner receives as it looks to follow a similar strategy.  Reddit strategist Dylan Hulser wrote:  ""You can demonstrate a desire to buy advertising on Reddit with bitcoin. We'll be keeping an eye on how many people are using this feature to determine where developing tools for cryptocurrency payments fits into the overall reddit advertising strategy.""  BuySellAds currently allows customers to advertise in five collections, advertising packages that group subreddits into larger categories including design, gaming, eSports, motorsports and cryptocurrency.  Reddit boasts more than 135 million monthly unique visitors, and its vibrant bitcoin community, r/bitcoin, has more than 130,000 subscribers.  Notably, users can already purchase memberships for Reddit Gold, the website's premium membership program, with bitcoin.  Generating an impact  The statements follow the formal launch of BuySellAds' bitcoin payments initiative on 3rd September.  To purchase reddit advertising via the company, customers must first send funds to their BuySellAds account, at which point they will be converted into dollars and become available for use in purchasing.  The moderator indicated that the process may not be ideal for digital currency users who want to spend bitcoin more directly on advertising, but encouraged the community to stay focused on its larger goal.  Further, he indicated specific ways Reddit users may be able to make a larger impact with their ad spending, writing:  ""Currently, we focus most of our time on improving our self-serve system, which impacts the sponsored headlines you see at the top. Those are our best performing and most engaging unit. If we saw a lot of success here, we would absolutely be open to expanding.""  Pricing details  BuySellAds  features more details about its advertising packages in its formal announcement, noting that its cryptocurrency collection reaches top altcoin subreddits such as those for litecoin, dogecoin and peercoin, among a host of others listed in full on its website.  The company estimates its advertisements to the wider digital currency community will reach 1.75 million views a month. BuySellAds also offers geo-targeted ads as well.  The cost of advertising via a top-right banner on the site is $1 per 1,000 views.

42377620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VMP,1410894047,CEX.io Joins Bitcoin API Race With Launch of PlugChain,"The team behind cryptocurrency exchange CEX.io and bitcoin mining pool GHash.io has launched a new venture – an open API for building bitcoin applications.  With the announcement, CEX.io joins the fast-moving race to launch a comprehensive API for the bitcoin network, competing against notable startups including Gem, which recently launched in beta, and Chain, which raised $9.5m in venture funding this August.  Called PlugChain, the CEX.io platform enables developers to create an array of cryptocurrency apps, such as merchant applications and wallets.  Jeffrey Smith, chief information officer at CEX.io said:  ""The bitcoin industry is really young, and there are not so many professional bitcoin developers at the moment. Meanwhile, plenty of universal developers could find their jobs in bitcoin and heavily contribute to it. Thus, we decided to create PlugChain.""  Smith said the emphasis is on bitcoin entrepreneurs who have great ideas and need professional developers to help build their projects. According to the CIO, PlugChain can save developers and their employees hundreds of hours, thus streamlining development and cutting costs.  Merchant apps, wallets and more  The PlugChain API can be employed to develop a wide range of cryptocurrency apps. This includes wallets, merchant apps, exchangers and other products that require block chain access and real-time information about transactions, blocks and other services.  CEX.io's “block chain Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)” platform enables developers to build cryptocurrency apps in Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Groovy, Objective-C and Swift, Apple’s new language for iOS.  Relying on permanent block chain parsing, the API is designed to deliver fast server response times: fetching an address in as little as 60 milliseconds and retrieving blocks in 250 milliseconds.  The company says this server response time is currently ten times faster than similar services, even though the platform is still in beta.  Additionally, Smith stressed that the “incredible support” provided by CEX.io has already garnered the API a lot of positive feedback on its trust pilot.  Non-profit API  Although it was developed by CEX.io, PlugChain is a non-profit project – “it will always be free,” Smith confirmed – and was created solely to help develop the bitcoin ecosystem.  However, this does not mean CEX.io will be at a loss. The API can be expanded to work better with the company’s crypto exchange, allowing it to make money on transaction fees.  Alternatively, developing the ecosystem could allow more startups to emerge and attract additional capital investments to bitcoin, thus pushing the price upwards. Smith described it as a “win-win” for all parties who choose to get involved.  The API was developed by a team of three developers, two designers and a number of marketing specialists at CEX.io. The group started working on the project in late August and my mid-September they were ready to roll out a working beta.  For the time being, API access is invitation-only (for those with API keys), but this restriction should be lifted by the end of the month.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/16/cexio-joins-bitcoin-api-race-with-launch-of-plugchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5241caf678ff5281586e71d3eec5afdb2d8d372-1280x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377623,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VJt,1410891024,Banks Cut Ties With Isle of Man's Bitcoin Industry,"Capital Treasury Services (CTS), the company that links bitcoin businesses to banks in the Isle of Man, is to cut ties with the digital currency sector as of next month.  CTS, which is a subsidiary of Capital International Group, currently works with a number of digital currency companies in the Isle of Man, acting as their banking solution.  The company is not a bank, but a treasury service, which holds funds for a number of companies across a variety of sectors.  It works with banking partners in order to clear customer funds. Pressure from these banking partners has forced CTS to withdraw its services from companies in the digital currency space.  A statement from CTS reads:  ""Although support from government is very strong and we have been keen to get behind the government's initiative, we are only able to do so with the wider support of the financial sector, which has unfortunately now been withdrawn.""  The statement goes on to say CTS is no longer taking on any more digital currency companies and will close the accounts of those it currently works with next month.  Companies will still be able to receive money for the next two weeks and outward payments will be processed until 14:00 on 15th October.  ""We will be working closely with those businesses already with us in order to find alternative providers and solutions, and are happy to talk with businesses and provide guidance from our experience in the sector,"" the statement says.  Searching for solutions  Eric Benz, of the UK Digital Currency Association, said the Isle of Man government and certain financial services companies are doing everything they can to help cryptocurrency companies continue to operate on the island.  ""No stone is being left unturned and there is great confidence that new banking solutions will be provided shortly,"" he added.  Benz stressed that the CTS is still very keen to work in the digital currency space, but it is not able to do so without the support of its banking partners.  Simon Hamblin, CEO of Isle of Man-based bitcoin, gold and sterling exchange Netagio, told CoinDesk he has been approached by a number of alternative finance providers in other jurisdictions keen to work with his company.  ""Britain is making claims about its commitment to innovation, not least in the area of FinTech, and yet, regrettably, the banking industry does not seem to share this commitment,"" he said.  Hamblin added:  ""The sad impact is that this view – which some might argue to be anti-competitive – ultimately will drive innovation, talent and future economic benefit to other jurisdictions.”  This week, the Isle of Man is playing host to a bitcoin conference titled Crypto Valley Summit. The topic of banking is to be discussed on the first day in a panel discussion featuring Paul Davis, managing director of Counting House; Jason Field, CEO of Instabill; and Ian Bancroft, managing director of Cayman National IOM.  Other speakers at the event include His Excellency Adam Wood, lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man; Bobby Lee CEO of BTC China and Steve Beauregard, CEO of GoCoin.

""We hope to add iOS and Android native apps to our product offering later this year,"" he added.  Launch imminent  Before the talk, Allaire told CoinDesk his company had received a great deal of positive feedback since launching its service in beta back in July.  He explained that users in 60 countries have tested the site so far, but he hopes to increase its reach even further when the service comes out of beta, which will be happening ""very soon"".  The company's aim is to bring bitcoin to the masses, offering a simple platform that enables people to store, send and receive bitcoin.  Currently, all users can top up their Circle bitcoin accounts using their credit and debit cards, but US users can also top up by linking their bank accounts. Allaire said the company is working to enable the latter feature for users in other countries too.

42377624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VRR,1410876172,New Organisation Offers Bitcoin Accreditation for Financial Professionals,"Accountants, attorneys and financial professionals seeking to advise digital currency consumers and companies can now pursue professional accreditation from the Digital Currency Council (DCC).  The New York-based professional services company officially launched today with the backing of Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, the investment vehicle led by SecondMarket chairman Barry Silbert, to provide training, support and education to members of these services sectors.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the DCC's CEO and founder David Berger asserted that there is a real need for his organisation given the fact that these professionals are becoming the first place consumers turn to when considering digital currency investments.  Suggesting that there is a broad lack of knowledge about the subject among its target demographics, Berger told CoinDesk:  ""We believe professionals should be held to a higher standard than the average person, because they're advising others for a fee. If you or I want to make an investment in bitcoin, that's our prerogative. But, if someone is going to advise us on it, we're putting our faith in them, so we're going to be held to a higher standard.""  The former Americas CEO of business support service Campden Wealth indicated that the DCC aims to partner with the major professional organisations serving these industries, and that outreach to these entities has already begun.  Addressing a need  Berger told CoinDesk that the DCC is the product of his 18 months working with high-net-worth investors and family offices. During this time, Berger said, he met with hundreds of wealth management professionals who weren't able to answer even basic questions about digital currency.  He explained:  ""For the most part, I was met with shoulder shrugs and people looking at me with a blank stare, and I realized if traditional advisors aren't prepared to answer questions from their clients, then their clients will miss out on the opportunity or [not be appraised of] the risks.""  As such, Berger indicated that the DCC aims to become the bitcoin industry's version of organisations like the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association, a global group that offers accreditations for alternative investment professionals, and the CFA Institutehttps://www.cfainstitute.org/Pages/index.aspx, which develops ethical standards for investment professionals.  DCC curriculum topics will cover the characteristics of major digital currencies, secure storage options for consumers and past statements from major US regulatory bodies, among others  Membership options  To support its efforts, the DCC will offer four tiers of membership plans, from its free basic 'Explorer' package to its more extensive 'Innovator' product, which costs $99 per month.  While anyone can join the group, DCC certified professionals, Berger said, will need to complete an exam given by the organisation and be willing to respond to inquiries received by the group itself.  Those who wish to sit for the exam need to become 'Leader' members, a package that costs $49 as part of a limited-time offer. DCC Leader members will be able to send messages to other DCC members, host DCC events, gain access to continuing online education, receive proprietary research and receive referrals from new clients.  Leader members will, in turn, need to provide a link to their professional profiles online to prove that they are currently operating in the DCC's areas of specialty.  Building a community  Of course, Berger acknowledged that the DCC will face a challenge in building its membership base, though he indicated he expects some interest from early adopters.  Likewise, Silbert told CoinDesk that he believes financial professionals will, in turn, have an increasingly compelling incentive to engage the DCC, citing this as a key reason behind his firm's investment in the organisation.  Silbert said:  ""There's certainly a lack of educational material and advisors, whether its wealth advisors or accountants, the last thing they want to do is sound dumb in front of their clients, or worse, send their clients to another professional.""  Berger expects that interest in digital currencies will increase over time, and that this will strengthen the DCC and its appeal.  ""The more bitcoin is integrated into our everyday lives the more there will be a need for accountants, lawyers, financial advisors and others who have the experience necessary to advise us on it,"" Berger concluded.

The free online course, titled DFIN-511: Introduction to Digital Currencies, was taught by Antonis Polemitis and Andreas M Antonopoulos.  The duo published a comprehensive explanation of how they designed the certificates to be block chain verifiable. This means that course graduates no longer have to rely on the university to verify that they completed the course successfully.  ""Even if the University of Nicosia and its website were to disappear, so long as the validated hash still exists as a public record, people can [...] authenticate any certificate,"" the course website said.    5/ Note this transaction and the OP_Return code that contains a hash of the index document for all the certificates: https://t.co/sC8cFCw2Ce      — Digital Currency (@MScDigital) September 15, 2014      How it works  Verifying the university's certificates relies on the OP_RETURN field that is contained in each transaction. The field was designed to allow a small amount of extra data to be stored in the block chain, as a first step towards allowing assets like property or documents like contracts to be exchanged using the protocol.  The course instructors created hashes of the PDF versions of each certificate, collated all the certificates into an index document, and then generated a hash of that. This hash was then entered into the OP_RETURN field of an unspendable transaction.  Hashes are unique strings of characters that can be generated by any input, using an algorithm. In this case, the SHA-256 algorithm, which is also used in the bitcoin protocol, was used. Hashes are only one-way, so someone with a particular certificate can replicate a hash using the algorithm, but that hash can't regenerate the certificate.  Hashes of hashes  The instructors have published the hash of the certificate index on the university's website. Anyone who wishes to verify a certificate must first check that he has the correct index document. This is done by checking the OP_RETURN field of the particular transaction sent by the instructors.  Once the index has been verified, then individual certificates can be verified. This is done by creating a SHA-256 hash of a given certificate, and then comparing it against the hashes listed in the authenticated index document.  The hash of the index document is published on the University of Nicosia website, along with the specific transaction containing this data. The hash contained in the transaction's OP_RETURN field can be seen at sites like Coin Secrets.  For the validation process to work, the index document has to be readily available. The course instructors note that students are encouraged to host the index document themselves to reduce reliance on the document located on the university's website.  The course instructors also announced that the course completion rate was over 20% from a cohort of 615 students. The next session of the course is scheduled to start on 15th October.

42377617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VId,1410867859,Assange: Bitcoin and WikiLeaks Helped Keep Each Other Alive,"Julian Assange has described how bitcoin founder 'Satoshi Nakamoto' asked him not to use the fledgling digital currency for WikiLeaks fundraising, and how going along with that request helped protect bitcoin from government scrutiny during its early days.  The revelations came in a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session set up by the WikiLeaks founder to promote his new book, When Google Met WikiLeaks.  Most of the Q&A revolved around WikiLeaks and politics, but the subject of bitcoin was raised on more than one occasion.  Assange said:  “There's lots on bitcoin in my book - on my thoughts on it, and on WikiLeaks' history with it. [Google's] Eric Schmidt and I conversed for a while about it, and I also included a lot of notes to expand on my views. It's a fascinating and complex subject, so I can't possibly go through all of it.”  Assange further explained that he started exploring the possibility of using bitcoin to raise funds in late 2010, after major payment processors started denying their services to WikiLeaks.  The pros and cons of bitcoin fundraising  That idea, however, proved controversial, since some bitcoin pioneers were concerned that it could provoke unwanted government interest in the new digital currency. On the other hand, some believed the media attention would make bitcoin more popular. An online discussion ensued on a bitcoin forum early in December of 2010.  In the book, Assange recalls Nakamoto’s pragmatic position on the matter:  'Basically, bring it on,' wrote one poster. 'Satoshi Nakamoto,' the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, responded: “No, don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.  Assange said the WikiLeaks team looked into the matter and agreed with Nakamoto. Consequently deciding against accepting bitcoin donations at such an early date, giving the cryptocurrency more time to mature and establish itself as an alternative method of payment.  WikiLeaks eventually opened up to bitcoin donations in June 2011.  Bitcoin innovation stretches beyond payments  Assange has already spoken in favour of bitcoin on several occasions. Earlier this year he described bitcoin as “the most intellectually interesting development in the last two years” and said he expects the world's next major innovation will be in the finance sector, with bitcoin playing a role.  During the AMA session, Assange argued that bitcoin has a lot to offer beyond mere payments, as the block chain can be used for a range of different tasks and, in theory, the network could be used to “nail down” history.  Assange explained:  “Bitcoin is an extremely important innovation, but not in the way most people think. Bitcoin's real innovation is a globally verifiable proof publishing at a certain time. The whole system is built on that concept and many other systems can also be built on it. The block chain nails down history, breaking Orwell's dictum of 'He who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future'.”  Assange also confirmed that WikiLeaks made a substantial amount of money via what he called a “strategic investment” in bitcoin. Assange recalled that bitcoin had risen above the US dollar and reached parity with the euro on the day of his conversation with Eric Schmidt. Although he tried and failed to persuade Schmidt to embrace bitcoin, Assange’s belief in the concept helped WikiLeaks in its darkest hour.  “WikiLeaks’ strategic investments in the currency saw more than 8,000 percent return in three years, seeing us through the extralegal US banking blockade,” said Assange.  While Assange takes credit for keeping bitcoin safe from government scrutiny following the publication of US diplomatic cables, he also gives bitcoin credit for helping WikiLeaks survive the government clampdown.

The central bank of Bangladesh has issued a new statement suggesting that the use of digital currency is now illegal in the country.  The Bangladesh Bank, as originally reported by the Agence France-Presse (AFP), has said that the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is unlawful under existing anti-money laundering (AML) statutes.  The Bangladesh Bank noted in its advisory that harsh penalties could be imposed on those who use digital currencies, saying:  ""Bitcoin is not a legal tender of any country. Any transaction through bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is a punishable offense.”  AFP also reportedly spoke to a representative from the bank, who said that the act of using a digital currency could be punishable by as much as 12 years in prison.  Bangladesh recently enacted Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012, a revision of a 2009 law that aimed to bring the country's AML policies up to global standards.  Popularity leads to announcement  Notably, the bank's decision to outlaw digital currency transactions derived from increasing reports in the local media regarding the use of bitcoin by domestic residents.  The announcement follows the formation of the Bitcoin Foundation’s official chapter in Bangladesh, the organisation's first affiliate program in Asia. The Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh opened to great fanfare in mid-August and counts international bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver among its advisors.  At the time, members of the group expressed optimism that formal recognition of the group would lead to greater domestic awareness of the technology.  At press time, the Bitcoin Foundation and Ver had yet to respond to requests for comment.  Latest nation to restrict bitcoin  With the announcement, Bangladesh became the latest nation to restrict bitcoin activities outright, although it is not clear whether the country has enacted a formal digital currency ban.  Bolivia’s central bank  , for example, banned bitcoin earlier this year, saying that it had taken the action in order to protect both Bolivia’s national currency, the boliviano, and its citizens.  Soon after, bitcoin was banned in Ecuador as part of a legislative vote that created a new state-backed digital money. Though not named specifically in the bill, the ban was formally affirmed in statements to local businesses.  While other central banks around the world have issued warnings about the use of digital currency, potential dangers and the risk of fraudulent applications, many have avoided outright restrictions.  A full transation of the statements can be found below:  This is hereby to caution everyone not to transact any online artificial currency (such as bitcoin).
