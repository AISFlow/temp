DeFi has provided users alternatives to traditional investments that they would otherwise not be able to access and this has been one of the major factors driving the growth of the space. Currently, there are a number of blockchains on which DeFi protocols are programmed, namely; Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, which Yieldly is built on, among others. These blockchains seem to be in an arms race to secure the most market share and lead the space. However, Yieldly&apos;s CEO Sebastian Quinn does not believe this is the way to win. Instead, Quinn says, the focus should be more on interoperability between blockchains. Quinn sat down with NewsBTC for an interview, where the CEO shared thoughts about the space, programmable blockchains, and some exclusive insight on future listings of Yieldly&apos;s native token YLDY. NewsBTC: Can you tell us about your background and what led to Yieldy? Sebastian Quinn: My professional training is in corporate law.
