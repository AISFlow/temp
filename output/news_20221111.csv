42414956,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVCYy,1668207066,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Returns to Red, Tumbling 7% on FTX Collapse","Price Action  FTX crashed. Cryptocurrency prices tumbled on Friday as fretful investors returned to their defensive postures of earlier in the week.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $16,675, down nearly 7%. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still hovering near $17,000 when CoinDesk reported that FTX, the once-widely revered exchange, had filed for bankruptcy after a fruitless search for a rescuer. The ongoing fallout for an already shellshocked crypto sector remains uncertain.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “The collapse of FTX and the uncertainty it has brought to the industry has been another damaging blow,” wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda. “How damaging it will be will depend on what further details appear in the coming days but right now, prices remain under pressure and vulnerable to further sharp declines.”  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands just above $1,260, off more than 4.5%. Most other major cryptos by market value spent their day in the red, victims of FTX contagion. FTX’s FTT token recently plunged more than 30% to approach its low perch from earlier in the week.  As CoinDesk reported, the Solana blockchain’s SOL token, one of the hardest-hit digital assets this week, slid nearly 12%. SOL’s decline stemmed from speculation about Solana’s close connection to Alameda Research, a trading firm that was founded by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. SOL was Alameda's second-largest holding, according to Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, dropped 4.2%.  Equity markets continued their momentum from Thursday, especially the tech sector. The Nasdaq rose 1.8%, while the S&P 500 increased 0.9%.  Yet, consumer attitudes about the U.S. economic future slumped in November, according to the University of Michigan’s much-watched monthly consumer sentiment index. The index had risen unsteadily in recent months after falling to an all-time low in June.  Although buoyed by stocks’ recent rise, Oanda’s Erlam noted that investor “sentiment [could] cool again in the coming weeks.”  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 860.65 −38.6 ▼ 4.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,858 −852.4 ▼ 4.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,274 −39.0 ▼ 3.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,992.93 +36.6 ▲ 0.9% Gold  $1,774 +23.9 ▲ 1.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.81% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Technical Take  Post-FTX, What Happens to Crypto Markets?  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Since 2015, BTC’s RSI has fallen between 30 and 50 on 1,005 occasions. Since 2017, ETH’s RSI has maintained the same range 682 times.  The average 30-day performance following those occurrences since that time has been -1.1% for ETH and 3.03% for BTC.  Bitcoin and ether’s respective $20,000 and $1,300 support levels of a week ago will now likely represent resistance.  Read the full technical take here.

The gains were mainly due to a memorable rally staged by U.S. stocks on Thursday which was spurred by data that showed core and headline consumer inflation were softer than expected in October. The CPI data sparked off hopes that the Federal Reserve would slow down its aggressive rate-hike path. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are now pricing in a 85.4% probability of a 50-basis-point hike at the central bank's policy meeting next month, up from a 80.6% probability just earlier in the day. Another major event during the week was the U.S. midterm elections, the results of which still remain uncertain as votes continue to be counted. The Republican Party looked set take control of the House, but the outcome of the Senate was yet to be decided. That uncertainty reflected in the stock market on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) falling over 2% in that session. The third quarter earnings season began to wind down this week. The biggest name that reported was entertainment giant Disney ( DIS ), which issued a disappointing quarterly report that sent its shares tumbling . Among other major companies, videogame stalwarts Take-Two Interactive ( TTWO ) and Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ) announced their numbers. Retail giants Walmart ( WMT ), Target ( TGT ) and Home Depot ( HD ) are among firms on tap to report next week , with investors closely watching out for their comments on consumer spending and forecasts for the all-important holiday quarter. Crypto markets also garnered attention this week, as beleaguered exchange FTX's troubled saga which ended in it filing for bankruptcy and its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried quitting sent cryptocurrencies into a tailspin. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was on track to post weekly losses of more than 20%. In terms of weekly economic data, other than the inflation report the calendar was light. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected. The University of Michigan's preliminary measure of November consumer sentiment came in lower than anticipated, while inflation expectations ticked up. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) on Friday rose 5.89% for the week alongside the benchmark index. The ETF is -16.10% YTD. All 11 S&P 500 ( SP500 ) sectors ended the week in the green. Rate-sensitive sectors Information Technology and Communication Services were the top gainers, while defensive sectors Health Care and Utilities rose the least. See below a breakdown of the weekly performance of the sectors as well as the performance of their accompanying SPDR Select Sector ETFs from Nov. 4 close to Nov. 11 close: #1: Information Technology +10.03% , and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLK ) +10.04% . #2: Communication Services +9.23% , and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLC ) +9.41% . #3: Materials +7.69% , and the Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLB ) +7.73% . #4: Real Estate +7.07% , and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLRE ) +7.05% . #5: Consumer Discretionary +5.93% , and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLY ) +5.52% . #6: Financials +5.72% , and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) +5.78% . #7: Industrials +4.60% , and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLI ) +4.69% . #8: Consumer Staples +2.38% , and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLP ) +2.32% . #9: Energy +2.00% , and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLE ) +1.87% . #10: Utilities +1.39% , and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLU ) +1.48% . #11: Health Care +1.07% , and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLV ) +1.04% .

42411312,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzQq,1668204080,FTX's Fall Will Lift the Next Generation of Bitcoin Maximalists,"The collapse of FTX has caused yet another destructive wave to wash over crypto – the world of altcoins, crypto exchanges and overleveraged entities.  It’s impossible to say at this point how much collateral damage the loss of what was once the third-largest crypto exchange – whose founder had a foot in the door in Washington, D.C., his face plastered on sports stadiums and subway stations as well as his fingers in untold financial pies – will bring.  BlockFi, which was rescued by FTX just months ago, has paused withdrawals, Genesis, a CoinDesk sister company, needs another lifeline and rumors are circulating that many Solana-based projects are facing insolvency. (Bankman-Fried was a notable supporter of SOL.)  Will Szamosszegi is founder and CEO of Sazmining.  The lesson to sufferers and outside witnesses alike is the same, and it is simple: Self-custody your bitcoin. Do not fall to the temptation of staking rewards, harebrained tokenomics schemes or the simplicity of using an exchange.  Bitcoin maximalists are called “toxic” for being so hardlined about this issue, but they've been proven right time and time again. A new generation of ardent bitcoin maximalists will be born from FTX's implosion.  ‘Toxic’ maximalism wins the day  During the summer of 2022, controversy struck the Bitcoin community regarding toxic maximalism: Partner at Castle Island Ventures (and CoinDesk columnist) Nic Carter (then a vocal bitcoin supporter) had participated in an investment in a Web3 wallet company, and was called out for building beyond bitcoin.  In response to his critics, Carter wrote a lengthy Medium article in which he distanced himself from the bitcoin maximalist community: “I am not a “bitcoin maximalist, I have never been one, I will never be one.” Entering and exiting the bitcoin community is voluntary, but on his way out Carter showed maybe he never understood bitcoin’s “toxicity.”  Bitcoiners certainly take up a few unapologetic, uncompromising stances. Tomer Strolight, editor in chief at Swan Bitcoin, has argued that bitcoin maximalists’ perceived toxicity is really just principled opposition. When maximalists criticize centralized crypto exchanges, curse the altcoin ecosystem or call creators of new tokens scam artists, they are actually working to uphold the integrity of the Bitcoin network.  Read more: The Collapse of the FTX Empire  For these views, bitcoiners have been called parochial. For instance, Stephan Livera, managing director of Swan Bitcoin, wrote in Bitcoin Magazine that maximalists are often criticized for not “understanding” the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is incorrect because bitcoiners (many of them former “crypto” advocates) understand blockchains only too well.  There are technological limits to what blockchains can achieve, social contagions in crypto that foment scams and economic principles such as creating a viable alternative to fiat currencies at play. Bitcoiners think bitcoin eventually will become the next global reserve asset – and so can argue in good faith that playing with other cryptocurrencies or trusting one’s BTC to a third-party is a waste of one’s time at best and a dangerous risk at worst.  This hardline stance certainly looks good today because the broader crypto industry is facing its “Lehman moment.” Bitcoin maximalists are entirely correct that if all you did was buy bitcoin and store it in a hard wallet you would have placed yourself completely outside of FTX’s economic blast radius.  Read more: It’s Time to End Maximalism in Crypto / Opinion  One may quibble over bitcoin maximalists’ choice of words (like the vulgar term for a supposedly scat-related coin) but perhaps they have been strident for a reason. From their perspective, altcoins and “easy” crypto rewards have always had zero value, and the people selling you them have always been snake oil salesmen. Crypto calamities are always around the corner, and bitcoiners are only trying to warn others.  A new generation of maxis  Many crypto enthusiasts who are suffering due to FTX’s implosion are likely to take a second look at all of the “toxic” messaging that bitcoin maximalists have been shouting from the rooftops. It could begin with a simple question. Were the maximalists right?  They will begin their journey anew, assuming they do not exit crypto entirely, no longer so susceptible to crypto scams. But if they keep an open mind, and try to return to the principles of decentralization, self-custody and self-reliance, they will find that bitcoin is unique.  It’s not just bitcoin’s origin story – the first “cryptocurrency” was founded by a pseudonymous developer who launched the network fairly and stepped away from his vast trove of tokens earned just like anyone else – that sets it apart. But also, what Bitcoin has become: A decentralized financial network that anyone can use, that’s governed transparently by predetermined rules and that no one can shut down. What is crypto in comparison?  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried No Longer a Billionaire After $14.6B Wipeout: Bloomberg  Well, crypto is Sam Bankman-Fried: a (former) billionaire who lied to investors and his own users. Crypto is FTX: an underfunded exchange that provided little social or economic value even when it was in operation, that people trusted. Crypto is Alameda Research: a hedge fund that in all probability traded against FTX users, backed dubious projects and had a hole so big in its balance sheet it swallowed the crypto industry.  The new generation of ardent bitcoin maximalists born from FTX’s ashes will, in time, hold their bitcoin keys on their own wallets (perhaps a Trezor or Ledger) and they will not be susceptible to Ponzi schemes propped up by the reputation of whoever the next paper billionaire with his/her own coin.  The pain felt right now is real. The feeling of having been deceived must be unbearable. But know that whatever shame, guilt, anger, depression or rage you have ties back to one source. Bankman-Fried got away with his lies for so long because “crypto” itself is built on a lie: What calls itself a revolution is really just the fiat system par excellence. Satoshi Nakamoto started a new network that makes double-counting impossible because everyone has the same view of what’s going on. It exists, while crypto can vanish.  This is the free market in action: Mistakes are punished and correct choices are rewarded.

42420874,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZCX,1668203247,"Post-FTX, What Happens to Crypto Markets?","What a week.  The bankruptcy of one-time crypto industry powerhouse FTX represents the latest unsavory chapter in an industry regularly rocked by crises.  Yet, cryptocurrencies have historically rebounded to new heights following each calamity. What doesn’t wipe out blockchain and other crypto ventures makes them stronger as new fortified iterations of themselves.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has weathered a range of big setbacks, including Mt. Gox, other bankruptcies, security breaches and macroeconomic uncertainties. BTC was most recently trading just under $17,000 after falling below $16,000 earlier in the week for the first time in two years. Its current level puts it within range of its previous high water mark during the crypto bull market of late 2017.  How do markets recover from crypto’s latest black eye? To continue a boxing analogy, we’re still in the early post-apocalyptic rounds. Let’s consider a couple of constants.  Bitcoin remains a network that allows payments to be sent from one party to another without need of financial intermediation. Its currency, bitcoin, remains a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, with a capped supply of 21 million coins.  Ethererum remains a protocol for building decentralized applications. Its ether (ETH) token remains the fuel for the Ethereum network. Ether can still be used to store value, generate yield and process transactions. Ether has recently become a deflationary asset, decreasing in supply for the time being thanks to Ethereum's recent upgrade, known as the Merge.  The tenets of supply and demand remain in bitcoin and post-Merge ether’s favor. The volume of each is limited and the public, increasingly including institutional investors, remains robust.  But price direction among other cryptocurrencies is uncertain, subject to many different factors including protocols’ ability to execute on their strategies and engage the public.  Separately, an improving economy, a more settled socio-political landscape and clearer crypto regulation in some combination would likely buoy markets. A fresh debacle and sudden economic reversal from the current encouraging signs would likely lead to a downturn and renewed doubts about crypto’s future.  Macroeconomics  Markets received positive news this week, with CoinDesk reporting U.S. consumer prices rose slower than projected for October. The overhang of inflation and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) efforts to quell its advance has been an ongoing theme.  To be sure, economic challenges still exist. For instance, the spread between the yields for the 10- and two-year U.S. Treasury bonds remains negative. The inversion of this yield curve, which has been present since July, has historically been a predictor of economic recessions.  But the FOMC remains fully committed to fighting inflation, the biggest long-range threat to the U.S. economy. And the economic landscape appears to be stabilizing, or at least avoiding market moving surprises.  Technical levels  To say that BTC and ETH have been oversold as FTX has disintegrated is an understatement. Yet, investors should not see this trend as a clarion call to buy, particularly as prices have rebounded over the past couple of days and are not as oversold.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC and ETH is 35 and 40, respectively. RSI levels under 30 are generally a signal that an asset’s price is undervalued.  Based on past data, BTC and ETH’s RSI levels don’t imply much movement over the next 30 days.  Since 2015, BTC’s RSI has fallen between 30 and 50 on 1,005 occasions. Since 2017, ETH’s RSI has maintained the same range 682 times.  The average 30-day performance following those occurrences since that time has been -1.1% for ETH and 3.03% for BTC.  Bitcoin and ether’s respective $20,000 and $1,300 support levels of a week ago will now likely represent resistance.  On-chain data  On-chain data shows a decline in BTC and ETH transferred to centralized exchanges following a spike on Nov. 9.  This bears watching because coins are often sent to exchanges prior to offloading. Historical data for this metric must also be used as a less reliable benchmark.  Given the turmoil, I would expect investors to hold their coins on exchanges for much shorter periods of time, using exchanges as transactional vehicles only.  Funding rates for BTC, often used as an indicator of sentiment, have turned positive again after two sharp moves down.  The final verdict will depend on the individual's time horizon. Contagion effects are still working their way through markets, not to mention the looming overhang of government regulation.  Bitcoin and ether’s core principles remain unchanged. As such, recent turmoil may represent a unique opportunity for bullish investors, albeit not without additional challenges.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/11/post-ftx-what-happens-to-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a03ea2784dfc960f594ed730e58593b813f0300-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In September, FTX paid $1.4 billion to win a bidding war to acquire Voyager’s assets, beating out other crypto firms including rival exchange Binance and digital asset investment firm Wave Financial.  FTX US, along with its international parent company, FTX, and quant trading firm Alameda Research, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Friday after news spread earlier in the week of the company’s massive liquidity crisis. The portfolio of companies is now fessing up to a massive hole of between $10 billion and $50 billion in their balance sheets.  A part of that money apparently belongs to Voyager and its customers. In the press release issued Friday, Voyager admitted that it has approximately $3 million currently locked up in FTX, “substantially comprised of locked LUNA2 and locked SRM.”  Following FTX’s collapse, Voyager Digital and the Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors announced on Friday they have reopened the bidding process and are “in active discussions with alternative bidders.”  In a press statement, Voyager claims the company did not transfer any assets to FTX in connection with the sale agreement.  A $5 million “good faith” deposit submitted to Voyager Digital by FTX US is currently being held in escrow.

The top crypto, which was stuck in rangebound trading over the past several weeks, dropped to a two-year low of ~$15.7K on Wednesday. Sam Bankman-Fried quit as FTX CEO and the crypto exchange began voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. John Ray III has been named Fried's successor as CEO. Ray reportedly oversaw the liquidation of former energy trader Enron. FTX Token's ( FTT-USD ) market cap has shed ~$2.6B this week, currently standing at ~$350M, according to CoinMarketCap . The world's largest crypto exchange Binance initially offered to acquire the non-U.S. business of FTX, but pulled out after FTX reportedly came under regulatory scrutiny over potential mishandling of funds. In response to the crypto selloff, Binance topped up its emergency insurance fund to $1B . Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) said late on Friday that it reopened the bidding process for the firm after FTX filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy. SEC chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC that crypto investors need better protection as the sector is ""significantly non-compliant"", despite having some clear regulations. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) CEO Mike Novogratz told CNBC that the FTX implosion is a ""body blow"" to trust in the industry. But MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) co-founder Michael Saylor said it highlights the importance of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), adding that now is a good time to accumulate the token . Now, one exchange traded fund has taken advantage of the broader selloff - ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ). The ETF climbed over 9% on Friday, with its trading volume at ~1.7M vs. average trading volume 916.9K. On Thursday, inflation print for October came in cooler than expected, after which bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ) erased some losses as the data sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise rates at a slower pace. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slid 7.3% to $16.67K at 4.01 pm ET, while Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) fell 5.7% to $1.25K.

Traders continued to buy into growth stocks, with megacap technology firms rising across the board. The benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) rose 0.92% to close at 3,992.93 points. ""We anticipate some corrective weakness in both indices in the next week or two – but we remain bullish on both through year end,"" Seeking Alpha contributor Alex King of Cestrian Capital Research said. The Dow ( DJI ) managed to eke out gains of 0.10% to end the session at 33,747.86 points. It fell as much as ~1% earlier in the day. The blue-chip index was capped by losses in defensive healthcare stocks . ""The Dow has shown exceptional strength and is now threatening to make a new all time high (even with a selloff in key Dow components today, the index is less than 10% from its prior high point) - and we think the S&P and the Nasdaq could do the same in 2023,"" King added. For the week, all three major averages ended solidly in the green, largely helped by Thursday's massive gains. The Nasdaq added 8.10% , the S&P rose 5.90% and the Dow advanced 4.15% . Of the 11 S&P sectors, six rose, with Energy the top gainer, as crude oil prices surged after China eased some of its tough COVID-19 rules which added to hopes for a demand boost. Aside from Health Care, defensive sectors Utilities and Consumer Staples were the top three losers. The bond market was closed for the Veterans Day holiday following a sharp drop in Treasury yields in the previous session after monthly core CPI came in cooler than anticipated. The inflation data spurred hopes that the Federal Reserve would slow down its aggressive rate-hike path. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are now pricing in a 80.6% probability of a 50-basis-point hike rather than a 75-point one at the central bank's policy meeting next month. ""It's still a long, long, long path ahead towards anything resembling normal inflation, but with monthly core CPI running at its slowest pace in over a year, investors immediately latched onto hopes that the Fed wouldn't need to be as aggressive in raising rates, leading to a massive surge across all the major asset classes (on Thursday),"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said. In economic data on Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary measure of November consumer sentiment came in lower than anticipated at 54.7 vs. the consensus figure of 59.5 . Inflation expectations ticked up to 5.1%. The FTX saga took another twist on Friday after the cryptocurrency exchange commenced bankruptcy proceedings and its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down. Crypto markets resumed their selloff , with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down more than 3%. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was marginally lower. Among other active movers, Chinese tech stocks ended higher amid the conclusion of the Singles' Day shopping event and broader optimism as Beijing moved to relax its tough COVID-19 policies. Macau casino stocks also rose . Health and pharma stocks fell in sector-wide selling, with UnitedHealth, Merck and Johnson & Johnson the top three percentage losers on the Dow ( DJI ). Cigna and Elevance Health were the top losers on the S&P ( SP500 ). In earnings related news, software company Expensify fell on a disappointing quarterly report. Shares of electric vehicle startup Polestar drove higher after its revenue more than doubled. Pot stocks gained on the back of Aurora Cannabis' results. The third quarter earnings season largely begins to wind down next week , though reports from retail giants such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot will be closely watched for comments around the state of consumer spending and their forecasts for the all-important holiday sales quarter.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3906510-sp-500-dow-jones-nasdaq-crpyto-veterans-day?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4086240.jpeg

42414958,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVCeH,1668198990,Meet the Metaverse Nightclub–Loving Audit Firm That Presided Over FTX’s Financials,"Crypto exchange FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday with an eleven-figure hole in its books. As observers remarked on the rapid deterioration of then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading empire, a natural question emerged: Who was FTX’s auditor?  FTX Trading LLC, the exchange’s international arm, worked with auditing firm Prager Metis, according to financial statements seen Friday by CoinDesk. The mid-sized firm lists 24 operating locations on its website, including the “metaverse.”  A now-deleted post on the company's website, published in June 2022 said Prager Metis was ""proud to support FTX US."" (The page was still viewable in Google’s search cache.)  The 2020 and 2021 FTX US audits were performed by New York City-based firm Armanino, according to documents viewed by CoinDesk.  A cursory internet search reveals Prager Metis provides tax, auditing and advisory services, notably to the entertainment and music industries, though it has no clients named on its website. It also surfaces more spicy fare: The company announced plans to open an office in the Decentraland metaverse in February 2022, and will sponsor an upcoming metaverse party for the scantily clad Decentraland Babydolls.  On its website, FTX said it had successfully undergone a U.S. GAAP financial audit for 2021.  As FTX ran into trouble this week, many critics pointed to FTX’s opaque business operations and how a lack of oversight may have allowed Bankman-Fried and his inner circle of executives to conceal possibly fraudulent behavior.  “I don’t know anything about FTX,” said Jerry Eitel, the partner emeritus and chief metaverse officer at Prager Metis. “I’m retired,” Eitel added, before disconnecting on the phone. (Eitel is a one-time CoinDesk contributor.) The head of Prager Metis’ audit practice could not be reached for comment.  Venture capital giant Sequoia, which wrote off the entirety of its $150 million investment in FTX this week, justified its investment in the company by citing FTX’s strong 2021 financials. The venture fund touted FTX’s $1 billion in revenues and $250 million in operating income as evidence of the company’s legitimacy, both figures CoinDesk’s leaked Prager Metis reports corroborate.  “At the time of our investment in FTX, we ran a rigorous diligence process,” the team wrote in a letter to investors.  Spokespeople for FTX and FTX US did not respond to a request for comment. The people did not respond when asked if the firm, M Group Strategic Communications, was still representing the company.

42420796,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH7t,1668198369,Crypto.com's Preliminary Glimpse of Token Reserves Reveals 20% in Shiba Inu Coin,"The swift collapse of the FTX crypto exchange has sparked an industry push among big rivals to publish proof of their reserves as a means to provide transparency into the assets on their platforms.  With those efforts just getting underway, one firm, Crypto.com, has taken the proactive step of providing a preliminary set of disclosures – sharing wallet addresses with the blockchain analysis firm Nansen to create a dashboard of nearly $3 billion of reserves and other assets.  What that shows is just how heavily the mix of assets is skewed toward a meme-y token called shiba inu (SHIB), a digital asset built atop the Ethereum blockchain that was largely inspired by the joke token dogecoin (DOGE). Like DOGE – a key staple of billionaire Elon Musk’s crypto schtick on Twitter – the SHIB token is a highly volatile cryptocurrency whose primary use case is often considered to be speculation itself; it’s traded for fast profits and yuks.  Of the $2.88 billion in total assets in the wallets, roughly $558 million, or about 20%, are in SHIB.  The holding ranks second only to the $872 million of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which represents 31%. The amount exceeds the $487 million in ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, and dwarfs the $1.5 million in dogecoin, Nansen data suggests.  A Crypto.com spokesperson said, ""The reason our Proof of Reserves include Shiba is because we hold customers' balances 1:1. Thus, our Proof of Reserves are dictated by our customer holdings.""  Crypto.com’s large holding of SHIB is a “reflection of user interest/activity,” Nansen data journalist Martin Lee told CoinDesk via a Telegram message.  “In an ideal world, we’d want the best assets to be worth the most, but SHIB and DOGE both have extremely high market caps,” he said. So it’s “not super surprising that retail-heavy exchanges will have a higher concentration of such tokens. And regardless, as an exchange, your main source of revenue would likely be trading fees, so whether it’s meme coins or more fundamentally sound assets, your business model is intact.”  The shiba inu token vaulted into the headlines in May 2021 when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was sent roughly $1.2 billion of unsolicited SHIB tokens by creators of several dogecoin knock-offs, and then promptly regifted those to the India COVID-19 Relief Fund.  Despite its ridiculousness – or maybe because of it – the SHIB token is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. The @Shibtoken account on Twitter boasts 3.6 million followers, and even after a swift sell-off across crypto markets the token still has a $5.74 billion market capitalization and a 24-hour trading volume of $347.9 million at press time, per CoinDesk data.

42414949,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVBxp,1668196918,"Solana Volatility Returns After FTX Bankruptcy, but What Comes Next?","The Solana blockchain’s SOL token, one of the hardest-hit digital assets this week amid a steep sell-off across crypto markets triggered by the swift collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s business empire, slid further on Friday after the one-time billionaire’s main holding company filed for bankruptcy protection.  SOL's price had tumbled to a record low earlier this week of around $12 and then surged 26% to as high as $19 on Thursday.  But on Friday, after the FTX bankruptcy news, the price was back down to around $16, off 6.4% on the day. The SOL price is down 50% in the past seven days.  The additional volatility has sparked a debate among crypto analysts and blockchain developers and executives over Solana’s long-term future, with nagging questions about the prospects for the blockchain and how severely it might be affected by this week’s fallout in the industry.  The SOL token’s recent price movements were tied to speculation about Solana’s close connection with Alameda Research, a trading firm that was founded by Bankman-Fried. SOL was Alameda's second-largest holding, according to Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  The theory was that Alameda might need to dump its SOL tokens to raise liquidity. SOL jumped Thursday after Solana Foundation postponed a plan to ""unstake"" 28.5 million SOL tokens – implying an immediate relief from additional selling pressure.  “Solana is more centralized than, say, Ethereum, as they are clearly limiting the amount unstaked to protect SOL’s price,” Carey told CoinDesk.  Crypto markets were also broadly down Friday; the CoinDesk Market Index was down 3%.  The swift decline in SOL doesn't represent the “death knell” for Solana, according to Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners.  He contrasted Solana with other blockchain projects where development is funded primarily by venture capitalists.  ""I think a lot of these protocols do benefit from astroturfing by VCs,” he said, “like an illusion of grassroots growth when in fact it's all being underwritten by institutional money.""  “But I think it's not the case” for Solana, Tapscott said. With “tons of organic growth,” Solana will “have to survive on the merits of the technology and on the community.""  Marius Ciubotariu, a core contributor to Hubble Protocol and Kamino Finance on the Solana ecosystem, said, “Just as we saw with Ethereum and ETH in 2018, this current shakeout will purge Solana of pure price speculators and ensure that only those that are dedicated to the ecosystem are part of the next big wave of innovation and growth.”  Stefan Rust, CEO of blockchain technology firm Laguna Labs, said there’s speculation in the market that developers building on Solana might have had assets locked up on FTX and now can’t access those tokens.  It’s not clear yet if that’s the case, but if it were, according to Rust, “Given the extremely slow pace of bankruptcy proceedings, they may not have access to them for eight to 10 years.”  A spokesperson for the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk: ""The events of this week are unfortunate and will likely impact certain projects more than others, but the overall Solana ecosystem of thousands of developers is robust and diversified, and ecosystem projects continue to reiterate support for Solana and their commitment to building on Solana.""",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/11/solana-volatility-returns-after-ftx-bankruptcy-but-what-comes-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2a2c2f235a0f0ed558bcfcb0350b27a51b70636-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sollet Bitcoin (soBTC), a so-called “wrapped” asset supposedly backed 1-to-1 with bitcoin, plummeted $10,000 at around 2:00 p.m. ET, according to decentralized finance protocol Raydium. It had already spent much of the day trading below its bitcoin peg on the news that FTX had filed for bankruptcy protection.  The wrapped asset later recovered much of its value after FTX US inexplicably reversed course and reopened withdrawals, allowing traders to once again exit their positions. FTX US communicated neither move to the public.  Read More: FTX US Temporarily Froze Crypto Withdrawals, Adding to Chaos of Bankruptcy Proceedings  That soBTC would follow FTX into the proverbial “Goblintown” would surprise few in Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) circles, many of whom had long speculated that FTX and Alameda held the bitcoin that backed it.  Indeed, so intertwined was the bitcoin derivative and Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading empire that exchange employees were pinged on every withdrawal in the company Slack, a person said.  FTX was the only place traders could redeem their Solana-based bitcoin for real bitcoin. Shuttering withdrawals Friday, FTX effectively stranded everyone who still held the 16,000-odd soBTC still in circulation at press time Friday.  According to developers at blockchain indexer SolanaFM, 90% of soBTC is on wallets controlled by FTX or Alameda, meaning the coin’s traders had meager holdings of soBTC going into the crash.  Part of that could be due to DeFi projects preparing for the worst. Crypto lending protocols Solend and Hubble and decentralized exchange Mango Markets took steps to limit their and their users’ exposure in the final hours Friday.  “All sollet wrapped assets like soBTC are backed by FTX so nobody knows the collateralization status of those assets,” said Ben Chow, co-founder of DeFi protocol Jupiter Aggregator.

42414954,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVCTf,1668195845,Justin Sun Moved $6M Stablecoins From TrueFi Lending Pools Before FTX-Alameda Bankruptcy,"Justin Sun, founder of the Tron network and a one-time, potential savior of the insolvent crypto exchange FTX, moved $6.1 million in stablecoins from decentralized lending protocol TrueFi, which is among companies weighted down by FTX sister company Alameda Research's debts.  Transaction data on the blockchain shows that Sun withdrew the funds in four transactions processed Thursday. He moved $2.4 million of USDT, 2.1 million of USDC, $1 million TUSD and $673,000 in BUSD from the four available credit pools on the lending protocol.  The crypto wallet has been identified as Sun’s by crypto intelligence platforms Arkham Intelligence and Nansen.  Justin Sun and representatives of TrueFi had not replied to requests for comment at the time of publication.  TrueFi is a decentralized lending protocol where liquidity providers can lend money for a yield, and borrowers can take out loans for interest. The loans are uncollateralized, meaning that creditors do not pledge assets against it. Borrowers secure the loan with only their good financial standing and trust.  The withdrawals are another sign of an ongoing liquidity crunch in crypto credit markets following the sudden implosion of FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm.  Alameda Research has a $7.3 million outstanding debt on TrueFi’s Capital Markets credit facility, managed by TrueTrading. Alameda’s bad debt represents almost half of all current outstanding loans on the protocol, according to TrueFi’s dashboard. After Alameda filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, chances are low that it will be able to repay the loan.  TrueFi has already been rocked by two recent loan defaults. South Korea-based Blockwater defaulted on a $3 million debt despite restructuring efforts, and Invictus Capital didn’t pay back a $1 million loan by the maturity date after it filed for court-assisted liquidation earlier this year.  The total value locked on TrueFi cratered to $32 million from $544 million in the last six months as appetite for crypto borrowing dwindled, according to decentralized finance data site DefiLlama.

The story was first reported by Bloomberg.  LedgerX, which does business as FTX US Derivatives after being acquired in 2021, filed a plan to directly settle crypto derivatives, cutting out intermediaries, earlier this year. The move met with opposition from traditional financial players, such as Cboe, which warned that there may be investor safeguard and protection concerns.  The proposal was under review by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives products in the U.S. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, while not endorsing the plan directly, nonetheless called it ""unique"" earlier this year. ""I think this is potentially – and I emphasize the 'potential' – another phase in the evolution of market structure, innovation and disruption,"" he said at the Financial Markets Quality Conference last month.  In March, then FTX.US President Brett Harrison explained that FTX U.S. Derivatives’ current derivatives clearing organization license requires full collateralization of derivative positions through an intermediary. FTX’s application had sought to amend that to allow for direct-to-consumer margined derivatives trading for retail and institutional customers. The change would allow derivatives risks to be “transparently assessed and mitigated in real time” because of FTX’s almost continuous setting of margin levels, Harrison said.  Update on 11/14 at 14:28 UTC: CFTC confirms that FTX US Derivatives on Friday formally withdrew its application.

FTX, which had a $32 billion valuation at the start of the year, has been collapsing steadily through the week, after a CoinDesk article questioning its sister company Alameda Research’s financials led to a run on the exchange.  The voluntary petition filed on Friday names FTX’s many local iterations scattered across the world, from the U.S. to Gibraltar and Japan along with its sister company Alameda Research, as “debtors” seeking protection from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. code.  But personnel at FTX Japan and other subsidiaries, who are listed among the debtors, learned about the filing at the same time as everyone else, they told CoinDesk.  “We found out on Twitter,” an employee at an FTX subsidiary outside of the U.S. told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution. The same person said that FTX’s staff in Turkey had put their salaries and bonuses into the company due to distrust of local banks and inflation of the lira. FTX Turkey has been allowing customers to withdraw some sums in Turkish lira intermittently since Thursday, according to its Twitter posts. “It’s a f**king disaster.”  Read more: FTX Japan to Go Into 'Close-Only' Mode Following Regulator's Order to Suspend Operations  This source added that staff had been pleading for clarity from Bankman-Fried, saying they had to answer clients and they were under scrutiny. “They are literally vomiting, it’s really bad,” this source said of people running FTX operations around the world, adding that “everyone put their whole work, life, reputation on the line for this guy,” referring to Sam Bankman-Fried.  Another entity named in the petition said the CEO had kept everyone in the dark, but they had seen the bankruptcy filing coming.  FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller notified FTX employees worldwide about the bankruptcy in an internal memo posted on Slack just four minutes before the Twitter post announcing the same.  “Keep an eye on Sam’s Twitter. He posts news there more than internal updates,” said a person from FTX Japan, who also found out about the filing via Twitter.

Coinbase initially fell almost 8% on the FTX bankruptcy news but has recovered strongly since then, as have shares of Bakkt.  Some analysts have noted how more regulated and transparent U.S.-based exchanges such as Coinbase could benefit from FTX's troubles.  Longer term, Coinbase can “take market share from FTX, and other opaque platforms within and outside of US,” Oppenheimer equity research analyst Owen Lau told clients in a note Thursday. Still, Lau lowered his price target on Coinbase given overall crypto industry headwinds.  Meanwhile, DA Davidson analyst Chris Brendler told CoinDesk the most significant thing for Coinbase is it seemed the company had avoided any direct exposure to FTX. But Brendler was also positive on Coinbase stock based on how the company is run. The fact that some of its competitors weren’t regulated and were based offshore gave them free rein to do whatever they wanted, including potentially using customer assets. “Coinbase, in my opinion, would never do that,” Brendler said.  In a Twitter thread earlier this week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized how his platform operates in a safer manner. “We don’t do anything with our customers' funds unless directed to by the customer. We hold all assets dollar for dollar, and users can withdraw their money at any time,” Armstrong wrote.  Aoyon Ashraf contributed reporting to this article.

However, that may be just the wake-up call U.S. lawmakers need, said Hester M. Peirce, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Peirce, who joined CoinDesk TV “First Mover” just moments before Bahamas-based FTX announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S., said that despite the dark moment for the industry, FTX’s downfall could be the “catalyst” government agencies needed to “sit down” and create clear regulations.  “That doesn’t mean just bringing enforcement actions,” Peirce said, “but we also need to know, thinking about this as a society, how do we want to regulate this thing.”  Peirce said the difficulties that come with regulating digital assets could be solved in a more productive and efficient manner if the SEC and the Commodities of Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were to coordinate in some fashion. In the past, former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad has voiced his support for a self-regulatory organization (SRO) overseen by both the CFTC and the SEC.  “Having the SEC and CFTC work together makes a lot of sense,” Peirce said. “And even before Congress acts, we can do a lot of work jointly and get input from the border public.”  Peirce did not state which agency should be responsible for regulating the crypto industry, and added that “having one regulator devoted to crypto could be problematic.” She did, however, suggest that crypto and the underlying blockchain technology that powers it could be “integrated into the back end of the financial system,” and therefore warrant the jurisdictions of the SEC.  “The SEC would be a good regulator for spot crypto markets if we got our act together,” Peirce said.  Friday morning, FTX Group, along with FTX.com, FTX US, Alameda Research and an estimated “130 affiliated companies,” filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Meanwhile, the company’s CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said he would be stepping down.  In the midst of the debacle, Peirce said for crypto it’s a strong “reminder” for people to take into account some of the “basic lessons from traditional finance,” adding that things such as counterparty risks and who is in charge of handling a user’s assets is a “real thing.”  “This is not a great moment and it's attracting a lot of negative attention,” Peirce said. “But at the same time, it can be a catalyst for us to sit down and do some of the regulatory work.”  Read more: FTX Files for Bankruptcy Protection in US; CEO Bankman-Fried Resigns",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/11/sec-commissioner-hester-peirce-ftxs-collapse-could-finally-be-catalyst-for-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e48660343d0e3ab3464b9b5e5c9c5afdaeeaec2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Historically strong capitulation events like this have signaled the bottom for the cryptocurrency market, where the very fundamentals of cryptocurrency begin to be criticized en masse publicly. As always the criticisms that sprung up in this event are largely irrelevant and just rehashing typical fears that have been repeated over and over in previous capitulation events. There's blood in the streets, mass fear amongst the general population, and liquidations occurring throughout the space - yet the pot odds have never looked better. Risk-averse investors should avoid digital assets entirely until the market has normalized. Thesis Summary The thesis for this is simple - nearly everything points at this being a major capitulation event, the first we've really seen since 2018 when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell over 30% in just a matter of two weeks. One could argue there was another such event in 2020, during the liquidity crisis, however this was a broad-market event that affected more than just cryptocurrencies, and thus I would argue it was not quite the same type of capitulation. During these capitulation events all these same headlines and perma-bears come out of the woodwork - swearing Bitcoin is going down to With Bitcoin trading at 2-year lows, back to the price it was just as the inflation narrative took off in 2020, the pot odds down here are fantastic - nearly nothing has to go right for cryptocurrency to go back up. It's my belief that the best way to play this is to go long via ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) due to the lack of exchange risk combined with options availability, as it is not spot Bitcoin but rather a futures derivative that does not have custodianship risk. Similarities Are Everywhere For folks who haven't been through these events before they can be nerve-racking, especially if you're heavily invested in cryptocurrencies as everything is put into question during these events. The very fabric of the space often seems to be crumbling, with exchanges collapsing or at-risk of collapsing, user funds potentially being unsafe or stolen, government regulations or bans being rumored, etc. Going back in time to the November 2018 crash, which was the final capitulation of the 2017-2020 bear market where the real bottom in sentiment, interest, and weekly price was made, there are many similarities to today. It's almost strange how many similarities there are, with both of these events occurring right around the same time the U.S. midterm elections happened - both times in November. Coinmarketcap BTC Chart (2018) Another similarity is the volatility; both periods had the previous few months filled with seemingly disinterest, nothing happening, and extremely low volatility relative to the past. Coinmarketcap BTC Chart (2022) But the similarities hardly stop there, with Google trends charts showing nearly an identical picture during the time period as well, with a slow fall in search interest in the preceding few months before the collapse in prices. Google Search Trends Data (2018) Searches on Google pertaining to ""Bitcoin"" globally fell from around 75~ in mid-August 2018 to around 45~ right as the bottom dropped out of the market and the crash began. This represented around a 40% drop in relative searches globally over the period of 90 days preceding the crash. Google Search Trends Data (2022) Likewise in 2022 the Google trend data for the search term ""Bitcoin"" fell globally from around 85 down to 55, representing a 38% decline in relative search interest globally in the last 90 days preceding this decline. I can continue with chart after chart, similarity after similarity, but the reality is the situation in 2018 was very different than today - there was no liquidity crises amongst the biggest crypto exchanges. There was no real risk of cascading collapse of other platforms/exchanges either. History Doesn't Repeat Itself But It Rhymes The situation today is different than in 2018, the macro environment has evolved, the risks plaguing markets have changed, and a lot has changed - yet there are many similarities between this capitulation event and the 2018 capitulation event. I'd suggest this capitulation event is NOT caused by SBF and the potential collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) but rather this is just the reason we've collectively decided to panic. Nobody has been interested in crypto for months, interest has continued declining to almost nothing - down nearly 40% in the last 3 months alone. Volatility has contracted as nobody dares to bet on the upside, nor the downside as Bitcoin sat in a zone most folks thought was reasonable, but uncertain - with no catalyst to move it up or down. People largely didn't jump in and go long as with inflation seemingly not expanding, hawkish monetary policy, and a potential economic crisis on the horizon there was a lot of uncertainty, but with Bitcoin down so much why would you sell after already eating the majority of the loss? That's what people thought - until they woke up to see that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) that has been largely stable for many months now, in an ""accumulation zone"" drop 25% -> 30% in a matter of days with absolutely no certainty of a bottom being set - all facades of stability gone. New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/cryptocurrency-binance-ftx.html) They woke up to this reality after checking their portfolio, or seeing headlines like the one above, with a taste of blood in their mouth, feeling queasy that they just lost another 1/4th of their investment. What if Bitcoin does go to $3,000? What if this stupid internet money has no value? What if the U.S. bans and regulates everything to oblivion over this? What if FTX has been propping up the price of Bitcoin? Oh god what about Tether (USDT-USD), is this the time they get regulated and proven to be a Ponzi? Cold chills rush over them, they log in, and they puke it - selling at any price they can as the dread sets in that they could lose everything - as the doubt sets in that the bears are right. This shifted everyone's mindset from ""a bottom is in, we're accumulating into the next rally"" to ""why do I own this garbage?"" as they woke up from their complacency. SBF and FTX could be bailed out and this awakening will not go away, it was simply the excuse, the event, that made everyone collectively panic. Neck-Deep In Terror At this moment Bitcoin is around $1000 off its overnight lows, up at around $16,500~ and I can't find a single soul who is willing to buy. Not one. With the strong buy rating you may think I'm going to say it's only up and away from here - and everyone is wrongly afraid. Unfortunately, I can't say that - everything is just getting worse and worse. Binance official Twitter Previously this was all looking like it was going to be swept under the rug and Binance (BNB-USD) was going to absorb FTX and resolve this - but with them backing away from any dealings or association with FTX this possibility is gone. There is no rescue. There is no bailout. There is no help. Currently there is no real substantive data on how problematic this situation is, how much of customer funds are gone, missing, or lost, or the current balance sheet of FTX. The Deafening Silence Returns To make matters worse, until this morning, FTX and SBF had gone radio-silent since November 8th, something that has only been done by companies that are on their own, heading straight for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and investigations. The eerie similarity to Celsius Network (CEL-USD) and other crypto-lending platforms, who also chose this route, is striking to me - and screams the likely outcome of this situation will not only not be soft, but will be far far worse than people are expecting. There is no rescue. There is no bailout. There is no help. Takeaway God help us all - the bottom has fallen out and I don't see the ground under my feet - all I hear is screaming. This is exactly how it sounded and felt in the November 2018 crash and the 2020 COVID-19 crash, so I remain long, reluctantly adding at these levels with a feeling of sickness in my chest as I am forced to raise cash and delever from other investments to support my cryptocurrency portfolio. The bottom should be in, or close to it - and in time us bulls will likely be called lucky bottom fishers when the crypto market returns to normal or begins rallying from these lows in the near future. Actionable Takeaways I like to provide actionable takeaways, trade ideas for people in my articles, but I cannot really provide one in this case - every trade would be based on speculation and opinion and with extreme risk. With one exception. If you want to go long the asset class (or I suppose short), consider buying medium-long dated spreads, an example being buying the January 20, 2023 7 puts and selling the 12 puts in the same expiration - netting a breakeven at mid-price (market) with a capped upside of $253 and a capped downside of $247. This would limit downside risk in either direction depending on if you did the above (going long BITO/Bitcoin) or the opposite of it (going short BITO/Bitcoin) and provide a way for an investor to gain exposure without taking on the extreme risks actually holding the asset carry currently. Risks To Consider If you haven't taken the hint, bulls like myself are on the verge of being skinned alive by the market. In mere days, if the true impact of this ordeal is proven to be catastrophic, we could all be joining the screaming with everyone else - falling quickly into the abyss with no sight of the bottom. Those who do not have a risk tolerance capable of withstanding an entire loss of capital should likely avoid all cryptocurrency products until this whole situation has played out.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4556510-bito-and-bitcoin-history-doesnt-repeat-itself-but-it-rhymes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4088653.jpeg

42388706,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQZCX,1668188503,Ex-Ethereum Miners Token Hop to Stay Alive After the Merge,"Only a handful of former Ethereum miners are able to survive in the post-Merge world, and some are making it by hopping from token to token. Those that are able to survive are eking out smaller profits than they enjoyed when they were mining ether.  In September, the Ethereum blockchain, built for smart contracts and decentralized applications, switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which requires mining, to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, which needs validators.  Dubbed “the Merge,” the change decreased Ethereum’s energy usage by 99.998%, thwarting a major criticism on blockchain networks, but it meant that thousands of miners had to figure out what to do with their equipment, a key source of income for many.  Over a month later, fewer than 20% of Ethereum miners, or 200 terahash (TH), a measure of computing power, “were able to find a new home in crypto mining, while also suffering from a significant decrease in margins,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services company Luxor.  Alternative coins, or altcoins, reward miners for their computational work significantly less than ether or bitcoin. That’s because their price tags are far lower than ether or bitcoin. Some miners have chosen not to mine at all after the Merge because they had already recouped their initial investment on graphics processing units (GPU) a while back.  As such, only those with the most efficient machines and lowest power costs can mine altcoins without finding themselves in negative margin territory.  Given the current market, altcoins can only accommodate about a fifth of the global hashrate and miners are faced with the fact that their mining revenue does not cover their electricity bills, a spokesperson for mining pool f2pool said.  But at the same time, as miners flock to mining any PoW token, a mechanism known as difficulty kicks in, meaning it is less likely for them to earn a reward, thus further lowering their earnings.  To take advantage of these quickly shifting winds where reward values change with token prices and the likelihood of earning rewards changes with the difficulty, publicly listed miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) is using a switching algorithm that automatically redirects its GPUs to the most profitable coin, said Aydin Kilic, the firm’s president and chief operating officer. Hive then exchanges these coins into bitcoin.  Thus, its strategy overall is to repurpose and optimize its GPUs to expand its BTC production, the president said. That way, Hive earns more dollars per kilowatt-hour than by just mining ethereum classic (ETC) or ravencoin (RVN), Kilic said.  Similarly, miners flocked to the Nicehash platform because of its software that enables this type of automated switching in the 24 hours after the Merge, said Joe Downie, chief marketing officer at the hash power brokerage platform.  Downie said the platform went from about one million to 600,000 customers across Nicehash products after the Merge.  The rush before the storm  After the Merge, altcoins faced feedback loops of miners flooding a token, increasing its difficulty and then leaving the network.  The majority of miners mined right up to the last minute possible. While some were unsure what to do when the Merge took effect, many had already made plans, said Downie.  Larger miners prepared in advance, some even repurposing their GPUs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing, but many solo miners had to play it by ear.  After the network switched to PoS, miners behaved “frantically,” with “the vast majority hopping from coin to coin in attempts to remain as profitable as possible,” said a representative for mining software provider Hiveon. But this led to a “vicious cycle” in which miners saturated a market until they were forced to abandon it.  The Ethereum Classic blockchain’s hashrate jumped about fourfold from Sept. 12-16, around the time of the Merge, to around 200 terahash/second (TH/s), and its difficulty concurrently went up by about the same factor, data from CoinWarz shows. Ethereum Classic’s hashrate has since fallen to about 125-135 TH/s, as miners got priced out of mining the Ethereum fork.  Ethereum Classic is the easiest switch because its algorithm is the closest to mining Ethereum, Downie said. The blockchain was formed by a fork on Ethereum in 2016.  Similar trends were evident for mining ravencoin (RVN), beam (BEAM) and ergo (ERG).  Miners that use GPUs are mainly going for ravencoin, Downie said, as ETC is increasingly dominated by application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), specialized computers like those used for bitcoin mining.  Much like the rest of the industry, Ethereum miners of the past are waiting for a bull market, keeping their machines humming in hopes other coins will pump in the future.  “Some miners still chose to continue mining even though their revenues could not cover electricity bills,” f2pool said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETC | MINING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/11/ex-ethereum-miners-token-hop-to-stay-alive-after-the-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5860487ee69254b34d369bc6cada1788c51071f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411315,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMze4,1668187800,"FTX Lesson: Crypto Needs the Press, the Press Needs Crypto","Journalists don’t like to be the story. We prefer to tell it.  But with CoinDesk playing a central role in this week’s FTX meltdown – following Ian Allison’s bombshell on Alameda Research’s suspect balance sheet last week – I got to thinking that we media folk may have to be the story this time around. So, let’s examine journalism’s place in the crypto industry. TLDR: It’s complicated, to say the least.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On the one hand, there’s an unreasonable hostility toward journalists in some quarters of the crypto community. It’s exacerbated by a blinkered, self-interested perspective fostered by price-dependent online communities and by a tech utopianism popular in Silicon Valley. This anti-press mindset breeds conspiracy theories and, in steering everyone into the confines of the subcommunities gathered around their pet investment projects, fuels a toxic fragmentation in which each clings to their own narrow version of the truth. It’s “my token, right or wrong.”  This was evident in the unfounded charges laid against CoinDesk on Twitter by people alarmed by the fallout from the FTX revelations: the Alameda story was “fake news”; CoinDesk ran a story planted by Binance to play its “games”; it was a clear case of FUD (stories sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt) to undermine confidence in the market.  (Needless to say, those charges are all patently untrue. I shouldn’t need proof, but the haste with which Binance abandoned its buyout of FTX laid bare how bad FTX and Alameda's finances truly were at the time of Ian Allison’s report.)  Watch: Crypto Exchange FTX Files for Bankruptcy Protection in US; CEO Bankman-Fried Resigns  On the other hand, the multiyear story of FTX’s rise and fall, now culminating in stunning evidence of gross misuse of users’ funds, reminds us that journalists can fall victim to the blindness of hero worship. Tough questions should have been asked earlier of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research’s phantom balance sheet, propped up with a self-issued currency from sister company FTX, was there in plain sight and we in the press failed to see it until now. Too many accepted the fairytale story of the altruistic “SBF” wunderkind.  It’s noteworthy that this story broke just after a tweet from privacy activist Edward Snowden highlighted a history of Central Intelligence Agency representatives abusing the trust of journalists – and their inability to verify those agents’ privileged-access claims – to sow disinformation. It’s also in the vein of how local television news takes police reports of violence at face value, the social injustice of which was highlighted in a recent episode of John Oliver’s ”This Week Tonight” show on HBO.  Both sides need introspection, in other words: critics of the press and the press itself.  Transparency is in your interests, truly  Let me start with the lesson for press critics. These include the token investors who barge their way into CoinDesk reporters’ Twitter mentions to accuse them of bias or corruption or stupidity just because they didn’t cover some protocol development of non-fungible token drop that to their biased perspective is the “biggest untold story in crypto.”  My message to them: Try, maybe, to step outside the narrow confines of your financial interests and look at the bigger picture. It is not the crypto press’s role to protect or promote the participants in an NFT project, the short-term financial interests of FTT investors or bitcoin HODLers. It is to bring transparency to the companies and other institutions that hold influence over how this industry and its markets function, regardless of price impact. That responsibility extends both to what we choose to cover and what we choose not to cover.  Transparency exposes malfeasance and entails reporting on otherwise hidden corporate accounts that reveal fragile finances. In the biggest cases, such as that of this past week, doing so will mean that a house of cards will inevitably fall, and, along with it, token prices. But sooner or later these issues would be revealed anyway.  Read more: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFi  It’s better if these revelations can be revealed sooner, because then we can learn the lessons and react accordingly. Can more effective regulation be introduced to protect consumers? What can investors learn about token valuation? Is it time to “do your own research?”  If the crypto industry is to mature, and if its underlying technology is to live up its vast potential, we must flesh out these unstable structures and bad practices. Sorry. There is no free lunch.  This is the purpose that we at CoinDesk have set for ourselves. Like any media company, we strive to be profitable, but the route to that is defined by a broader mission: to lead the narrative on the development of this industry by bringing transparency to the global movement that’s driving it. We see this honest, warts-and-all exposure as our contribution to the better world that this technology has the potential to support.  Don’t trust, verify  Now for our own introspection.  “Trust, but verify” was a term – lifted, ironically, from a Russian proverb – made popular by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan during his negotiations with the Soviet Union over nuclear disarmament. In the late 1990s, cryptographer Adam Back and entrepreneur Austin Hill, who later co-founded Blockstream, paraphrased the line to rewrite it as “Don’t Trust. Verify.” The negative wording was stronger for a reason, based on the notion that reliance on a third party with the capacity to censor, change or control information is dangerous.  The imperative to verify was a nod to cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs, with which people can prove the veracity of information without having to trust assurances from those with an interest in lying to you.  The thinking behind the first, Reagan-era coinage is something all journalists should embrace as a matter of course. It’s the “show me the money” idea. You don’t necessarily assume your source is untrustworthy but, without some other independent means of verification, you simply can’t run with the information they provide.  The problem is that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to obtain independent verification because all means of communication around the relevant topic are controlled by the party you’re covering. It’s the problem of “asymmetric information” that underpins U.S. securities laws: those with the data have the power to control how it is used. And that’s where the dependence on powerful people kicks in, which then gets distorted by the hero worship identified above.  This is where cryptography comes into play. Already, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is declaring that his exchange is embracing a “proof of reserves” model based on the cryptographic instrument of Merkle trees and calling on others to follow suit. This would presumably offer anyone, including an investigating journalist, a tamper-proof source of information on a company’s assets.  Read more: Crypto Exchanges Scramble to Compile 'Proof of Reserves' as FTX Contagion Grips Markets  There are also efforts afoot to bring blockchain verification of evidence trails into journalism, notably by the Starling Project at Stanford University, while other projects – including Refound, a winner of the Web3athon launched at CoinDesk’s Consensus this year – apply encryption solutions to protect journalists’ information gathering from snoopers.  If such tools become the norm, a “Don’t Trust. Verify” standard could arise in journalism. Claims from powerful people need no longer be taken at face value.  But although there are some cryptographic tools that journalists can independently apply to their truth-seeking efforts, it really can’t be up to them to fix this. We need an overhaul of the system for recording and proving information, and that requires change by the investigated, not by the investigators. In reality, it needs regulation, or at the very least industry-driven self-regulation, to change practices.  So let’s hope that, for transparency and the healthy growth of this industry, regulators will look to zero-knowledge proofs, Merkle trees and encryption to impose crypto-savvy data requirements on entities operating in this space.  In the meantime, please support the journalists who are working against an asymmetric information system to try to bring transparency to this industry.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Michael J.

42388698,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQZLt,1668186380,How Sam Bankman-Fried’s ‘Effective’ Altruism Blew Up FTX,"The ongoing collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire will have innumerable victims. One of the most important may be “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried’s beloved philanthropic philosophy.  In very broad strokes, effective altruists believe that making a lot of money to influence the world is a noble goal as long as you’re very, very smart – and there is evidence that this mindset contributed to the decisions that have cost Bankman-Fried’s victims billions of dollars.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Late Thursday, the team behind FTX’s philanthropic “Future Fund” resigned. The Future Fund was set up to help implement Bankman-Fried’s effective altruism playbook, but departing staff say it won’t have funds to deliver grants it had already approved.  The resigners wrote in an open letter that ""To the extent that the leadership of FTX may have engaged in deception or dishonesty, we condemn that behavior in the strongest possible terms. We believe that being a good actor in the world means striving to act with honesty and integrity.""  See also: Bankman-Fried's Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire  That’s a bleak thing for a philanthropy to have to write about its founder. But the problem for effective altruists is not just that one of their own behaved unethically. There is reason to believe that the ethos of effective altruism (sometimes shortened to “EA”) enabled and even encouraged the disaster at every step along the way.  Above all, Bankman-Fried’s frequent public emphasis on philanthropy helped him garner positive press, political influence and even investment. Reputation laundering through philanthropy is hardly unique to him, as explored by writer Anand Giridharadas in his recent book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.”  But effective altruism more specifically could have excused or encouraged behaviors that led to FTX’s downfall. Perhaps not least, Bankman-Fried more or less acknowledged in an infamous “Odd Lots” interview that many of the tokens trading on his platform were probably frauds.  That implies he and FTX were always facilitating harm to its users, but the neoliberal and utilitarian underpinnings of effective altruism allowed him to justify that as a matter of consumer freedom.  A less charitable summary of effective altruism, then, would be that it is little more than a fancy way of saying “the ends justify the means.” Effective altruism also encompasses an emphasis on “long-termism,” which can read like another excuse for mercenary corner-cutting today, so long as you commit your loot to improving tomorrow.  Bankman-Fried grew up in Silicon Valley, where long-termism is a pillar of the libertarian/neoliberal “Californian Ideology,” ideas seemingly shared by the likes of Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.  (For a longer dive into Bankman-Fried and the EA mindset, I recommend this Vice piece by Edward Ongweso Jr. and Jordan Pearson).  Effective altruism may even have provided a direct rationalization of a large, secret and illegal bailout loan to sister trading shop Alameda Research, which appears to have helped bring down FTX. One speculative but incisive comment circulating on Twitter laid out the effective altruism case for financial fraud:  “They all thought the risks were worth taking to accomplish the most they could for humanity … SBF thought he was someone who could do more for the world than others, and that it was his responsibility to bear that risk, and he convinced many others in the effective altruism movement to align with him.”  See also: With FTX Bloodied, Rival in US Regulatory Fight Adds Another Knife  Of course, the ugly truth is that it wasn’t Bankman-Fried “bearing that risk,” but the customers who trusted him. Bankman-Fried certainly could have made that mental and ethical error, because effective altruism also implies a messiah complex – in fact, “Savior complex” is in the title of a fawning profile published (and since deleted) by Sequoia Capital, one of FTX’s venture backers.  Effective altruism posits that making money by (almost) any means necessary is OK because you, Elon and Zuck and SBF are so brilliant that you absolutely should have all the power implied by billions of dollars in the bank.  But as we’ve discovered about all three of those false messiahs, convincing yourself that you’re brilliant doesn’t make it true.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | RESEARCH,David Z.

While it's easy to point to SOL has just been stuck in the crossfire, the reality is there were already big concerns on the network itself. TVL metrics and NFT buyers have fallen off a cliff. It's wait and see on this one. The entire cryptocurrency space has been largely in freefall over the last several days. While declines have been large and widespread, one of the biggest drawdowns has been in the native coin of popular Layer 1 blockchain Solana ( SOL-USD ). SOL Daily (TradingView/Binance) While most of the coins in the top 10 by market cap have seen 10-25% declines over the last 7 days, Solana has a 6 day haircut of 45% on immense volume as of writing; and that's after a sizeable relief rally that has seen the coin move up from $12.37 Wednesday to nearly $19 at yesterday's intraday peak. Why the chaos? What has pushed the coin over the cliff this week after what was actually a pretty good technical setup heading into the weekend was the news that crypto exchange FTX was dealing with solvency concerns. I covered that saga in detail on Tuesday and you can read about it here . But the point that's likely most relevant to this article is FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's other company Alameda Research had a SOL position greater than $1.1 billion according to a leaked copy of the company's balance sheet. When word got out that Alameda Research had a massive position in FTX Token ( FTT-USD ), there was sell pressure on FTT from Binance (BNB-USD) founder Changpeng Zhao, and Alameda was forced to defend its FTT position by selling off other assets; Solana included. Solana and FTX do have a history as the exchange is built on Solana's blockchain and Bankman-Fried was also an investor and very bullish the token in August: Of course, SBF is not totally impartial as he has invested in the Solana network-either through his companies or directly. Alameda Research, a trading shop founded by Bankman-Fried, participated in a $314 million funding round for Solana Labs in June 2021. He is also building Serum, a decentralized exchange , on Solana. With the collapse of FTX, the pressure on Solana developed very rapidly as price fell from $38 to the low teens in less than a week. Much of this was likely triggered by Alameda Research and Sam Bankman-Fried dumping whatever Solana they could. But the decline in SOL's price was likely also from the rest of the market simply anticipating Alameda's continued selling of its very large SOL position. The problem for Alameda at the time was that 75% of the company's SOL was locked in stake and couldn't immediately be liquidated. In the addition to what the company has already sold, it is speculated that the company still has over 19.5 million SOL that many believe will be dumped on the market when the withdrawal from stake is finalized. Alameda SOL (SolanaCompass) If those accounts that have been attributed to Alameda do indeed sell the SOL at market, it would be roughly $332 million in Solana that needs to find a new home. That would be a tremendous amount of selling pressure by a business that is without too many other options. It could in theory trigger a bottom, but I'm actually not too sure. Bad network trends It would be easy to point to the market carnage caused by Alameda Research and FTX and say now is the time to buy Solana because forced selling by Alameda will eventually come to an end, but the reality is the network metrics have been very poor on Solana for a few months now. The real volume as measured by Messari has been declining all year. SOL Real Volume (Messari) This is indicative of a general lack of interest in the chain. Some of these volume declines can be attributed to the collapse in NFT buyers and sales that happened in mid-October. Solana NFT Data (CryptoSlam) You can see a strong trend of higher highs and higher lows in NFT buyers throughout most of the last year on Solana. This was something that hasn't been seen on all chains this year. For instance, unique NFT buyers on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) peaked in February. Solana's peak happened in September and essentially collapsed soon after. While buyers on Solana were often very high, the sales figures themselves haven't been overly impressive since early summer. SOL TVL (DeFi Llama) The DeFi footprint for Solana has been very concerning most of the year. Even when adjusting Solana's TVL figure from dollars to SOL, at roughly 33 million coins the TVL is down more than 50% from its peak back in June. For comparison, Ethereum is off a little under 23% from its January peak when measured in the native currency. The main takeaway from this section is that Solana's on-chain metrics have become quite poor. Summary Solana is a coin that I've had a generally favorable outlook on for awhile but I'm very quickly losing conviction in the thesis. I could certainly entertain just getting out of this one and waiting for the dust to settle. But I have treated Solana as a staked asset in the BlockChain Reaction portfolio and I have decided to un-stake those funds while I decide what to do with them longer term. I don't currently plan to sell but that could certainly change. I would like to see some of the on-chain metrics like TVL and transactions improve considerably before I'd entertain buying this enormous decline. The reality is there is an incredible amount of competition for fast, high throughput Layer 1 blockchains and I think we're getting to the point where Solana is running out of chances. The network has a poor history of stoppages and has seen key activity metrics come well off highs even before the FTX-related collapse in price. I think Solana's connection to Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX exchange is just the latest example of bad PR for the network. I'm not going to call it a sell after such a massive decline over the last week because a lot of that selling pressure was an attempt to front-run Alameda, but I'm not prepared to add to my position either. For now, Solana is a hold.",NEGATIVE,SOL | FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4556450-solana-its-worse-than-ftx-contagion?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4086062.jpeg

42411316,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzkg,1668181340,Crypto Can Help With Elon Musk’s Twitter Identity Issue,"Much furor has been generated on Twitter about Elon Musk’s new ""blue tick"" (checkmark) verification scheme. Existing blue ticks (full disclosure: I am one) are up in arms about the plan, which would give anyone a blue checkmark on their tweets if they pay Musk $8 a month, with no questions asked. Twitter Blue marketing makes it clear that there will be no identity verification. Pseudonymous accounts will be able to get blue ticks.  Musk has expressed a hope that opening the blue tick scheme to a much wider audience will eliminate hate speech on Twitter and stop the proliferation of bots, spammers and fraudsters. But I’m afraid he is entirely mistaken. The payment of $8 per month is nowhere near enough to compensate for elimination of centralized identity checks. And the reason should be entirely obvious to anyone who is familiar with crypto, and in particular the problem that Bitcoin originally solved – the “Byzantine Generals” problem.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  The Byzantine Generals problem is all about the difficulty of reliably establishing identity in a distributed system that has no trusted central authority. The original 1982 research paper by Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostok and Marshall Pease imagined several armies besieging Byzantium, each army led by a General – hence the name “Byzantine Generals problem.” Some of the Generals and their subordinates are traitors who are trying to confuse the rest. Without knowing who the traitors are, and with only oral messages as a means of communication – or perhaps Twitter – the loyal Generals must coordinate their attacks. The research paper shows that in the absence of a trusted central authority, the loyal Generals will be unable to coordinate their attacks if the proportion of traitors among the Generals and their subordinates is too high.  Twitter’s blue ticks are a fine example of the Byzantine Generals problem. The blue tick is meant to prove that the Twitter account actually is run by the person it claims to represent. So, for example, an account called “Joe Biden” has a blue tick to prove that it is run by the real U.S. President Joe Biden (or his staff), not an imposter. But blue ticks are allocated through an opaque process run by a centralized team at Twitter, which is not accountable to the Twitter community and is suspected of corruption. Rumors circulate that blue ticks can be bought for $15,000 or $36,000 or some such figure. There’s no evidence this is true, but it doesn’t matter. People believe the rumors, and that is sufficient to destroy trust. The blue tick that was supposed to reliably identify celebrities, influencers, companies and brands is no longer reliable.  Enter Elon Musk, savior of the blue tick. He proposes to eliminate the existing centralized verification process completely, and instead give blue ticks to anyone willing to pay $8 per month, including pseudonymous accounts. This is a decentralized solution because people will decide for themselves whether to pay the subscription rather than the allocation of blue ticks being determined by a central trusted authority. As with existing blue ticks, the new blue tick will confer advantages in platform visibility – the Twitter algorithm boosts tweets issued by blue ticks above those of ordinary users. The subscription payment is presumably supposed to be low enough to encourage genuine Twitter users to sign up for blue ticks, but high enough to discourage bots, spammers and fraudsters. But – is it?  Read more: Dan Kuhn - The Web3 Twitter Fixes Elon Musk Could Actually Try  The authors of the ""Byzantine Generals"" paper say that any solution to the problem is necessarily expensive. Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution (proof-of-work) is indeed expensive, and so is proof-of-stake, recently adopted by Ethereum. But as Elon Musk himself pointed out, $8 per month is the price of a Starbucks latte. Some people can’t afford this, of course. But I’d suggest that most Twitter users – and certainly those that have, or want, blue ticks, can, easily. It’s small change. And for some of Twitter’s most toxic elements, it will be well worth it to create the impression of authenticity and amplify their tweets.  Of course, there’s still centralized moderation of tweets. Liberalization of blue ticks isn’t carte blanche to post hate speech on the platform. But I am looking forward to the lawsuits when Twitter starts suspending accounts that are paying $8 a month.  More importantly, $8 per month doesn’t appear to create much disincentive for bots, spammers and fraudsters, or even the sock puppet accounts that infest the platform. For them, tweet amplification is gold. I predict that bot and sock puppet farms will bulk-buy blue ticks, and crypto spam accounts shilling tokens will all have blue ticks and there will be an epidemic of blue tick phishers.  A good idea  However, Musk’s aim to enable ordinary Twitter users to obtain blue ticks is laudable. And there’s no doubt that the existing centralized process is unfit for the purpose. So how could Twitter create an identity verification process that didn’t rely on a centralized authority, was open to anyone who could prove their identity and discouraged fascists, bots, spammers, fraudsters and sock puppets?  Well, Musk could do worse than look at the solutions adopted by the cryptocurrencies of which he is so fond. Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake use a community-led process with volunteer verifiers. The verifiers are incentivized by the potential for rewards, and kept honest by harsh financial penalties for abusing the system. Verification is expensive for the verifiers, but not for the users whose transactions are being verified – they just pay transaction (gas) fees. Could such a system work for Twitter verification?  There will be an epidemic of blue tick phishers.  There’s an obvious problem, and that is that verifiers have no more idea than anyone else whether an account that has applied for verification is malicious. But Twitter users are pretty good at identifying malicious accounts. There’s no reason to suppose that Twitter verifiers who have staked a whole load of money (much more than $8 per month) for the right to verify identity would be any worse – indeed they would have an obvious incentive to get it right, if the penalty for inadvertently verifying (say) a neo-Nazi account was to lose part or all of their stake. And all that is needed is for enough of them to agree. Some kind of majority voting system would work. It’s complex, but surely not beyond the ability of the bright minds in the tech world to solve.  What rewards might Elon Musk offer Twitter verifiers? Well, he could offer money: treat them like shareholders, pay them a dividend. Or he could offer them voting rights, for example over the introduction of new facilities. But would he agree to such dilution of his power?  It seems to me this is the fundamental problem. Twitter, the decentralized “town square,” was unfortunately so centralized that it could be taken over by a dictator. Dictators are not usually too keen on decentralization.  I hope that Elon Musk’s longstanding interest in crypto will encourage him to look at decentralized solutions to the problems that he is rightly identifying. But that might mean stepping back from Twitter and setting the community free to fly on its own.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/11/crypto-can-help-with-elon-musks-twitter-identity-issue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/767791e0c76a539b0daca29be2ca08d4853f85b2-3000x1999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Earlier this week, the FTX.com signed a non-binding deal with Binance to sell itself, though the latter pulled out just a day later, citing fund mishandling and regulatory issues.

The crypto market lost its $1 trillion market capitalization, dropping 18.3% to $803 billion.  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped about 7% to a 24-hour low of $16,351 during early U.S. trading hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of 162 digital assets slid 3.3%, leaving it down 16% in November.  The decline partially reversed a big rally on Thursday, when a report showing slower-than-expected inflation in October gave bitcoin traders some relief. The largest cryptocurrency shot up about 10%, the biggest daily gain in two months.  As the bitcoin price has tumbled, many speculators have homed in on Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, and the losses likely to be adding up on the company’s bitcoin holdings, eating away at the company’s equity – and whether a capitulation might be in the offing.  In an interview with CNBC, Saylor said that bitcoin is still 33% higher than when he first bough it in 2020 and that he will continue to purchase and hold the asset. ""Our shareholders are winning, and we're going to stick with that strategy because it's working for us,” he said on Thursday.  Previously, Saylor acknowledged that the company would struggle to have enough bitcoin as collateral if the price dropped below $3,562, but that they could post other assets if that happened.  The FTX exchange's in-house token (FTT) – where the crisis of confidence first began to appear early this week in digital-asset markets – dropped another 33%. Huobi token (HT), which briefly gained 400% on Thursday amid news that Tron-based tokens would be redeemed 1:1 from FTX, fell 15% on Friday; Tron leader Justin Sun is a global advisor to Huobi and owns HT tokens. Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped over 11%.  The Solana blockchain’s SOL token fell 14.3% to $16.25. The SOL tokens were a major holding of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research trading firm.

42411311,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzU9,1668174417,"FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFi","Our community keeps learning the lesson of decentralization the hard way. Celsius Network. BlockFi. Voyager Digital. Now FTX.  These are all centralized exchanges (CEXs) and centralized financed platforms (CeFi). Their business models are centuries old; the only new thing about them is they offer users exposure to crypto assets – but crucially, not root ownership, since they hold the keys to those assets.  Amanda Cassatt is the founder and CEO of Serotonin, a Web3 marketing agency and product studio.  Like the financial institutions that collapsed in 2008, their economic incentive is to under-collateralize and take risks with user funds. They play political games, cozying up to regulators who claim to care about consumer protection.  The pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto was inspired by the events of 2008 when creating Bitcoin that year. When the network launched, they inscribed these words in its genesis block, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”  See also: The Collapse of the FTX Empire  This headline from The Times of London sent a powerful message about Satoshi’s intentions: Large financial institutions had spent years privatizing the gains from taking risks that led to collapse, and once it came they forced the public to bear their losses thanks to their influence on politicians with discretionary decision-making power.  With Bitcoin, Satoshi changed the locus of decision making from politicians to an automated code base, giving regular people the option to permissionless-ly participate in an alternative financial system, one where the rules are public, apply to everyone and execute automatically. Then, with smart contracts, Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) delivered these benefits in various forms to hundreds of thousands of people.  In an echo of the 2008 financial collapse, the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research has triggered a “run on the banks” across crypto markets. Some CEXs and CeFi platforms are overwhelmed with users withdrawing funds forcing them to freeze transfers off the platform. Some must be insolvent.  Those with funds on FTX will likely lose their money. A number of large venture firms as well as Web3 companies told their investors Wednesday that a significant portion of their AUM [assets under management] or treasuries were lost to CEXs. It’s a hard way to learn the basic hygiene of keeping minimal funds on CEXs only for immediate trading.  Despite sell-offs, Uniswap, Balancer, Curv, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have been functioning smoothly, enabling users to exit their crypto positions or, if they prefer, to capitalize on low prices and buy in. Users may have seen their portfolios decrease in dollar value, but they never lost access to their assets. If that isn’t consumer protection, I don’t know what is.  When I was at ConsenSys and we were first introducing Ethereum to the world, we had a sign at our events that said, “Welcome to the decentralized future.” Our community was then, and is still, asked to explain the use of this new technology. The best answer was, and still is, decentralization.  DeFi platforms are designed to preserve the benefits introduced by Bitcoin and magnified by Ethereum: permissionlessness, transparency, censorship resistance and self-sovereign custody of assets.  Users should insist on a base settlement layer for economic activity that is as decentralized as possible, to avoid exactly the scenario that has played out in recent days. History may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme – and we would do well to heed the lessons it teaches.  Like the large financial institutions involved in the 2008 meltdown, which donated generously to political campaigns, the FTX crypto exchange spent its final weeks spending lavishly to court regulators. Its founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried even had the audacity to say DeFi needed consumer protections while, as has become clear, playing fast and loose with user funds.  Consider for a moment that SBF was running the second-largest CEX, and centralized platforms see DeFi as a competitor. What he wanted from regulation wasn’t consumer protection, but rather to protect his incumbent position and entrench his competitive moat.  Regulators are paying attention to this collapse, as is their job. Those with good intentions should see through the Times Square billboards about ESG [environment and social governance] and the fancy soirees and understand that centralized players calling for DeFi regulation do so because it serves their interests. Regulators should also recognize that as far as consumer protections goes DeFi has beat CeFi time and time again.  See also: The Role Regulators Played in the FTX Fiasco | Opinion  Regulation that doesn’t overprotect incumbents or harm actually decentralized projects could be a boon for the industry, offering the clarity institutional investors waiting on the sidelines need to start deploying capital. It could clear our space of many of its scams by making it riskier to perpetrate them.  If there is a silver lining for the FTX fiasco, it is a reminder of the importance of decentralization. While it has taken a sledge hammer to all crypto prices, layer 1 blockchains that de-prioritized decentralization as a design goal have been the hardest hit.  The FTX collapse was a failure of CeFi, not DeFi – and smart investors, builders and users are already taking notice. I believe that many have learned their lesson this time.

42388701,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQZeb,1668173960,Wintermute Ceased Trading and Moved Funds From Crypto Exchange FTX US Before Warning,"Sam Bankman-Fried of the suddenly ailing FTX exchange has insisted repeatedly that FTX US – a U.S.-based crypto exchange – is a separate legal entity, insulated from its own financial troubles. Some traders with balances on FTX US took no chances.  Prominent crypto trading firm Wintermute says it stopped trading and market-making operations on FTX US soon before FTX halted withdrawals on Tuesday, spokespersons for FTX US and Wintermute told CoinDesk.  The London-based trading firm also moved all of its funds from FTX US, according to a Wintermute spokesperson.  Blockchain data shows that Wintermute diligently moved stablecoins and multiple altcoins off FTX US and deposited them to other crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase in the last few days up until Wednesday.  In an earlier announcement, Wintermute said that it halted trading on FTX and withdrew funds to minimize its exposure to the exchange, although some of its funds are still stuck on the platform.  ""We treated FTX and FTX US in a similar way and stopped trading on both,"" Wintermute Chief Operating Officer Marina Gurevich wrote in an email.  Wintermute’s early move is significant because market makers are essential for any exchange to work efficiently. They trade assets in large volumes to provide liquidity and facilitate match making between buyers and sellers.  The trading firm was one of the largest market makers on FTX US. According to blockchain crypto intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence, it was the second-largest trading firm by deposit and withdrawal size on FTX US after trading shop Alameda Research, the corporate sibling of FTX.  Wintermute’s departure from FTX came before FTX US issued a warning Thursday that “trading might be halted in a few days,” despite Bankman-Fried’s assertion that it was “100% liquid” and not financially impacted” by the global FTX exchange’s liquidity problems. In the same thread, he announced that Alameda would be winding down.

The move comes even though two days ago Chief Operating Officer Flori Marquez said that BlockFi was “fully operational” and that it was an independent entity. In July, FTX US agreed to provide BlockFi a $400 million line of credit, which also gave the crypto exchange the right to acquire BlockFi. That deal, of course, is now in doubt.  Beleaguered crypto exchange FTX’s Australian arm has called in administrators to examine whether it has enough assets to pay back its customers. FTX Australia’s directors handed the reins to administrators from KordaMentha, an advisory and investment firm, after FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried didn’t attend a board meeting, according to a report by Australian Financial Review. All eyes will turn to FTX’s other regional subsidiaries in the days ahead, as the crypto empire’s collapse continues. Bankman-Fried has warned that although FTX US is “100% liquid”, it might halt trading in the coming days and so users should close their positions.  FTX’s subsidiaries have slowly begun to reopen withdrawals. FTX Japan said it had resumed yen withdrawals, and FTX Turkey announced it was working on sending lira balances to its customers. Japan’s regulator had ordered FTX to stop accepting new customers and allow only current customers to close their existing positions and not open new ones. FTX’s regional subsidiaries are able to access local payment rails, and so traders aren’t reliant on the SWIFT network for deposits or withdrawals. Withdrawals on FTX International remained paused.  Chart of the Day  The Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped to a three-month low. Markets have been offloading dollar bullish positions since Thursday's softer-than-expected U.S. inflation release.  The weakness in the greenback may provide a tailwind to risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Some observers, including ING, remain bullish on the dollar.

That means the company is limiting activity on its platform, including pausing client withdrawals, the company said via tweet. It also requested that clients not deposit to BlockFi Wallet or Interest Accounts ""at this time."" The developments at BlockFi increase concern about how much further FTX's liquidity crisis will spread throughout the crypto sector. Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that BlockFi had been in the process of moving its assets to FTX for custody. A majority of BlockFi's assets, though hadn't yet been moved, the person said. The crypto lender had provided loans to Alameda, the person told Bloomberg, but didn't specify an amount. Those loans are over-collateralized with liquid assets, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) shares, but BlockFi is unsure about where the funding for its credit line with FTX.US and the collateral for the Alameda loans came from, the person added. In June, FTX offered a lifeline to BlockFi in the form of a $250M credit line , giving the crypto lender capital to bolster its balance sheet and platform strength, BlockFi said at the time. As part of that transaction, the two companies agreed to collaborate ""as we work to accelerate prosperity worldwide through crypto financial services.""

42388702,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQZjH,1668169142,Here’s What FTX and Alameda Now Hold on Public Ethereum Wallets,"Crypto exchange FTX's and its sister trading arm Alameda Research’s wallet holdings have significantly dwindled in the past week following liquidity issues, illicit loans between each other, customer withdrawals and a market decline.  FTX, which now faces insolvency, is seeking nearly $10 billion in external funding a week after CoinDesk first reported how funds were spread between the exchange and Alameda. The report led to a cascade of events, with crypto markets tanking, Alameda winding down trading and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried losing most of his wealth.  Ethereum-based token data on Dune Analytics, which refers to a list initially compiled by The Block, shows the current state of wallet holdings held by the two firms. The data serves as the lower bound of the current wallet holdings, crypto investment firm 21Shares said, meaning it doesn't represent the entirety of all assets held by the two companies.  FTX holds over $600 million in wallets tracked by Dune, a 76% decline since last week’s $2.6 billion figure. It holds over $100 million of that in FTT, its native exchange token, whose price has plunged 80% in the past week. The data was updated during Asian morning hours on Friday.  The large FTT holdings are at the center of what initially ignited the crisis. FTX allegedly used FTT to backstop losses made by Alameda during May alongside its equity holdings in Robinhood Markets (HOOD), apart from illicitly using customer funds.  In addition, FTX holds $69 million in USD coin (USDC), $61 million in paxos gold (PAXG) and $50 million in DAI, a decentralized stablecoin. It holds over $40 million of ether (ETH) and staked ether (stETH) each.  On the other hand, Alameda’s $146 million public wallet is full of stablecoin holdings. It holds over $60 million in USDC and over $35 million spread over true USD (TUSD), tether (USDT) and dai (DAI).  Alameda holds over $33 million in BitTorrent’s BTT tokens. Justin Sun, who owns BitTorrent and founded the Tron blockchain, said Thursday he would honor redemptions of Tron-based assets like TRX and BTT from FTX on a 1:1 basis, even as withdrawals of other assets remain paused.  Alameda’s relatively smaller holdings include $5 million in staked Sushi (XSUSHI), $3 million in Ethereum staking service token lido (LDO) and just under $3 million in serum (SRM). It holds just $680,000 in ether.",NEGATIVE,ETH | PAXG,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | PAXG,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/11/heres-what-ftx-and-alameda-now-hold-on-public-ethereum-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83c3e8908feb6dec80e3625b956f217ada9514f4-1920x1465.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The introduction of liquid staking, which would allow holders of Cosmos’ ATOM token to use derivative tokens to earn rewards elsewhere, is unjustified, Kwon said in an interview with CoinDesk. Passing what’s known as Proposition 82 would create a dangerous precedent of minting a “scandalous” number of new tokens – ATOM2.0 – to a treasury that is controlled by select insiders.  “The extreme risks of this should be abundantly clear to everyone,” especially given the current contagion in crypto markets caused by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company Alameda Research, he said.  In September, Cosmos released a white paper that proposed major expansions to the utility of the Cosmos Hub – the blockchain that sits at the center of the ecosystem. Voting on the contentious reforms ends Monday, with votes 2-to-1 in favor of the proposal as of Friday.  Read more: New Cosmos White Paper Revamps Cosmos Hub, ATOM Token  “In an ecosystem with one of the most advanced systems of governance like Cosmos, changes affecting the development of the Cosmos Hub and placing its security and dependability at risk, as well as radical changes to its monetary policy, must be thoroughly examined from all angles and broken down into individual components to be assessed one by one – not grouped together in an omnibus white paper proposed by a centralized committee,” Kwon said in emailed comments.  The Cosmos Hub continues to display resilience and economic security because the ATOM tokens are bonded and not earning yield or absorbing losses in a high-risk over-leveraged environment, he said.  “We need to ensure that such a harmful division of the Cosmos community does not happen again,” and the way to do that is by creating a constitution, he added.

The total value of frozen or seized assets in the case now amounts to $8.4 million the ED said.  The investigation relates to a February 2021 complaint filed by regulators in India's eastern city of Kolkata against Aamir Khan, the app's creator, and others. The agency alleges that Khan and others launched E-Nuggets to collect money from the public in return for rewards on commissions, but later wiped out all data. Khan's contact information has not been known since the investigation began.  The ED said ""multiple accounts (more than 300) were used to launder the money"" and that Khan transferred some of the money overseas through a cryptocurrency exchange. As many as 77.6 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.5 million at the time, were frozen in that Binance account earlier this year.  At the time, Binance confirmed it froze the accounts at the request of the ED.

42414983,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVU6n,1668160671,Ether Turns Deflationary as Amount of ETH Burned Spikes Amid FTX-Induced Market Volatility,"Ether (ETH) has turned deflationary for the first time since the token's parent blockchain Ethereum changed how it processes transactions nearly two months ago.  Data from ultrasound.money shows the second-largest cryptocurrency's net issuance, or the annualized inflation rate, has dropped to 0.029%, indicating that the leading smart contract blockchain is now burning more ether than what's being minted.  The negative inflation rate means ether's net supply has declined by 5,598 since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of verifying transactions from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism on Sept. 15. Ether's supply would have increased by nearly 670,000 had Ethereum continued to use the PoW mechanism.  The upgrade, dubbed Merge, put ether on the path to becoming a deflationary asset by replacing miners with validators as entities responsible for running the blockchain and causing a drastic reduction in the newly minted ETH. Ether's annualized inflation rate crashed from over 3.5% to nearly zero following the Merge.  The deflationary milestone, however, remained elusive for nearly two months before finally being reached, with the recent increase in the Ethereum network activity prompting an uptick in the amount of ether burned. That's a sign that ether's prospects as a deflationary asset heavily depend on the degree of network usage.  On Wednesday, more than 5,000 ETH was burned, the highest single-day tally since June, according to Etherscan. More than 13,000 ETH have been burned in the past three days alone. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, implemented in August of last year, introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid by users. The EIP is essentially tied the amount of ether burned with the network usage.

42414960,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVSea,1668151294,FTX's Regional Crypto Exchanges Slowly Reopen Withdrawals,"FTX Japan said it resumed yen withdrawals after Japanese regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), expressed concern over the crypto exchange's health. Elsewhere, FTX Turkey said it was working on sending all Turkish lira balances to its customers.  FTX Japan made the announcement in a short statement on its website Friday. FTX Turkey communicated its message in a Friday tweet. On Thursday, the Turkish subsidiary said it would automatically convert user balances into Turkish lira at a 1:1 ratio.  Japan's FSA ordered FTX Japan to enter ""close-only"" mode on Thursday, meaning users should be able to wind up existing positions but not initiate new ones. In the order, the regulator noted that the exchange had halted withdrawals without specifying a date for reinstatement and that it continued to enlist new customers.  Under the circumstances, the regulator said it was uncertain about the company's health. It also required FTX Japan to stop accepting new customers and halt the exchange business.  These regional subsidiaries of FTX are wholly owned by FTX's 'mothership' in Antigua, FTX Trading Ltd, and license FTX's technology stack in exchange for royalty payments sent back to the Antigua-based parent. The regional exchanges are compliant with local laws surrounding securities, and thus offer a limited selection of tokens (similar to Binance's regional subsidiaries). Because of this compliance they can access local payment rails meaning that traders do not have to use expensive and slow SWIFT transfers to deposit or withdraw funds.  Some traders are known to treat these as a payment gateway for buying stablecoins, before sending them off to the main exchange for full-featured trading.

ETH must clear $1,320 and the 100 hourly SMA to start a sustained upward move. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $1,200 and $1,220 levels. The price is now trading below $1,300 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair is now struggling to clear the $1,320 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Ethereum Price Faces Key Resistance Ethereum declined heavily below the $1,320 support zone, similar to bitcoin. ETH even traded below the $1,200 support level and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average. It even spiked below $1,100 and traded as low as $1,070. Recently, there was an upside correction above the $1,120 and $1,150 levels. Ether price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,580 swing high to $1,070 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even spiked above the $1,300 resistance. However, the bears defended the $1,320 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price also failed near the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,580 swing high to $1,070 low. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,280 level. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,320 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A clear break above the $1,320 resistance could set the pace for a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise to the $1,400 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,500 resistance zone. More Losses in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,320 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,200 level. The next major support is near the $1,190 level, below which ether price may perhaps accelerate lower. In the stated scenario, the price could decline towards the $1,070 support zone in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone.

42414971,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVTL2,1668139763,First Mover Asia: Possible Legal Filings Could Clarify FTX’s Relationship to Alameda; Bitcoin Hovers Near $17K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos spent their day in the green as investors relished encouraging inflation data.  Insights: How intertwined were FTX and Alameda Research? The answer may soon be forthcoming.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 861.00 +31.7 ▲ 3.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,970 +700.0 ▲ 4.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,231 +65.7 ▲ 5.6% S&P 500 daily close  3,956.37 +207.8 ▲ 5.5% Gold  $1,755 +5.0 ▲ 0.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.83% ▼ 0.3 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Cryptos See Deep Green as Investors Relish U.S. Inflation Report  by James Rubin  After rallying on Thursday amid encouraging U.S. inflation data, bitcoin found a happy nesting place near $17,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $16,970 a more than 4% gain over the past 24 hours as investors filled with new hope about the economic future returned to riskier assets. At one point, BTC rose more than 13% to trade near $18,000. A Wednesday plunge, spurred by the ongoing FTX unraveling, had sent its price to two-year lows.  Ether was recently changing hands over $1,230, up 5.6% from Wednesday, same time. Other cryptos in the top 20 spent Thursday well into the green. In an email to CoinDesk, 3iQ Head of Research Mark Connors noted optimistically that the “one persistent development [distinguishing] the crypto winter from all others is the emergence of ETH dominance as measured by the ETH/BTC ratio.”  Other cryptos in the top 20 by market cap, spent the day in the green amid – at least temporarily – waning FTX and inflation fatigue. Even FTX’s beleaguered FTT token, whose accumulation by the exchange’s sister company Alameda Research ignited the current mess, was recently up over 20% to $2.90. Solana’s SOL, which also figured prominently on Alameda’s balance sheet, raising investor alarm, recently rose more than 6%.  On Thursday investors had cause for optimism when an unexpectedly positive Consumer Price Index report indicated the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent diet of hawkish, 75 basis point interest rate hikes were working towards reducing a year-long bout of high inflation.  This article was adapted from Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down about 3%.  Stocks soared, staging their biggest rally in two years as investors cheered the heartening price data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 7.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 5.5% and 3.7%, respectively.  In an email, Mati Greenspan, the founder and CEO of research and advisory group Quantum Economics, saw a positive in FTX's disintegration. ""In a way, FTX collapsing is a self-inflicted wound by the crypto market intended to prevent bad regulation from killing our future,"" Greenspan wrote. ""I don't think anyone, including CZ [Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao] wished their demise nor the contagion it caused. But frankly I'd much rather see the platform disappear into the void than jeopardize everything we're trying to build.""  Insights  Joined at the Hip? Details About the FTX-Alameda Relationship May Soon Be Forthcoming  by Sam Reynolds  FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried publicly claimed that Alameda Research was a “wholly separate entity” from FTX. All the evidence, including corporate filings, pointed to the contrary. The legal fallout from the exchange’s decline, including the increasing possibility of a bankruptcy filing, will clarify how intertwined the two entities have been.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, the 30-year-old former billionaire took to Twitter to say Alameda – his empire’s once mighty crypto quant shop and market maker – would go dark ""one way or another.""  A CoinDesk scoop from last week revealed that a notable portion of Alameda’s balance sheet was FTX’s FTT token. Reuters reported Thursday that FTX used customer funds to prop up Alameda Research during market turmoil in May.  A filing from Singapore’s corporate registry has shown that Bankman-Fried and other FTX corporate executives retained key roles at Alameda’s Singapore subsidiary.  The filing listed Bankman-Fried as an authorized representative, alongside Constance Wang (Wang Zhe), FTX’s chief operating officer, and Darren Wong, FTX’s chief marketing officer. The other representatives on the filing are part of a corporate services firm that helped establish the entity.  This Singapore entity is wholly owned by Alameda’s British Virgin Islands parent. There’s also an Alameda Research entity in The Bahamas, as many of the staff are based on the island.  There’s no Alameda Research in Hong Kong, but rather a Cottonwood Grove that is controlled by Bankman-Fried (it shares the name with an entity in Antigua).  If FTX ends up filing for a U.S. bankruptcy, there will be a document dump, much like in the case of Three Arrows Capital, where all will be laid bare.  Meanwhile, the Financial Times has a first look at what it believes is the FTX empire and the results of their research is impressive.  Surely regulators like the Commodities Futures Trading Commission were aware of the Alameda-FTX relationship for some time, but this spectacular collapse of the two companies will force them to act.  During the GameStop frenzy of early 2021, market maker Citadel Securities came under intense scrutiny for its relationship with brokers. Now imagine if Citadel and the New York Stock Exchange were one and the same. Regulators’ heads explode if Jeffrey Sprecher and Ken Griffin’s names appeared together on a list of a company’s directors.  And what do other crypto market makers think of all of this? They don’t like it.  One that spoke to CoinDesk on background clarified that market makers and takers (the counterparty) must have equal access to the exchange with no party at an advantage. Exchanges are also not supposed to comingle funds, something Reuters reported FTX is guilty of doing.  We’ll learn a lot more if FTX ends up before a bankruptcy court. It’ll probably be the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which has heard many of the major crypto bankruptcy cases this year. And it might even be the same judge, too.

The group wrote that it was ""devastated that it looks like there are many committed grants that the Future Fund will be unable to honor.""  ""We are so sorry that it has come to this,"" the letter said, adding: ""To the extent that the leadership of FTX may have engaged in deception or dishonesty, we condemn that behavior in the strongest possible terms. We believe that being a good actor in the world means striving to act with honesty and integrity.""  The decision adds to the fallout from FTX's dramatic liquidity problems. FTX fell under scrutiny last week after CoinDesk reported that the balance sheet of its sister company, Alameda Research was overly weighted with FTX's FTT token.  FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has tried to brand himself as the world's ""most generous billionaire"" and pledged to donate a significant amount of his wealth and make significant corporate donations. FTX ran two philanthropic arms.  The FTX Foundation, a traditional charity, has donated to health, pollution and climate initiatives. The FTX Future Fund has supported moonshot projects in fields like biosecurity and AI safety focused on ""long-term improvements for humankind."" In March, FTX said it was going to deploy $1 billion through the Future Fund at a rate of $100 million a year.  During the bull market, some thought that Web3 wealth would power a new generation of philanthropy, similar to how Web2 spurred the creation of organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Bankman-Fried has seen his personal wealth plummet by nearly 94% amid the rapid devaluation of FTX and FTT, and vanished from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index earlier this week. He might be worth even less now, given how one prominent VC that invested in FTX marked down its investment value to zero.",NEGATIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/10/ftxs-effective-altruism-future-fund-team-resigns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f76f665c39356d99992bbc24c47f6ad5d6d03188-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC failed to clear the $18,000 resistance and started a fresh decline. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $17,000 and $17,200 resistance levels. The price is trading below $18,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could resume its decline if there is a close below the $16,750 support zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Key Hurdle Bitcoin price declined heavily below the $18,000 support zone. FTX’s fall is still hurting the market and there was a strong decline towards the $16,000 support zone. The price traded as low as $15,555 and recently started an upside correction, similar to ethereum, bnb, and ripple. There was a steady recovery wave above the $16,500 and $17,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $20,670 swing high to $15,555 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price also moved above the $17,500 level, but it struggled near the $18,000 resistance zone. The 50% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $20,670 swing high to $15,555 low also acted as a strong resistance. It is now trading below $18,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,400 level. The first major resistance is near the $18,000 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $18,000 resistance might push the price further higher. The next major resistance is near $18,500 or the 100 hourly simple moving average, above which the price could test the $20,000 zone. More Losses in BTC? If bitcoin fails to start a recovery wave above the $18,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,900 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $16,750 zone. A clear move below the $16,750 support might push the price further lower. In this case, the price may perhaps decline towards the $16,000 support zone. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.

In the following article, we’ll comment on several of his very interesting points. Make no mistake, though, Jesse Powell thinks this isn’t over and the crypto industry will have to work for years to make up for… some other cryptocurrency exchange’s mistake. “More business failures are sure to come as the contagion spreads,” he warned. 2/ Our good, trusting nature makes us easy targets for con artists. Some even tell us straight up that they're here for profits, not crypto, and we praise them for their honesty. Yet we're surprised when they turn out to be who they said they are. We need to raise our standards. — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 10, 2022 At one point, Powell even gave the best advice possible for future crypto investors. “Don’t trust. Verify.” Related Reading: Coin Metrics Analyst: “FTX Might Have Provided Massive Bailout For Alameda In Q2” What he didn’t do, though, was naming Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, or Alameda Research. We are assuming this is all about them, but it’s just an assumption. Jesse Powell Allegedly Blast Sam Bankman-Fried First of all, the head of Kraken doesn’t buy the “I made a mistake” line that Sam Bankman-Fried has been feeding the public via Twitter. And Powell doesn’t mince words while saying he doesn’t. “This isn’t about aiming high and missing. This is about recklessness, greed, self-interest, hubris, sociopathic behavior that causes a person to risk all the hard-won progress this industry has earned over a decade, for their own personal gain.” The thing is, Sam Bankman-Fried didn’t only blow up his two billion-dollar businesses. He blew up the whole crypto industry. “We give them power to speak for us but they haven’t earned that privilege. When they blow themselves up, it’s our house, our reputation, our people which bear the brunt of the damage,” Powell tweeted. And he’s probably right about this. Everyone will have to pay for Bankman-Fried’s mistakes. 5/ The damage here is huge. An exchange implosion of this magnitude is a gift to #bitcoin haters all over the world. It's the excuse they were waiting for to justify whatever attack they've been keeping in their back pocket. We're going to be working to undo this for years. — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 10, 2022 Then, in a bizarre turn of events, Jesse Powell brought bitcoin into the mix: “An exchange implosion of this magnitude is a gift to bitcoin haters all over the world. It’s the excuse they were waiting for to justify whatever attack they’ve been keeping in their back pocket.” What does the FTX implosion have to do with bitcoin? In fact, out of all the crypto world, bitcoiners are the less affected by all of this. In bitcoin culture, the self-custody of your assets is paramount. And people who make the effort and self-custody aren’t directly affected by exchanges blowing up and losing their customer’s hard-earned money. They are affected by the price movements these black swan events generate, though. FTT price chart for 11/10/2022 on Binance | Source: FTT/USD on TradingView.com Are The Media, VCs, And The US Government To Blame? This is the most interesting part of Jesse Powell’s rant. As bitcoiners denounced Sam Bankman-Fried’s shady business model left and right, the man became a media darling like few others. His frequent political donations, the way he said what the establishment wants to hear about crypto regulation, and the whole myth about him being an effective-altruism vegan were the perfect combination. “VCs, the media, the “experts” failed. People torched their own reputations vouching for individuals, projects, businesses they had not diligenced.” We’re pretty sure “diligenced” is not a word, but Jesse Powell’s message stands. The media failed miserably and led retail astray. They will never admit to their wrongdoings, but Sam Bankman-Fried was on the cover of “Fortune” a couple of weeks ago. “The New Warren Buffet?” was the article’s title. 9/ Red flags:* acting like you know everything after showing up to the battle 8 years late* 9 figs buying political favor* being overeager to please DC* huge ego purchases, like 9-fig sports deals* being a ""media darling"", seeking out puff pieces* EA virtue signaling* FTT — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 10, 2022 What about VCs, though? Aren’t they at least partially responsible for financing FTX? Before you answer, read what Jesse Powell has to say about it. He’s got inside information: “I know for a fact that VCs wrote checks blindly. Why? Because revenues were strong. Were they sustainable? Were they bleeding out money the other side?

You drove this business offshore because you refused to provide a workable regime under which these services could be offered in a supervised manner. Enforcement wrongfully focuses on convenient, on-shore good actors. — Jesse Powell (@jespow) November 10, 2022 Last but not least, what about the US Government and its lack of crypto regulation clarity? “US lawmakers & regulators have some accountability too.

The company said in a tweet that the ""lack of clarity"" around FTX's current situation meant it would pause client withdrawals. It also told clients not to deposit to its wallet or interest accounts.  ""We will share more specifics as soon as possible,"" the company said. ""... [W]e intend to communicate as frequently as possible but anticipate that this will be less frequent than what our clients and other shareholders are used to.""  BlockFi's tweet Thursday came just two days after founder and Chief Operating Officer Flori Marquez tweeted that ""all BlockFi products are fully operational,"" saying it was an independent entity until at least July of next year.  BlockFi and FTX US announced this past July that the companies had agreed to a deal wherein FTX US would provide BlockFi a $400 million credit facility, which would also allow the crypto exchange the right to acquire BlockFi. The price of the acquisition would depend on certain terms.  Read more: FTX Could Buy BlockFi for Only $15M – or a Lot More If Crypto Lender Hits Big Goals  These terms included BlockFi receiving clearance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate a yield-generating service in the U.S.; reaching at least $10 billion in client assets by the time FTX US exercised its option and BlockFi's annual income.  If these terms were met, FTX US would have to spend up to $240 million to acquire the lender. If the terms weren't met, BlockFi could have been sold for as little as $15 million.  Marquez appeared to be referring to this deal in her Twitter thread from Tuesday, saying BlockFi was an ""independent business entity"" and noting that the lender's deal was with FTX US, not FTX international.  This deal seems to have been thrown into doubt after the revelation that FTX, the global company linked to FTX US, had an up-to-$10 billion hole in its books.  FTX is now the subject of state and federal investigations and has halted withdrawals. While FTX US is okay, according to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the company announced Thursday that it may halt trading in the coming days and advised its users to halt deposits.

42411062,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVXE,1668129592,FTX Collapse Sparks Alarm From US Lawmakers,"The dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX has – perhaps naturally – sparked a number of calls for greater regulation or faster legislative action from leading U.S. lawmakers.  FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried revealed earlier this week that his exchange had ""liquidity crunches."" Later reporting suggested FTX had comingled customer funds with Alameda Research, another company founded by Bankman-Fried. FTX has a nearly $10 billion hole and froze withdrawals on its exchange. FTX US, a related entity, similarly warned its customers that it may also freeze trading in the coming days.  A number of lawmakers have published statements expressing concern about the situation.  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement:  “The recent collapse of FTX is a loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail, and just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system. The cryptocurrency market’s continued turmoil is why we must think carefully about how to regulate cryptocurrencies and their role in our economy. It is crucial that our financial watchdogs look into what led to FTX’s collapse so we can fully understand the misconduct and abuses that took place. I will continue to work with them to hold bad actors in crypto markets accountable. I’m committed to finding the best path forward to protect consumers and the stability of the U.S. markets and banking system.”  Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, tweeted:  ""The crypto sector has been operating with far too much ambiguity because (a) regulators refuse to give well-meaning actors clear guidance and (b) lawmakers refuse to act,"" he said later in the thread.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement:  “The recent fall of FTX.com – a major international cryptocurrency trading platform – is just the latest example in a string of incidents involving the collapse of cryptocurrency companies and the impacts these failures have on consumers and investors. Although FTX’s U.S.-facing company is reportedly operational, FTX’s FTT tokens are now worthless, and even worse, FTX.com customers are completely unable to access their funds. Now more than ever, it is clear that there are major consequences when cryptocurrency entities operate without robust federal oversight and protections for customers.""  ""For four years, under my leadership as Chairwoman, the Committee on Financial Services has led the way in examining and investigating the cryptocurrency marketplace. This includes the Committee’s formation of Congress’ first-ever Task Forces on Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, along with the working group on digital assets. In addition, for several months, I've been working around the clock with Ranking Member Patrick McHenry to craft bipartisan legislation that establishes a federal framework for stablecoins in order to begin building the safeguards needed to protect customers’ assets and insulate our financial markets from contagion. This week’s news further highlights the urgent need for legislation.”  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement:  “For years, I have advocated for Congress to develop a clear regulatory framework for the digital asset ecosystem, including trading platforms. The recent events show the necessity of Congressional action. It’s imperative that Congress establish a framework that ensures Americans have adequate protections while also allowing innovation to thrive here in the U.S. I look forward to learning more from FTX and Binance in the coming days about these events and the steps they will take to protect customers during the transition.”  Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee and a co-sponsor of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, said in a statement:  ""The events that have transpired this week reinforce the clear need for greater federal oversight of the digital asset industry.""  ""That has been our goal since we began drafting the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022. Working closely with our colleagues, financial regulators, academics and a wide array of industry participants, we introduced a robust bill that aims to bring transparency and accountability to the market.""  ""In light of these developments, we are taking a top-down look to ensure it establishes the necessary safeguards the digital commodities market desperately needs.""  ""Chairwoman [Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.)] and I remain committed to advancing a final version of the DCCPA that creates a regulatory framework that allows for international cooperation and gives consumers greater confidence that their investments are safe.""  ""While our legislative work continues, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission already has the ability to regulate and prosecute fraud, manipulation and abuse. I strongly encourage them to actively exercise those authorities when necessary.""  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement:  “The recent events that have transpired between FTX and Binance are the clearest example yet of why we need clear rules of the road for digital asset exchanges in the United States” said Sen. Lummis. “Market manipulation, lending activity, and whether customer funds and assets were appropriately safeguarded are just a few of the many issues my colleagues and I need to consider in the coming days. Transparent and fair exchange regulation, which is provided for in the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, is essential to ensuring customers are protected while still promoting responsible innovation.”  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, tweeted:  Warren's tweet in particular provoked a backlash from a number of crypto executives, including the CEO of publicly traded Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, who said U.S. regulators pushed crypto traders offshore by not providing clear rules for companies to abide by.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has on numerous occasions said he believes crypto exchanges should register as national securities exchanges, though he has stopped short of saying whether the agency would force companies to do so.

""The DFPI is the agency responsible for administering the state's lending and banking laws, the recent California Consumer Financial Protection Law and the state's securities laws, which govern broker dealers, investment advisers, and commodities,"" the release said.  The regulator asked affected persons to contact it to file a complaint.  FTX is not a registered money transmitter in the state, according to a search of the DFPI's database.
