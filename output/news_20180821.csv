42401796,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2WwK,1534881651,"US Senators Raise Crypto Mining Concerns, Propose Government Blockchains","Members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources asked about the cost of cryptocurrency mining and the opportunities for blockchain in the public sector on Wednesday.  Like other crypto-related hearings on Capitol Hill, the hearing – which featured a range of public and private-sector speakers – served in part as an informational session for lawmakers who aren't very familiar with the technology.  In contrast with past Congressional hearings which at times turned acrimonious toward the concept of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, senators on the Energy Committee largely inquired about how blockchain can be applied to various projects.  The people giving testimony were Robert Kahn, CEO and president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives; Paul Skare, chief cybersecurity and technical group manager of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Thomas Golden, program manager of technology innovation at the Electric Power Research Institute; Claire Henly, managing director of the Energy Web Foundation; and Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton University.  In remarks, committee chair Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska noted the ""hearing will examine any cybersecurity advantages that blockchain and similar technologies might offer over other ways of securing our energy infrastructure.""  Mining concerns  The foremost risk discussed at the hearing revolved around the energy needs of cryptocurrency miners. Networks relying on proof-of-work – which require the expense of energy to prove that ""work"" has been completed – generally require large amounts of energy, such as the bitcoin blockchain, according to Golden.  The witnesses estimated that public blockchains may be using anywhere from one to as much as five gigawatts worldwide, though, as Golden contended, ""this is less than 0.1 percent of the global power usage.""  Murkowski remarked that growing demand on the local level from new crypto mining farms can cause stress for utility providers, and may even damage the electric grid. Her concern is that this may translate to increased costs for the provider's customers.  She asked:  ""Can we anticipate the consumer rates and the concern that some might have that, 'my family and I might not be the ones that benefit from blockchain and bitcoin and yet I'm wondering are my rates going to be expected to pay for this infrastructure?'""  Senator Steve Daines similarly asked how communities can prepare for mining farms moving onto their power grids.  Golden said power utilities should begin having discussions with their communities about providing power for these companies, as a start to solving the infrastructure issue.  But even reinforcing some localities' grids may not be enough. Henly noted that ""bitcoin's energy use is a substantial concern … we know that bitcoin's energy use will prevent it from being able to scale.""  Her solution was to look at alternatives to PoW, noting that while they require large amounts of power, proof-of-stake and proof-of-authority algorithms are far more energy efficient, and can pose as feasible alternatives to scaling a blockchain without requiring large amounts of power.  Security questions and federal blockchains  At various times during the hearing, the conversation turned away from perceived problems and toward how blockchain could be applied to the energy sector, including for tracking shipments, validating security protocols or building on other existing technologies.  ""I'd like to hone in on the security aspect, because I think it's one of the most important here today,"" Senator Maria Cantwell remarked during an opening statement.  At other points, the senators sought to clarify for themselves different aspects of the technology's elements. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, for example, asked about transaction privacy and whether law enforcement officials could be hindered in carrying out their duties.  Senator Bill Cassidy notably asked about specific uses for the U.S. government, asking if it is technically feasible to develop a blockchain for federal governments to track shipments sent from one nation to another. Narayanan confirmed that such a platform is feasible, but would require participation from whichever nations are involved.  And while, like previous hearings, no firm conclusions were reached, Murkowski noted that the hearing was educational for the committee's members – perhaps setting the stage for more queriers to come.

42401812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2XB5,1534877471,Bets Against Bitcoin's Price Are Nearing Record Highs,"The number of short orders placed on bitcoin is less than 3 percent – or 1,196 orders – away from setting a new all-time high, according to data from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  As of 16:00 UTC Tuesday, there are 39,524 short orders outstanding, marking its highest level in more than four months. Shorts have only been higher on one occasion: April 12, when the figure reached 40,719 orders.  Bitcoin shorts of this amount speaks volumes about the prevailing market sentiment being overwhelmingly bearish, given that investors continue to bet that the price of the cryptocurrency will sink further in the near term.  There is cause to caution the bears, however. Since more than 16,000 shorts were opened at a bitcoin price below $6,700 (Aug. 8th through today), a less than 4.5 percent increase in bitcoin's current price of roughly $6,435 could cause a significant portion of the total shorts to cover, or have to buy BTC back in order to close their losing position.  Such an occurrence can cause prices to quickly rise even further due to the increase in buy orders, an effect known as a ""short squeeze.""  A short squeeze of this nature is not without merit as a near-identical situation came to fruition on April 12, the same day shorts reached an all-time high. On that day, bitcoin opened at a price of $6,943 but ultimately reached a 24-hour high of $8,087 as a result of a significant amount of short orders needing to be closed.  BTC/USD Shorts vs. Price  As seen in the above chart, circumstances between April 12 and today are very similar.  On both occasions, price traveled sideways in the mid-$6,000 range following a steep downswing in prices. This allowed for the emboldened bears to put up an abundance of short orders on Bitfinex, depicted by the red line indicator.  What's more, the relative strength index (RSI), an indicator used to identify ""overbought"" or ""oversold"" market conditions, is printing a near identical daily value (~44) as on April 12th.  Indeed, the stage is set for a massive short squeeze, but there is no guarantee bitcoin prices will rise enough to force those shorting to close their positions.  Until then, both bears and bulls are waiting eagerly and watching as the events unfold.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

As first observed by Lanjiner, a China-based finance news outlet, among those affected are Jinse, which is backed by Node Capital, and Deepchain, a site supported by several token funds.  At press time, on Jinse's official Wechat account, none of its previous articles are shown. Instead, a text is posted indicating that the account has been banned.  That message explains:  ""Due to users' complaints and after the platform's examinations, the account is found to violate 'Temporary Regulations on the Development and Management of Public Information Services for Instant Messaging Tools' and all contents have been banned. The account has been prohibited for use.""  The same message is also shown on the account pages for Deepchain, Huobi News and CoinDaily.  It's not clear at this time precisely why the accounts have been affected. However, newly-enacted rules from China's government may have played a factor.  The Temporary Regulations on the Development and Management of Public Information Services for Instant Messaging Tool is a set of rules announced and enacted by the Cyberspace Administration of China on August 7.  One of the rules in that release lays the groundwork for accounts to be impacted on the grounds that they must ""abide by relevant laws and regulations,"" stating:  ""The users of instant messaging tools serving in public information service activities shall abide by relevant laws and regulations. For instant messaging service users who violate the agreement, the instant messaging service provider shall take measures such as warning, restriction, suspension, and closure until the account is closed, meanwhile saving the relevant records and fulfilling the obligation to report to the relevant authority.""  Back in March, People's Daily, the state-run media outlet in China, directly criticized blockchain and cryptocurrency media outlets in China and claimed that these media outlets were helping manipulate the cryptocurrency market.  Notably, Jun Du, the founder and CEO of Huobi, was named in the commentary as ""a classic example"" of the problem in China's blockchain media ecosystem.  Usually considered as the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), People's Daily's commentary was seen by some as the government's call for stricter regulations on blockchain media outlets.

Speaking to Null Transaction, the bitcoin proponent said this is the first time he has worked with a blockchain company in his career, adding that he ""was amazed at the technology behind [cryptocurrency].""  Equi aims to act as an investment firm, Wozniak said. According to the startup's Twitter page, it hopes to help both retail and professional investors purchase equity in companies in an effort to replace traditional investing firms.  Wozniak continued:  ""Our approach is not like a new currency, or something phony where an event will make it go up in value. It's a share of stock, in a company. This company is doing investment by investors with huge track records in good investments in things like apartment buildings in Dubai. We have one person in our group who has listed out a whole apartment building for bitcoin.""  Wozniak did not provide details on what his role would be at the startup. He did indicate that the company may register in Malta, which has been working to develop a friendly regulatory environment aimed to attract firms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.  Continuing to tout the potential use cases for blockchain technology, he said, ""I've encountered people working in real estate avenues, types of Uber systems, everything we've got in our life, especially involving transactions – retail sales, car sales, manufacturing of goods … working on bitcoin applications … and they all have value.""  The tech guru's choice of first crypto project is perhaps a little surprising. Equi, as reported by The Next Web, has had something of a bumpy path so far. Initially launching its token via an ICO, lack of interest and missed targets reportedly saw the sale cancelled and pre-sale investors refunded.  A follow-up bounty scheme to reward users with tokens for publicizing the project also saw major issues when a partner marketing company soon walked away, the news source indicates. Going the bounty route also raises the thorny issue, as reported by CoinDesk, that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated that even giving away tokens may break securities rules.  At press time, Equi's website was not working.

Reports on the firms' participation in the funding effort first emerged among Chinese media in early August. Soon after, several outlets including CoinDesk, TechCrunch and other media platforms cited the reports in follow-up articles on the mining giant's anticipated multi-billion dollar initial public offering in Hong Kong.  Yet, both Tencent and Softbank have now confirmed to CoinDesk that they have no connection to the investment deal.  A spokesperson for Tencent told CoinDesk via email on Thursday that the Hong Kong-listed company is ""not involved in this investment"" when presented with several online reports claiming they were. ""The news is not true,"" they added.  Similarly, financial giant SoftBank indicated it, too, had no connection to the Bitmain round.  ""Neither the SoftBank Group Corp. nor the SoftBank Vision Fund were in any way involved in the deal,"" a spokesperson of SoftBank wrote in an email response last week.  Asked about any previous or subsequent investment interest in the mining giant, the SoftBank representative further replied with ""nothing so far.""  Meanwhile, another firm reported to have participated – China International Capital Corporation (CICC), an investment and securities brokerage firm listed in Hong Kong with headquarters in Beijing – did not deny the news after CoinDesk sent multiple enquiries on the issue, eventually telling us on Monday it has ""no comment on the issue.""  Based on various Chinese reports that covered the deal, the original source of the claims appears to have come from an IPO-focused blog on the WeChat messaging platform, using an official account named ""IPO Zao Zhi Dao.""  The owner, called ""Uncle C""on WeChat, first published a report on July 23, saying its ""exclusive sources"" revealed several potential investors who were likely to participate in the Bitmain funding.  The post listed major names such as Tencent, GIC (a Singapore government-established sovereign wealth fund), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and a Canadian pension fund. Tencent said at the time it had ""no comment on the report"" after the article got widely cited across the Chinese media.  Yet on August 4, the same blog published a follow-up post that again claimed the exclusive that Bitmain had officially closed its pre-IPO round with $1 billion, valuing the firm at $15 billion, post-deal. In addition, Tencent, Softbank and CICC were reported as participating.

The Israel-based company said in a press release that, with help from sports marketing agency SportQuake, it has entered new partnerships with seven Premier League football clubs for a range of sponsorship assets, including access to players, digital rights, tickets, LED perimeter boards and interview backdrops.  Planned and finalized over six months, the deal sees eToro partner with Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Southampton, Brighton & Hove Albion and Cardiff City, and claim it is ""the first brand to pay for a Premier League partnership in bitcoin.""  Iqbal V. Gandham, eToro's managing director for the U.K., said:  ""The blockchain technology that underpins crypto currencies like bitcoin brings transparency, which we believe can improve the experience for everyone who loves the 'beautiful game', from fans being targeted by ticket touts, or a club negotiating a transfer, we believe that blockchain will revolutionise the world of football.""  The move to fund the sponsorship deal with bitcoin will perhaps come as little surprise. As far back as January 2014, eToro became an early adopter of the cryptocurrency, opening up bitcoin trading for its then 3 million users.  Early in 2017, the company moved to allow customers to buy or sell XRP, ether and litecoin on its platform. However, the investment-only service did not allow them to deposit or withdraw cryptocurrencies from their accounts.  Then, in May 2018, the firm announced it was launching a fully fledged cryptocurrency exchange with a wallet service and the addition of the dash, bitcoin cash, stellar, ethereum classic, NEO and EOS cryptocurrencies.  The announcement also saw customers in the U.S. gain access to cryptos on the platform for the first time.  Just yesterday, the token of the IOTA project was also added to the platform.

42401815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2XD3,1534847626,Rally Ahead? Bitcoin's Price May Be Charting a Previous Bull Pattern,"History often has a way of repeating itself.  The current price pattern in the bitcoin market is eerily similar to the one observed in the run-up to a major rally that occurred on April 12.  To start with, bitcoin charted a long-tailed candle on Aug. 14, similar to the one seen on Apr. 1, signaling the sell-off from the July 24 high of $8,507 has likely run its course.  Further, the leading cryptocurrency has spent the last seven days trading in a sideways manner around $6,400. Back in April, the cryptocurrency traded around $6,800 in the first 11 days before rising sharply above $8,000 on April 12.  More importantly, during the bitcoin price consolidation of early April, the BTC/USD shorts on Bitfinex jumped more than 44 percent to print a record high of 40,719 and fell sharply on April 12, meaning the big spike in BTC was likely fueled by the unwinding of short positions.  Interestingly, the short positions on Bitfinex currently stand at $38,640 – the highest level April 12 – and are just short of the record high of 40,719, as seen in the chart below.  BTC/USD Shorts on Bitfinex  As seen in the daily chart above, BTC looks to be repeating the price action seen in early April. Even the relative strength index (RSI) is positioned exactly where it was ahead of April 12.  So, the question now is will bitcoin repeat the history by producing a $1,000 rally in the next few days?  In theory, a sharp rise in short positions during price consolidation is considered a sign the market is preparing for another round of sell-off.  However, in BTC's case, the consolidation is happening after a 30 percent drop, meaning the cryptocurrency is oversold. Add to that the extreme bearish positioning, as indicated by the near record high BTC/USD shorts, and there is always a risk of a short covering rally.  So, it seems safe to say history will likely repeat itself.  View  The BTC market is looking similar to the one seen in the first 11 days of April. The cryptocurrency may consolidate for another day or two before rising sharply toward $7,000.  A close below $6,000 (February low) would weaken the odds of BTC repeating the history and would shift risk in favor of a drop to June low of $5,755.

42401802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2X3D,1534843850,Energy Firm Discloses Major Crypto Losses Amid Blockchain Rebrand,"An energy firm that is publicly traded in Hong Kong and chaired by a Chinese billionaire is planning to rebrand itself as a blockchain company despite having lost millions investing in cryptocurrencies.  Called Global Energy Resources International Group, the firm filed a proposal with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday indicating it seeks to change its Chinese name to ""Global Token Limited,"" given its recent move into the crypto space.  Based on the filing, the firm has over the past several months launched cryptocurrency trading platforms based in Hong Kong, as well as making investments in crypto assets and blockchain technology solutions.  ""As announced by the Company on 18 January 2018, the Board had resolved to re-allocate approximately HK$50.0 million ($6.3 million) of the unutilized net proceeds ... to make investment in, among others, cryptocurrency,"" the company wrote.  According to the interim financial report disclosed by the firm on Aug. 10, at the end of June, the firm invested a total of $2.4 million in cryptocurrency assets, which amid this year's bear market, led to a near 50-percent loss of $1.02 million.  Global Energy Resources currently holds 2,135 ether and over 20 million XPA tokens, which are together worth around $1.2 million as of press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap and CoinDesk's price index.  As stated in the Hong Kong filing, over the past several months, the energy firm has also launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange called TideBit and a crypto-to-crypto platform named TiDeal, which brought in some revenue.  However, in part due to the losses arising from cryptocurrency and related technology investments, the firm recorded an overall net loss of $6.3 million in the first half of the year, compared to just $573,277 in the same period last year.  Although Global Energy Resources is little known as a publicly traded firm, it is notably chaired by Chen Ping, a billionaire Chinese publisher who also owns the Sun TV, a satellite network based in Hong Kong.  According to the interim report, Chen owns 85 percent of the TideBit trading platform. TiDeal was also launched by Chen, according to the exchange's website.

42401803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2X4C,1534838445,Threats Fly As Fight Over Siacoin's Crypto Mining 'Kill Switch' Intensifies,"An effort to keep the $200 million siacoin blockchain free from corporate interests is devolving into chaos amid accusations against the companies at the center of the effort.  At issue is the conduct of the protocol's coders, and the motivations behind their push to alter the rules of the blockchain they maintain. Last week, developers including siacoin creator David Vorick floated changes that would keep some mining equipment operators from earning value by securing the distributed storage protocol.  Simply put, the code would fork siacoin so that products offered by Bitmain, the China-based firm on the verge of an initial public offering, and its competitor Innosilicon, would be disabled.  But while such efforts have been met with enthusiasm on other blockchains, satisfying concerns about how such changes could impact the balance of power on their networks, there's just one problem – in the case of siacoin, the equipment that would still work is being sold by a company operated by siacoin's developers.  Indeed, the mining company in question, Obelisk, was founded by Vorick in 2017. In June this year, Vorick later announced a service named named ""Launchpad,"" through which Obelisk would create mining equipment for a wider range of blockchains.  But while this was praised as a novel model for blockchain management, it did little to change the competitive environment for the company. Obelisk's SC1 miner had already been beaten to market by a competing offering from Bitmain in January. The stage set for competition by June, the mood in the community was tense, if optimistic, that is until Obelisk missed a June deadline.  Having amassed $22 million from siacoin users for the production of mining machines, the situation has now degraded into a tangle of legal threats and proposals to fork the blockchain. The situation is so fraught, even Vorick said he doesn't quite know ""how things will play out.""  Vorick told CoinDesk  ""Things are very chaotic right now, and the situation is complex. We're trying to do the right thing, but it's not obvious to us what the best way forward is from here.""  Not simply a way to regain economic sway of the network, multiple sources within the siacoin community have told CoinDesk the move was in response to a rising legal pressure, a fact alluded to by Vorick in his statements.  ""Obelisk felt that there was sufficient pressure in the sia community, and sufficient pressure from the Obelisk community to justify releasing the algorithm to the sia development team,"" Vorick told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It is now in the hands of the sia developers to make a decision around whether to deploy the algorithm or not.""  Missed deadline  At the time of writing, two parties have contacted CoinDesk claiming to be pursuing legal action against Obelisk. In both cases, the lawsuits stem from allegations the company failed to ship its SC1 miner by June 30, as agreed on purchase.  A third-party developer that was previously responsible for the upkeep of siacoin-related websites and web tools, the pseudonymous ""RBZL"" recently quit his engagement with siacoin, stating that the controversy over Obelisk has effectively stalled the platform's development.  Now pursuing legal action, RBZL explained that his concern was that Obelisk knew it couldn't commit to its release timeline. RBZL went on to call the venture ""proud and arrogant,"" stating that the behavior of the company was a ""slap in the face"" to Obelisk's buyers.  Comments on the social media site Reddit  attest that such marketing efforts were made, with Vorick stating there that users ""will be eligible for a full refund,"" in the case of a missed deadline.  ""I have no interest in seeing the sia project go under, but they've done a good job of setting themselves up for that possibility,"" RBZL told CoinDesk.  Continuing, RBZL shared screenshots of private messages with Vorick that featured the founder stating Obelisk was unable to offer refunds due to a lack of funds. Funded entirely by advanced sales of its mining machines, Obelisk had already spent its money on manufacturing.  ""I feel like we were pretty clear that we wouldn't be able to survive refund requests,"" Vorick wrote in the message.  Referring to a comment on Reddit, Vorick acknowledged that his statements might come back to impact the company. ""That comment might be enough to kill us in court. And when I say kill us, I mean dead company,"" he said.  Nebulous and Obelisk  Making matters worse is that those behind the effort suggest any legal action against Obelisk could impact Nebulous, the startup entity the currently employs open-source developers for the siacoin protocol.  In the same screenshot, Vorick is seen stating that ""Obelisk and Nebulous are not properly arm's length,"" and warned that in the case of legal action, ""it's likely the court would order Nebulous to refund damages as well which we don't have money for either.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Vorick confirmed the messages were authentic, but said he was ""speaking on a personal level and sharing [his] own fears with a community moderator and leader."" He requested these messages ""not be interpreted in an official capacity.""  Another siacoin user named ""Bloqtwits"" also contacted CoinDesk, claiming to represent a group of claimants that had purchased Obelisk miners and are now seeking a class action lawsuit.  Bloqtwits declined to share further information about the filing, as did RBZL, citing advice from legal council that could impair any case.  Still, some of those seeking damages believe the entities backing the siacoin protocol have more than enough funds to pay up. The sole development body behind siacoin, Nebulous is custody of what is called the ""siafunds,"" a slice of a siacoin smart contract that is built to incentivize siacoin development.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a siacoin trader named Scott Bell estimated the fund nears $56 million, or did at one point over the course of 2018.  ""I believe these folks are not actually seeking justice, but instead see a legal pathway to the Nebulous siafunds in a class action,"" Scott Bell told CoinDesk.  Support for developers  That's not to say there aren't efforts ongoing that support the protocol's developers.  Bell, for example, leads one of the factions within the siacoin community that is promoting a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF), a change that would find users opting to alter the software's rules, as opposed to a corporate entity.  Bell said the proposal seeks to find a way to defend against the mounting legal pressure against Obelisk and Nebulous, which he sees as an attack on the siacoin network.  And that's because, according to Bell, Nebulous is vital to siacoin. If a lawsuit on Obelisk succeeded to take Nebulous down as well, it could have a damaging impact on the network.  ""There won't be any devs on it anymore, the visionary will be bankrupted and will have to go away, and everything we put our efforts behind will go up in smoke,"" Bell told CoinDesk.  Published two weeks ago, the proposal argues that once the mining units are released, Obelisk should give Obelisk miners the run of the network for a three-month period, after which other miners would again be able to secure the protocol.  ""Unfortunately, the only thing we could arrive at is a pretty messy way of solving the problem, and that's essentially paying off the people who are threatening legal action. I hate to say it, but it's that,"" Bell told CoinDesk.  Uncertain future  Still, other factors suggest that the volatile situation could continue to change in the days and weeks ahead. For one, Obelisk said it began the shipment of its units Friday and planned to send ""hundreds"" this week.  ""We are still on track to deliver all Batch 1 units by the end of August,"" the company announced on Discord last week.  In the meantime, Vorick said he remains skeptical of more grassroots efforts to change the protocol (Obelisk and Nebulous have not issued statements on the proposals).  For one, while Obelisk agreed to release its new algorithm, one that would shut out competing miners, Vorick said that he disagreed with the efforts of the UASF group to open the network to other mining after a brief lock-out period, as is specified in the proposal.  ""If we are going to take proactive measures to curate our mining community, the goal is going to be to set up a healthy, decentralized, open mining ecosystem,"" Vorick told CoinDesk, ""It therefore does not make sense to me that we would switch away and then switch back.""  Further, uncertainties remain — for example, the threat of the class action hasn't subsided.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Vorick said that for now, he is practicing caution, focussing on shipping the units, and hesitating to take dramatic steps that could set a lasting precedent for the governance of the cryptocurrency.  ""Something as significant as a fork should never be rushed,"" he told CoinDesk.  Correction (09:20 UTC, Aug. 21, 2018): An earlier version of this article erroneously stated the market value of siacoin as $200 billion instead of $200 million. This has now been corrected.  Correction (09:40 UTC, Aug. 22, 2018): An earlier version of this article erroneously stated Obelisk shipment deadline to be July instead of June. This has now been corrected.

42401807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2X79,1534831220,Chinese Bank Issues Securities Worth $66 Million on a Blockchain,"Zheshang Bank, one of the largest privately held commercial banks in China, has completed an issuance of securities worth $66 million using its proprietary blockchain platform.  Based on public documents, the bank filed a prospectus with the Shanghai Clearing House on Aug. 13 saying it would back the securities with a portfolio of account receivables from various corporations.  According to a report from China Securities Journal on Monday, the bank subsequently completed the issuance on Aug. 17, becoming one of the first institutions in the country to have made such an issuance over a blockchain network.  The blockchain platform, called Lianrong, was designed in-house by the bank to allow registered companies to broadcast account receivable assets to potential investors and to further let them settle invoice transactions as securities peer-to-peer.  By purchasing a firm's account receivables, an investor essentially pays for the firm's pending invoice at a discount and expects to later collect the full amount from the party liable for making the original payment.  Founded in 2004, Zheshang Bank is one of 12 publicly traded commercial banks in China that have launched various blockchain initiatives over the past 12–18 months.

42401808,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2X97,1534822535,Tron's BitTorrent Acquisition Triggers String of Employee Exits,"At least five employees have left BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer networking pioneer, following its June acquisition by Justin Sun, the founder of the controversial blockchain protocol Tron, CoinDesk has learned.  According to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the acquisition and company operations, the departures were related to concerns about the acquisition, as well as the direction proposed for the company by Tron leadership. Sources said three of the employees left on their own accord, while two others were dismissed.  Among those departed were at least two individuals serving in leadership positions, the sources indicated, performing key roles such as general manager and head of marketing.  However, other senior-level employees, including the company's chief executive, chief financial officer, chief product officer and chief revenue officer, are unable to leave the company due to 18-month lock-in agreements.  The news comes just two months after Sun purchased the San Francisco-based company for $120 million in cash through Rainberry Acquisition, Inc., a company registered to him alone according to publicly available documents. Sun, a former Ripple representative, is best known for founding the Tron project in 2017, which aims to decentralize the internet and boasts controversial miner Bitmain as a backer.  Tron completed a $70 million ICO in 2017, but later returned funds collected from Chinese investors after China banned the fundraising method.  At the time of the acquisition, observers speculated that Sun purchased BitTorrent with the hope of leveraging its extensive user network (about 100 million users per month) for his own project's ends. Others suggested Sun acquired the company with the hope of lending credibility to Tron - something it has been accused of lacking in the past.  More specifically, last year Tron was accused of failing to properly attribute code that it incorporated into its protocol. This allegation was followed by claims project leaders had plagiarized Tron's white paper.  Sun's $1 billion blockchain launched in late June shortly after the acquisition was announced, however, token holders are still in the process of electing the nodes that would make the technology fully operational.  A Tron representative told CoinDesk via email:  ""Tron is committed to the BitTorrent product and user community. We have been growing rapidly since the acquisition, as one family, to meet our vision for a decentralized future.""  But according to sources, this rapid growth is one of several reasons remaining staff are concerned about the acquisition.  The approximately 49-person company is hiring for at least 30 positions ranging from software engineers to recruiters, LinkedIn shows, and employees fear that the expansion Sun hopes to achieve will compromise the company's working culture, which sources described as more relaxed prior to the acquisition.  Sources went on to tell CoinDesk that there is also unease amongst remaining employees about Tron's marketing techniques and messaging, particularly with regard to the nascent state of their technology as compared to the way it has been marketed to consumers and investors.  Likewise, they said that BitTorrent staff members feel discomfort about the role of Tron entities in the blockchain's node elections. Out of 27 total elected nodes, Justin Sun controls one and Tron controls four, though the nodes are named after different entities, specifically, BitTorrent, uTorrent, Peiwo and Raybo.  The Tron acquisition marks the latest chapter for BitTorrent, which has undergone multiple personnel shake-ups in recent years. The company laid off 12 employees in2008 after its online media store product failed, and again in2015 when it cut around 40 employees following a reorganization of the business.

42401798,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2WxJ,1534816810,US Government Grants $800K to Blockchain Researchers,"The U.S. government will help fund a distributed ledger platform being developed by researchers at the University of California-San Diego.  Subhashini Sivagnanam, a researcher and software architect with the Data Enabled Scientific Computing division at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, won $818,433 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop the Open Science Chain (OSC), a proposed distributed ledger which will help researchers efficiently access and verify data collected through scientific experiments, according to the NSF's website.  NSF, a long-standing scientific organization, serves as a key conduit for research initiatives in the U.S. to tap federal resources. The government organization has funded a number of blockchain projects in previous years, including those focused on different aspects of cryptocurrency incentive mechanisms and blockchain technology use cases.  Public records show that the project entails ""a web-based cyberinfrastructure platform built using distributed ledger technologies that allows researchers to provide metadata and verification information about their scientific datasets and update this information as the datasets change and evolve over time in an auditable manner.""  Simply put, the network would constitute a living – and digital – catalog of their work, growing as more information is developed and added. Researchers will be able to better trust the data they are examining, according to the abstract.  The grant will begin on Sept. 1, 2018, and carry through until Aug. 31, 2021, according to the award letter.
