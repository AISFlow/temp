42429997,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Dh,1543960821,Numerai to Cut Token Supply by 10 Million to Become 'Decentralized as F*ck',"Numerai never did a token sale, but people have its token and they are using it.  The numeraire (NMR) was launched in June 2017 as an early departure from the initial coin offering (ICO) template. Now, with the final upgrade of the company's smart contract on ethereum, the maximum supply of tokens will drop from 21 million to 11 million, and the company will throw away the keys to the contract controlling its supply.  ""We are going to be decentralized as fuck,"" Numerai founder Richard Craib told CoinDesk in an interview.  Craib argues this has always been the plan, but the move dovetails nicely with comments by U.S. regulators suggesting widely-used tokens that no one company controls are viewed more favorably.  When CoinDesk asked Craib if the company has been in touch with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about its business model, he declined to comment. Regardless, Craib seemed relieved that his company never opted to do an ICO. Rather, NMR tokens were distributed via airdrops and as payments to users of its platform.  ""I think from a securities perspective the key question is whether or not the SEC will go after a company that only did an airdrop, rather than an ICO,"" said Margaret Rosenfeld, the blockchain practice lead at law firm Smith Anderson.  How it works  Craib doesn't dispute that Numerai has been centralized up till now.  Numerai started as a marketplace for data that its hedge fund could use to make investments. With the full debut of Erasure, its software on ethereum, Numerai will open up that marketplace to any fund that wants to incorporate other people's work.  Numerai dates back to 2015. It was founded as a hedge fund that wanted to give data analysts a better way to sell good data analysis. To date, Numerai has been using its software to let data scientists crunch numbers for Numerai's own benefit, but Erasure will let anyone making predictions prove their track record.  Today, even with only one customer, there are 25,000 stakes of NMR, according to the company, making it ethereum’s most-used token.  What's striking about the recent decentralization announcement, though, is the company's decision not only to turn the software over to NMR holders but to mint significantly fewer tokens than originally planned.  According to Craib, if Erasure is meant to bring in lots of new participants, then it's important to cut off the new supply of NMR.  Craib explained:  ""We had to be sure those people didn't have to trust Numerai not to mint a whole bunch of tokens.""  Why rush?  But there's a lingering question: why move so quickly?  ""Nothing we are doing now is a reactionary thing,"" Craib told CoinDesk. He added that he believes the SEC's priority has been to take on ICOs that went too far.  That said, we've already seen one project, Stream, decide to pull its ICO because the firm didn't think it could do it legally, and then shut down entirely when it didn't believe it could even do an airdrop.  Nevertheless, Craib seems confident that turning the protocol over to NMR holders will be enough.  Rosenfeld, the Smith Anderson lawyer, was not so sure. She said the SEC will look at everything the company has done with the token, not just what it's doing once it has completely decentralized. The ""taint of a security"" doesn't just go away in the eyes of the SEC, she said.  Still, she added: ""[U.S. regulators] haven't yet gone after a company that has just done an airdrop.""  Numerai 2.0  So far, NMR payments have been issued to users by way of a weekly analysis tournament. Competing analysts had to use NMR to stake their work. It was a way of expressing confidence in their models. If their analysis proved right, bigger stakes got bigger NMR rewards.  If their work was bad enough, scientists could lose their stake, but lost stakes didn't go back to Numerai, Craib explained. Lost stakes just got burnt.  On Erasure, users will be able to prove that they've made good predictions on a given dataset over time and sell those predictions to anyone who thinks their fund can make good use of it.  Similar to the existing system, analysts will need to stake their predictions to express confidence. Buyers can pay to destroy their stake if they get frustrated with a predictor.  Joshua Gans  , an economist at the University of Toronto, doesn't buy the staking approach on Erasure, but its community won't have to stick to it. With the launch of Erasure, NMR will also become a governance token. Holders can vote to approve a better approach to managing spammy datasets if a better approach comes along.  What they won’t be able to do is vote to increase the token supply, as that smart contract will be shut down for good.  But wait, there's more  With Erasure's launch, the supply of NMR tokens will rise by almost half again.  How that happens could be a key question for regulators. The company is not revealing how that last lot of tokens (over 50 percent of the existing supply) will be distributed.  According to Numerai, there are currently about 7 million NMR in existence. CoinMarketCap pegs that number at 2.3 million. Craib says the difference is largely explained by the fact that the company locked up 3 million tokens for a decade in May, but that still leaves 1.7 million unaccounted for.  ""I don't really know where CoinMarketCap gets their information,"" Craib wrote CoinDesk in an email.  In Erasure's early days, ""Numerai will be one of the biggest purchasers of data feeds, for the time being,"" Craib projected, but he believes it is inevitable that other hedge funds will begin scouring it for predictions.  ""It's fundamentally going to be a token about users and usage,"" he said.

Modern Materials Handling magazine reported Monday that the school had launched a free demonstration website for supply chain management professionals in particular, aimed at helping students learn more about blockchain and its potential use cases. The tool can be used on its own as a classroom module, or folded into other lessons, according to the magazine.  The platform was developed in conjunction with supply chain firm SecureMarking and the University of South Dakota's Beacom School of Business, and while it was developed by Air Force researchers, it's aimed at aiding all Department of Defense leaders who may need to know more about the technology, according to the article.  AFIT's tool ""tracks the entire lifecycle of a component,"" the magazine explains, meaning those using it can follow a part's simulated life from when it is first manufactured to its ultimate disposal.  ""This is important because many supply chains now face a challenge of having used products re-introduced and sold as new by unscrupulous businesses,"" the article explains, adding:  ""These used products can lead to costly problems such as unexpected breakdowns of equipment. In some situations, tracking decommissioning could also be useful for ensuring that hazardous materials are properly disposed of, or that re-usable components are properly recycled.""  Alongside the tool itself, AFIT researchers have published a series of videos explaining blockchain technology and outlining how a platform using the technology might operate, as well as how users can interact with the demonstration website.  Researchers with AFIT did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

The company announced Tuesday it was purchasing $2.5 million of equity stake in GrainChain, a nearly six-year-old company which develops software tools to aid farmers and purchasers in the grain industry. Medici's purchase gives it a 10 percent ownership stake in the company, with the option to purchase another 10 percent at a future date.  While GrainChain originally developed internet of things-focused software, CEO Luis Macias told CoinDesk that the company began looking into utilizing a blockchain ledger about two years ago.  At the time, the company's systems were having issues coordinating with ""thousands of trucks on a daily basis,"" due to the number of contracts that had to be filled out and executed manually.  To combat these issues, the company is developing a blockchain platform that makes it easier to track grain and connect with a larger set of buyers, Macias said.  He explained:  ""What it’s doing is not only leveling the playing field for the farmer but ... giving a more accurate vision of where that grain is coming from, how it’s being paid and how it’s moving through the market. It’s eliminating the need for multiple-tier middlemen in the industry.""  There are roughly 500 farmers piloting the network right now, with another 3,000 or so on a waiting list, he said. The company expects to go live with the platform by the first quarter of next year.  In addition to grain tracking, the platform utilizes a token, dubbed GrainPay, to facilitate payments. The dollar-backed stablecoin is meant for internal use only, and is utilized in conjunction with the contracts farmers create with buyers.  As an example, Macias cited contracts involving farmers in Argentina. ""This is a contract that is usually done months in advance,"" he explained. ""When it's executed months later, the farmer is able to deliver the grain, receive GrainPay and convert it to dollars or the Argentinian peso at the date [the contract] was created.""  The token is used to stabilize currency fluctuations, ensuring neither side loses out due to volatility. It's also useful for cross-border payments, Medici president Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk.  ""It makes these cross-border payments more frictionless, quicker and easier, and so the cross-border aspect to this is what makes it so appealing to many of the farmers,"" he said.

Speaking at the American Bankers Association/American Bar Association Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference on Monday, U.S. Department of the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker outlined how her agency is examining the crypto space and calling for increased global oversight.  She highlighted the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)'s addition of bitcoin addresses to its sanctions list last week. The office listed two Iranian residents who converted bitcoin ransoms into Iranian rials as part of an effort to cut them off from the global financial system, she said.  ""As Iranian and other bad actors attempt to misuse digital currency to facilitate illicit activity, financial institutions, including exchangers and other providers of digital currency services, must guard against the risks of assisting these malicious actors,"" she said.  Specifically, crypto companies must take steps to ensure that ""malicious actors,"" such as those listed on the SDN list, are not able to use their services. As an example, she said that one company alerted customers about the sanctions list. The company also shared information about its due diligence processes as part of this effort.  Perhaps more notably, however, she called for other nations to develop or enforce anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, saying:  ""While the United States regulates, supervises, and brings enforcement actions relating to virtual currency and other digital asset financial activity, many more countries must follow suit. We have made this a priority in our international outreach, including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), for which the United States is currently serving as President.""  In addition to targeted actions, the U.S. is regulating crypto exchanges and other businesses in the space through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), she said.  A lack of these regulations, especially in the crypto space, allow individuals to conduct financial crimes, such as money laundering, particularly across jurisdictions.

The Linux Foundation-led group announced Tuesday that Hyperledger Ursa will act as a repository of ""trusted"" cryptographic implementations, aimed to make it easier for blockchain developers within its community and the wider open-source space to avoid duplication of development efforts.  The library will lead to simpler project maintenance and cut down on bugs, Hyperledger said, with most or all of the crypto code being kept in a single location and reviewed by security experts – including developers who work on Hyperledger's Indy, Sawtooth and Fabric projects, as well as cryptographers with academic backgrounds.  “Our goal in creating Ursa is to combine the efforts of all the security and cryptography experts in the Hyperledger community and move all of the projects forward,” Hyperledger said.  At present, there are two modules under Ursa, one for modular, standardized basic cryptographic algorithms and another – called zmix – relating to ""more exotic"" tech, such as ""smart"" signatures and zero knowledge primitives.  Written largely in the Rust programming language, Ursa will also have interfaces in Hyperledger's most commonly used languages.  Hyperledger said:  ""The novelty [with Ursa] is the modularization and API, which enables blockchain platforms to easily use a wide variety of changeable cryptographic algorithms without having to understand or interact with the underlying mathematics.""  Developed as part of Hyperledger Labs, Ursa is being made available as an official project after the Technical Steering Committee considered it to have sufficiently “matured.""

According to Atlas' LinkedIn page, he started this month as a fraud operations manager at Twilio, a similar role to the ones he held over a five-year period at Coinbase.  Atlas referred CoinDesk's questions to Twilio's public relations officer, Caitlin Epstein. She confirmed the hire, but declined to share any information about whether Twilio is exploring blockchain or crypto at the moment.  Coinbase declined to comment.  Atlas joined Coinbase relatively early: fresh out of Butler University, he got a job as fraud team lead in September 2013, a little more than a year after the exchange was founded.  In January 2017, Atlas became a risk operations manager at Coinbase and had been working in that position until last month. His job, according to his LinkedIn profile, was ""leading a team of risk analysts in the fight to protect Coinbase and its customers from fraudulent activity.""  Atlas' new employer Twilio, which, like Coinbase, is based in San Francisco, was founded in 2008 and provides solutions for businesses to manage marketing communications through programmable calls and messages. It has been actively expanding, buying four smaller startups over the last four years. The last one was SendGrid, a marketing communications platform Twilio acquired in October.  In November, the company reported third-quarter revenues of $168.9 million, beating the average expectation of analysts by $18.5 million and causing the stock to surge by 12 percent in one day.

Signature Bank claims that all transactions made will be secure, require no transaction fees and avoid third-parties, meaning funds will be sent directly from one client to another.  There will, however, be a minimum account balance requirement of $250,000 for clients.  The platform is being built in conjunction with trueDigital Holdings LLC, another New York-based firm focused on building exchange and settlement technology using a blockchain infrastructure. The company primarily provides services to financial markets.  Signature has just received approvalhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1812041.htm from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to offer services within the state. Further, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has approved Signet deposits to receive insurance, “up to the legal insurable amounts.”  In a statement, Signature president and CEO Joseph DePaolo said it was ""gratifying"" to receive approval from NYDFS, saying that regulated innovation helped the bank build up its platform.  He added:  ""The ability to transmit funds between approved, fully vetted commercial clients of the Bank at all times is very valuable, especially in light of the increasing speed and frequency at which they conduct their business. As we have been stating, Signature Bank has made a commitment to invest in its technology infrastructure, and the Signet Platform is indicative of this investment along with the implementation of new systems for loan operations, credit approvals and foreign exchange.""

The regulator announced Monday that the new license allows approved ""innovative financial companies"" to accept public deposits of up to 100 million Swiss francs (or just over $100 million), provided the funds are not invested and no interest is paid on them. The move is a result of a late-November amendment to the country’s Banking Act by the Federal Council to promote fintech innovation.  Effective Jan. 1, 2019, blockchain firms that wish to be licensed under the scheme must meet certain certain conditions. Firstly, the entity must be a company limited by shares, a corporation with unlimited partners or a limited liability company. Secondly, it must also have its registered office and conduct its business in Switzerland, the regulator explained.  FINMA has also issued guidelines aimed at smoothing the application process for potential licensees, setting out a long list of details they will need to provide up front. These include the reasons for applying for the license, a description of the proposed business activity, a business plan including budget for the next three financial years with ""optimistic, realistic and pessimistic scenarios,"" among others.

42429992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM301h,1543928365,$35 Million: Sequoia Backs Turing Award Winner's Blockchain Project,"A group of university professors and researchers including a Turing award winner have raised $35 million for a non-profit foundation that will support the development of a new blockchain network.  Announced Tuesday, the Conflux Foundation is registered in Singapore and will use the proceeds to fuel work on its network. Backers include venture capital firms Sequoia China, crypto mining firm F2Pool and exchange Huobi, as well as Metastable and IMO Ventures.  With the new capital, the foundation said it’s now looking to expand its 10-person development team. The goal: roll out a testing environment in February and officially launch a new public blockchain around the third quarter of next year.  The project was co-founded by scholars from the University of Toronto and China’s Tsinghua University, including Dr. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Award winner and an information sciences professor at Tsinghua. Named for renowned mathematician Alan Turing, the Turing award is given out yearly by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and is considered a kind of Nobel prize for computer science.  According to an academic paper published in May, the group conducted a month-long experiment for the Conflux prototype late last year. Their efforts utilized the code of the bitcoin blockchain but changed the protocol from the Nakamoto consensus model, named for bitcoin's creator, to Conflux’s own design.  ""We implemented a prototype of Conflux and evaluated Conflux by deploying up to 20k Conflux full nodes on 800 Amazon EC2 virtual machines,"" the paper stated. ""The throughput is equivalent to 6,400 transactions per second for typical bitcoin transactions.""  Scalability push  In an interview with CoinDesk, Dr. Fan Long, a co-founder of the project and an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, said the key design decision that he believes could help to scale public blockchains is to change the way blocks are ordered.  Currently, most blockchains work in a rather linear way in that only one block can be produced at a time and added to the end of a chain. In the event of two blocks being created at the same time, the network relies on nodes to agree on which one will continue the chain.  Long said this feature of blockchain results in a bottleneck that is problematic for most public networks, especially those like ethereum that aim to power smart contracts and decentralized applications.  ""Some may have a higher scalability, but to some extent at the expense of a complete decentralization,"" Long said.  The Conflux protocol, however, is designed to allow blocks to be produced concurrently to boost the volume of transactions.  But to avoid forks, or the emergence of two competing versions of the ledger, Long said the group designed an ordering algorithm based on the concept of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is able to make sure every block will be eventually arranged in a sequence by the network.  Looking ahead  According to Long, while the foundation utilized most of the original bitcoin blockchain code during its lab experiment, it will develop its own infrastructure for the public launch next year as the team hopes to include smart contract features.  Further, the foundation said its investors will commit to using the network for future development.  Long went on to say that the end goal is to create a scalable public blockchain with smart contracts that can deliver decentralized applications – and he made a sly dig at ethereum, whose scaling challenges were laid bare a year ago when CryptoKitties clogged that public blockchain network.  ""That goal sounds easy and similar to what every other project is saying. But it's actually really difficult,"" Long said, concluding:  ""Because what we need is a highly productive public network for high-value applications, not just several blockchain-based games.""

42430001,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Jh,1543924836,Bitcoin Trader on US Sanctions Blacklist Says He’s Innocent,"Mohammad Ghorbaniyan says he’s been wrongfully blacklisted.  An Iranian bitcoin trader, Ghorbaniyan was among the wallet holders whose names and blockchain addresses were added to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list last week.  But in the wake of that event, Ghorbaniyan has told CoinDesk that he was unaware of the origins of his apparently tainted bitcoin, which OFAC said was extorted from more than 200 victims including corporations, hospitals, universities and government agencies that were hit with the SamSam ransomware virus.  Since the listing, Ghorbaniyan said in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, his Blockchain.info account and Gmail account were both suspended. He admits to converting bitcoin to Iranian rials for both of the individuals listed by the FBI, Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri and Faramarz Shahi Savandi, over several years, but says he had no reason to suspect them of any wrongdoing.  At the very least, his perspective raises questions about how black markets and grassroots bitcoin adoption overlap, especially in regions with opaque regulatory requirements.  The U.S. Treasury had no comment when reached.  What follows is a transcript of CoinDesk’s interview with Ghorbaniyan, as conducted through a translator.  Q: How did you meet Mansouri and Savandi, the alleged hackers associated with the SamSam ransomware virus?  A: I didn’t know the SamSam criminal activities were associated with the bitcoins I received from these two customers and I’m honestly still not sure if these two people are behind the SamSam crimes.  They used common messenger apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. This is the most common way to buy and sell bitcoin in Iran. They were like any other customer I’ve had over the years.  I do a standard know-your-customer (KYC) procedure. And there’s no reason to be suspicious of my customers once they do KYC.  Q: What was your KYC procedure like?  A: KYC for buying/selling bitcoin in Iran involves a selfie with bank account cards and national ID cards for the person in the selfie, plus a telephone number.  Q: Why did you say that you are unsure if those individuals are behind the SamSam ransomware?  A: In one of their chats with me, they declared that they’ll be selling 50 bitcoins by themselves, and they don’t need an exchanger for that deal. Therefore, I don’t know, there is a possibility that they were exchangers as well.  At any time, if needed, I’m ready to give all data regarding my trades with them to the Iranian cyber police and the cyber police can submit this data to the international authorities for further proceedings.  I’ve never done any criminal activities with these two people and if I knew that any of our customers are associated with criminal activities then I would refrain from doing business with them.  Unfortunately, our names have been declared by the United States Treasury as associated with criminal activities without receiving any contact from the Treasury. We are accused of something we haven't done! I was not aware of any criminal activities from our customers and I have not committed a crime.  Q: Most regulated exchange businesses in the United States have strict policies for precisely this reason. Even if that is not the requirement in Iran, why don’t you require more information in order to track the capital flows?  A: We are an Iranian exchange and we work under the law of our country, Iran, according to the rules of the Iranian cyber police. We, as exchangers, record all the data about our trades. This includes screenshots from chats and KYC data from our customers. We never violated the laws of our country.  Is there a database declaring the bitcoins that are associated with criminal activity? If I was trying to do criminal activities wouldn’t I be more concerned with hiding my identity? You could find my bank, phone numbers and bitcoin address publicly available on my website! Why should I give out such info if I were to take part in criminal activities? This is enough evidence and arguments to prove I’m innocent of any charges!  I met with the Iranian cyber police last weekend to talk about next steps. I hope the U.S. makes things right and takes my name off that list.  Before accusing people of criminal activities, the Treasury must notify the international police to request data and explanations from the Iranian police, which would have come to us. We could have stopped this misunderstanding and wrong accusations.

42430009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Vh,1543921805,Closing on $4k: Bitcoin Price Recovers From One-Week Lows,"A quick recovery from one-week lows seen today may have helped bitcoin (BTC) avert a bigger sell-off, but the bulls are not out of the woods yet.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization established a bearish lower-high pattern at $4,400 last week and closed (UTC time) well below $4,000 yesterday, confirming an end of the corrective bounce.  As a result, BTC was on the defensive earlier today, with prices hitting a one-week low of $3,730 on Bitstamp, before quickly rising back to near $4,000.  The sudden recovery from one-week lows likely indicates that sellers are reluctant to step in at current levels and may be exhausted, having pushed the cryptocurrency down by more than 30 percent through November.  That said, a short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed only above the recent high of $4,410. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,955, representing marginal losses on the day.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC struggled to close above the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) for four days straight before falling below $3,861 (Nov. 30 low) yesterday.  BTC's break below that key support confirmed an end of the oversold bounce. Further, the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) continue to trend south in favor of the bears.  So, the indicators appear to be pointing to the downside. That, however, would change if prices establish a higher-lows and higher-highs pattern with a convincing move above $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).  Hourly chart  Over on the hourly chart, BTC's recovery from seven-day lows has established a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). As a result, BTC may witness a falling channel breakout in the next few hours.  The breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to $4,410.  View  The odds of an immediate drop toward $3,500 have dropped somewhat with BTC's quick recovery from the one-week low of $3,730.  A falling channel breakout on the hourly chart would open up upside toward $4,410 (Nov. 29 high). A UTC close above that level would signal a continuation of the recovery rally from the 14-month low of $3,474 hit on Nov. 25.  A drop below $3,730 (today's low) would put the focus back on the overall bearish technical setup and could yield a re-test of $3,474.

Announced Tuesday by TRIVE Ventures, an early stage Southeast Asia-focused venture capital firm based in Singapore, the accelerator is being launched in partnership South Korea’s ICON Foundation, as a technical partner, and PwC Singapore’s Venture Hub.  Seeking to drive widespread adoption of blockchain technology across Asia, Tribe Accelerator aims to help startups achieve “real-world applicability and impact” beyond technical considerations like smart contracts and interoperability.  It further aims to provide a platform for traditional enterprises and government agencies to work alongside the upcoming blockchain projects.  “As the accelerator targets later stage startups past their Series A funding rounds, Tribe will offer significantly more value as it provides startups with access to its network of governmental and business mentors, technical support, technical talent and ultimately gain global exposure, which will help incubated startups translate their blockchain concepts into real products,” TRIVE partner Ng Yi Ming told CoinDesk.  The program is scheduled to officially launch in early 2019, the firm said, adding that, for the first batch of companies, it will not take equity or charge a participation fee.  “By working with Tribe Accelerator, we hope to create more innovative and disruptive blockchain startups to capture growth opportunities locally and overseas,” said Jonathan Lim, Enterprise Singapore’s director of startup and global innovation alliance, in an announcement.
