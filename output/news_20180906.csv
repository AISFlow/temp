42381125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94C3V,1536269724,Winklevoss Brothers Win Patent for Crypto Key Storage System,"Crypto exchange Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have won a patent for a cold storage method involving air-gapped computers, geographically remote vaults, plastic cards and, possibly, papyrus.  Filed under the brothers' firm Winklevoss IP, LLC, the document – published Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office – outlines a plan to develop a network of computers capable of generating accounts for storing cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded products (ETPs). As part of a security measure, the computers would be isolated except when necessary to transfer assets, essentially acting as a cold storage device.  The computers would generate these keys for new accounts, which would then be segmented into parts and written onto an external memory device, such as a flash drive, CD, DVD or written down physically onto a laminated card, sheet of paper, piece of plastic or even papyrus, according to the document.  The patent suggests various ways of manufacturing cards: ""for example, two sets may be stored on paper, and a third set is stored on papyrus,"" but notes that at least one set of keys must be stored on an electronic memory device. The keys should be delivered to a key storage company in person, via mail, or via fax, or created right at the secure storage site. To access the storage, the owners of the keys should provide three forms of identification.  The computers would have access to a secure portal, which could, if necessary, connect the machines to the blockchain network in order to process transactions, the document explains.  According to the document, protecting asset keys is important for blockchains to prevent the theft of funds. Further, the patent notes that digital asset ledgers are used to facilitate financial transactions, and therefore securing them enables consensus protocols to operate properly and prevent double-spend attacks from occurring.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement published on Wednesday that Louis Meza, who was accused of kidnapping an unnamed individual in New York last year and stealing their ether holdings, admitted to grand larceny in the first degree and kidnapping in the second degree.  Meza was arrested in December after allegedly forcing the victim to hand over a cell phone, wallet and keys at gunpoint last November, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Vance said in the statement:  ""Meza orchestrated a 21st-century stick-up. Then 21st-century investigators brought him swiftly to justice, securing a landmark conviction in an undeveloped area of the law. Since 2010, my Office's Cybercrime & Identity Theft Bureau has developed the expertise and technology to become a national leader in cybercrime prosecution and prevention, as underlined by this conviction and recovery of funds on the survivor's behalf.""  While the Manhattan DA's website states that Meza ""is expected to be sentenced on September 27,"" the Wall Street Journal reported that Meza agreed to a 10-year prison sentence under the terms of his plea deal. A judge will confirm or modify the sentence during a hearing later this month.  Authorities used video surveillance to confirm that Meza entered the victim's home using the stolen keys, before exiting with a box believed to have held the victim's digital wallet.  Meza was originally charged with criminal possession of stolen property, computer tampering, computer trespass and criminal use of a firearm on top of the charges to which he pleaded guilty.

An order issued by president Shavkat Mirziyoev on September 2 gives foreign exchanges a number of benefits to begin operating in the country. The document states that cryptocurrency-related income will not be taxed, licensed exchanges running operations with cryptocurrencies and foreign fiat currencies are not subject to existing foreign currency regulations and crypto exchanges are not subject to the country's securities and exchanges regulations.  However, foreign entities can only get a license for a cryptocurrency exchange after they open a subsidiary in Uzbekistan.  Further, the terms for getting such a license may be restrictive: an exchange must have an authorized capital of no less than 30,000 times the average minimum salary, which amounts to roughly $700,000; servers must be located in Uzbekistan; exchanges must utilize anti-money laundering procedures for users and they must store users' transaction and personal data for at least five years.  There are also benefits for miners: the document orders federal and local government officials to provide industrial miners using more than 100 kWh of power with land without requiring an auction (which is normally required to acquire land) on ""specially designated territories.""  The move comes months after the government announced a goal to develop new regulations for cryptocurrencies in the country.

The company released the results of its latest poll Thursday, which asked 1,202 Americans about their familiarity and interest in cryptocurrencies on August 29 and 30. According to a press release, 79 percent of respondents have heard of at least one type of cryptocurrency, with 71 percent saying they have heard of bitcoin. The second-best known cryptocurrency was ether, with only 13 percent of respondents saying they had heard of it.  That being said, the release noted that 87 percent of the individuals who have heard of bitcoin have not mined, bought or sold the cryptocurrency. Half of this group also does not plan to purchase bitcoin in the future.  According the full results, 19 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 are ""very interested"" in using cryptocurrencies primarily, with a further 29 percent being ""somewhat interested."" On the other hand, 50 percent of millennials said they were not very or not at all interested in primarily using cryptocurrencies as a payment method.  The numbers change somewhat with other age demographics, with only 36 percent of respondents overall interested in using cryptocurrencies as a payment method.  Further, a significant number of individuals believe cryptocurrencies may become a ""widely accepted"" financial tool in the future. The release stated that:  ""Although relatively few people have any immediate plans to buy Bitcoin, more than one-third (36 percent) of people think that cryptocurrencies will become widely accepted as a means of transaction for legal purchases within the next 10 years. Millennials (44 percent) are the most likely of any age group to say cryptocurrency will be widely accepted. About one-third (34 percent) of Gen X'ers and 29 percent of baby boomers agreed.""  That being said, a quarter of all respondents believe that cryptocurrencies are still used mainly for illegal purchases, with another 19 percent split between thinking they are used equally for legal and illegal purchases.

As reported on the company's blog, the cryptocurrency startup has welcomed former DHS acting general counsel Gus Coldebella to its legal and senior leadership team. Going forward, Coldebella will oversee all of the firm's legal, compliance, regulatory and government affairs in this capacity.  He will also be tasked with helping Circle in its global expansion, as the firm works with lawmakers and regulators internationally to begin providing services, Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire wrote.  Coldebella comes with not only legal expertise but is an acknowledged authority on cybersecurity policy. While at the DHS, he co-led implementation of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative under President Bush. That effort was aimed to protect government networks from cyber-attack and to promote cooperation between the public and private sectors, according to the George Washington University where he is a senior fellow.  Prior to joining Circle, Coldebella was a principal at law firm Fish & Richardson, where he helped firms address cyber security planning and incident response, government and internal investigations, and more.  Circle, which offers a variety of crypto services including an investment app, closed a Bitmain-led $110 million Series E fundraising back in May – a figure that valued the startup at nearly $3 billion. Part of that funding was said to be directed into hiring new staff at the firm.  At the time, Circle also revealed a plan to bolster its products and services by launching a ""U.S. dollar coin,"" a regulated blockchain asset that would be backed by fiat currency.

According to news agency IBENA, which is affiliated to the Central Bank of Iran, Abolhassan Firouzabadi, the Secretary of Iran's Supreme Council of Cyberspace stated on Tuesday that cryptocurrency mining ""has been accepted as an industry in the government.""  Further, the official said the decision was arrived at after consensus among other relevant government agencies such as the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, although a final policy legislating for the activity hasn't been declared as yet.  The move to recognize cryptocurrency mining comes as the country is taking efforts to create its own central bank digital currency as a means to bypass the U.S. economic sanctions recently reimposed by President Trump, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Firouzabadi added that a national cryptocurrency remains a ""promising"" tool to facilitate financial transactions with Iran's trade partners, as the Trump administration has restricted the country's access to U.S. dollars.  With regard to cryptocurrency trading activities, the official further said ""a decision-making authority will declare the framework and final policies for trade and participation of startups and trade activists in the cryptocurrency sphere by September but no definitive decision has been taken yet.""  CoinDesk also reported in July that cryptocurrency investors in Iran then appeared to be facing restrictions from the state, with users being blocked from accessing accounts at exchanges such as Binance, even if using virtual private networks or VPNs.  Following the country's recognition of crypto mining, reports indicate that the price of bitcoin on some local exchanges such as Exir peaked to over $24,000 – exceeding the global average all-time high of $20,000 seen in December – while prices elsewhere yesterday were around $7,000.  Data from CryptoCompare backs up the reports, indicating that OTC trading prices on LocalBitcoins briefly reached as high as $25,000.  Editor's note: Since publication, some commentators have offered an alternative take, suggesting that the bitcoin price spike was due to a wild fluctuation in the value of the rial, Iran's national currency.

42381142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94CMN,1536231604,Bitcoin's Double-Digit Drop Negates Long-Term Bull Market,"Bitcoin's (BTC) double-digit drop has torn down the scaffolding of what had seemed to be a developing long-term bull market just days ago.  That said, a bearish reversal is still not confirmed either, technical studies indicate.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,422 on Bitfinex – down 13 percent from the previous day's high of $7,404.  Notably, BTC has erased all the gains made over the last two weeks in a single day. Further, the sharp drop has poured cold water over the optimism generated by the falling channel breakout and the bullish turn of the weekly MACD.  Still, it is premature to call a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, as the prices are holding well above the crucial support of $6,000.  Weekly chart  As seen in the above chart, the bears have repeatedly failed in the last 11 weeks to secure a weekly close (Sunday's UTC close) below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low), signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 has run out of steam.  Hence, the bears will likely feel emboldened if BTC closes the week below $6,000.  One way to gauge whether BTC is likely to end this week below the significant support level is to study the line chart. This paints a better picture of the broader trend by focusing only on the UTC close, unlike the candlestick chart, which also takes into account the daily high and low.  Daily line chart  As can be seen, BTC has charted a pennant pattern on the daily line chart. A UTC close below the pennant support of $6,340 would signal a revival of the long-term bear market. Thus, the probability of BTC ending the week below $6,000 would rise sharply on pennant breakdown.  That said, the sell-off is now looking overstretched on the short-duration charts, and a bearish close is looking unlikely.  4-hour RSI chart  The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is hovering at its lowest level since June 11, signaling extreme oversold conditions. A similar sentiment is being echoed by the hourly chart RSI. Hence, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out.  View  BTC's drop to the low of $6,302 has neutralized the long-term bullish outlook.  Prices could drop to $6,000, albeit after a minor corrective rally due to intraday oversold conditions.  A weekly close below $6,000 would confirm a bearish reversal.  The odds of BTC ending this week below $6,000 would go up if bitcoin closes below the pennant support (line chart) for two consecutive days.  In the short-term, $7,429 (Sep. 2 high) is the level to beat for the bulls. Meanwhile, a convincing move above the July high of $8,507 would confirm a long-term bullish reversal.

42381123,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Bzj,1536231548,IBM Makes Another Blockchain Identity Play With Health Data App,"IBM's blockchain division is widening its work in the nascent field of ""self-sovereign identity"" – technology designed to give individuals greater control over their personal data.  Announced today, the tech giant is working with Hu-manity.co, whose #My31 app just became available on iOS and Android mobile devices. The app's name alludes to the idea that legal ownership of one's data should be a ""31st human right"" in addition to the 30 already ratified by the United Nations.  It's the latest in a series of similar projects IBM has been involved in. Others include SecureKey, a bank consortium building a digital ID system in Canada, and Sovrin, contributor of the Indy toolkit for Hyperledger-based blockchains.  As such, the partnership with Hu-manity is a strong signal that Big Blue sees long-term business value in this use case for distributed ledgers. Marie Wieck, the general manager of IBM Blockchain, told CoinDesk:  ""Getting people's permissioned rights on a blockchain will create a marketplace and entirely new economic business models as a result.""  Indeed, while Hu-manity's app is consumer-facing, an enterprise version will be generally available to corporations starting in the healthcare industry in the first quarter of 2019, Wieck said.  ""We tend to agree that data is the next natural resource and like a natural resource has to be mined responsibly in the same way,"" she added. ""Blockchain combined with the notion of rights to individual data, facilitates the distributed sharing of that information securely and at scale.""  Richie Etwaru, founder and CEO of Hu-manity, has a similarly expansive vision. Starting with the well-established market for health record data, he said he expects location data, search history and e-commerce habits will also be ""owned"" by users.  Upon claiming their data property rights, Hu-manity users receive a title of ownership, akin to a property deed. Thereafter their personal details, signature and photograph can be added in the form of a hash on the blockchain, along with things like the individual's data-sharing preferences.  While the Hu-manity.co global consent ledger, which records the granting and revocation of permission to use someone's data, is built on the IBM Blockchain Platform using Hyperledger Fabric, the two companies will also collaborate with Sovrin.  Data: The new oil?  Comparing the personal data humans produce to crude oil, Etwaru told CoinDesk, ""The partnership with IBM enables private blockchain to create a direct relationship between the crude data provider – the human being – and the buyer of the refined data at the end of the supply chain.""  And in its refined form, personal data such as a patient's health record changes hands for an average of around $400, Ewaru pointed out.  Yet regulations in the U.S. and beyond are very unspecific when it comes to personal data and can be interpreted in different ways, noted Etwaru.  Provided data has been masked, an organization may sell it for specific uses, which might often be for research as opposed to overtly commercial purposes. However, there could equally be an interpretation whereby an individual has the right to notify a corporation requesting them not sell data in the de-authorized format.  But wide adoption of an empowering data-sharing app, he said, would constitute a ""call to action, and pool consensus around how laws should actually work,"" Etwaru said.  And it's not only the individual who stands to gain. Rather than walking on eggshells concerning people's growing awareness of their privacy (or lack thereof), Etwaru said, corporations could have clarity and transparency by virtue of what describes as a ""movement.""  ""The end buyer could have better compliance posture if they use our data and we can figure out the economics between the individual and the buyer. The pharmaceutical industry has never really been offered an explicit consenting relationship with individuals before,"" he said.  IBM's Wieck added that large anonymous datasets can be noisy and inaccurate, but could be better relied upon to be clean using the blockchain app.  ""In clinical trials, there would be a way of tracking data and ensuring these are all real human beings and doing it at scale. Trust and transparency have been a challenge up until now,"" she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/06/ibm-makes-another-blockchain-identity-play-with-health-data-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73fc90cc362174c7a6ae1c14eff7d1567aa87d39-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reddit user ""throwaway34034324"" posted a thread on Thursday claiming that the exchange is closing operations in Halifax, Canada, and has ""just laid off hundreds of people in response to a security [breach].""  Another user, ""MysteriousPlankton,"" who is apparently one of the Halifax employees, commented on the thread that they were asked to accept voluntarily resignation with eight weeks' pay as a ""severance package"" or risk being laid off.  They added:  ""Security everywhere, required to hand in door fobs.

The same user also specified that the staff allegedly impacted from back-office operations, including those conducting know-your-customer/anti-money laundering processes, security and investigations, and deposits and withdrawals processing.  ""The layoffs cover just about every aspect of their business,"" they stated.  While Kraken has not yet made any official statement to address the issue, its customer support operation replied to at least two inquiries on Twitter to deny most of the allegations.  ""We can confirm that we are not shutting down any operations in any specific place, and there has been no security breach. Everything is fine & secure,"" the exchange said.  On Twitter, Kraken co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell confirmed that the company had ""laid off about 10 percent of [its] client services team in [a] cost-saving measure,"" but likewise denied that there was any security breach or that hundreds of individuals had been laid off.  Some employees were offered an optional resignation package, he said.  ""No other teams affected, still aggressively hiring globally for all functions,"" he said.

The justice department of Zhongshan says it has launched a blockchain-based system that can monitor the movements of ex-prisoners to improve the quality of so-called ""community correction,"" a local media source reported on Thursday.  The technology has apparently been deployed across various community service centers where parolees are required to check in and complete daily duties.  The department said it developed and applied the blockchain system in an effort to provide up-to-date data on each convict's movements around the clock.  Since convicts' data is updated in a distributed fashion, community correction staff and relevant law enforcement agencies who are given access to the network are able to know a convict's whereabouts at any time, and thus can take necessary measures if one is breaking from the required routine.  The justice department claimed that the technology is able to reduce the manpower burden that is traditionally required to physically follow parolees when ensuring they are obeying laws and performing community service.  The Zhongshan implementation is the latest use case in which blockchain is being adopted in the legal system in China.  As CoinDesk previously reported, an internet court in the city of Hangzhou has already recognized the nascent technology as an authorized way for evidence deposition.

42381137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94CEp,1536220805,How to Make Public Blockchains Safe for Enterprise Use,"Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain. The views expressed are his own.      At the beginning of this year, I wrote a column predicting that companies would find the allure of public blockchains irresistible. While a world of private blockchains provides many enterprises, regulators and central banks with the comfort that there are accountable, centralized entities involved, these permissioned networks will never match the innovation or network effects that public, permissionless networks offer.  If the world of enterprise commerce remains committed to private networks, then they will have only substituted one intermediary (financial institutions) for another (software companies and hosting organizations). However, it is possible, and essential, to bring these two worlds together, and to do so on public, permissionless and decentralized networks.  In order for public networks to deliver on their promise, two key things must happen. First, regulators must provide a clear set of rules around how tokens, assets and smart contracts that exist on public blockchains will be assessed. And second, companies must implement these regulatory rules in the decentralized environment of the public networks.  The first of these is off and running. Regulators in the U.S., Europe and around the world are defining what is an asset, a currency or a security. It shouldn't be expected that all regulators will come to precisely the same conclusions, but it does look like some early convergence is taking place: Utility Settlement Coins are being characterized as securities while cryptocurrencies are being treated more like currencies or assets.  One gap that we regard as particularly important going forward is how tokenized fiat currency will be regulated: If you have a $1 token on a public blockchain, and that is backed by one U.S. dollar in an escrow account, will that be a security or a currency and what rules might apply? So far, no regulator has specifically addressed this emerging category of blockchain tokens.  The second is that whatever the regulatory rules are, they must be implemented in tokens and smart contracts. In particular, it's important that while the blockchain as a whole may be decentralized, a central bank should be able to issue and cancel its own currency on a blockchain and companies should be able to manage their own assets when they are tokenized.  Know your carton?  To illustrate how important this is, let's come back to the question of how companies will do business with each other on public blockchain networks: The exchange of product or asset tokens for money tokens. Once a company starts to tokenize its inventories and assets and use those in contracts and financial services, they are disintermediating traditional financial entities. They are also, consequently, taking on some of the regulatory responsibilities of those intermediaries.  Tokens, if they have value, can be moved around as easily as money, for example. While a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company may never have had cause to think about this before, once they tokenize packages of detergent, those tokens have an effective exchange rate with real money and other goods that makes them perfectly suitable for any kind of deal, legal and otherwise. That means even CPG companies will become responsible for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance.  Is this a deal-breaker for public networks and enterprises? No, it isn't.  One of the great benefits of smart contracts and blockchain tokens is that they are programmable. Going forward, audit, KYC and AML regulations can and will be written into smart contracts and tokens. Combined with exchange controls and other checks, it will be possible to control how and when tokens are used on public blockchains without resorting to the centralization of the blockchain as a whole. This will even include canceling and issuing new tokens to handle theft and loss.  There are, no doubt, many who will mourn the end of public blockchains as systems wholly outside of regulatory control. For blockchains to deliver on their promise, this is inevitable, but how this happens matters a great deal.  If regulatory compliance is delivered through centralization, then there will be a great loss to innovation and we may see the dream of a re-decentralized internet die. I didn't call my original paper on blockchain technology ""Device democracy"" for nothing. It's my dream, too.  There is another option, however: regulatory compliance within a decentralized framework.

42381140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94CJr,1536213615,Coinbase to Offer New Crypto Trading Pairs for British Pounds,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced it will begin rolling out new order book trading pairs for British pounds (GBP) on Sept. 7 for traders based in the U.K.  David Farmer, general manager of Coinbase Pro, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that the order book exchange will offer trading services for GBP against ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic and litecoin, in addition to the current sole offering of bitcoin.  Each new pair will first go through a post-only phase and then a limit-only stage before full trading services can be available, such as limit, market and stop orders. In the post-only phase, he continued, the exchange will only allow users to post limit orders but matching will not be available for at least 10 minutes.  After that, limit orders will start matching but no market orders can be submitted. The limit-only phase will also take another minimum of 10 minutes.  The news follows a report in early August that Coinbase had enabled direct withdrawal and deposit services for GBP for the first time through the UK's Faster Payments Scheme.  That replaced the previous method of having to convert GBP to euro to fund accounts, a process that normally took days to complete via a bank transfer.  The new GBP pairs also arrive months after the U.S. exchange secured an e-money license from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, paving the way for Coinbase to expand its services to the U.K. and Europe.

The Financial Services and Market Authority (FSMA) declared that ""cryptocurrencies are the hype of the year"" in an announcement published on Monday. The FSMA is a public institution that supervises the Belgian financial sector alongside the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).  The regulator said in its missive that would-be investors should beware of would-be fraudsters who are peddling the idea of big profits through crypto-sales that ultimately prove to be fictitious.  The FSMA wrote:  ""Fraudsters are well aware of that, and try to attract customers online through fake cryptocurrencies and huge profits. The only thing they actually do, however, is take the customers' money and disappear. It is as simple as that.""  Officials added a list of 28 trading platforms that they have said are fraudulent in nature, and the agency said that it issued the update ""based solely on the findings of the FSMA, in particular as a result of consumers' reports.""  In February, FSMA issued its first warning on crypto scams, contending that people who trust suspicious-looking websites with their money ""never recover the funds invested"" or ""simply have heard nothing further from the company with which they invested their money.""

Ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to its lowest price since 2017 on Wednesday, a development shared by Cardano, the world's ninth largest by market capitalization.  At 16:00 UTC, during the middle of Wednesday's trading period, the cryptocurrency ether dropped to $211 for the first time since July 30, 2017, while Cardano dropped to levels not seen since last year according to CoinDesk price data.

At press time, ether is one of the biggest losers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is reporting a 7-day loss of 20.06 percent.
