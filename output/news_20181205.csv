42381382,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95QxZ,1544045418,"Indian State to Boost Local Blockchain Ecosystem With Mentorships, Events","The Indian state government of Andhra Pradesh wants to build a community of blockchain startups in the region.  The Andhra Pradesh Innovation Society (APIS) announced Wednesday that it was partnering with the Eleven01 Foundation to develop a blockchain talent pool and support startups building with the nascent technology.  Eleven01 is a local provider of native blockchain protocols.  APIS is tasked with developing ""an exceptional technology startup ecosystem,"" according to a press release. As such, the partnership is aimed at using events, activities and mentorship programs to ""nurture talent and develop a community"" of startups within the state.  In a statement, J.A. Chowdary, IT advisor and special chief secretary to the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, said ""we truly appreciate what the Eleven01 team is trying to do and we are happy to associate with them to bring advanced development and innovations with regard to the blockchain realm in the state.""  Eleven01 Foundation’s president & chief product officer, Ramachandran Iyer, echoed Chowdary's comments, saying:  ""We visualize India to be a blockchain-hub and the support from the state here brings us a step closer to achieving that. Together, we will contribute towards the development of the best blockchain-ready talent pool and innovations in the state.""  Eleven01’s blockchain protocol was built in association with Indian IT services giant Tech Mahindra. The platform was announced back in August, and aimed at strengthening the blockchain ecosystem in the country.  Wednesday's move is just the latest blockchain-focused effort by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Earlier this year, the state signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Covalent Fund to start a blockchain ecosystem, as well as launch a blockchain university with a $10 million initial investment.  In October last year, the state was also working with startup ChromaWay on a land registry pilot that uses blockchain to track the ownership of property.

42381375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95Qtn,1544044803,Crypto Unicorn Coinbase Is Planning a Year-Long Identity Experiment,"One of the crypto industry’s biggest players is experimenting with ways to give its users more control of their personal information.  Crypto exchange turned corporate unicorn Coinbase has a 17-person team currently exploring decentralized identity solutions. B Byrne, the product manager of Coinbase’s identity team, told CoinDesk he wants to “help people own more of who they are online.”  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Byrne’s approach relies on creating bridges between Coinbase products, such as its mobile wallet, with a built-in decentralized application (dapp) explorer. He explained:  “I’m looking at dapps, and which of our customers are using which dapps. That’s probably a good indicator of what types of activities [our customers] want to be doing in an on-chain way.”  In Byrne’s mind, the best way to start lies in identifying a small segment of Coinbase users who would gain real value from controlling more of their personal data, rather than Coinbase repeatedly collecting and storing their know-your-customer (KYC) information across the platform’s products.  Over the next 12 months, Byrne said his team aims to scale these experiments from just a few users to a “meaningful group” of dapp users. In addition to tech-savvy power users, Byrne said identity solutions could have the most immediate impact for customers that “aren’t getting access to things because it’s too hard as is.”  Byrne added:  “We think it’s an important part of our future and we’re thinking about the tools we need to ship for that.”  As such, Byrne said his team is talking with projects like the W3C Credentials Community Group. W3C member and crypto veteran Christopher Allen told CoinDesk the group aims to launch a Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Working Group in January that can recommend standards through the Massachusetts-based World Wide Web Consortium.  Although Allen is urging companies like Coinbase to take a more active role in these standards-building efforts – arguing that at least 5 percent of a tech corporation’s budget should be devoted to community contributions – Byrne said Coinbase is hesitant because such efforts are still too academic and might distract from the daily priorities of serving customers.  Indeed, Coinbase’s VP of corporate and business development, Emilie Choi, told CoinDesk there aren’t plans so far to delegate a portion of the $300 million Series E that Coinbase raised in October to the identities team or related community projects – aside from perhaps hiring at least three more digital identity experts.  Joseph Weinberg, chairman of the data network Shyft, told CoinDesk that the whole industry needs to “figure out and formalize better ways” to standardize development models related to digital identities. Shyft is already working with government entities in Bermuda and Mauritius to test data-sharing and privacy technologies.  “You need to also focus on the governance part [of development] because these are systems that people work with,” Weinberg said. “That’s the problem that we’re not so good at in our space.”  Experimentation mode  By starting with a few Coinbase Wallet users, Byrne’s team hopes to find niche groups that could benefit from partially decentralized identity solutions in specific, regulator-friendly contexts. The operative word here is “partially.”  “We want to protect [Coinbase] users and make sure it’s really safe,” Byrne said. “I spend time thinking about the Social Security Administration or the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles], because they are the purveyors of so much identity today.”  Based on his own experiences building international and compliant privacy solutions, Shyft’s Weinberg told CoinDesk he doesn’t think decentralized identity solutions will ever allow crypto exchange users to control all their own data.  Regardless, Weinberg said companies can cooperate to give users the right to choose how data sharing happens. He added:  “I have no problem paying for a service where I know how [identity data] is being used.""  When it comes to building such systems, Allen, the W3C co-founder, emphasized the importance of distinguishing authentication – “the relationship between the digital data and a real person” – from authorization – “the ability to do different types of things,"" such as buying securities.  Coinbase’s Byrne generally agreed with this distinction, adding “at this point, it doesn’t feel like there’s a clear standard that we’ve agreed on that solves a problem.” He said it would be a steep commitment for Coinbase to be involved with each group that is currently working on its own identity standards.  However, in Weinberg’s mind, collaboration could actually make it easier for companies to expand services across jurisdictions, which is a priority for Coinbase.  For example, if the crypto exchange Kraken was already operating in one Caribbean country, then if companies like Coinbase entered the region they could simply query the international ID network for overlapping data instead of on-boarding users all over again.  It takes a village  Even if Byrne's team develops identity solutions that reduce cross-platform friction or increase customers’ privacy, these solutions will probably rely on public tools and protocols that exist beyond Coinbase.  “It’s not a zero sum game at this point,” Byrne said. “Whatever standards we agree on, upkeep will be critical.”  To underscore this same point, Allen mentioned the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability that impacted several types of open-source software in 2014. That ripple effect across the tech industry started because just one person was updating the OpenSSL code years after its initial creation. A critical bug eventually crept in.  “I don’t want to see that problem replicated in the bitcoin world,” Allen said. “I would like it for customers to say: I don’t want to hire a qualified custodian unless you’re contributing to the commons.”  Plus, Allen said, official working groups like the one that his W3C community project aims to become, can create international standards that are referenced as an authority by regulators and technologists alike.  Without commenting on any specific resources or priorities, Byrne agreed Coinbase would need to commit to keeping the infrastructure for future solutions “healthy.” Byrne also expressed curiosity about how Coinbase could someday take a more active role in community efforts.  “A failure mode of past identity thinking has been trying to win it and own everybody’s identity completely as opposed to working in standardized ways that decentralize and distribute out that power,” Byrne said, adding:  “Everybody is still just getting started.”  Colored pencils image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/05/crypto-unicorn-coinbase-is-planning-a-year-long-identity-experiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87364cf0cc5f1ae2ac0587b49b0d3ed6557df1e9-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95RDv,1544034876,Coinbase Adds Zcash to Retail Crypto Trading Service,"Less than a week after adding privacy-focused zcash to its professional trading platform, crypto exchange Coinbase is opening trading to its retail customers.  The company announced Wednesday that clients using coinbase.com or the Android and iOS apps can buy, sell, send, receive or store zcash, though residents in the United Kingdom and the U.S. state of New York will not immediately have access to these services.  The move comes on the heels of Coinbase Pro adding support for zcash last week. At the time, the platform announced that only residents in the U.S. (excluding New York), UK, European Union, Canada, Singapore and Australia would be able to access the coin.  Coinbase's blog post announcing the listing of zcash included information about its privacy features, notably mentioning that users can send either ""transparent"" or ""shielded"" transactions.  ""The unencrypted/transparent version of the protocol allows third parties to see metadata associated with the communication or transaction, while the encrypted/shielded version protects this information,"" the post noted (it highlighted similar information in last week's post).  As with Coinbase Pro, Coinbase will not be supporting sending transactions to shielded addresses at this time, though customers can send both types of transactions to the exchange.  The exchange has now listed three of five tokens it first hinted at in July, including the Basic Attention Token and the 0x Protocol token. It has yet to add support for the other two tokens, Cardano and Stellar lumens.  Brief boost  While the ""Coinbase effect"" resulted in zcash's price rising 15 percent last week after Coinbase Pro announced support, Wednesday did not see such a boost.  Data from CoinDesk's Crypto-Economics Explorer shows that the coin's price jumped 4 percent briefly to reach a 24-hour high of $75.27.

More than 50 ventures currently exist under the ConsenSys umbrella, and the firm's recent investments include a stake in the crypto trading platform ErisX alongside big-name companies like Fidelity and Nasdaq.  Yet the move comes as the price of ether (ETH) languishes around $100, down from the all-time high over $1,400 that was hit early this year (Lubin, an ethereum co-founder, is said to hold vast reserves of ETH). Other startups in recent weeks have cited the crypto bear market for major layoffs and downsizing, with such developments often framed as necessary belt-tightening in the aftermath of this year's market boom and subsequent decline.  When asked about potential layoffs stemming from the announced reforms, Lubin told CoinDesk:  “We are looking at lots of different situations – some of them will shrink, some of them will grow. There’s nothing I want to say concretely about that at this point.”  Whereas previously “it was good enough to do cool projects,” Lubin said, ConsenSys 2.0 will be different: “We are going to focus much more rigorously across the different business lines on accountability, that includes financial sustainability,"" he told CoinDesk.  As the letter explained:  ""We will more quickly declare projects a ‘learning success’ and disband them, enabling their elements – technology, technologists, and entrepreneurs – to diffuse back into the sea of potentiality and reconstitute into another project with the benefit of greater experience.""  “It recognizes that we’re in a new regime,” Lubin said of the letter.  Lubin says the company has been interacting much more with external investors over the last year in a bid to ""open up"" funding opportunities for ConsenSys-supported ventures. That push will continue.  “Certainly one goal is to enable ConsenSys and its projects to not be dependent on the price of these value tokens, that essentially they are all thriving businesses in their own right,” Lubin said.  As protracted market lows change the calculus for many players in the crypto space, Friday's letter captures how one prominent company is adjusting to new realities. The big-picture goals remain the same, Lubin says, but the strategy for getting there must evolve in order for ConsenSys to succeed in the long-term.  “We’ve definitely been more focused on doing cool things in the past, and now we’re just focused on being a set of viable and successful businesses in a real business ecosystem,"" he said, adding:  ""Blockchain is getting very, very real. It’s about the maturation of the company.”  Photo by Michael del Castillo",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/05/lubin-wont-rule-out-layoffs-amid-refocusing-at-consensys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bfc80e51a43b9b2196471b18ab2e58d47feb586-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The declaration was signed in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 4.  Blockchain can be a “game changer” in increasing the efficiency and transparency of government services, from education and healthcare to transport and customs, the group said in the document. It can further enhance services for citizens, bringing "" accountability and privacy for the end-users.""  “This can result not only in the enhancement of e-government services but also increased transparency and reduced administrative burdens, better customs collection and better access to public information” the declaration states.  It further addresses future regulation in the economic bloc, saying:  ""We believe that any legislation on Distributed Ledger Technologies should take into account the decentralized nature of such technology and should be based on European fundamental principles and technological neutrality. It should also allow innovation and experimentations in order for the public and private sector to better understand the Distributed Ledger Technologies and to develop usecases""  Silvio Schembri, Malta's parliamentary secretary for digital economy, financial services and innovation, tweeted on Tuesday, stating he is “proud” to see Malta, the smallest nation in the EU, taking a ""leading role"" on blockchain cooperation.  ‏  Malta has already taken several initiatives toward becoming a self-titled “Blockchain Island.” Back in June, the nation’s parliament passed three cryptocurrency and blockchain related bills, and have since been attracting notable crypto businesses to set up shop.  While the EU has not yet moved to regulate blockchain technology across the region, it has launched initiatives aimed to investigate and trial the tech.  Most recently, in late November, the European Commission announced the launch of a new blockchain association with five major banks on board, including Spain's BBVA.

R3 said XRP is the first globally recognized cryptocurrency to be supported by Settler, bringing the Corda and XRP ecosystems into closer alignment – something of a rapprochement considering Ripple and R3 were previously locked in a legal dispute.  “The deployment of the Corda Settler and its support for XRP as the first settlement mechanism is an important step in showing how the powerful ecosystems cultivated by two of the of the world’s most influential crypto and blockchain communities can work together,” said Richard Gendal Brown, CTO at R3, adding:  “While the Settler will be open to all forms of crypto and traditional assets, this demonstration with XRP is the next logical step in showing how widespread acceptance and use of digital assets to transfer value and make payments can be achieved.”  The Corda Settler is an open source CorDapp that allows payment obligations arising on the Corda network to be settled via any parallel rail supporting cryptocurrencies or other crypto assets, and any traditional rail capable of providing cryptographic proof of settlement.  The app will verify that the beneficiary’s account was credited with the expected payment, automatically updating the Corda ledger. In the next phase of development, the Settler will support domestic deferred net settlement and real-time gross settlement payments.  When a payment obligation arises on Corda during the course of business, one party now has the option to request settlement using XRP, said R3. The other party can be notified that settlement in XRP has been requested and that they must instruct a payment to the required address before the specified deadline. Once an oracle service validates the payment has been made then both parties can treat the obligation as settled.  R3’s Corda platform has taken some bold steps to build its ecosystem while also building bridges between the private enterprise blockchain world and the public domain, with tokenisation of assets being added earlier this year with Cordite.

42381379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95Qyp,1544014851,Aion Token Project Estimates 18-Month Runway After Bitcoin and Ether Sales,"Cash is king – especially during a crypto winter.  That's the takeaway from a report out Wednesday from the Aion Foundation, which raised $23 million worth of bitcoin, ether and fiat through a token sale in October 2017. Compiled with the help of Deloitte, though not formally audited by the Big Four accounting firm, the report details how Aion has been managing its crypto war chest, providing a rare level of transparency for a token project.  According to Aion Foundation CEO Matt Spoke, the foundation has sold off half of the bitcoin and ether it raised for fiat. The sales were well-timed to take advantage of the gains in crypto prices through the beginning of 2018.  Even after spending more than $10 million launching its unique blockchain platform and opening offices in Canada, Barbados, and China, the nonprofit had $14 million left as of October 31 of this year, $5.8 million of it in fiat, the report shows.  “We’ve liquidated a decent amount of our bitcoin and eth that we raised as proceeds to make sure that we are stable in this type of period,” Spoke told CoinDesk, adding:  ""As we continue to spend in our operations we'll end up liquidating more bitcoin and eth over the course of the next few months""  The Aion protocol already has active users such as the video game startup ClanPlay experimenting with how this network could support applications, Spoke said, but for now the nonprofit will “lean more heavily on cash"" to fund its growth.  The foundation has roughly 18 months of runway, Spoke estimated, and it will take up to five years for the network to offer services comparable to centralized alternatives like Amazon Web Services. in addition to currently supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Aion is scheduled to support its own Aion Virtual Machine, so developers can use can use Java tools to build decentralized software by Q2 2019.  In the meantime, Spoke said his team might seek additional funding from crypto funds and accredited investors in return for Aion tokens.  The goal is to avoid layoffs for the foundation’s 61-person team by modeling itself somewhat like the ethereum-centric conglomerate ConsenSys, led by Joseph Lubin, in that the foundation would sponsor projects across the network.  Going forward, the foundation will publish quarterly updates and annual reports and participate in the Messari disclosure database to boost token holders’ confidence.  Risks ahead  Aion tokens are currently traded on more than two dozen exchanges, including large ones such as Binance and Bitfinex, according to CoinMarketCap.  Despite that apparent liquidity, Meltem Demirors, founder of Shiny Pony Ventures and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, expressed concern that the foundation listed its holdings of Aion tokens as assets on its balance sheet.  “I think they should be really careful about that,” Demirors said. “I don’t think that we’ve definitely proven the token model works.”  Both she and Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures, warned against viewing token treasuries as a substitute for traditional equity investments or employee stock options.  “You have to pay progressively more of that stack as it declines in price and you become a forced seller at certain points,” Carter said. “A lot of these projects are going to face liquidity crises.”  Nevertheless, Demirors gave Aion credit for making the disclosures. “They are trying to bring transparency and accountability to how they are spending money. That’s good,” she said.  There are other risks as well. Regulators have forced some crypto startups to refund tokens to buyers, a task that would prove challenging for the Aion Foundation since Spoke said it only has records of accredited investors who participated in the private pre-sale before its public token sale.  Looking ahead, the foundation is focused on amping up the platform’s utility.  “Our grant and bounty program has been very active and focused heavily on tooling,” Spoke said, speaking to how it rewards external developers with Aion tokens for creating software tools for its platform. “Over time we should not be the most important member [of the Aion ecosystem].”  UPDATE (December 6, 17:00 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that part of the $23 million Aion raised last year was in fiat.

42381390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95RBP,1544011239,"Blockchain 'Radically Simplifies' KYC, Say UAE Trial Participants","Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial free zone within the United Arab Emirates, says it has successfully completed the trial of a blockchain-based know-your-customer (KYC) application.  ADGM announced Tuesday that the first phase the project has been concluded in association with its regulatory body, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), and project advisor KPMG.  The KYC app provides financial institutions with a single location where customer identification and verification can be performed once for a customer, rather than multiple times by different entities for the same customer, ADGM explained. Key features of the app, it adds, are an unalterable audit trail, secure data sharing, compliance with the EU's GDPR data privacy rules, interoperability with third-party systems and customer consent.  The trial found that the KYC process, which is currently “cumbersome, repetitive and cost intensive,” can be ""radically simplified"" using distributed blockchain tech. Institutions were able to “successfully” share and validate KYC documentation and data updates about their clients on the prototype in a “secure” environment,” ADGM said.  “By harnessing the power of technologies such as blockchain, the e-KYC project has demonstrated tangible benefits that may be offered by an e-KYC utility for financial institutions in the UAE,” said Richard Teng, CEO of ADGM’s FSRA unit.  He added:  “In addition to enhancing KYC checks across the industry, the utility can achieve significant cost efficiencies and financial inclusion driven by unified KYC standards.”  The project was first launched in February of this year for a consortium of major UAE-based financial institutions, including Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank and more.  The FSRA is now planning a second phase of the KYC project in a bid to ease access to banking services for small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Other notable financial institutions around the world are also looking to build blockchain-based KYC systems. Back in June, a group of 39 banks and regulators, including BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, conducted a trial of a KYC compliance application built upon R3’s Corda blockchain platform.

42430008,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Rh,1544007661,Bitcoin Price On Track for Biggest Yearly Loss on Record,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent drop to 14-month lows has left the cryptocurrency on track for its biggest ever yearly loss.  Just three weeks ago, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $6,300 – already a 54 percent year-to-date drop, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The dominant market narrative back then was that BTC would trim losses in the last few weeks of 2018, having bottomed out around $6,000 in five months to October.  However, on Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, prices ultimately dropped to 14-month lows below $3,500 on Nov. 25 before regaining some poise.  With the bears still keeping the upper hand, a significant recovery from current levels appears unlikely before year's end, and BTC looks set to snap its three-year winning streak with a 73 percent annual price drop – its biggest on record.  As seen in the table above, BTC's only previous annual loss was a 57 percent drop in 2014. This year’s loss would be the biggest on record as long as prices hold below $5,959.  Meanwhile, the technical charts indicate that the cryptocurrency may extend the loss further before the year's end.  Weekly chart  As seen above (price data via Bitstamp), BTC has found acceptance below the crucial support of the 200-week EMA, bolstering the already bearish technical set-up represented by the descending triangle breakdown, confirmed two weeks ago.  4-hour chart  The stacking order of the 50-candle EMA, below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA is also a classic bear indicator.  BTC, therefore, risks re-testing the recent low of $3.474 in the next few days.  View  Bitcoin is on track to post its biggest annual price drop on record. That would change only if prices rise above $5,959.  The symmetrical triangle breakdown seen in the 4-hour chart favors a drop to $3,474 (Nov. 25 low). Acceptance below that level would further strengthen the bear grip and open up downside toward the psychological support of $3,000.  A short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed only above $4,400 (Nov. 29 high).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42430000,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Hh,1544004044,A Top-5 US Hospital Is Exploring Blockchain for Patient Data,"Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), one of the top-five hospitals in the US, are collaborating with Korean blockchain startup MediBloc in an effort to find better ways to store and share patient data.  Synho Do, director of the Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation by MGH and Harvard Medical School, told CoinDesk that the laboratory is expanding research in a range of areas “from medical image analysis to health information exchange by leveraging our cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and machine learning.”  Regarding this specific initiative, Do added:  “In collaboration with Medibloc, we aim to explore potentials of blockchain technology to provide secure solutions for health information exchange, integrate healthcare AI applications into the day-to-day clinical workflow, and support [a] data sharing and labeling platform for machine learning model development.""  Through a spokesperson, Do later emphasized that the hospital isn’t using any real patient data for its research but rather simulated data.  The trouble with patient data is that multiple entities – hospitals, research bodies, insurance and pharmaceutical companies – need the information about those that are receiving medical help. But currently, they're all keeping their own data that can’t be shared securely and often is in various incompatible formats.  “Every day, when people go to hospitals, lots of information is created, but it’s difficult to transfer it from one hospital to another,” Allen Wookyun Kho, MediBloc’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.  He added that MediBloc is not only developing a distributed ledger for storing and sharing medical data, but also working on a tool that would convert data now held by hospitals from existing formats to a universal one.  A range of blockchain startups have been working on enabling fast and secure transmission of healthcare data. But team-ups with actual major medical institutions such as the lab at MGH – which U.S. News and World Report ranked No.4 in the country in its most recent annual survey – are rare.  The reason they are rare is that to share the data, hospitals need full access to it from IT vendors designing data systems for them, said Kamran Khan, CEO of blockchain startup Translo, which also is working on a system for health data within Harvard Innovation Labs.  The vendors, in turn, are not motivated to let this information out of the silos they designed, which is why hospitals have different electronic healthcare systems with different codes, and even within one hospital, there can be several systems for different kind of diseases.  Khan told CoinDesk:  “Even in Boston, there are 27 different systems for only 17 hospitals, and they lack interoperability. This is done on purpose: once the data is out of the siloed system, the hospital can create their own system.”  This is why, to create a new system, a hospital needs to persuade its vendor to provide full access to the data in the existing one and to be really convinced itself that the new system will benefit the institution.  Partners across Asia  MediBloc, however, has had notable success in getting partners, at least in Asia; according to Kho, now eight medical institutions across the region and 14 tech companies, including Deloitte Anjin LLC, Deloitte’s Korean branch, have signed up to test MediBloc’s system.  Dawn Lee, the startup’s business development manager, told CoinDesk that the company got the South Korean government’s attention as one of the first blockchain companies to run an initial coin offering (ICO) in Korea, in December 2017.  This, and the fact that MediBloc’s founders, Kho and Eunsol Lee, are doctors, helped to develop relationships with government officials and actual hospitals.  As a result, it was selected as a provider of blockchain technology for two government-funded projects, with Bundang Seoul National University and Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Lee said.  That record of working with big medical institutions led the Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation to approach MediBloc, she said. “The MGH Lab came across our company, we started talking in early spring, signed a deal in summer and we’ve just started the research.""  MediBloc's main focus now is building an ecosystem upon which other startups can build their apps for various ways to use and exchange health data.  A testing environment version of the blockchain was launched in August, the network is expected to go live before the end of the year and become fully functional in the second quarter of 2019, Kho said. MediBloc’s public blockchain will use the delegated proof of stake consensus method and is currently relying on 10 nodes — on the mainnet, the number will be 21, Kho said.  There are also apps in the works by MediBloc planned to go live in the first half of 2019. One of them, currently in a beta testing phase with 300 users, is designed for patients to sell the information about their symptoms and the prescriptions they get to MediBloc. After that MediBloc will analyze that data and sell the analysis to pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  In the future, users will be able to sell or share their data directly to the buyers, without MediBloc as an intermediary, Kho told CoinDesk.  The main goal of this all is to let patients independently decide what to do with their information.  “We make patients the mediums of their own data,"" Lee concluded.

""User funds on the DEX will be secured with decentralized wallet applications like Trust Wallet, which has a server-free infrastructure that stores private keys only on the user’s device, meaning only users have access to their funds,"" Binance said in a statement on Wednesday.  Binance DEX is built on its own Binance Chain, which was first unveiled in March of this year and is aimed to offer ""low latency, high throughput trading, as well as decentralized custody of funds.""  With the DEX, traders will be able to send and receive Binance's own BNB tokens and other coins via trading pairs, Binance said, adding that while BNB is currently an ERC-20 token, it will soon be migrated to Binance Chain upon its mainnet launch.  The first video demo of Binance DEX was released in August, which outlined via a command line interface the basics of issuing, listing and trading crypto assets.  In June, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi also announced a plan to evolve into a standalone decentralized exchange, offering funding for developer assistance in creating an open-sourced blockchain protocol.

42429999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Fh,1543986039,The Race Is On to Replace Ethereum’s Most Centralized Layer,"“If we don't stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed.”  That’s how Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity Ethereum client, described one of ethereum’s most popular – and controversial – technologies on Twitter in October.  Infura handles around 13 billion code request per day and provides a way for developers to connect to ethereum without having to run a full node. And while the exact usage stats aren’t public, by creating a simpler method for interfacing with the network, it’s said to underpin the majority of decentralized applications in the ethereum ecosystem.  But here's the thing: Infura is operated by a single provider – the ethereum development studio ConsenSys – and relies on cloud servers hosted by Amazon. As such, concerns exist that the service represents a single point of failure for the entire network.  “If every single dapp in the world is pointed to Infura, and we decided to turn that off, then we could, and the dapps would stop working. That’s the concern and that’s a valid concern,” Michael Wuehler, the co-founder of Infura, told CoinDesk in an interview.  While many of the projects recognize the importance of Infura’s contribution to ethereum – referring to the service as a pillar that holds up the developer community today – many, like Schoedon, feel that steps must be taken to seek a decentralized alternative.  “There is no point in having dapps connecting through Metamask to a blockchain hosted by someone else,” Schoedon tweeted.  And Schoedon isn’t alone in his interpretation. Rather, he’s met by a host of new efforts to dethrone Infura as the go-to connection point for developers linking their decentralized applications to ethereum.  For example, new full node incentivizations schemes like VIP node, Dappnode and DeNode seek to provide different kinds of alternatives.  Equally, infrastructure minimizing efforts such as light clients are gaining traction, as well as experimental software restructuring like Turbo Geth. And according to developers, what’s at stake is the very decentralization of the ethereum ecosystem itself.  “One of the issues that we’re facing in the space today is that decentralized application development is happening through centralized services,” Yalor Mewn, communications officer for Dappnode, a node incentivization scheme, told CoinDesk, adding:  “We are building all of this infrastructure on top of a bottleneck.”  An imperfect tool  Currently, there’s a total of 11,803 ethereum full nodes according to available data.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Wuehler said Infura accounts for somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the nodes. Yet because the Infura nodes are highly reliable – under 24 hour maintenance – they’re accounting for a disproportionate amount of traffic.  “[We’re] effectively supporting the entire ethereum dapp ecosystem with the RPC traffic,” Wuehler said.  And that’s partially because, as of the time of writing, a full archive node is said to take over 1 terabyte of data – beyond what a conventional laptop can store. For developers, as well as users, this means that the storage requirements are frequently outsourced to companies that have the means to manage that kind of infrastructure.  “The way Infura works is they host their own full nodes and they open up an [interface] to allow you to easily access those full nodes,” Aidan Hyman, CEO and co-founder of ethereum research and development startup Chainsafe, told CoinDesk.  For example, developers frequently opt for Infura as a way to focus their efforts on software, while users are often drawn to in-browser tool Metamask to hold their cryptocurrency. And both route through the ConsenSys full nodes.  ""Any dapp that uses Metamask also inherently depends on Infura (knowingly, or not). In that sense, nearly all dapps potentially depend on Infura,” Wuehler told CoinDesk.  The impact of this is that developers and users are less likely to run full nodes, meaning that the number of full nodes supporting the network decline. As the risk that Infura might become a single point of failure, there are other repercussions to a lack of full nodes as well.  Running a full node, for example, allows users and developers to keep much of their sensitive activity local, while Infura accumulates combinations of data from its users such as wallet address and IP locations.  “Privacy is an issue,” 'Dapplion,' the pseudonymous developer behind Infura replacement project Dappnode, told CoinDesk, adding:  “And Infura is hosted on Amazon. So what if Amazon says ‘You know what? Infura no more, just fuck off.’ Most of the dapps would be unusable.”  True decentralization  As such, several efforts are trying to find a viable and usable alternative.  For example, Parity Technologies has released a new code library for light client development, dubbed LightJS. Parity hopes that it will encourage developers to build light clients rather than relying on Infura as a service.  And that’s because, while they promise to be much less hardware and storage intensive, light clients are intended to maintain the same degree as decentralization as running a full node.  “Ideally, what we will see is less and less dapps connecting to Infura, and they will use a light client instead to achieve true decentralization,” Parity developer Amaury Martiny told CoinDesk.  The Turbo Geth project by Alexey Akhunov also seeks to completely restructure how ethereum software clients handle storage. In the latest version of the software rewrite, he’s decreased the storage requirements down to a fifth of its current size.  And several projects, such as Dappnode, Denode, and VIP node, target the underlying incentive layer to encourage more people to run a full node. And that’s because currently, unlike the miners that secure transactions on ethereum, full nodes are not rewarded in any way.  But VIP node, working on a grant that has been given by the Ethereum Foundation, uses the identifier with which full nodes connect to ethereum to dole out rewards to nodes that are online, that are paid through a subscription from developers wishing to use the service.  Another project, named DeNode, also creates a market between developers and node operators, but tries to decentralize the economic relationship between those actors as well.  To do this, DeNode uses a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. An initiative by Toronto-based startup Chainsafe, Denode was conceived in May at ethereum hackathon ETH Buenos Aires and is funded through a grant by the Ethereum Community Fund.  “The idea that we can build these structures in a decentralized way that allows for the democratization of power dynamics in economic systems,” said Hyman.  Finally, Dappnode, founded by blockchain developer Jordi Baylina, takes a different approach by allowing developers to set up a local network that is designed in such the way that it is easy to engage in dapp deployment.  “Someone sets it up the Dappnode and gives access to his family, his friends, a trusted circle of person-to-person connections that you have a trust bond. And then just with a couple clicks, as hard as it is to connect to Infura, you will connect to Dappnode,” leading developer Dapplion told CoinDesk.  On the horizon  Several of these projects – such as VIP node and Turbo Geth – also receive funding from Infura itself.  One of ethereum’s largest startups – the company behind Infura – Consensys is also funding a project, named Incubator, by which is trying to reduce Metamask dependance on Infura on its gateway to ethereum. Infura itself is also trying to diversify the number of cloud providers it relies on, so that it’s not purely reliant on Amazon, according to Wuehler.  “Our efforts are mainly about continually trying to push more and more decentralization into the way that our technology stack is delivered,” he told CoinDesk.  According to Wuehler, Infura’s popularity is due to a quirk inside the ethereum platform itself. And that’s because, by combining the functionality of bitcoin’s blockchain with a virtual machine that can execute decentralized applications, ethereum generates a wider range of data than simply transactions.  For example, as well as relying on a blockchain, ethereum stores what is known as the “state,” which is the sum of all computation on the platform. And as the quantity of ethereum users continue to grow, the size of the state keeps expanding as well.  The end result of this is that, as hardware gets increasingly more expensive and complex to operate – and due to ethereum’s underlying design – incentives aren’t in place to encourage people to do this.  “We didn’t create the problem, we are just a Band-Aid on the problem. We are just providing a solution that is needed,” Wuehler said.  Looking ahead, there's work being done by ethereum researchers such as founder Vitalik Buterin to find a way to rewrite the underlying incentives so that full nodes can be rewarded for storing data, or what is commonly referred to as “rent.”  Such a change is now being considered for inclusion in a proposed upgrade named ""ethereum 1x."" Currently targeted for 2019, in the interim, developers are focused on finding solutions that can be deployed immediately.  As Hyman from Denode told CoinDesk:  “Though we are working as a community on these long term goals we also have to be pragmatic and focus on the present. This is a problem that exists right now and has persisted in the space.”  Correction: A former version of this article misspelled Denode as ""D-node.""
