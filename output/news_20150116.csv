42377935,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVhT,1421441144,Bitso Extends Bitcoin E-Commerce Services to Mexico's Merchants,"Bitso has launched its e-commerce platform and point-of-sale (POS) system, BitsoPagos, positioning itself as a more wide-ranging provider of bitcoin services in the Mexican market.  The merchant solution includes an API for e-commerce companies that want to integrate a shopping cart interface, enabling customers to pay with bitcoin at checkout as quickly and easily as they could with traditional payments options like MasterCard, PayPal and Visa.  “While we still cater to traders, it just makes sense to plug BitsoPagos into the same market and attract Mexican merchants,” said chief executive Pablo Gonzalez, who added that a number of merchants interested in accepting bitcoin have approached Bitso in the last year.  Both the BitsoPagos cashier and e-commerce tools connect into the Bitso exchange market. There are no merchant fees required to use the service.  “There hasn’t been a service that allows them to accept bitcoin and quickly convert them to Mexican Pesos,” he continued. “We settle fiat with Mexican traders in minutes using the SPEI systemhttp://www.banxico.org.mx/sistemas-de-pago/servicios/sistema-de-pagos-electronicos-interbancarios-spei/interbanking-electronic-payme.html. We can do it with merchants as well.”  The offering also includes a POS product for high-street retail shops and boutiques. Both the cashier and e-commerce tools connect into the Bitso exchange market.  Focus on e-commerce  While Bitso has a number of merchants already signed up and using the POS system, the company is more excited about the potential its e-commerce plugin will have for the global bitcoin economy.  ""The brick-and-mortar solution is great for users that already have some bitcoin and want to spend it somewhere,"" said Gonzalez. ""It is as convenient as using cash when making a payment; it is also great advertising for bitcoin.""  However, he continued, e-commerce opens doors to international trade without the merchant and consumer risks posed by credit cards – chargeback fees and fraud, among others.  The BitsoPagos settlement feedback is instant, he said, something that credit card processors like Mexico’s Prosahttp://www.procesos.com.mx/prosa/prosa.asp can’t match at the time being.  To that, he spoke about the possibilities of real-time bill payments – and considering the US-to-Mexico remittance corridor, cross-border bill payments.  “A person in Mexico could go to the supermarket to buy groceries and have a relative in the US pay for the bill while the person in Mexico is at the cashier,” he said. “You just need to notify the sender of the bitcoin address and amount, which the payment app gives you.”  Developing an ecosystem  Bitso is betting big on bitcoin going mainstream in Mexico, Gonzalez said, and will continue to encourage that trend however it can.  “It’s all about developing the entire ecosystem, not just about getting speculators on board,” he said.  The company launched its exchange last April, with features designed specifically for locals.  It has since implemented a number of initiatives for users across Mexico, launched the country's first and only Ripple gateway, and extended its bitcoin buying services to mobile phone users.

42377928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVYf,1421435437,Bitcoin Miner ZeusHash Faces Cloud Service Shutdown,"ZeusHash, the cloud mining service operated by mining hardware company ZeusMiner, has announced that it may be forced to shut down its bitcoin cloud mining operations.  The news comes weeks after ZeusHash announced that it would suspend its scrypt cloud mining offering due to unprofitability. In a message dated 15th January, the service said that bitcoin cloud mining contracts would be frozen after 10 days of unprofitability, in accordance with its terms of service.  The company also advised customers against purchasing additional mining contracts, stating that “it’s not the best time for investment”.  CEO Terry Li told CoinDesk that the risk of unprofitability means that the company may have no alternative but to power down their mining operations, noting:  “I don't know if there are many platforms [that are going to] be left on the play field. I'm sure that suppliers like us backed up by real hashing power would be running out of juice pretty soon. All contracts will be frozen within [a] short time if price keeps dropping.”  ZeusHash is not the only cloud mining operator to experience problems as a result of the recent drop in the price of bitcoin. On 12th January, UK-based mining pool and crypto exchange operator CEX.io announced it would suspend its cloud mining service owing to third-party issues, and companies like Bitmain – which operates the HashNest service – have powered down less efficient models amid current conditions.  Zeus points to shifting mining climate  Like other cloud mining operators, ZeusHash suggested that shifting winds in the cryptocurrency market have left it in a vulnerable position. Li also cited “speculators” that are less supportive of new technology and more interested, he said, in generating profits.  “In merely one year, you can see the crypto community is filled with speculators rather than people supporting the underlying technology and methodology,” Li told CoinDesk.  He continued:  “This is sad. On one end the technology supports decentralisation, but on the other it's centralised by people building faster chips and larger farms.”  In its statement, the company left the door open to a possible path forward, citing negotiations with third parties on cost-reduction measures. As it stands, ZeusHash customers are seeing the majority of their payouts reduced by high maintenance fees.  The full statement from ZeusHash can be found below:    Dear ZeusHash customers,      As Bitcoin price witnessed significant and continuous dropping lately, the daily payouts of GHS will not be able to cover maintenance fees (now at $0.0023 per GHS per day) very soon. As you can see the payouts today have already been eaten up by 98%+ of maintenance fees.    According to our Terms, “in case the daily mining return is lower than the maintenance fee for at least 10 days in a row”, we’ll have to cease the operation of our mining farms and freeze all GHS contracts, which is a forced measure when there’s no mining profitability.    We’d like to warn you not to purchase more GHS as it’s not the best time for investment. And we are working on different plans for your profits when the conditions for freezing GHS contracts are met. The final solution will be released then.    As a dedicated cloud mining platform, ZeusHash will continue its efforts to seek for better solutions to deliver more cost-efficient cloud mining contracts. Negotiations with our partners are going on smoothly and it won’t be long before the new contracts are available.    ZeusHash Team    15/01/2015    CoinDesk will continue monitoring this story and provide updates as they become available.

42377930,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVZv,1421427122,Spanish Political Party Calls for Bitcoin Regulation,"Spanish political party, Unión Progreso y Democracia (UPyD), has submitted a proposal to the country's Congress outlining why it believes bitcoin regulation is needed.      The group, a social liberal party, has used the submission to call out for stricter control measures to be placed on the technology in a bid to ""improve security and prevent fraudulent and criminal activity"".      The document stated:      ""Bitcoin should not remain in a legal vacuum, without the appropriate supervision.""              UPyD believes that there are currently 40,000 bitcoin users in Spain, and that while this small user base doesn't pose a risk to the larger economy today, measures should be enacted now before the technology becomes more widespread.      In its document, UPyD cites the European Central Bank's Virtual Currency Schemes report, which assesses that bitcoin cannot be considered a form of digital money and as such cannot be subjected to specific legislation.    The report highlighted the various advantages of bitcoin, asserting that its decentralised, cryptographic and anonymous nature are favourable to its users.  However, it voiced its belief that digital currency exchange is inherently risky, claiming that ""users can be led astray by criminals, which will take advantage of them to engage in illegal activities or money laundering"".  When asked about the proposed legislation, Nacho Robles, a law student and UPyD member, said:  ""I am all for regulation if it serves to offer judicial security, but against it if it triggers persecution from the central government. I would say that there is quite a lot of expectation around this in Spain as appropriate regulation will help the sector.""  Increased governance  The call for governance comes after El Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Publicas, the Spanish government agency that deals with matters of finance and taxation, issued a ruling stating that bitcoin should be treated as an electronic payment system.  The decision, which came in response to questions from Coinffeine, a Spanish open-source bitcoin exchange platform, established that bitcoin-based online gambling companies in Spain must apply for licenses.  Additionally, the framework stipulated that transactions by bitcoin businesses may be subject to existing laws that impose a cap on cash transactions of €2,500 or more.  Central bank threat  UPyD claimed that the lack of regulation could impact central banks in its filing, stating that:  ""Given the shared characteristics with other payment systems, incidents could be linked to the lack of intervention by public banking authorities.""  The proposal also touches upon a report by the European Banking Authority (EBA), published on 4th July, which identified ""more than 70 risks that affect users, market participants, financial integrity – by facilitating money laundering and other financial crimes – existing payment systems and the regulating authorities"".  The party, which considers its proposal to be a response to the EBA's call for short-term regulatory measures, will discuss the issue in Congress on 30th January.

42377939,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVjz,1421417266,AirBitz Gives Away BTC in Miami Bitcoin Conference Scavenger Hunt,"Mobile wallet AirBitz, which provides a location-based directory to make it easier for users to spend bitcoin, is launching a giveaway promotion at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida.  Airbitz is calling the contest 'Hidden Bits', which is a scavenger hunt that will see bitcoin-loaded cards secreted in locations around the Miami Beach area during the conference.  Clues will be released on Twitter to hint at the location of the cards, which will contain QR codes giving finders access to varied amounts of cryptocurrency.  Paul Puey, CEO of Airbitz, said the purpose of the Hidden Bits contest is to get people excited about the company’s mobile wallet – and bitcoin as a store of value.  He noted, in regards to Hidden Bits:  “There’s obviously a promotional aspect for Airbitz, but there’s also a promotional aspect for bitcoin.”  Social media exposure  Puey said the locations for the hidden bitcoin-loaded cards will not be set until he and the Airbitz team arrive in Miami for the conference, which is being held 16th to 18th January, at the Fillmore Theater, Miami Beach.  Those seeking out bitcoin hidden in the Miami area will need to follow Airbitz on Twitter.  The company's employees will also be on the ground talking about Hidden Bits at the conference and related events, such as the pre-event party being held at the Clevelander Hotel.  Individuals who do find the cards containing a bitcoin private key will also be able to double their money.  Puey said:  “The key thing is, when you scan the card with an AirBitz wallet, it will congratulate the user and ask if they want to Tweet it to their followers to double the prize.”  By Tweeting out a message to their followers, a code will send more value into the user's private key. The idea is to make sure the wallet remains private information, all the while promoting bitcoin.  Winners do not have to reveal information about their use of bitcoin if they don’t want to, the firm says.  Airbitz in Miami  Airbitz is planning to distribute around 30 cards with values ranging from $40 to $100 for Hidden Bits. Puey stressed that this promotion would likely be restricted to areas where cryptocurrency enthusiasts would be located during the conference.  He said:  “We want to do it where we are, where there’s a concentration of bitcoin people.”  The Airbitz mobile wallet app offers a simple experience using bitcoin, the company says, and also offers an API for developers.  Unlike most mobile bitcoin wallets, Airbitz's provides a location-based directory, which enables users to instantly know where they can spend bitcoin in their vicinity.  Puey says there are over 50 places in the Miami area that accept bitcoin, including the Clevelander Hotel where many bitcoiners stay for the conference, which is in its second year at this location.  Airbitz recently was accepted into the Silicon Valley-based Plug and Play startup accelerator, which has incubated bitcoin companies such as 37 Coins, Purse.io and Bitwage.  The Airbitz wallet is available for both iOS in the Apple App Store and Android in the Google Play Store.

42377927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVUt,1421404519,Research: Hackers Could Install Backdoor in Bitcoin Cold Storage,"Even a bitcoin wallet in cold storage, widely thought to be the most secure way to hold the digital currency, could leak its private keys to an attacker, a security researcher has found.  An attacker could reverse-engineer a compromised wallet's private keys from as little information as a single transaction issued by that wallet.  The attack is particularly worrying because it would be successful even if the victim maintained a wallet on an air-gapped machine without an Internet connection – or even in space, as wallet provider Xapo is attempting to do – according to the paper by Stephan Verbücheln.  Verbücheln, a researcher at Humboldt University's Institute for Computer Science in Berlin, said:  ""The attacker only has to watch the blockchain until two [compromised] signatures appear ... the affected signatures are not detectable by anyone other than the attacker.""  Conventional wisdom has it that coins in cold storage are safe from attacks because the private keys never come in contact with the Internet or any other network.  In general, this is true. Even if the cold storage device could be compromised by malware, stolen private keys would fail to be transmitted to a thief because it isn't connected to the Internet.  How it works  Verbücheln's paper, which is titled, How Perfect Offline Wallets Can Still Leak Bitcoin Private Keys, sets out an attack that centres on bitcoin's cryptographic algorithm.  This mathematical formula, known as ECDSA or the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, is used in the bitcoin protocol to ensure funds can be only be spent by their rightful owners.  When a bitcoin transaction takes place, it contains one or more ECDSA signatures. The number of signatures in a transaction depends on the number of inputs that it contains and are used to prove the transactions were authorised by their rightful owners. The amount of bitcoin contained in a transaction consists of the sum of its inputs.  The attacker must first create a compromised version of ECDSA. This is achieved with a kleptographic 'SETUP', or 'Secretly Embedded Trapdoor with Embedded Protection', which was first described in a 1997 paper by Adam Young and Moti Yung. That paper described a similar attack on the Digital Signature Algorithm, on which ECDSA is based.  Each time a bitcoin transaction is signed, the signature is generated partly from a random number known as 'k'. The compromised ECDSA uses a specific formula to select 'k', which is in turn used to compute a further value 'k2'.  The attacker will now watch for consecutive signatures signed by the compromised ECDSA. Because he knows how 'k2' was computed in the first place, he will be able to calculate that value from two consecutive signatures. With 'k2' in hand, the attacker can work backwards to calculate 'k' and the private key to that address.  ""After the attacker knows 'k2' for an ECDSA signature, it is easy for him to compute the private key,"" Verbücheln said.  An observer of the blockchain – and even the attacker himself – looking at signatures from this compromised elliptic curve would not be able to detect any faults. Unlike a general observer, however, the attacker would be running his extraction formula on every signature on the blockchain, hoping to find the 'k2' value from signatures generated by his malicious ECDSA.  Eventually, the attacker will hit on the signatures signed by his handiwork, allowing him to discover 'k2' and ultimately derive the addresses' private key.  ""He can now store the extracted private keys and watch the addresses' balance. He can use them to steal money at any point in time,"" Verbücheln said.  The good news  Verbücheln said his paper has not been submitted for publication yet, although he is giving a talk on the topic at a conference in Amsterdam next week.  While the scenario described by Verbücheln is frightening – private keys essentially leaked to the blockchain – the good news is that it's a difficult attack to carry out on a large scale.  Ivan Pustogarov  , a researcher at the University of Luxembourg's cryptology research group, said an attempt to smuggle compromised ECDSA code into a popular open-source wallet, for example, would be discovered by the public.  ""In open-source [software] on a large scale ... The code will be analysed at some point in time and the malicious implementation detected,"" he said.  Verbücheln largely shares this assessment, although he cautions that some pieces of open-source code are so large and complex that even a dedicated community of developers may not detect a malicious addition.  Both Verbücheln and Pustogarov say that the most likely way for such an attack to be mounted would be through dedicated wallet services running proprietary software. Devices designed specifically for secure cold-storage of coins, for example, would be prime candidates for this sort of attack.  ""Even if the manufacturer claims that it runs open-source code, how do you tell whether it is actually running what you compiled?"" Verbücheln said.  According to Pustogarov, the Verbücheln paper describes an attack that is related to the 'repeated r-values' flaw that white-hat hacker 'Johoe' famously exploited to grab more than 500 BTC from wallet provider Blockchain.  ""These two issues are related. The [Verbücheln] paper describes a more general approach, and repeated r-values is a sub-case,"" he said.  Verbücheln said he does not know if the attack he described has actually been carried out. Nevertheless, the possibility that one of the core cryptographic algorithms underpinning bitcoin could be cunningly compromised, allowing a thief to pick the lock of even the most secure addresses, presents a chilling scenario.  ""This attack has been known for many years for related crypto systems, so you can't know for sure,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/16/research-hackers-could-install-backdoor-in-bitcoin-cold-storage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23949925911829a3238d9ae7272df52073b10654-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
