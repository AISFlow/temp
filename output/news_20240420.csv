Bitcoin Mining Pool Pays Over $2.4 Million In Block Fees Earlier today, the 840,000th block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain, triggering the onslaught of the highly anticipated halving event. While the price of BTC did not witness a dramatic change following the halving, transaction fees spiked to unprecedented highs. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Walks Back $5 Trillion Crypto Marker Prediction, Unveils New Target Amidst the massive competition, a mining pool identified as ViaBTC had successfully mined the 840,000th Bitcoin block. Cumulatively, BTC users had spent a staggering $37.7 BTC in mining fees, equivalent to $2.4 million, recording the highest fee ever paid for a Bitcoin block. According to reports from mempool, after ViaBTC had produced the 840,000th block, the protocol had initiated an automated reduction of miners’ reward by half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. In addition to the fees, ViaBTC had received a total payout of 40.7 BTC, valued at approximately $2.6 million, for mining the historic block. While it may seem that Bitcoin miners had thrown caution to the wind by spending over $2.4 million on a single block, the 840,000th block had a major significance within the cryptocurrency space. The historic Bitcoin block is said to hold the first Satoshis, ‘sats,’ the smallest units of BTC following the halving. There are several of these “epic sats,” that appear after the halving event, coveted as a rare collector’s item among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Some even speculate that these Bitcoin fragments could be potentially worth millions of dollars. Including the hype surrounding these fragmented BTC, much of the competition for the Bitcoin blocks, following the halving has been attributed to the new Runes Protocol which launched at the same time as the Bitcoin halving. Degens Rush To Secure Infamous Rune Tokens The Runes Protocol, created by Casey Rodamor, a Bitcoin developer, has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, as degens are avidly competing to etch and mint tokens directly on the Bitcoin network. While mining pools were mining new Bitcoin blocks, degens had paid over 78.6 BTC valued at $4.95 million to mint the rarest Runes. This exponential surge in fees has been an unprecedented event, highlighting the increased adoption and participation of the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees 81% Daily Increase, But Why Is Participation Low? According to reports from Ord.io, a Rune labeled as ‘Decentralized’ was acquired for a fee of 7.99 BTC, equivalent to $510,760. While another titled ‘Dog-Go-To-The-Moon’ was obtained for a fee of 6.73 BTC, worth approximately $429,831. Leonidas, protocol developer and host of the groundbreaking Ordinals, a system for numbering “epic sats,” has declared the Runes Protocol a remarkable success as degens have “single-handedly offset the drop in miner rewards from the halving.” He concluded that Runes have significantly impacted Bitcoin’s security budget, potentially playing a major role in ensuring the network’s sustainability.

With a growing holder base, a strategic support network, and a recent price jump, SHIB seems poised for a potential climb. However, lingering sell pressure and the ever-present shadow of its all-time high keep investors cautious. Shiba Inu Finds Strength In Numbers SHIB’s popularity continues to rise. The number of Shiba Inu holders on the Ethereum blockchain has surpassed a staggering 1.4 million, a new milestone that reflects the coin’s expanding reach. This surge in holders indicates a growing community of believers in SHIB’s potential, potentially translating to a more stable and resilient market presence. #Shiba holders reaching 1.4M mark 🔥🔥🔥 We just grow,only up!!!#Shibarium #shib #bone #leash #crypto #ShibaSwap #ShibTheMetaverse #btc #eth # pic.twitter.com/Ha1R7phBOt — SHIBKIND 🔥 (@SHIBKIND) April 19, 2024 Shiba Inu Establishes Support System For Price Stability Beyond the expanding holder base, SHIB has built a strategic support system that could act as a safety net in case of price fluctuations. These zones, dubbed “support clusters,” sit at $0.00001 and $0.000014, and concentrate buying pressure zones. Essentially, a significant number of holders originally bought Shiba Inu at these price points, meaning a large number of tokens would be bought again if the price dips below these levels. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.259 trillion. Chart: TradingView Additionally, data suggests that a large portion of current SHIB holders are in profit. This metric, often visualized as “In & Out of the Money” by blockchain analysis tools, incentivizes them to hold onto their tokens rather than sell at a loss. Shiba Inu Still Barks For Its All-Time High Despite the positive developments, a cloud of caution hangs over SHIB. The current price sits comfortably above the aforementioned support clusters, but it remains significantly lower than its all-time high of $0.00008616, reached in the meme coin frenzy of 2021. Related Reading: Buckle Up, Injective (INJ) Primed For Takeoff Towards $50 — Analyst Furthermore, while the recent price increase is encouraging, there’s still more sell pressure than buy pressure in the spot markets. This imbalance suggests that some investors are eager to cash out, potentially hindering a sustained price surge. The Road Ahead For The Meme Coin Shiba Inu’s future remains uncertain. While the recent developments paint a cautiously optimistic picture, the meme coin market is notoriously volatile. The success of SHIB hinges on several factors beyond its current holder base and support structure. Continued positive developments in the broader cryptocurrency market, increased utility for the SHIB token itself, and a potential reduction in sell pressure are all crucial for a sustained price increase.

26099634,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604274,1713628810,Fourth Bitcoin Halving Completed – Here Are The Implications,"The long-awaited fourth Bitcoin halving finally occurred after BTC posted its 840,000th block. This event is significant as it is expected to have several implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the crypto market going forward. What To Expect Following The Bitcoin Halving The Bitcoin halving slashed miners’ rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block mined. This means that Bitcoin miners are set to earn a reduced income of 450 BTC instead of the 900 BTC they earned before the fourth halving. This development is expected to have a dire effect on their operations, as NewsBTC reported that they could lose a whopping $10 billion following the halving. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees 81% Daily Increase, But Why Is Participation Low? While the effects of the halving are not so pleasant for BTC miners, the halving is deemed necessary for the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It makes Bitcoin (BTC) deflationary by reducing the rate at which more tokens come into circulation. This could make the flagship crypto more scarce and ultimately drive up its value, as it has done in the past three halvings. In anticipation of history repeating itself, crypto analysts and experts have made several predictions about how high Bitcoin could rise this time post-halving. So far, the most bullish price prediction remains by Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, who predicts that the flagship crypto could rise to $1 million this year. He added that this unprecedented price surge was possible considering that BTC’s demand is expected to continue outpacing the supply, with more institutional investors recently getting on board through the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The imbalance between Bitcoin’s supply and demand is also why crypto analyst MacronautBTC believes Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. Billionaire Tim Draper also agrees that Bitcoin could attain such heights based on his prediction that the flagship crypto will hit $250,000 in 2025. Implications On The Broader Crypto Market Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently predicted a narrative shift post-halving. He expects Bitcoin to take months to consolidate while altcoins significantly move to the upside during this period. This is plausible, considering Bitcoin doesn’t experience that parabolic price surge until about six months after the halving. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Walks Back $5 Trillion Crypto Marker Prediction, Unveils New Target During this period, altcoins like XRP and Cardano (ADA), which have underperformed up until now, will be closely monitored as investors wait to see if they will show any sign of bullish momentum in them. Ethereum (ETH) will also be the focus of many in the crypto community as they watch how the second-largest crypto token by market cap will perform while Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates. Interestingly, Van de Poppe expects the narrative to shift to Ethereum and projects in the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Therefore, such projects are also worth keeping an eye on.

42390957,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR5Hh,1713621786,"Grayscale's Planned Mini Bitcoin ETF Will Have a 0.15% Fee, the Lowest Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs","Grayscale’s new ETF product, the Bitcoin Mini Trust, has set fees at 0.15%.  Grayscale said it will contribute 10% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) assets to the Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).  Grayscale, which currently offers the highest-cost spot bitcoin ETF, revealed that a planned spinoff version of the fund will have a 0.15% fee, which would be the lowest of them all, according to pro forma financials in its latest filing.  The existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a 1.5% fee. When Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) is introduced, the filing says the company will contribute 10% of the assets in GBTC to the BTC Trust. Shares of the BTC trust are to be issued and distributed automatically to holders of GBTC shares. (The pro forma financial statements are projections of future expenses and revenues, based on a company's past experience and future plans.)  Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust was conceived to offer GBTC investors a lower fee option that’s more competitively in line with other bitcoin ETFs approved back in January. Currently, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) at 0.19% is the lowest-cost spot bitcoin ETF.  The Grayscale spinoff is also considered a non-taxable event for GBTC’s existing shareholders, so those investors will not be expected to pay capital-gains tax to automatically transfer into the new fund. Some early stage GBTC investors with gains in the thousands of percentages would face a significant taxable event to switch to a competitor product with a lower fee.  Grayscale’s GBTC appeared over a decade ago, originally offered through a private placement. In mid-2015, the shares began trading publicly on an over-the-counter basis. This continued until January 2024 when GBTC uplisted to NYSE Arca as a spot bitcoin ETF, along with competition products from other companies including BlackRock and Fidelity.  Grayscale’s current assets under management stands at around $19.6 billion; its nearest rival, which is BlackRock’s IBIT fund, has grown to just over $17.5 billion.

26094699,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604262,1713621620,BNB Resilience: Holding Firm At $560 – What’s Next?,"The price of BNB hasn’t fallen below its previous low, and it’s showing some strong signs of heading up. After a spell of moving downward, the Binance Smart Chain’s native token is aiming for an upward bounce back towards its earlier high. Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Uptrend For BNB To figure out where the BNB price might be headed next, several indicators can be used to examine the chart: 4-Hour MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend. This can be seen in the above image. RSI 4-hour Timeframe: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the below image also suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen trending above the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are still very active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers. 4-hour alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that BNB is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might be starting a new rally. At the time of writing, the price of BNB was up by 1.35% and was trading around $561 in the last 24 hours. BNB price is showing bullish signs and also forming a base above the $508.1 support level. Also, the price is trading above the bearish trend line and below the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. Final Thoughts From the previous downward movement, the price of BNB has managed to create one major resistance level of $635 and one major support level of $508. Currently, BNB is moving toward this resistance level and if it breaks above this level, the price might go even further to create a new high. On the other hand, if the price fails to break above this major resistance, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support and if it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further downward thereby starting a new downward trend.

26081996,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604175,1713602942,Uniswap Resurgence Incoming? Analyst Predicts 30% Surge For UNI Price,"Uniswap’s native token, UNI, has been struggling in terms of its price action over the past few weeks. Although the general state of the crypto market may be blamed for this gloomy price performance, other factors, such as the Wells Notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Uniswap protocol, have also played a role. However, the UNI price appears to be recovering well, as the token has jumped by more than 2% in the past day. A popular crypto pundit on X has predicted that a bullish rally might only just be beginning for the DeFi coin, but the question is – how far can Uniswap’s price go? Analyst Sets $10 Target For Uniswap Price In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an exciting bullish prediction for the price of UNI. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency might be getting ready for a run to the upside in the coming days. Related Reading: Injective Votes On Major Upgrade To Make INJ Even More Deflationary: Will Prices Recover? The rationale behind this bullish prognosis for the Uniswap token is based on the TD (Tom DeMark) Sequential Indicator. The Tom Demark Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis used to identify the probable time and points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. Uniswap's daily price chart | Source: Ali_charts/X The TD Sequential indicator consists of two stages, namely the “setup” and the “countdown” phases. As shown in the chart above, UNI’s price just completed the setup phase, which comprises nine consecutive candles that closed lower than the candle four periods ago. The completion of this phase usually signals a potential trend reversal for the token’s price. The direction of the reversal depends on the type of candles that formed the “setup” (I.e., red candles would suggest a bottom for the asset, while green candles would imply a top). Martinez noted in his post that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy alarm on the UNI daily chart, and the token might be “gearing up for a 1 – 4-day rally. According to the analyst, the DeFi coin could jump as high as $10, representing an over 31% surge from the current price point. UNI Price Overview As of this writing, the price of UNI stands at around $7.46, reflecting a 2% jump in the past 24 hours. However, this latest price increase is not enough to bring the coin to profit on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees 81% Daily Increase, But Why Is Participation Low?

This negative price movement is similar to the majority of the cryptocurrency market following unprecedented massive dips in the price of Bitcoin. However, despite ADA’s troubles, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez is backing the coin to pull off a remarkable rebound. Interestingly, Martinez’s prediction comes as the digital asset attempts to find its feet, gaining by 9.92% in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Rally To $3 As Price Reaches ‘Ultimate Support Test’ ADA Tipped To Hit $0.80, Record Yearly High In a post on X on April 19, Ali Martinez shared that ADA may soon record an impressive price surge. Martinez predicted the tenth largest cryptocurrency could soon record a 75% gain due to its MVRV Ratio being lower than -22%. For context, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is a metric used in crypto technical analysis to assess the valuation of a digital asset relative to its realized value. It is basically used to know if a token is overvalued or undervalued based on its market price compared to the average cost basis of its holders. An MVRV ratio of -22% indicates that the market value of ADA is significantly less than its realized value. However, Ali Martinez notes the last time the coin was this undervalued was in June 2023, after which it rose by 75% in the next month. Based on such historical price data, the crypto analyst predicts ADA could replicate a similar performance over the next few weeks, attaining a market price of $0.80, which would represent its highest value in the last year. At the time of writing, ADA trades at $0.46, with a 2.43% gain in the last hour. In a similar fashion, the token’s daily volume is up by 43.07% and $595.30 million.

This announcement occurred during Wood’s presentation on Polkadot’s future at the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai. Wood introduced the JAM Implementer’s Prize, a 10 Million DOT prize pool, to encourage diverse development of the JAM protocol. Polkadot Unveils JAM Upgrade According to the announcement, the JAM upgrade aims to replace the relay chain, which acts as the central data chain in the Polkadot network, with a “more modular and minimalist design” that will allow Polkadot to run generic services and increase network stability. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Walks Back $5 Trillion Crypto Marker Prediction, Unveils New Target The parachains service within JAM will support existing Substrate-based parachains, enabling developers to continue using Substrate to develop and deploy their blockchains. Notably, these services will have no predefined limits on code, data, or state capacity and can accommodate additional DOT deposits for increased capacity. JAM’s design includes several technical improvements. It replaces WebAssembly with the Polkadot Virtual Machine based on the RISC-V ISA, an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) used to develop custom processors. It also introduces SAFROLE, a SNARK-based block production algorithm. These upgrades are reportedly designed to optimize performance and scalability within the Polkadot network. On The Path To Decentralization? To realize the vision of “a truly decentralized protocol,” Polkadot aims to support multiple client implementations. Furthermore, the JAM Implementer’s prize has been established to incentivize and fund projects contributing to the development of JAM implementations. The announcement further reads on the matter: We believe that supporting a range of implementations in various programming languages will strengthen the ecosystem’s foundation. It distributes the power of protocol implementers more widely and reduces the risk of a bug in one implementation taking down the entire network. The JAM Implementer’s Prize will collaborate with existing and future funding initiatives that support Polkadot’s ecosystem and technology stack. These initiatives include Decentralized Futures, Grants, and Polkadot’s on-chain treasury. The prize will be activated when JAM is ratified as a Polkadot technology through the network’s on-chain governance mechanism. Related Reading: Railgun Among Crypto Market Top Gainers: Why Is RAIL 53% Up? Overall, Gavin Wood’s introduction of the JAM upgrade and the associated 10 Million DOT prize reflects Polkadot’s intention to increase the protocol’s use and adoption. JAM’s modular design and incentives for multi-client implementations are also expected to contribute to ongoing efforts to decentralize the Polkadot network. As JAM development continues, the Polkadot ecosystem welcomes proposals from teams interested in implementing it in various programming environments. Despite the recent announcement, the network’s native token, DOT, has been unable to break the downtrend witnessed over the past month. Currently trading at $6.75, it reflects a significant 24% decline in price over the last 30 days.

As the Bitcoin Halving is set to occur between today and tomorrow, April 20, Bitcoin has shown less significant market movement. At the time of writing, the asset has a market price of $64,578. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Could Catalyzed $100,000 Price Surge: Bitwise CEO Analyst: ‘When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?’ According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, Bitcoin typically reaches its bull market peak between 518 and 546 days following a Halving event. Applying this historical timeline, the next anticipated bull market peak could fall between mid-September and mid-October 2025. However, as disclosed by Rekt Capital, recent market trends suggest a possible acceleration in Bitcoin’s ongoing cycle compared to historical patterns, demonstrated by the cryptocurrency achieving new record levels approximately 260 days ahead of the typical schedule. Despite this apparent acceleration, Rekt Capital noted: Bitcoin has been experiencing a Pre-Halving Retrace for the past month or so As a result, Bitcoin has been slowing down and decelerating the cycle by 30 days thus far and counting So while Bitcoin may have been accelerating by ~260 days last month… Today this acceleration is now more close to ~230 days due to the current Pre-Halving Retrace. Additionally, Rekt Capital introduced an alternative viewpoint termed the “Accelerated Perspective,” which factors in the duration from when Bitcoin exceeds its previous peak to the projected culmination of the bull market. Given Bitcoin’s recent attainment of new all-time highs in March, this perspective implies that the subsequent bull market peak could happen between December 2024 and February 2025. #BTC When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?

At the time of writing, it had increased marginally by 1.4%, bringing its market price to above $64,000. This recovery follows a week-long decline during which Bitcoin experienced nearly a 10% downturn. In light of these developments, crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe has shared insights into the potential implications of the impending BTC Halving event. Van de Poppe suggests a shift in focus away from Bitcoin once the halving occurs, speculating on potential changes in market narratives. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts A Narrative Shift Post-Bitcoin Halving While he did not specify the exact narrative shift, Van de Poppe previously outlined expectations for the crypto market, including an anticipated emphasis on Ethereum (ETH) and projects focused on Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Real World Assets (RWA) post-Halving.

According to Injective, through a post on April 19, the proposal is now open for voting via the Injective Hub. For the next four days, stakers and validators are free to participate. Community Voting On Injective 3.0 Over the months since launching in 2023, Injective caught the crypto community’s attention. The team aims to launch a platform for users to launch DeFi-focused protocols in a low-cost, scalable, and yet Ethereum-compatible environment. Though INJ, the native currency of the platform, remains one of the top performers, changes introduced by Injective 3.0 will likely push prices even higher. According to developers, Injective 3.0 aims to make INJ a deflationary asset. A big part of this will be to reduce token minting by controlling the rate of token creation. If the community approves what’s laid out in the proposal, the team will change on-chain parameters to slow down token minting. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts A Narrative Shift Post-Bitcoin Halving At the same time, Injective 3.0 plans to make INJ’s inflation rate more responsive to staking. Under this model, inflation will slow down as more INJ is locked away via staking, making the coin scarcer. Proposers predict the network to be more robust and secure if INJ becomes more deflationary. Usually, token prices of scarce assets tend to be higher. However, it should be noted that changes to tokenomics don’t immediately lead to favorable price repricing. For prices to soar, there must be utility, driven mainly by community interest. Millions Of INJ Burned, Will Prices Break $30? Injective 2.0 is currently live following its activation in August 2023. Under the current regime, there is a token auction burn, where decentralized applications (dapps) running on the platform are free to participate in token burning. According to the Injective Protocol, over 5.9 million INJ have been withdrawn. So far, INJ remains under pressure, sliding down, shedding 50% from March 2024 highs. The coin has been moving horizontally in the past few trading sessions. However, it is under immense selling and within the April 12 bear bar.

42390932,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR4s3,1713576947,"Runes Protocol Launches on Bitcoin, Sending Fees Soaring as Users Rush to Mint Tokens","Despite this being the most anticipated Bitcoin halving yet (at least according to Google search history), it was the launch of the high-profile Bitcoin builder Casey Rodamor’s latest creation – Runes – that turned heads, even among long-time blockchain developers who despise the digital tokens that can be minted on the platform.  Rodamor is known for the release of Ordinals, a protocol that allows people to “inscribe” data on the smallest units of bitcoin (i.e. satoshis) to create highly valued assets on Bitcoin. Ordinals is largely credited for inspiring a renewed developer ecosystem on Bitcoin.  Runes is similar to Ordinals, in that it allows people to “etch” and mint tokens on-chain – the main difference is that ordinals are “non-fungible” (i.e. one-of-a-kind) while Runes will function more like meme coins, which have recently taken crypto markets by storm.  The first Runes project to mint was Rodamor’s own UNCOMMON•GOODS project, which was announced well in advance of the halving, as were many of the projects looking to etch themselves on these highly coveted satoshis.  See also: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction Fees  Impossible to know in advance, however, is what other projects would be able to find space on these scarce satoshis. There are already quite literally hundreds of Runes projects that are currently being minted and looking for prospective buyers.  About nine blocks after the halving, Runes minters had already paid 78.6 BTC in fees (~$4.95 million) in order to buy the rarest of the rare. This suggests that, like Ordinals, the Runes protocol could be a boon to Bitcoin’s burgeoning fee economy.  What makes a Runes project potentially viable is something of a subjective measure: being an early project to list — like DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, which has the honor of being “Rune Number 3” — is one measure. But buyers are also judging projects based on the “quality” of its ticker.  A number of Runes projects were already starting to mint before the halving happened, including DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG, MEME•ECONOMICS, SHORT•THE•WORLD and PEPE•WIT•HONKERS, including dozens others, according to runebtc.xyz.  Prior to the halving block being mined, prospective buyers in an X Space hosted by Leonidas, a well-regarded Ordinals collector, users and speculators alike were discussing which Runes to mint and trading ticker names.  Among the names dropped were Taproot Wizards, the Ordinals project co-created by Bitcoin OG influencers Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, and a project called Satoshi Nakamoto, named after Bitcoin’s creator, which at press time had over 5,000 holders who minted about 19,000 tokens.  Which projects will actually prove to have long term value is hard to judge.  “Yeah, I don't see any good memes, like, I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out,” one trader said. “To be quite frank, I haven’t minted anything yet.”  See also: Runes DEX Secures $2 Million in Seed Investment to Pioneer AMM on Bitcoin  “I’m trying to understand the space in general right now,” someone else responded. “These projects are like early Runes. Do you guys think that these are actually going to be the most valuable ones?”  “I think it depends what happens with them,” someone responded.  Another aspect to consider: how many of the tokens were “pre-mined,” or held in reserve for project creators to potentially release on the market later. Prior to the halving, Leonidas shared guidelines that suggested projects that pre-mine more than 10% of the token supply were “greedy.”  “I think the pre-mines are going to be the ones that win,” one trader said. “Because like, it's so hard to come up with a good meme with a 13 character limit,” he said, referring to the hardcoded naming system Rodamor added to Runes to try to prevent “ticker squatters.”  In time, Runes tickers will be able to list with shorter names. Within three years, there could be Runes projects with three-letter tickers, for instance.  Though it’s unclear how well this strategy will play out. According to data source Ordiscan, one forethinking developer has already blocked off a series of tickers, including ZZZZ (which will be the “first four letter Rune” to mint in two years), ZZ and Z (the first two letter and one letter Runes to mint in three years) and A (the last single character Rune to mint in four years).  In other words, with something so new, it’s hard to determine what to value.  “As everybody is scrambling to figure out what the hell's going on, I want to just take a moment to say it's awesome being here with all of you,” Leonidas told his audience. “This is essentially the start of a new protocol that kicked off about 30 minutes ago. So let's see what happens. I think it's going to be very chaotic.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/20/runes-protocol-launches-on-bitcoin-sending-fees-soaring-as-users-rush-to-mint-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca4073986b82e35a5d6bd80c2e88a27749ed87bf-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Mega Whales Have Shown Net Inflows In The Past Day In the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has struggled to mount any significant bullish momentum as it has been stuck consolidating inside a range. Earlier, while this was happening, the largest holders in the space had been sitting quietly, not buying or selling anything notable. According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, however, this appears to have changed in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trader Selling Pressure Declining, CryptoQuant Head Explains Why Relevant holders here are the “Large Holders,” who, as defined by the analytics firm, are investors carrying at least 0.1% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply in their wallets. A little under 19.7 million tokens are circulating for the cryptocurrency, 0.1% of which would be 19,700 BTC. This amount is worth more than $1.26 billion at the current exchange rate of BTC. Clearly, these large holders are quite large indeed, and in fact, they are much larger than the usual whale investors, who typically carry between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. As such, it would perhaps be apt to call these humongous entities “mega whales.” Since an investor’s influence in the market increases the larger their holdings, these mega whales would be the most powerful entities on the Bitcoin network. Therefore, their moves can have some consequences for the wider market. IntoTheBlock has used the netflow on-chain indicator to track the movements of the Large Holders here, which measures the net amount of BTC entering or exiting the wallets of these investors. The below chart shows the trend in this metric over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been positive most recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Large Holders netflow registered a notable positive spike yesterday, meaning these investors have received a net amount of coins into their wallets. The mega whales bought 19,760 BTC during this spike, worth more than $1.27 billion. “Historically, accumulations by these addresses have often preceded rises in Bitcoin’s price,” notes the analytics firm. The chart shows that some extraordinary buys came from this cohort on the way to the new all-time high for the asset.

As such, it’s possible that these latest buys will also help the asset gain some bullish momentum in the near future.

But this time, bitcoin has already embarked on a momentous rally to record highs, rising from $15,500 in late 2022 to $73,680, helped by optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and then then the ensuing enthusiasm after they began trading in January.

42390950,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR6C7,1713572190,"The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction Fees","The Bitcoin halving took place early Saturday, upending the economics of running the pioneering blockchain.  Fees soared in the aftermath as a new Bitcoin-based system called Runes launched.  Bitcoin completed the fourth halving in its 15-year history, a milestone venerated and anticipated in the blockchain community just like the World Cup and Olympics are in sports.  The once-every-four-years event, which cuts in half the amount miners get rewarded for creating new bitcoin, took place at 00:09 UTC on Saturday when the 840,000th block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain.  While bitcoin's price held mostly steady above $63,000 in the aftermath, something else stole the show: Transaction fees spiked on Bitcoin as the launch of a new protocol called Runes led to a flurry of transactions as speculators rushed to mint digital tokens atop the blockchain.  Read more: Runes Protocol Launches on Bitcoin, Sending Fees Soaring as Users Rush to Mint Tokens  The halving block – block 840,000 – saw a record-high 37.6 BTC fee (worth more than $2.4 million) attached to it, and fees remained far higher than normal in the hour after the halving.  The winning mining pool for that block was ViaBTC, entitling it to the bitcoin rewards at the new, just-lowered rate of 3.125 BTC per block, worth about $200,000 at the current price. But crypto miners had been competing actively for the block since it contains the first ""sat"" – the smallest denomination of bitcoin – following the halving. These ""epic sats"" that follow halvings are seen as collector's items, and some mining executives have suggested that this individual fragment of a bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars, or many multiples of the current price of an entire bitcoin.  The Runes protocol for fungible tokens, from Casey Rodarmor, the developer behind the Ordinals platform that launched last year to enable NFTs on Bitcoin, also launched at block 840,000. Less than an hour after the launch, 853 of the runes had already been etched, according to the website runealpha.xyz.  A quick glance at the fees paid by users to get transactions included in blocks might reflect the intense competition by users to mint the new runes: the $2.4 million fees for the halving block compared with $40,000 to $60,000 for a more typical block before the halving. Several of the ensuing blocks also came with more than $1 million of fees.  ""We've not had anything like this in the history of Bitcoin,"" the prominent Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song said during a livestreamed watch party hosted by Tone Vays. ""We're stressing the network in a different way, in ways we've never stressed it before.""  On-chain data shows that the median satoshis per byte (sats/vByte) fee has exploded post-halving to 1,805 sats/vByte. Pre-halving on April 19, this most recent median fee was closer to 100 sats/vByte.  (Sats/vbyte (satoshis per byte) is a measurement of the fee rate used to conduct a Bitcoin transaction, indicating how many satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) you are willing to pay for each byte of data in your transaction.)  In layman's terms, this means that transaction fees have surged, with medium-priority transactions costing $146 and high-priority transactions costing around $170.  Miners are expected to rely more on higher transaction fees and a potential increase in bitcoin's price to offset the expected decline in revenue due to the reduced mining subsidy, especially in the short term.  For CoinDesk's complete coverage, please see our Bitcoin Halving landing page.  The mining reward – which dropped to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC during this halving – is an incentive for entities who contribute computing power to secure Bitcoin. The miner that wins the race to add each new block to the network takes away the mining reward, the amount of which is fixed until it's cut again at the next halving, as programmed by the cryptocurrency's elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Soaring fees, though, in the aftermath of the halving suggest miners could have a lucrative new revenue stream in the Runes era – though several people speaking on the Tone Vays livestream expressed the belief that the fee spike will end up being temporary.  The quadrennial halving is seen as a momentous occasion in the crypto community because it symbolizes Bitcoin's original concept as an autonomous, decentralized financial network whose monetary policy is set by code, as opposed to human organizations like governments and central bankers.  Unlike traditional, or fiat, currencies, whose value has historically been eroded by inflation and government printing, bitcoin is designed to be non-inflationary with a maximum total supply of 21 million BTC in circulation. With the halvings every four years, the pace of new issuance of bitcoins reduces over time until the last one is mined, likely sometime in 2140.

The thinking is that the fewer new BTC are being produced, the more valuable those already in existence become. This time, the outlook is murky. Some market commentators say the halving is already priced into BTC and, therefore, the immediate effects may be muted. Others see the bitcoin price falling, while yet others have suggested a rally is in store.  The potential effects of this present halving may be impossible to predict due to the profound differences in the Bitcoin landscape compared with the three previous events. Notably, January's long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. means greater institutional investment is coming to BTC by orders of magnitude.  Also, following the launch of the Ordinals protocol early last year, there is now much greater activity going on under the hood of Bitcoin, with developments and upgrades to the network potentially bringing far more utility to the notoriously conservative ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | ORDI,"Jamie Crawley, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/20/bitcoin-blockchain-has-fourth-halving-in-15-year-history-in-show-of-monetary-policy-set-by-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e317673783930c89e42ebc9f742a4afcbf7c3fc5-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the figures being burned paint another picture, especially when it comes to participation from Shiba Inu holders in the SHIB burning initiative. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Rises 81% The Shiba Inu daily burn rate saw a significant uptick, rising an impressive 81% in a single day. While this surge is a positive for the meme coin, the number of tokens burned to cause this surge are far from impressive. Related Reading: Goldman Sachs On Bitcoin Halving: ‘It doesn’t Matter If It’s A Buy The Rumor, Sell The News Event’ According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn, a total of 4.64 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last day. To put this in perspective, the total value of the tokens burned for the day is around $105. Additionally, given that this constitutes an 81% increase, it means an even smaller amount of tokens were burned the prior day. Shibburn’s records show that the previous day saw a total of 1.9 million tokens burned, which is around $45 worth of coins. This drastic decline in the number of coins being burned on a daily basis suggests muted participation from investors. This could be directly tied to Shiba Inu’s price struggle over the last few weeks, which has seen investors take a more conservative stance to protect their positions. SHIB Price Crashes 21% The Shiba Inu burn rate is not the only thing that has been seeing a decline in the last week, its price has also taken a hit. According to data from the token tracking platform Coinmarketcap, the Shiba Inu price is down 15% in the last week alone. Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 As a result of this 15% decline, the SHIB price has now dropped to $0.000023, which also represents a 50% drop from its March peak of $0.000044. However, its daily trading volume has seen a bullish reversal, rising 12% in the last day to $645 million. A rise in volume can often signal a return in interest to a cryptocurrency. If this is the case, then the Shiba Inu price may be headed for a reversal as investors start to place their bets once more. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is still trending at $0.0000228, showing small daily gains of 4%. However, despite the negative headwinds the meme coin has experienced, it continues to maintain a market cap above $13.5 billion, which makes it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, ahead of the likes of Avalanche and Polkadot.
