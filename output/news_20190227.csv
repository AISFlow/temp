42402613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblL7,1551300607,Constantinople Incoming: Today's Two Ethereum Hard Forks Explained,"In less than 24 hours, the world’s second largest blockchain by market capitalization is expected to activate its sixth and seventh system-wide upgrades, at which point its global user base will be asked to make two near-simultaneous changes to its code.  Known as Constantinople and St. Petersburg, both upgrades will be implemented as ""hard forks,"" or upgrades that add new rules to the ethereum software that are incompatible with past versions. Both will also take place at the exact same block number – 7,280,000.  Should users decide to upgrade, St. Petersburg will effectively disable part of the Constantinople code discovered back in January to host a critical vulnerability affecting smart contract security. Further, four out of five planned ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) – the majority of which, according to independent ethereum developer Lane Rettig, will not be noticeable to the average user.  Calling Constantinople primarily a “maintenance and optimization upgrade” in an interview with CoinDesk, Rettig highlighted in September that the only user group to experience a noticeable change would be miners, the specialized hardware operators who today assemble ethereum transactions into blocks and compete for network rewards.  Indeed, once activated, Constantinople and St. Petersburg will reduce block reward issuance from 3 to 2 ETH, similar to how the previous hard fork – called Byzantium – reduced issuance from 5 to 3 ETH.  “The reduction in ETH block rewards … will clearly have a big impact on miners,” said Rettig to CoinDesk via email.  As explained by Eric Conner, founder of information site ETHHub, the change is intended to be a temporary measure until miners on the blockchain are eventually replaced with new kinds of validators in ethereum's next upgrade, Serenity.  Conner to CoinDesk back in September:  “[ETH supply] in late 2018 and 2019 is over what was initially assumed by the community. It’s at 7.5 percent inflation now … [We’re] reducing it to 2 ETH per block – roughly 4.5 percent inflation – as a stop gap until Casper is done.”  Ahead of tomorrow's upgrade, here are some big takeaways from ethereum's coming code change:  1. It's a collection of updates  Outside of this reduction in block reward issuance, there’s a number of other technical upgrades also expected to improve operations on the ethereum blockchain before its larger Casper FFG upgrade is fully implemented.  These include EIP 145 “Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM,” EIP 1014 “Skinny CREATE2” and EIP 1052 “EXTCODEHASH opcode.”  On the matter of EIP 145, Stephen King – CEO of ethereum-based real estate marketplace Imbrex – explained to CoinDesk:  “Adding Bitwise shifting instructions will make it slightly cheaper to conduct certain functions on chain. This is a step in the right direction to making developing on ethereum more cost-effective for [decentralized application] developers.”  For a comprehensive round-up of each of the proposals in Constantinople – including the one to be deactivated through St. Petersburg, read our full coverage:  https://www.coindesk.com/constantinople-ahead-what-you-need-to-know-about-ethereums-big-upgrade  2. You can watch it live  At present, blockchain explorer site Amberdata is estimating an expected activation time for Constantinople and St. Petersburg tomorrow at 19:15 (UTC).  But because block mining speeds can vary from hour to hour, ethereum users, miners and developers will want to keep a close eye on the website for variations to this estimation as the block count increases. Once activated, users can monitor the progress of both hard forks in real time using a developer tool known as the “fork monitor,” which visualizes ethereum blockchain data into a time series graph.  For details on other useful metrics such as hashrate, market price and node count as the upgrade is rolled-out, check out CoinDesk’s article on “How to Watch Ethereum’s Fork as It Happens.”  (Disclaimer: As of press time, there is no livestream developer call scheduled to begin for the upgrade. Shortly following Thursday’s upgrade, there will be a meeting on Friday at 14:00 (UTC) between the developers to discuss how the hard fork went, among other topics.)  https://www.coindesk.com/the-thirdening-approaches-how-to-watch-ethereums-fork-as-it-happens  3. It's been delayed before  As much as the ethereum community is hopeful the upgrade will go over smoothly, one can never really be too sure when it comes to hard forks. As seen with past ethereum updates, some user groups could continue running older instances of the code, should they so choose.  This is notable as ever since testing for the upgrade began as early back as July 2018, ethereum developers have faced multiple roadblocks causing delays to the activation of Constantinople. Expected to be released on mainnet for as early as October 2018, complications as the code was released on the ethereum test network Ropsten pushed back this estimation to January of this year.  Developers then announced in December main network release for Constantinople would occur on block number 7,080,000 – only to have this activation block number pushed back to 7,280,000 as a result of a last-minute security bug found in the code.  For a play-by-play on how the most recent security bug in Constantinople was found and what sorts of decisions came out of it, the following is a curated list of all major hard fork developments since January:  1. January 11, 2019 – A week before expected activation of Constantinople on mainnet, developers are cautiously optimistic the release will go smoothly.  https://www.coindesk.com/what-to-expect-when-ethereums-constantinople-hard-fork-happens  2. January 15, 2019 – Not 48 hours before expected activation on block number 7,080,000, developer are notified of a critical security bug.  https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-constantinople-upgrade-faces-delay-due-to-security-vulnerability  3. January 18, 2019 – Developers agree to delay activation of Constantinople on mainnet until late February and propose a new block number.  https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-devs-propose-activating-constantinople-hard-fork-in-late-february  4. February 12, 2019 – Final software releases of Constantinople and St. Petersburg from major ethereum clients such as Geth and Parity are released and later compiled into a comprehensive blog post on the official ethereum website.  https://www.coindesk.com/take-two-ethereum-is-getting-ready-for-the-constantinople-hard-fork-redo  4. Let's get it over with  Due to the prolonged timeline of this upgrade, the final and most important takeaway is the present community sentiment surrounding the impending release of Constantinople (and St. Petersburg.)  As Taylor Monahan – CEO of blockchain wallet tool MyCrypto – admits to CoinDesk:  ""I'm eager to put Constantinople behind us because it's been such a distraction for a lot of core developers, the community, [and] the entire ecosystem. What we need to be focusing on right now is the path forward for ethereum.""  Independent core developer Lane Rettig couldn't agree more.  Saying that this planned hard fork has ""dragged on long enough,"" Rettig told CoinDesk that there is ""so much other stuff that [developers] are focused on.""  ""All the boxes are checked. All systems operational. Everything looks good, which is a good sign,"" explained Rettig about Constantinople. ""So, no lingering concerns... We need to move and get to our next milestones basically.""  These milestones according to Rettig include first and foremost, a proposed code change to alter the ethereum mining algorithm such that all miners in the ecosystem are operating on a more level playing field.  In addition, there is also a host of new proposed EIPs up for discussion collectively dubbed ethereum 1x paving the intermediary roadmap to Serenity. Last but not least, developers are also ever attentive to advancing research on the Serenity protocol itself.  ""I think that once Constantinople is behind us hopefully the community, the educators, the developers [and] the researchers can really focus on understanding this path forward [and] communicating the path forward with people of all different technical abilities and education levels,"" said Monahan to CoinDesk.

42402621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblS0,1551286831,A Crypto Project That Raised $20 Million Is Caught Faking Its Founding Team,"A cryptocurrency project that appears to have raised at least $20 million through a referral-based marketing scheme has been advertising false information about its team members, a CoinDesk investigation has found.  Launched on Dec. 2, BHB claims to offer an ethereum-based solution for peer-to-peer lending, but by Jan. 18, local media reports were already accusing the project of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. Now, CoinDesk is able to reveal inconsistencies in the information provided about its founding team that further suggest something may be amiss at the China-based project.  In particular, CoinDesk has found that images said to represent two BHB team members have been lifted from unaffiliated university professors, who are now publicly denying any association with the project.  According to web materials, alleged team members include a financial engineer named Bobby White, a blockchain expert named David Chen and a product designer named Gregory Moss. The respective images of each individual were featured on BHB's website, bgepay.com. (The project appears to have taken down the website.)  However, the image of Bobby White used in BHB’s marketing materials is identical to that of an economics professor at China’s Tsinghua University named Alexander White. Meanwhile, the image of Gregory Moss is the same as one used by a philosophy professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, who is also named Gregory Moss.  In responses to CoinDesk inquiries, both professors denied any association with the scheme and both stated they had no prior knowledge of the BHB project.  White said:  ""Any use of my photo for such purposes, including attached to the name 'Bobby White,' is fraudulent.""  Professor Moss, too, said he is very “troubled” by the incident, claiming he never gave BHB permission to use his image or likeness in connection with marketing its products.  CoinDesk was not able to independently verify the image associated with a third alleged team member named David Chen.  Besides false information about its team members, the project listed invalid contact details on its website, including a disconnected phone number and a supposed headquarters at a New York City address that does not exist (""22/121 Apple Street"").  An unusual model  Adding to concerns is the mechanism for how BHB tokens are issued and promoted at a single exchange, XBTC.CX, whose business appears tied to the BHB project.  Investors are not able to mine or receive BHB tokens through programmatic means. They can only buy these tokens using the U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrency known as tether or USDT on XBTC or Chinese yuan through XBTC's over-the-counter WeChat groups.  XBTC.CX, the only exchange that lists BHB tokens, began its offering on Dec. 2, explaining at the time that users who held at least 700 BHB for 24 hours were eligible to get a dividend issued in USDT that would equal 7 percent of their BHB holdings’ market value. On Dec. 5, the exchange announced it would reduce that reward rate to 1.3 percent.  (Some of XBTC's web pages related to BHB block IP addresses in the U.S. and U.K.)  Further, the same announcement on Dec. 2 said BHB holders could get additional USDT if they recruited other users to the exchange and had them hold BHB in an account.  In this case, XBTC.CX said anyone who could sign up a user that held a balance of at least 700 BHB would be eligible to receive an additional 1.5 percent of the new account’s BHB value in the form of USDT. The offer suggested these USDT payments would then occur daily.  If the same user managed to sign up yet another account to the exchange, then they could receive an additional 1 percent of the second account’s BHB holdings every day.  Although users do not have to pay a membership fee to their referrers, the project appears to rely on raising capital from new participants so that promised dividends and commissions for existing accounts can be continuously paid out.  This element of the scheme is notable, as it has attracted comparisons to multi-level marketing (MLM) and pyramid schemes, the latter of which is illegal in China.  Dozens of users on Chinese social media Weibo have been posting threads and raising doubts on the legality of the project, alleging it’s just a disguised pyramid scheme because it’s using latecomers’ money to pay for what early participants were promised.  China’s central government enacted a regulation in 2005 strictly prohibiting what it calls Chuanxiao, or “pyramid selling,” in the country. Based on an English translation provided by the law school at Peking University, the regulation defines pyramid selling as follows:  ""An organizer or operator seeks for unlawful interests by recruiting persons to participate in pyramid selling, asking the recruiters to persuade others to participate in pyramid selling so as to form a multi-level relationship, and calculating and paying the remuneration (including material awards and other economic interests) to an upper-level promoter on the basis of the sales performance of the promoters below.""  Links to MoCapital  But while the veracity of the advertised team may be in question, WeChat groups have linked both BHB and XBTC.CX to at least one real person – Renbing Li, the 24-year-old founder of the Hangzhou-based venture firm MoCapital.  In a WeChat response to CoinDesk, Li denied allegations BHB is a pyramid scheme and said it’s rather a project to “liberalize communities.” He did not respond to further questions.  The XBTC exchange did not reply to CoinDesk’s email request for comment.  According to photos and video clips from a BHB project gala held on Jan. 25, obtained by BHB users and reviewed by CoinDesk, Li appeared onstage at the Azure Qiantang luxury hotel in Hangzhou where he referred to himself as the founder of BHB.  The gala featured lucky draws meant to reward winners with Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury cars, as well as 3 million yuan (about $450,000) in cash. Only XBTC.CX users with more than 10,000 BHB and who signed up more than 10 other users to the exchange – each holding more than 700 BHB – were eligible to attend.  And Li’s association with XBTC.CX and BHB is traceable in other ways not tied to the event.  The MoCapital domain is registered by a firm called Moha Technology based in the city of Jinan in China’s Shandong province. According to China's business registration database, Renbing Li owns Moha Technology.  The Jan. 25 event at the Hangzhou hotel was also registered under the name of Moha Technology, according to a customer representative of the hotel.  Further investigation shows that Moha has a fully-owned subsidiary in China called Bihang Blockchain based in Hangzhou, which invested in XBTC, according to a verified job post by Bihang on a third-party recruiting agency.  $20 million raised  However, while some are raising the alarm about the project, others have been cashing in – data from XBTC shows $21 million in BHB is now changing hands daily for USDT.  Following the initial listing, XBTC had been publishing daily updates on dividend payouts, touting how many users had received a dividend each day. On Jan 24, the exchange claimed a total of 25,732 users on the platform received dividends.  With a minimum reward threshold of 700 BHB, the project’s exchange-based referral program would have attracted those 25,000 investors to purchase at least 18 million of the tokens.  And data from XBTC showed the initial listing price for BHB was about $1.10 on Dec. 2, which later doubled within just a month. Even assuming all the investors bought in during early December, that would put the proceeds at around $20 million.  However, signs suggest that enthusiasm may be slowing.  On Jan. 27, two days after the gala, a major sell-off took place on the exchange, which resulted in BHB dropping from $1.70 to as low as $0.60 within an hour. It then further plunged to $0.20 in the next two days.  Following that, XBTC said on Jan 28 and Jan 29 that the number of users who received payouts dropped to 19,873 and 17,358, respectively.  To prevent a run on the proverbial bank, the exchange abruptly announced on Jan. 31 it would suspend paying out dividends and freeze all BHB withdrawals during the Chinese new year in early February, and would only reopen withdrawal gradually afterward.  That note apparently calmed investors, as afterward the price of BHB rose to $2 within just two days. But the exchange has made no updates on the status ever since, regarding further dividends or withdrawal.  Further, while trading for BHB against USDT is still enabled on XBTC, users in BHB's WeChat groups have been complaining that since early February the project has also frozen BHB investors' withdrawal requests for USDT.  The project has made no announcements on the issue. Representatives of the project told investors in the WeChat groups that it's working to resolve the matter by March 6, but did not give further details.

42402612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblK8,1551283254,Fidelity Joins $1.9 Million Round in Blockchain Data Startup Coin Metrics,"Blockchain analytics startup Coin Metrics has closed a $1.9 million seed round with Fidelity Investments, Highland Capital Partners and Dragonfly Capital.  Announced today, the startup also released its first suite of commercial products for institutions seeking customized research reports.  Coin Metrics co-founder and board chairman Nic Carter told CoinDesk that institutional investors aren’t satisfied with the current crop of price aggregation services that don’t distinguish the integrity of different data sets.  “One thing we’re looking at is building out whitelists of exchanges so that the market reference rates are actually based on credible exchanges, as opposed to exchanges that engage in wash trading and other types of nonsense,” Carter said. (Castle Island Ventures, an investment firm he co-founded, led the round.)  Aside from looking at exchange activity and prices, Coin Metrics also analyzes blockchain data with a methodology that aims to help traders cut through the noise, as Carter put it. For example, purchasing bitcoin on an exchange platform might lead to several hops across wallets related to the platform’s back-end storage. Failing to account for such patterns could artificially inflate transaction data.  “Not all of this is meaningful and economic, only a fraction of this is,"" Carter said of the importance of correctly mapping patterns of activity on the blockchain.  Meanwhile, ConsenSys and Thomson Reuters alum Tim Rice, the CEO of Coin Metrics since November 2018, will “drive market data products for institutions,” according to Carter. Rice will strive to translate traditional securities metrics to the cryptocurrency market.  “We’ll be offering not only network data, but also market data and indexes as well,” Rice told CoinDesk. “We have approximately 15,000 IP addresses coming onto our site on a weekly basis, and we believe we can convert 20 percent of those into paying customers.”  Data demand  Dragonfly Capital co-founder Alex Pack told CoinDesk he’s eager to see more mature metrics applied to the space.  “There are a lot of competitors,” Pack told CoinDesk. “But the thing we liked most about Coin Metrics is they are crypto natives who have been around for years with a nonprofit, open source model.”  Fidelity, meanwhile, is on the cusp of launching a digital asset trading and custody service for institutional clients, so its interest in supporting high-quality research for the space makes sense.  ""Coin Metrics, Inc., delivers transparent and actionable data to various industry stakeholders,"" Fidelity said in a blog post. ""We applaud their achievements and look forward to working alongside their talented team to interpret crypto-assets market and network data.""  Several startups are rushing to accommodate the growing demand for blockchain analytics. Chainalysis, the incumbent startup in the space, raised $30 million earlier this month to expand services in Europe. Italian startup Neutrino was recently acquired by crypto exchange Coinbase. Those two firms, however, focus on tracking bad actors and helping businesses comply with regulations more than providing investment insights like Coin Metrics.  Squarely in the institutional investor space, though, is the analytics startup Flipside Crypto, which raised $4.5 million in November 2018 from Coinbase Ventures and others.

42402614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblN5,1551283203,Polymath Tests Show Security Tokens Can Be Compliant on a DEX,"Security token platform Polymath has teamed up with Loopring to trial peer-to-peer trading of security tokens on a decentralized exchange.  Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Wednesday, Polymath said that the ""successful"" tests – which used smart contracts on Loopring's DEX protocol – demonstrated that only authorized trades of ST-20 security tokens were able to execute, while unauthorized trades could not.  The ST-20 security token standard created by Polymath is an extension of the more generalized ERC-1400 standard that introduces the ability to restrict transfers of blockchain tokens. ""They can only be held and traded if certain criteria are met,"" Polymath said.  Giving the details of the test, Polymath said that it traded a cryptocurrency called ""wrapped ETH"" with an ST-20 token named Cammazol, with an authorized transfer for the token succeeding (see it here) and an unauthorized one failing to transfer (see it here).  Polymath vice president for marketing Graeme Moore told CoinDesk that the two firms carried out the tests to demonstrate that security tokens can be traded in a compliant manner, even on decentralized exchanges.  Moore said:  “What we are showcasing here is that decentralized exchanges and security token issuers have the ability to maintain compliance through the standardized protocols that Polymath and others have built. And, in fact, security tokens make it easier for issuers to follow regulations, when compared with the legacy capital markets system using paper share certificates.”  Detailing how it works, Polymath said that every time a trade is attempted, the token calls its transfer manager module and effectively asks, ""Can this trade be executed?"" The transfer manager then checks a whitelist (controlled by the token issuer) to see if the buyer and the seller are allowed to trade the token. Only if the answer is yes is the trade executed.  “This is how tokens are able to maintain compliance in the secondary market throughout the entire life-cycle of the token,” Moore said.  ""Loopring’s focus on user experience with their protocol was a great match for Polymath powered ST20 tokens which support an enhanced feature set on top of ERC20 to allow transfers to be fully validated before execution,” Adam Dossa, director of technology at Polymath, told CoinDesk.

The latest to receive a payment in a chain of transaction now known as the""Lightning Torch"" are the digital assets team at financial giant Fidelity Investments and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, both of whom joined the effort within the last few days.  Fidelity Digital Assets tweeted:  ""We and our research team at the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology have received the #LNTorch ⚡from @Wiz. Who should we pass it to? ""  The lightning network is an up-and-coming – yet still experimental – technology being built as an extra layer to bitcoin, allowing users to pass funds around the world quickly and without a third party, unlike more traditional payments options like Mastercard and Paypal.  The Lightning Torch showcases the technology, with Twitter accounts receiving the ""torch"" – a lightning payment – and passing it on after adding a nominal amount of bitcoin to the total. The experiment was kicked in mid-January off by an enthusiast, called Hodlonaut on Twitter, and has since been passed among prominent members of the crypto community and globally known individuals including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.  Dorsey said at the time:  “Cool example of #BitcoinTwitter experimenting on the lightning network.”  The experiment has also been called the “LN Trust Chain,” since current holders are supposed to send it on to someone they trust will send the payment on, rather than keep it to themselves.  So far the torch has passed through at least 137 countries and has been held 224 times, according to a sitehttps://www.takethetorch.online/Torch set up to track the chain of transactions.

42402657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblUx,1551265205,Bitcoin Price On Track to End Six-Month Losing Streak,"View  Bitcoin appears on track to snap its six-month losing streak and close February in the green for the fifth consecutive year. BTC may remain better bid in March, as the weekly chart is signaling bearish exhaustion.  The short-term outlook remains bullish, with BTC holding above $3,714 and a bounce from 10-candle MA on the three-day chart could yield a move toward $4,000.  On the downside, a UTC close below $3,714 would validate a bearish outside reversal candle seen in the three-day chart and open the doors to levels below $3,400.  The outlook as per the monthly chart remains bearish, as moving average studies are still trending south. The bearish setup would be invalidated if and when prices clear the resistance of the trendline falling from December 2017 highs, currently at $5,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to end its record six-month losing streak with modest gains in February.  The crypto market leader is currently trading at $3,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 10 percent gain on the monthly opening price of $3,434, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Had BTC remained bid at highs above $4,100 seen over the weekend, the monthly gain would have been close to 20 percent.  Nevertheless, a 10 percent rise – assuming prices stay at $3,800 till UTC close tomorrow – will be the first positive monthly performance since July.  Prices dropped 9, 6, 4.4, 37, 7 and 7.5 percent, respectively, in the previous six months, the longest stretch of monthly losses on record. Notably, November’s double-digit drop did the most damage, with prices tumbling below the long-held support of $6,000 and dashing hopes of a long-term bullish reversal from that level.  The sell-off, however, ran out of steam near $3,300 in the last two months, allowing BTC to post a notable bounce in the historically positive month of February.  More importantly, as we enter the final month of the first quarter, signs of bearish exhaustion have emerged on longer duration charts, as discussed earlier this week. BTC, therefore, could remain better bid in March – a weak month for the leading cryptocurrency since 2014.  Monthly chart  A break above the descending trendline connecting the December 2017 and November 2018 highs is needed to invalidate the bearish view.  Weekly chart  On the above chart, the 50-week MA has dropped below the 100-week MA for the first time since early 2015. That long-term bearish crossover is widely considered a lagging indicator. Further, historical data shows the previous bear market ended with the bear cross of the same two averages.  Further, the cryptocurrency created an inverted bullish hammer last week, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-term MA crossover.  BTC, therefore, may remain on the offensive next month.  3-day chart  BTC created a bearish outside reversal (engulfing) candle yesterday, countering the bullish outside reversal created in three days to Feb. 8. A bullish-to-bearish reversal, however, would be confirmed only if BTC finds acceptance under $3,714.  That looks unlikely, as the 10-candle MA, currently placed just below $3,700, is trending north and could recharge engines for a re-test of $4,000.

After being almost silent since the breach, the firm published a series of updates via Twitter on Wednesday. Most notably, Cryptopia provided an update on how much of the total assets held by the platform was lost in the cyber-attack, saying:  ""We are continuing to work on assessing the impact incurred as a result of the hack in January. Currently, we have calculated that worst case 9.4% of our total holdings was stolen.""  It did not provide an idea of that amount in monetary terms.  Cryptopia went offline on Jan. 15 saying it had suffered a ""security breach which resulted in significant losses."" The exchange did not provide any specific information at the time and has since said it cannot comment while an investigation by the New Zealand Police is underway.  A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the attack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost. Notably, hackers still had control over Cryptopia even after the police had been brought in and reportedly stole an additional 1,675 ether from 17,000 wallets – an amount worth about $181,000 at the time.  In Wednesday’s tweets, the exchange said it is “securing each wallet individually” to ensure it is “fully secure” when resuming trading.  Cryptopia also warned:  “As a result of the new wallets please immediately refrain from depositing funds into old Cryptopia addresses. We have more updates to come tomorrow, keep an eye on our page.”  New Zealand Police said on Feb. 7 that it expected to complete the inspection of Cryptopia’s premises by mid-month. Cryptopia confirmed in a tweet on Feb. 14 that the police had given them access back to its building, while the investigation was continuing.  Detective inspector Greg Murton of the New Zealand Police said at the time that the case is “progressing well and advancing on several fronts,” adding:  “The focus is on identifying those behind this offending and retrieving the stolen cryptocurrency.

Announced by Sony on Wednesday, Sony Global Education, Fujitsu Ltd. and the Fujitsu Research Institute have launched a field trial to evaluate the utility of blockchain tech in the management of course records and exam grades. Also collaborating on the trial is Human Academy, an educational institution that serves foreign students.  The trial will see foreign students aiming to study in Japan take a course preparing them for the Nihongo Kentei language proficiency test.  Students will use Fujitsu's Fisdom*2 digital learning platform as part of the course, with data including study logs and test grades being immutably stored and managed on a blockchain. The data will be provided to students as an ""unfalsifiable"" digital certificate, Sony said.  Growing numbers of foreign workers and students are coming to Japan, and many must provide the results of Japanese classes and exams taken before arriving in the country to take start employment or education.  However, Sony said that it's not always easy to confirm foreign students' course results.  ""In terms of language ability, this has led to issues as appropriate instruction suited to a person's ability was not provided after coming to Japan, and the institution was subsequently unable to offer job search support,"" the company explained.  Educational data provided over a blockchain can potentially provide educational institutions with a more reliable idea of a prospective student's ability at speaking Japanese, Sony explained, as well as verification that the student actually took the course.  The news marks Sony's latest initiative to utilize blockchain in education. In 2017, the company developed a new educational platform in partnership with IBM that uses blockchain to secure and share student records.  It filed for a related patent the same year, setting out how nodes on an education blockchain network could be run by teachers, students or other parties that might need access to those records. “Educational experiences” would be cemented on the chain after being signed by the relevant users and could be exchanged, transacted and transferred via the blockchain as a ""smart property.""

The company's big idea is providing platforms to automate the entire life cycle for the issuance of financial instruments – bonds, equities, derivatives – and leveraging public blockchains for registration and settlement so that humans don't need to touch anything and a corporate can do a self-service issuance.  Nivaura CEO Dr. Avtar Sehra said that this year, Nivaura plans ""a series of high-profile, large-scale projects with high-caliber partners to demonstrate our platform as a valuable solution across the full spectrum of capital markets primary issuance activities,"" adding:  ""We’re seeing growing appetite from major financial institutions for practical innovation that goes beyond buzzwords and conceptual PoCs in ‘digital investment banking.’""  Nivaura is also beefing up its board, adding Nikhil Rathi, the CEO of the London Stock Exchange, and Lake, who is also joining as an advisor.  “The investment strengthens our existing relationship with Nivaura and underlines the Group’s partnership approach in innovating to support our clients in accessing global investment pools,"" Rathi, who is also head of international development for the exchange's parent company LSEG, said in a press release.  Regulatory chops  The investment also represents a deepening of Nivaura's ties with LSEG. Previously, the exchange operator worked with Nivaura on the issuance of tokenized securities as part of the regulatory sandbox program of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Through this work, Nivaura has acquired expertise in arcane but important regulations such as the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the FCA Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS), which apply both to traditional market infrastructure as well as using tokenized instruments and blockchains.  Sehra told CoinDesk:  “What we are doing is not magical. We are technologists and financial engineers, but we also understand regulation very deeply. We work within the existing regulation rather than try to drive change in regulation because that's very hard. To change legislation takes decades.”  Figuring out how tokenized securities can be traded in Europe under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CDSR) has meant Nivaura needed to also increase its legal firepower. To that end, it's made a senior hire: Richard Cohen, a seasoned debt capital markets lawyer, is moving from Allen & Overy to become Nivaura’s general counsel and head of strategy.  Sehra explained that working with CSDR and MiFID is very complex in and of itself and the firm needed to bolster specific expertise in compliance, as well as in financial instruments, to complement what it does with technology and engineering.  “We re-engineered some of our key workflows to make tokenized instruments compliant under CSDR. Then it doesn't matter which blockchain you use – a private or public one – ultimately the token created on that chain will comply under CSDR and can be traded on a regulated trading venue,” he said.  Chain-agnostic  The work Nivaura has publicized so far with tokenized securities has all been done on public blockchains, first the bitcoin blockchain and then later using ethereum.  Sehra pointed out the official position of the company is blockchain-agnostic, just as traditional market participants are not beholden to any single clearing house.  “Like, we don't say you can't go into Clearstream if you use Euroclear,” said Sehra, adding that clients can use a software development kit (SDK) to plug into any clearing system they like, blockchain-based or otherwise.  Currently, the business that’s generating revenue for Nivaura is its workflow management and automation platform for primary capital markets, couched in traditional market infrastructure, noted Sehra.  But while that work pays the bills, the company is preparing for the financial industry's transformation, he said, concluding:  “The blockchain aspect we are considering, it's not something banks and other firms will want to use right now. But ultimately we think that's where the future is and that's why clients are working with us.”  London Stock Exchange image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/27/london-stock-exchange-leads-20-million-fundraise-for-blockchain-startup-nivaura,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8133499daf8c3ef72244989ea90d1dcad7383b8-1770x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblTy,1551238812,How the Coming Constantinople Hard Fork Could Stir Up Ether Markets,"Ether price volatility could spike in the days ahead, courtesy of an upcoming ethereum upgrade scheduled for Thursday.  The Constantinople hard fork, a planned two-part upgrade to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, is scheduled to occur once block 7,280,000 on the ethereum blockchain is mined. At the time of writing, ether’s block height is 7,272,826, meaning the fork should occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, given that roughly 4,200 blocks have been mined per day for the past two weeks.  However, the change could draw the interest of more than just developers and users, as historical data shows ether price volatility tends to spike hours before a software upgrade.  For instance, ether price volatility picked up with the Byzantium hard fork release on Oct. 16, 2017, with the resulting uncertainty forcing traders to sell ETH and unwind their long positions leading to a 20 percent price slide.  As shown in the chart above, traders on that date were unwilling to invest amid a change to the underlying ethereum protocol.  The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), used to gauge momentum as well as buying and selling pressure, demonstrated a break into bullish territory (a move above 0) on Nov. 14, 2017 after a brief visit below when prices went through a 20-day consolidation period.  Overall, it took a total of 34 days for ether’s price to break above the sideways channel after the fork occurred, so if history repeats itself, ether prices may be destined for a multi-week sideways trend after the Constantinople upgrade takes place.  Current Conditions  Still, it's also worth noting current trading conditions and the overall bear market for cryptocurrencies at present.  ETH/USD witnessed a considerable sell-off Sunday when its price dropped 17 percent after having clocked a three-month high earlier in the day. The CMF on the daily time frame was still printing a value above zero, so a bearish view is not yet confirmed as per the indicator.  However, if bears continue to drag price lower, the sell-off would likely be short and fast unless the amount of selling volume increases substantially, in which case it would add credence to the fall and put the price at risk of falling below the prior support level $123.  If the Constantinople fork aftermath resembles that of what transpired in ether markets following the Byzantium fork, ether prices should not exceed a drop beyond 20 percent. It's also possible that delays in the scheduled update could impact the market, and traders may want to be prepared accordingly.  The Constantinople hard fork was delayed in January of this year due to unforeseen mistakes during testing, a move that caused a slight drop in the ether price, as reported by MarketWatch at the time.
