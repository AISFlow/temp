42378981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhCb,1479764792,Santander Quits R3 Blockchain Consortium,"Spanish banking giant Banco Santander is no longer a member of the R3 blockchain consortium, CoinDesk has learned.  The news comes hours after it was revealed that Goldman Sachs, one of the original 12 members of the consortium effort, would depart the group. At press time, Goldman Sachs has not yet stated its reason for leaving, though it is known R3 is now soliciting as much as $150m in funding from its members.  A spokesperson for Santander was similarly tight-lipped about the bank's decision to leave, indicating he could not provide more details about its departure.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We have made the decision to abandon the consortium.""  A source close to the deal indicates that Santander is among a small number of firms that may have privately withdrawn from the consortium in recent weeks, and that a planned funding round is still moving ahead.  While Santander did not comment, the decision does not appear to be linked to Goldman Sachs' decision to withdraw.  In response, officials at R3CEV reiterated a statement issued earlier in the day:  ""Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.""  R3 did not offer additional comment on the status of its fundraising.

42378990,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhPB,1479754691,Australian Government Pushes for Bitcoin Accounting Standards,"The Australian government’s financial reporting standards agency is pushing for international action in the area of digital currencies.  The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), a government agency tasked with overseeing the country’s reporting standards, has published a new position paper ahead of a December meeting of members from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In sum, the paper argues that a more defined standard is needed both for digital currencies as well as other kinds of intangible assets.  The question of accounting standards has come up in the past, but the AASB’s paper might be one of the more consequential to date. Its release comes amid a controversial move by the Internal Revenue Service, the top US tax agency, to seek user records from digital currency exchange Coinbase.  According to the AASB paper, “clear” guidance is needed by accountants working with individuals or companies that handle digital currencies.  The paper’s author, Deloitte director Henri Venter, wrote:  “In our opinion, given the problems identified and the rapid growth of digital currencies, standard setting activity is required to provide clear accounting guidance for preparers and to ensure that financial statements provide relevant and useful information to users of those financial statements.”  Yet such a move would only solve part of the problem, the paper goes on to argue. At the heart of the issue is that there is a deeper lack of standards for so-called “intangible assets”, which would include digital currencies.  “...there is no accounting standard that deals with investments in intangible assets or other commodity type assets that are not financial instruments or inventory,” the paper notes. “Consequently, we recommend that the IASB develop a standard that would address the accounting for investments in intangible assets and commodities.""  The Accounting Standards Advisory Forum, a body within the IASB, is set to meet on 8th and 9th December in London. According to documents published by the IASB, members will offer their takes on possible paths to creating standards for digital currencies.

42378985,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhRh,1479741297,Germany's Central Bank is Hosting a Blockchain Conference,"Germany’s central bank is hosting a four-day conference on blockchain this week.  Dubbed “Blockchain Technology – Opportunities and Challenges”, the event is being organized by the Deutsche Bundesbank in partnership with the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. Topics up for debate include the future of bitcoin and applications of the tech in both finance and beyond.  The event is drawing attendees from regulatory bodies like the Bundesbank, the European Central Bank and the Prudential Regulation Authority, as well as startups like Monax, Digital Asset Holdings, Ripple and R3.  The Bundesbank said in a statement:  “This workshop addresses technological achievements of Blockchain and possible business cases especially in the financial sector. It tries to answer the question whether Bitcoin has a future in payments and illustrates examples for a possible use of Blockchain Technology.”  The Bundesbank has called the for regulation of bitcoin in the past, with Deutsche Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele describing the digital currency as a vehicle for speculation in a 2014 interview. More recently, board member Andreas Dombret opined that the technology could deliver significant efficiency gains but likely won’t replace the institutions that may one day adopt it.

42378982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhQR,1479737159,Overstock Could Raise $30 Million With Blockchain Stock Offering,"A discreet website with a domain that's difficult to decipher is currently in the process of making financial history.  For the past week, anyone who entered 'kccbd.t0.com' into a web browser would be prompted to create an account with Keystone Capital Corporation, ""powered by tØ"". Far from jibberish, the site is the point of entry to a first-of-its kind blockchain-powered security offering.  Unveiled last year, tØ is a product of Overstock's Medici division aimed at cutting out financial sector middlemen by moving the post-trade process to a shared, distributed ledger.  While many details of the effort are being kept behind a closed veil of secrecy during the so-called ""silent period"", Overstock has confirmed that the very first subscriptions have already been received.  The company told CoinDesk:  ""Because we’re in the middle of the offering/subscription period, we can't provide numbers, or insight into how it's being received. We can say the system is up and running and people are subscribing.""  Fortunately for industry professionals looking to glean insight into the process (and maybe even learn from it for their own efforts), Overstock is a publicly traded firm and much of the process is being documented for investors to follow.  Just last week, Overstock launched its rights offering designed to let existing investors purchase shares of its preferred stock, including shares to be issued using tØ's blockchain technology, according to an SEC filing.  These blockchain shares will trade exclusively on the registered alternative trading system using blockchain technology, and will reach a maximum price of $15.68 per share.  A document titled ""Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock"" details the exact nature of the offering. In total, 2 million shares of Series A preferred stock are expected to be offered, though that number may change. This is an increase of 1 million shares over an earlier document.  Based on the SEC filing that established the maximum price of $15.68, the broker-dealer will receive a $1.25 fee for each share sold, resulting in proceeds for Overstock of $14.43. At that rate, if all 2 million shares are sold, that would result in a maximum fundraise of $31.36m, with $28.86m proceeds for Overstock.  The subscription period will end on 6th December, while trading itself is expected to begin 15th December, exactly one year after the SEC approved Overstock’s plans to offer securities on a blockchain.  The high price of disruption  Also notable is that in SEC documents published the day before Overstock launched its subscription period, the online retailer revealed exactly how much the work has cost.  The breakdown across multiple categories puts into perspective an earlier report that the company was losing money on the venture at a rapid rate.  Earlier this month, Overstock reported a $3m pretax loss for the third quarter of this year. We now know that Overstock spent $2.5m in expenses related specifically to the rights offering.  Specifically, $1.9m was spent on legal fees and expenses, $260,000 was spent on accounting fees an expenses and $76,000 was spent on printing and engraving, among other expenses.  The support network  Though Overstock is footing the bill, it is not pulling off the offering alone.  Shares and interest of the stock will be transferred through the record holder's account with a designated broker-dealer using an alternative trading system registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The system itself is operated by PRO Securities LLC, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and partially owned by Overstock.  In September, tØ revealed its partnership with Keystone Capital Corporation to provide brokerage services support, and earlier this month, Overstock announced that Source Capital Group would serve as a dealer-manager.  Overstock has committed to paying Source Capital 8.0% of the proceeds, consisting of a 6.0% commission, a 1.8% non-accountable expense fee and an out-of-pocket accountable expense allowance of 0.2%, according to an SEC filing.  Bullish stocks  With speculation about the potential impact of blockchain on the post-trade market still in overdrive, Overstock's stock recently broke its 52-week high.  The stock reached a peak of $17.96 a share, according to an Equities.com report, making the e-commerce company valued at $463m.  While it can be difficult to tie such surges to any particular event, that hasn’t keep market observers from weighing in.  Earlier this month, a Seeking Alpha analyst brushed off Overstock's value and barely even registered the blockchain technology development as worth mentioning.  Then, yesterday, another Seeking Alpha analyst wrote that Overstock was ""oozing value"", adding that its ""blockchain investments depend of future cash flows.""  Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne on the other hand, is not hedging his bets.  In the SEC document, Byrne concluded:  ""Issuing history’s first public blockchain security is to the world of finance what Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier was to aviation. This is the start of a new age for global capital markets.""

42378980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhMf,1479734717,Goldman Sachs Leaves R3 Blockchain Consortium,"Goldman Sachs has reportedly elected not to renew its membership in blockchain consortium R3CEV.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the bank has left the group, but notably intends to continue developing blockchain projects on its own. (Goldman Sachs is an investor in blockchain technology startups Circle and Digital Asset Holdings).  In response to the departure, R3 has said that exits among members are to be expected over time.  A spokesman told the Journal:  ""Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.""  Adding new pressures to the partnership may be that the consortium startup is currently seeking funding from members, and that there have been disagreements over how much equity the firm should receive given that it also collects membership fees.  Documents obtained by CoinDesk dated in October indicate the banks involved are seeking for the equity structure to be similar to past financial consortiums (where equity could be as low as 10%), while R3 has asked for up to 40% of the company, including 10% equity for employees.  Negotiations have been ongoing for months, though sources have offered varying estimations of their progress.

42378969,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhHd,1479733241,UBS Eyes Blockchain in China Expansion,"UBS is expanding its footprint in China, a move that will also see the Swiss banking group boost its funding for blockchain research.  According to a report from the Shanghai Daily, UBS is opening a new business centre in the city of Wuxi, to feature a staff of about 200 when it opens. UBS has indicated that it wants to expand the business centre to about 500 staffers over the next three years, with an eye to double the amount of business it does in China during that period.  In an interview with the Chinese newspaper, UBS group COO Axel Lehmann said that the bank is investigating projects like a new settlement system in a bid to achieve greater efficiency.  Lehmann told the publication:  ""In this regard, it's a very important area for us to invest in to improve our overall value offering. So we are cooperating with our own in-house innovation labs as well as promoting an open architecture to share our information and data.""  Like other banks of its size, UBS has spent much of the past two years testing applications in the areas of transaction settlement and trade finance. The bank is also a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium.

42378993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhZF,1479726005,The Most Worrying Slide in the State of Blockchain,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  Our latest State of Blockchain report is a good read, full of original graphics, details and quotes that highlight shifts and market trends in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors.  But, one slide (pictured below) got me thinking...  The lack of funding announcements for ethereum-based businesses compared to those relying on bitcoin is striking, even when you narrow the focus to just this year.  It's also surprising, taking into account the overall positive market sentiment towards the blockchain platform (see our Spotlight Study), and it's worrying.  The business case appears to be there. Ethereum appeals to large enterprises, and startups are using it to develop decentralized applications (dapps) with interesting use cases. Most have a relatively clear path to monetization.  Given ethereum's business-friendly smart contracts functionality, why aren't more VCs nosing around?  Part of the answer lies in the graphic above: check out the box at the right. ICOs are initial coin offerings, or tokens issued by a dapp and offered to the public.  The participants in these crowdsales tend to be either potential users of the service, or investors who hope to re-sell the token on an exchange at a higher price. The trickle turning into a stream that you see in the list has not slowed down – in November alone, there will have been at least five.  Obviously, ICOs are a much more predominant source of financing for ethereum businesses than VC capital.  But why? And what does it mean?  ICOs carry significant strategic advantages: The business retains its independence, does not have to give away any equity (though this depends on the type of token it uses) and has no outside interference in its board.  The application in question gets access to an engaged community of users and investors. In a way, it efficiently takes care of the financing and marketing at the same time.  ICOs are easier to pull off than VC investment, since the business does not have to run the gamut of vetting by analysts and seasoned investors. The ""market"" will decide if the idea is good or not.  For many, ICOs may be the only option. VC investors are probably staying away from ethereum businesses for now because of the digital currency's relative youth. And The DAO hack as well as recent DDoS attacks on its blockchain will almost certainly have impacted their eagerness to jump into untested waters.  These compelling reasons highlight why ICOs are a good fit for young startups looking to harness a public blockchain.  However, they reveal an underlying weakness in the ethereum startup sector, one which could affect its development and sustainability going forward.  Let's take a look at the dangers hidden in those advantages:  Less interference means less support, which means less ""mature"" management and experienced leadership. Startups that go straight to ICO will miss out on the benefits VCs can bring, including contacts, vision and expertise.  The engaged community of users and investors is probably not in it for the long haul, and is not really interested in the health of the business. Users may end up dumping the assets if the utility doesn't meet expectations or if something better comes along. Token investors want trading gains more than they want profits (since they generally don’t get to share in those), and can exit any time.  Relying on the judgement of the ""market"" for the ICO tokens as a barometer of sustainability is misleading, since it does not generally focus on the fundamentals. The product-market fit, long-term strategy and strength of the management team are secondary to short-term traction and cool functions.  VC investment in ethereum is likely to pick up as the technology evolves. Unless, of course, ICOs become so entrenched in the market’s mentality that venture capital is edged out.  There you have one of the biggest risks to the sector: that it becomes addicted to the quick thrill of crowdfunding at the expense of future development.  The current focus on crowdsourced finance may be ideal for raising visibility and getting test models out into the market. It could, however, end up undermining the resources and the resilience of the industry of tomorrow.
