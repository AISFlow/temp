42375990,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDRvf,1634687159,US Lawmakers Push Back on Facebook’s Novi Wallet Launch,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – A group of U.S. lawmakers say Facebook cannot be trusted to launch a digital currency.  In a Tuesday missive, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) ordered Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to “immediately discontinue the company’s pilot of Novi” and end its work on the diem stablecoin project.  The lawmakers said Facebook cannot be trusted to protect user data or manage a payments network, in an open letter Tuesday just hours after Facebook announced it was launching a pilot program for its Novi wallet subsidiary in the U.S. and Guatemala.  Read more: Facebook’s Novi Taps Paxos, Coinbase Ahead of Diem Rollout  Under the pilot project, Facebook will let users purchase Paxos dollars (USDP) and custody the funds with Coinbase.  ”We urge you to immediately discontinue your Novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring Diem to market,” the lawmakers wrote on Tuesday.  Libra 2.0  The backlash is reminiscent of the response to the original libra announcement. At the time, Facebook unveiled a massive stablecoin vision that drew the ire of lawmakers and regulators around the world, including both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.  Tuesday’s letter referenced the past pushback, and noted that at the time both Zuckerberg and Facebook payments chief David Marcus had committed to not launching until they had secured regulatory approvals.  “To be clear, your ability to secure state-issued money transmitter licenses is not equivalent to obtaining the blessing of ‘all U.S. regulators,’ as you said in your testimony two years ago,” the letter said.  The lawmakers also pointed to Facebook’s other interactions with Congress, including allegations that the company may have misled lawmakers in the past.  Tuesday’s letter also pointed to the fact finance regulators are currently examining the global stablecoin industry, with at least one set of recommendations expected soon from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets.  “In addition to the risks products like Diem pose to financial stability, you have not offered a satisfactory explanation for how Diem will prevent illicit financial flows and other criminal activity,” they wrote.  After the publication of this article, a Novi spokesperson said, “We look forward to responding to the Committee’s letter.”  UPDATE (Oct. 20, 2021, 04:50 UTC): Adds Novi statement.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/us-lawmakers-push-back-on-facebooks-novi-wallet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b87be7b01edc77465b8f5ee85625a0a09dfc513d-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm, which is based in Austin, Texas, intends to complete the fundraising by the end of this year, according to the story, which cited fundraising materials that the publication had seen.  The initiative comes less than six months after Multicoin Capital raised $100 million for its second crypto venture fund.  It is the latest in a series of large funds that major venture capital firms have created this year or are creating to focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. In June, Andreessen Horowitz raised $2.2 billion for its third crypto fund. Paradigm, the cryptocurrency venture capital firm led by Fred Ehrsam, who co-founded crypto exchange Coinbase, is looking to close a $1.5 billion fund for startup investments, according to documents viewed by CoinDesk.  Multicoin Capital will be looking to invest in crypto companies that others might miss as managing partner Tushar Jain has called blockchain “the best social good in the world.”  In an email to CoinDesk, a Multicoin Capital spokesperson said the firm had no comment on The Information report.

42376001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDS8F,1634687022,"Market Wrap: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF Rises in Trading Debut, Sending BTC Higher","Bitcoin rose to a six-month high at around $63,000 as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO), the first bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund to trade in the U.S., made its debut on Tuesday.  BITO ended the trading day up 4.65% at near $41.80 per share. As of 4:02 p.m. ET, shortly after the close of U.S. stock markets on Monday, the ETF’s trading volume had reached 23.9 million shares, worth more than $1 billion based on the closing price, ranking the investment vehicle as one of the top ETF launches in history.  Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF Trends, tweeted that trading in BITO appeared “orderly” and “stable” in the early moments after the ETF went live.  BITO is structured to invest in bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, rather than investing in the cryptocurrency directly, which is one reason why some analysts don’t expect the fund to have a significant impact on BTC’s spot price.  “We do not expect the introduction of futures ETFs to drive a price impact as significant as we would see from a pure spot Bitcoin ETF vehicle,” Christopher Brendler, managing director at asset management firm D.A. Davidson, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Brendler also mentioned that contango can cause losses for some investors in commodity ETFs that use futures contracts. Contango occurs when the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price. “But these losses can be avoided by buying ETFs that hold actual commodities,” Brendler wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $64,016, +4.42%  Ether (ETH): $3,810, +1.98%  S&P 500: $4,519, +0.74%  Gold: $1,769, +0.33%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.63%  Bullish price action  In the spot market, BTC was well bid, rising about 3% over the past 24 hours. Buyers remained active after quickly absorbing a large sell order on crypto exchange OKEx during Asian daytime trading hours on Tuesday, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  And price action suggests bitcoin may be approaching another bullish rally.  BTC recorded its highest weekly close on record last week, topping the $61,500 weekly close on April 6, according to crypto research firm Delphi Digital. “Last week was one of the most decisive uptrends since Jan. 2021,” the firm wrote in a blog post.  Bitcoin options activity rises  Trading volume in the BTC options market accelerated over the past week, rising to $1.5 billion as investors anticipated the bitcoin futures ETF launch on Tuesday.  “Options trade volume has only reached levels this high on three prior occasions, all at similar price points [around $60,000 BTC] between March and May this year,” crypto data firm Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  A majority of positions appear to be call options, which gives the option buyer the right to purchase the underlying asset in the future at a predetermined price.  The chart below shows large open interest in call options with strike prices above $100,000 BTC expiring at the end of the year. That aligns with the overall bullish market sentiment, according to Glassnode.  Altcoin roundup  DraftKings to become Polygon validator: Sports betting giant DraftKings plans to work with the Polygon network to support the releases of custom non-fungible tokens and secondary-market transactions in its latest move to tap into the crypto industry, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported. The partnership will also allow DraftKings to contribute to Polygon’s governance, which gives token holders the option to suggest changes to the network after staking their tokens on the platform. Polygon expects DrafKing’s governance will start “in the next month,” a representative told CoinDesk.  Facebook’s Novi wallet goes live with Paxos stablecoin: Novi, Facebook’s digital wallet subsidiary, will go live and allow users to trade the paxos dollar (USDP) in a pilot program in the U.S. and Guatemala. Crypto exchange Coinbase will provide custody services for the program, CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reported. Facebook’s diem (formerly libra) stablecoin is expected to launch with Novi “once it receives regulatory approval and goes live,” according to a Facebook press release.  Sequoia Games Brings Augmented Reality to Board Games Using Algorand Blockchain: Algorand will be the digital ledger for Sequoia Games’ new Flex NBA product, an National Basketball Association-licensed board game that uses augmented reality, Eli Tan reported.

The largest cryptocurrency has climbed 33% over the past month on expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve the exchange-traded fund, which invests in futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrency.  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF started trading at 9:30 a.m. ET as the bell rang to open the day’s session on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock ticker is $BITO.  First-day trading volume in $BITO appeared strong, with at least 1.89 million shares of the ETF changing hands in the first couple hours, or more than $770 million worth.  As of press time at 17:32 coordinated universal time (13:52 p.m. ET) the $BITO share price was trading at $41.36, up 3.4% from the initial net asset value of $40. Over the same timeframe, bitcoin was up 2.3% to $63,197.  Market impact  The first of its kind in the U.S., the ETF offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to returns of BTC with the ease of buying a stock in a brokerage account. The SEC approved the ETF on Friday, and several other pending ETF proposals could win approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission later this week.  The big question for cryptocurrency traders is how much additional upward price pressure might come from the debut of the new ETF.  Michele Schneider, managing director at MarketGauge, said on CoinDeskTV Tuesday she likes to wait at least a week coming out of the gate with a new stock offering to evaluate whether it’s successful.  “So if we get good volatility, good liquidity and we develop some kind of ongoing interest and we see the coin itself continue to move up, then I think that would probably be enough evidence,” said Schneider.  The ProShares ETF is structured to invest in bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago-based CME, rather than investing in the cryptocurrency directly. So the ETF by itself won’t introduce any new demand for bitcoin. However, traders might buy more bitcoin as they look to hedge against the futures price or take advantage of pricing disparities.  According to data published on ProShares’ website, the ETF started the day with seed capital of $20 million:  Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF Trends, tweeted that trading in $BITO appeared “orderly” and “stable” in the early moments after the ETF went live.

42415738,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXJiP,1634675709,What to Make of the First Bitcoin Futures ETF Launch,"A bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched Tuesday morning – and saw strong demand from investors.  This indicates some amount of market maturity and acceptance from regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but also raises new questions about whether the format of the product is appropriate for investors and when a physical ETF may go live.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The narrative  The first bitcoin (futures) ETF in the U.S. began trading today, bookending an eight-year effort to launch a widely accessible, regulated bitcoin investment product.  Why it matters  Advocates of a bitcoin ETF have sought for literally years to launch such a product. They’re finally getting their wish, but not in full – the first product will be a bitcoin futures ETF.  While this is certainly something, it likely won’t receive the same amount of attention or asset inflow that a physical bitcoin ETF would have, which raises the question of whether a physical bitcoin ETF is possible at all, and what might need to happen to see one launch.  Breaking it down  Longtime readers may recall that in February I asked if 2021 would be the year we finally see a bitcoin ETF in the U.S.  At the time the conclusion I drew was, “Well, maybe.”  There was genuinely an immense amount of hope and hype that the SEC would finally approve a bitcoin ETF, with proponents pointing to how the bitcoin market has changed since 2018, the new administration in Washington and the growth of a regulated futures market.  And it turns out they were right! Sort of. A bitcoin futures ETF began trading this morning, a first for this type of product in the U.S. An actual physical bitcoin ETF still seems some time away, though. (On that front, Grayscale, which shares a parent company with CoinDesk, filed Tuesday to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF.)  What’s next?  So the race to be the first to launch a bitcoin-related ETF has ended. All eyes are on whoever will be second, and whether ProShares will have a massive first-mover advantage or not.  In theory, the next bitcoin futures ETF that could have launched would be Invesco, but the company announced it was pulling out late on Monday.  This leaves Valkyrie and VanEck with bitcoin futures ETFs that could launch as soon as Oct. 25, giving ProShares nearly a week to ride the initial wave of enthusiasm.  Valkyrie, at least, is moving to launch early. While the company hasn’t filed a post-effective amended prospectus as of Monday night, the firm did update its ticker, add pricing information and send initial listing information to the Bloomberg Terminal data team, all signs that it’s about ready to go.  To launch, Valkyrie would need explicit permission from the SEC, but it could follow ProShares pretty quickly if it receives that permission.  Gen, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said, “All this started when [SEC Chair Gary] Gensler outlined what he expected.”  Wen physical ETFs?  What isn’t clear is if/when a physically backed bitcoin ETF will launch.  Gensler’s comments would suggest that this won’t happen anytime soon, certainly not in 2021. ETF experts on Twitter say sometime in the fourth quarter of 2022 may be a reasonable expectation. Seyffart agreed.  “I view the futures ETF as a stepping stone,” he said. “I highly doubt the SEC will approve the product this year.”  Companies filing for ETFs seem unconvinced.  Bitwise Asset Management, which filed for a futures ETF in September, filed for a physical bitcoin ETF last week. CIO Matt Hougan said he believes the market itself is mature enough to support the product, citing data Bitwise compiled which ranks CME as the leading exchange for bitcoin price discovery.  On Grayscale’s ETF filing  The timing remains curious to me. Will Gensler or the SEC staff really become more comfortable with a physical ETF within the legally mandated time frame for Bitwise or Grayscale’s filings?  The answer may not depend on the SEC’s view of market maturity at all. While maturity and market surveillance were two key issues often cited by the SEC as it rejected bitcoin ETF applications in 2018 and 2019, Gensler’s more recent comments have largely focused on investor protections.  He said he was comfortable with the investor protections enshrined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, which oversees futures ETFs, when compared to the Securities Act of 1933, which oversees the physical ETFs.  The challenge for aspiring issuers may be drawing parallels between the futures ETFs and the physical ETFs and their respective investor protection clauses.  And just a quick personal aside: Bitcoin ETF stories are how I landed in the regulatory beat, but it’s still genuinely a surprise that one launched this morning (even if it is a futures filing).  Elsewhere:  DeFi on the Ballot: Yearn Developer Matt West Is Running for Congress  A Yearn.Finance developer and former MakerDAO lobbyist is running for the U.S. House of Representatives. Matt West told my colleague Andrew Thurman that he’s been considering this move for a while. What’s interesting to me is that while many other members of the crypto sphere have discussed running for office, many of those musings have been focused on how Congress treats crypto. West isn’t presenting himself as a single-issue candidate.  Crypto 2022: Policy Week  CoinDesk is kicking off a full week of policy coverage to coincide with DC Fintech Week. Spearheaded by my colleague Ben Schiller, expect a number of deeply reported articles and opinion contributions discussing policy within and outside of the U.S.  Crypto Learns to Play the DC Influence Game  While you should read all of the Policy Week stories, I wanted to highlight this feature by Rob Garver on the lobbying efforts around crypto. As crypto gains a larger profile in Washington, I would expect to see a lot more effort from businesses in advocating for specific types of regulation.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Crypto Twitter was one of the places you may have seen a ruckus about a proposed Treasury Dept./IRS move to collect certain information from bank accounts with more than $600 in them. The backlash, which came from lawmakers as well as industry players, seems to have spurred changes. The IRS will now report information from accounts that have gained more than $10,000 in non-wage income (i.e., your salary won’t count).  (Reuters) Minorities may be more likely to buy into bitcoin, largely due to lack of access to the traditional banking sector, Reuters reported, citing a number of surveys.

42424657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVgFh,1634671713,Kill the BitLicense,"On Monday, New York’s Attorney General Letitia James announced an order that two crypto lending platforms unregistered with the state cease operations in the state. The companies – their names redacted in a letter published by the James’ office – were ordered to cease all business activities in the state within 10 days.  The announcement calls attention to an austere regulatory framework that has made New York one of the most crypto-hostile states in the nation.  Alex Adelman is CEO and Aubrey Strobel is director of communications of New York-based bitcoin rewards app Lolli. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  As crypto becomes an increasingly profitable and innovative sector, disrupting industries from payments to the arts, states across the U.S. like Wyoming and Florida have moved to entice crypto companies to their borders. Meanwhile, New York, generally regarded as the financial capital of the world, has clung to regulations that make it immensely difficult for crypto companies, especially smaller startups, to operate in the state.  The state has doubled down on a regulatory framework that stifles innovation and prevents crypto startups from growing their operations in one of the world’s premier financial hubs. While New York City has become a buzzing center for the crypto community, the state’s regulatory framework is lethal for most crypto startups.  The pillar of New York’s regulatory approach to crypto is its BitLicense. New York’s BitLicense applies to a wide range of crypto organizations, including those transmitting crypto, buying and selling cryptocurrency as a customer business, providing exchange services to customers and issuing cryptocurrency. The license has staved off grassroots innovation in the city by ensuring that only companies with abundant disposable capital can shoulder its notoriously time and capital-intensive application and compliance measures.  The BitLicense negatively affects both companies and consumers in New York. New York state residents have dramatically limited trading options in crypto. They can only buy and sell coins from money transmitters registered in the state – of the hundreds of organizations offering services in the sector, only 20 have been issued BitLicenses in the last six years. No other state similarly curtails consumer trading options in crypto.  The stated purpose of the BitLicense upon its approval in 2015 by the state’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) was to protect consumers and guard against illicit activities like money laundering. However, the BitLicense has gone well beyond ensnaring ne’er-do-wells in crypto. By pouring pesticide on the industry, the BitLicense also zaps new shoots, indiscriminately stemming life in the sector such that only giants such as Square and Coinbase, both of which hold BitLicenses, can survive.  BitLicense holders and applicants have reported that the time allocation, legal fees and other costs drive the total cost of pursuing a BitLicense to more than $100,000, surpassing the means of most early stage startups. These include a 30-page application, $5,000 application fee, thousands of man-hours and the presentation of accounting and records from the last seven years. Of the 20 companies that have been issued BitLicenses, most are multi-billion dollar firms.  Notably, companies applying for a BitLicense are already beholden to both the stringent regulatory oversight and reporting requirements of federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the IRS and the Department of Justice (DOJ).  The BitLicense is a failed experiment  In 2015, the NYDFS proudly assured the public that other states would soon follow suit in emulating New York’s regulatory standards. Yet, in the six years since, no other state has issued requirements nearly as severe or extensive as those of the BitLicense.  The BitLicense is a failed experiment, widely criticized for crippling New York’s capacity to participate in the crypto sector’s boom and giving rise to more stalemates than solutions.  In 2020, the state revamped some of the license requirements, making it easier for some companies to receive conditional licenses. However, the most arduous parts of the application and adherence processes were largely left untouched.  The crypto industry is still in its relative youth and will undoubtedly experience tremendous growth in the years to come. As crypto continues to be at the nexus of innovation and profit in tech, states hostile to crypto like New York will lose out on revenue, talent and an opportunity to lead the way in effective, innovation-friendly regulatory frameworks.  The BitLicense’s roadblock to growth also places a firm ceiling on the potential of New York’s regional and local economies to grow in the coming years, as economic and technological trends drive us toward a future where information is increasingly decentralized and dependent on blockchain technology for the most secure digital infrastructure. New York’s BitLicense makes it probable that these products and companies, when they are built, will be built elsewhere.  Why, then, does New York continue its commitment to the BitLicense? It certainly helps that the primary source of NYDFS funding comes from institutional banks. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges threaten to disrupt the hegemony of the traditional banking system; therefore, one can easily see why the department would beat back companies disrupting traditional finance.  Beyond that, clinging to the BitLicense is irrational. The license is a relic, representing the NYDFS’ failed hopes that it would serve as a model for other states with its “regulation by strangulation” approach.

New York City is in a position to become a global leader in crypto by implementing smart regulation that gives companies room and resources to grow. Despite the arcane policies of the BitLicense, the city is home to a vibrant crypto scene powered by constant professional and social events.  The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a booming market for cryptocurrencies have brought together artists, entrepreneurs and financiers in the city to create never-before-seen kinds of products using blockchain technology. The growth of the sector needs to be cultivated thoughtfully, with policies aimed at helping well-intentioned startups already struggling in a competitive industry to grow – the BitLicense isn’t helping.  As other cities and states vie to become the crypto capitals of the world, New York could easily capture this flag, but only if it acts to cultivate innovation rather than destroy it. It’s time for New York to end the BitLicense before it’s too late.

42421039,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHht,1634670689,"For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID","For law-abiding cryptocurrency users, getting verified to trade on an exchange is a painstaking process. They must give out a wealth of personal data, including their home addresses, scans of government-issued ID, and photo or video selfies.  For criminals, it’s easier. They can pay as little as $150 on the black market for a ready-to-use, verified account in someone else’s name at Coinbase Pro, Binance US, Kraken or numerous other exchanges, a CoinDesk investigation found.  To be clear: “verified” in this context does not mean legitimate. Underground vendors create these accounts with other people’s identities or under made-up names, tricking the exchanges into verifying them as valid users. They then advertise these verified accounts for sale on internet forums and on Telegram.  Besides crypto exchanges, the vendors also offer fraudulently created accounts for use with mainstream payment providers such as Square’s Cash App and Transferwise.  “We are producing from 1,500 to 2,000 synthetic verified accounts each month,” an operator of one such service told CoinDesk in an interview via the Telegram messaging app.  This service has multiple employees and even “departments” within the business, said the person, who refused to give a name. And it has no shortage of competitors, CoinDesk’s investigation found.  A CoinDesk reporter reviewed a sample of crypto and payment accounts that had been purchased from several black-market vendors. The exercise revealed these vendors are, in many cases, trafficking in sensitive information about people who likely have no idea their names are on the accounts.  It also showed how people who, for whatever reason, don’t want to expose their real identities or fear they wouldn’t be approved for an account can skirt the industry’s customer-vetting processes – at least, up to a point.  While it’s difficult to gauge the size of this market – criminals don’t typically publicize their revenue, after all – it appears to be flourishing.  “We’ve observed a staggering amount of threat actors advertising and brokering fraudulent accounts for both crypto exchanges and payment services,” said Andrew Gunn, senior threat intelligence analyst at ZeroFox, a cybersecurity firm based in Baltimore.  Over the past 12 months, ZeroFox found over one million posts on forums and Telegram messaging-app groups advertising accounts for sale, Gunn said.  The fact that you can buy a fake digital identity for around $200 raises fresh questions about the effectiveness of “know your customer” (KYC) policies implemented by crypto businesses around the world. While everyday users often have to submit the same information multiple times for reverification and wait for weeks or months to withdraw their money (even Martha Stewart reportedly waited two weeks to get verified), bad actors can sneak in easily.  In plain sight  Black markets thrive both on the so-called dark web, which is accessible through the anonymizing Tor browser, and on the clear web or surface web – the part of the internet most of us browse every day.  Here, in plain sight, are live forums populated by professional hackers, scammers of all sorts and sellers of illegal goods. To name some, Russian-speaking forums such as Ver.sc (short for “Verified”) and CCCC.sb are focused on illegal identity-related services such as “carding” (trafficking in stolen or counterfeit credit card numbers).  On these platforms, one can easily find for sale accounts for use on a diverse range of crypto exchanges and payment services, from peer-to-peer trading platform Localbitcoins to professional trading venue Coinbase Pro to mainstream payment services CashApp, Transferwise and Revolut.  Prices, ranging from $150 to $500, are disclosed to a prospective buyer in a personal chat or posted on a price list like the one on this web pagehttps://www.notion.so/55af0fcb9926406b8f590e7de09dc77d. To buy an account, one needs to get in touch with a vendor (often via Telegram), pay in crypto (usually bitcoin) and get the requested account data.  Sometimes the accounts originally were registered by legitimate customers and have been hijacked by hackers. (For a buyer of such an account, there is always the risk that its actual owner will notice something weird is going on and flag it to the platform administrator.) Sometimes vendors create accounts from scratch using stolen or fake data. Sometimes users register accounts in their own names and then turn them over to vendors to sell.  According to posts on the forums and conversations with some of the vendors, they go through the exchanges’ verification process to open accounts, and control the accounts until they are sold. People whose information is used for registering with the services might not even know the accounts exist.  On the same forums where some vendors offer these fraudulent accounts, others look to hire “drops,” or individuals willing to lend their identities for account registration. Meanwhile, people willing to fill this role search for “job postings.” There are also multiple offerings of counterfeit IDs.  Lend me your face  The job of a drop is well explained by a recent dialogue on the CCCC.sb forum (the posts are translated from Russian).  “Looking for a job as a money launderer. Send offers to my DM,” one user wrote in July.  “Of a drop,” corrected another user in a reply before describing the role: “Only your face is needed. To pass video verification via WhatsApp. From 1,500 to 2,000 rubles [$20-$28] for a pass, you can do several passes a day.”  “The task is to pass verification on an exchange in real time. You can use your passport/driver’s license/foreign passport. Also gonna need to take a selfie. You get 500 rubles [around $7], after the successful verification,” says another post on the Bhf.im forum, adding that a “job seeker” will just need to give a full name and date of birth and then click on a link. The poster used a photo of the rapper Lil’ Pump as their profile picture.  More often, vendors do not advertise exact prices for such services in the postings but convey them one-on-one via chat.  Some vendors act as middlemen, offering to connect users with drops, much as a ridesharing app matches passengers with drivers. One ad boasts that the drops are available to work at any time.  But sometimes you don’t even need anyone’s real personal data to verify an account, the vendor who spoke to CoinDesk said: You can make things up.  “It’s a vulnerability KYC systems have. If you know how to generate [synthetic] data, you use it. KYC systems are not a customs checkpoint with a shared database and verified information about any potential user,” they said.  The ‘fullz’  Buyers can buy accounts registered under whatever names vendors have in hand or order custom accounts based on personal data (“fullz”) they themselves, by whatever means, have obtained.  Some vendors promise they will do all the necessary research on the real people whose data is being used, including credit and background checks.  If nothing works, they stand ready to search for people with the same names, even when a person whose name is being used is older than 90, vendors say in advertising posts.  “Working with us means we’ll do our best to verify accounts: selecting a model of suitable age, searching for namesakes and trying to achieve results,” one vendor wrote in a Telegram post illustrated with a cheeky meme.  In another post, the vendor describes software that allows the creation of fake selfies, including video.  “We do live selfies. 3D biometric is possible for us. take photos with id cards. print any docs. we can be anyone you need,” the same vendor advertised on the paid forum Ver.sc.  Some of these vendors just post from time to time that they have a good account for sale or are looking to buy some. Others run regular shops, with dedicated teams and customer support done via Telegram. Their posts are followed by testimonials from satisfied customers.  The sample  CoinDesk reviewed a sample of accounts at exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro and Kraken and payment services Cash App and Wirex that were available for purchase on the black market. The accounts had been put up for sale by several different vendors. The prices of these accounts ranged from $170 to $250, all paid in bitcoin.  Along with login credentials, these accounts came with private data of the purported account owners, all of whom appeared to be genuine U.S. or European Union residents. The data included dates of birth, street addresses and, in the case of the U.S. residents, Social Security numbers.  Most of the accounts came with instructions for using a virtual private network (VPN) to disguise an IP address so an exchange would think a user was logging in from, say, Miami instead of Moscow. In some cases, vendors included credentials for a Gmail account (with Google Voice phone number), presumably for multi-factor authentication (MFA) when logging into the financial service – and a recovery email address in case Google asks for verification, too.  After reviewing the accounts, CoinDesk contacted the crypto exchanges and payment services to check their authenticity. None of the companies would say whether the accounts were genuine, explaining they can’t comment on individual accounts.  Binance US sent CoinDesk an email signed by “Binance U.S. PR,” saying the company “believes this to be a fake account.” The exchange did not respond to a follow-up question asking whether by “fake” the representative meant it was nonexistent or fraudulently created.  CoinDesk searched online databases such as Spokeo, SearchPeopleFree and ClustrMaps and found four people whose names, years of birth and cities matched those on the black-market accounts. Two of those people had matching street addresses as well.  Attempts to contact these and other individuals whose names were on the reviewed accounts by phone, email and social media were unsuccessful, and CoinDesk has mailed them letters to alert them their data is potentially being abused.  We also called the phone numbers used to register the accounts – all of them except one turned out to be Google Voice numbers, meaning they are virtual numbers generated by Google. Users can register virtual phone numbers without getting contracts with a mobile provider. This has made Google Voice numbers a handy tool for scammers.  The email addresses associated with the accounts did not match the names under which the accounts were registered, and instead contained random-seeming combinations of names and numbers.  Made to order  “It’s quite hard to evaluate the total volume of this market, as we are probably the only public example of such a business with departments and streamlined processes,” the vendor who spoke to CoinDesk said.  “Our colleagues who are running similar businesses are either running very small enterprises or selling accounts of real people, who are either going through some hard times or have been deceived,” they added.  But ZeroFox’s Gunn said the market for these accounts for sale is vast, with some Telegram channels counting thousands of members.  “The sheer amount of threat actors specializing in this has even driven prices down to very reasonable levels (anywhere from $50 to $300 per account, depending on the exchange or service in question),” Gunn said.  While Gunn’s research focuses on Eastern Europe, he said stolen, hacked or artificially created accounts at payment services or crypto exchanges are sold all over the world and advertised in multiple languages.  In addition to ready-to-use accounts, the black-market vendors offer “on-demand, almost a la carte services, based on customer needs,” Gunn said.  They can help their “clients” register fraudulent accounts by selling compromised personal data or “offering support during any step of the verification process,” including digital rendering of faces to pass photo and video verification, which major crypto exchanges often require.  ‘Go here, click this’  ZeroFox identified at least one case when a group was hiring individuals on a freelance job platform to do account creation and verification, and then hand those accounts over, for as little as $5-$10 for each pass, Gunn said. The group was giving precise instructions to the people willing to do the job: “go here, click this, use this ID,” Gunn said.  Further investigation showed the group managed to create and sell “thousands of verified accounts” on a single platform, he said. Gunn would not name that platform.  Getting fraudulent accounts is a slam dunk for criminal groups, Gunn said. “These accounts are very easy to come by, relatively cheap and disposable, so in the criminal underground it’s very trivial to buy as many as you want. And if you lose one account you just buy another one,” he said.  For services, finding and shutting down fraudulent accounts can get extremely tricky, Gunn said.  “Some of these accounts are dormant until money moves through them, and if a real person verified them how would they know?” he said. “Security measures [implemented by the platforms] are pretty good, but there is always a way around.”  It’s unclear how long such accounts remain operational until a service notices something suspicious and shuts them down. The lifespan of an account depends on the way it’s being used, the black-market vendor told CoinDesk.  “We are providing an account that essentially looks no different from the one you or your friend would register. They are fully compliant with the KYC requirements, except they are fully synthetic,” the person said, adding that users’ own reckless behavior, rather than the quality of the account, can trigger exchanges’ fraud alerts.  Gunn agreed that it’s possible for the buyer of a synthetic account to fly under the radar. “If they took precautions to blend in with normal behavior (not exceeding transaction amounts, etc.), leveraged residential proxies matching the information and geolocation of the victim, to name a couple of items, the accounts might last indefinitely,” he said.  The trade in crypto exchange accounts is just a subset of a larger global black ID market. According to a 2020 report by the cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows, there are more than 15 billion credentials in the world for sale, and the most valuable are “bank and other financial accounts,” which sell for $70.91 each, on average. This is dwarfed only by the prices of domain administrator access to corporate systems, where the price tag can go up to $140,000, Digital Shadows said.  Apparently, illegal access to cryptocurrency services is valued somewhere in the middle, with some accounts sold for as high as $500 each.  Countermeasures  Some platforms CoinDesk contacted confirmed they were aware of the black market for their accounts.  “We have team members dedicated to monitoring the dark web for accounts stolen through malware or phishing, as well as ‘mule accounts,’ which are put up for sale as fronts for criminals to launder funds,” a spokesperson for Kraken told CoinDesk via email. “Depending on the situation, we can either restore the account back to the rightful owner or disable it with immediate effect and take appropriate action as necessary.”  At Coinbase, a threat intelligence team “monitors darknet markets and other cybercriminal forums,” the Nasdaq-listed exchange’s senior manager for communications, Jaclyn Sales, told CoinDesk.  “Like any other financial institution, Coinbase implements measures to protect accounts from fraudulent actors. For security reasons we do not disclose specifics of those measures, as we do not want to provide fraudsters with information that could be used to bypass those controls.”  Binance US’s press representative told CoinDesk via email that the company is closely watching how users are logging into their accounts each time they use them.  “Our risk management system collects a wide array of signals during account opening, subsequent logins and during each account interaction, and we monitor these signals to identify potentially high-risk accounts or related activity and prevent malicious behavior,” the spokesperson told CoinDesk.  A CashApp spokesperson said the company is also monitoring users’ behavior to detect potential fraud.”In addition to our standard customer information and verification programs, we use various behavioral signals, information provided by our customers and various vendors, as well as transactional patterns to analyze and detect when accounts may be suspicious for various bad activity, including fraud and identity theft,” the company said in a written statement to CoinDesk.  Gunn’s firm ZeroFox is helping payment app company Wirex to “track and take down impersonations of Wirex, and those malicious actors claiming to sell Wirex accounts on the dark web,” Wirex Communications Manager Lottie Wells told CoinDesk via email.  The offerings, according to her, are abundant.  “Between the beginning of June and [September], we have monitored nearly 400,000 links, accounts and posts, we identified and remediated (blocked, took down, deleted, etc.) over 1,500 pieces of content. In fact, 32% of this was specifically from the dark web,” Wells said.  To prevent fraud, Wirex employs “a range of compliance, tech and security measures,” depending “on the risk profile of a user, the nature of transactions and our third-party partners who support us on evaluating external conditions,” Wells said.  “We also work closely with regulators to mitigate account takeover risks, and report them where necessary,” she added. “Any customer accounts that may be compromised are quickly blocked and protected, while our customer support team works with our customers to protect their accounts.”  CoinDesk also asked cryptocurrency exchange Huobi as well as payment services Transferwise and Revolut, for comment. All of them are mentioned in the ads posted by fraudulent-account vendors.  TransferWise spokesperson Chris Monteiro said that the company works with law enforcement “to help prevent further illegal activity” when it learns about “specific organized fraud cases.”  “For our customers, if they feel they have been a victim of fraud they should report it to the police immediately, and we encourage them to get in touch with us straight away,” Monteiro added.  Huobi declined to comment. Revolut did not respond by press time.  Bitter pill  The target audience for these accounts for sale are people involved in other criminal activities, Gunn said.  “Threat actors that are purchasing the created and verified accounts are leveraging them for whatever criminal activity they do, whether it’s a carding operation or selling malware or gift card scam,” he said. “This is one part of the process that helps them to stay anonymous rather than having crypto accounts on their names on those exchanges.”  The vendor who spoke to CoinDesk used more delicate language, saying users avail themselves of its services to avoid “taxation risks.”  As law enforcement agencies around the world adopt blockchain-sleuthing software, it makes even more sense for criminals to cover their tracks by buying and selling crypto through accounts registered in others’ names, Gunn said.  Sergey Mendeleev, founder of Estonia-registered crypto exchange Garantex and CEO of investment platform InDeFi, explained to CoinDesk how these “mule” accounts might be used to obscure the connection between crypto and its actual owner.  “If you buy monero for fiat, then withdraw it and then deposit via another account, you can sell it for bitcoin and get clean, exchange-originated bitcoin, not connected to the previous transactions. This scheme is quite popular, and there are tens of others,” Mendeleev said.  Another reason there is demand for synthetic accounts can be as simple as this: People living in countries sanctioned by the U.S. and EU or with prohibitive anti-crypto regulations can’t register under their real names on the major crypto exchanges.  Sergey Zhdanov, chief operating officer of London-registered crypto exchange EXMO, told CoinDesk his company has caught some users faking their KYC data. The users explained they were based in territories under international sanctions, so they wouldn’t be able to register with their real IDs, he said.  “Some users just honestly admitted that they were based in the DNR [Donetsk People’s Republic, a disputed area in southeastern Ukraine] or North Korea, so they bought their documents [to register]. We block such accounts,” Zhdanov said.  China, which has been aggressively pushing crypto out of the country, appears to be a new growth market for the bogus ID business. Dovey Wan, founder of the Primitive Ventures crypto fund, told CoinDesk the market for verified accounts for Chinese users is “vibrant.”  The vendors “advertise in Telegram groups as ‘KYC service,’” Wan said, adding that “you simply ask in the Telegram groups (mostly in Chinese ones) that ‘I want a KYC service’ [and] people will pop up.”  The vendor CoinDesk spoke to confirmed their service is becoming popular in China: “At the moment, we’re seeing interest in our services from Chinese people. No need to explain, I guess. :) ""  Marc Hochstein, Danny Nelson and Daniel Kuhn contributed reporting",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5cfd9129664eb4d38154ac5e49308e590775313-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On-Chain Data Shows BTC Outflows Continue To Decrease As pointed out by an Analyst on Twitter, on-chain data reveals Bitcoin outflows have been gradually going down in the past month. The relevant metric here is the BTC netflows. This indicator shows the net amount of coins exiting or entering exchange wallets. Its value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the netflow shows negative values, it means outflows are dominating inflows. This means more Bitcoin is being pulled off exchanges than the amount being put in. Sustained such values have usually been bullish for the crypto. Positive values, on the other hand, would imply an increase in coins entering exchanges as inflows show more strength than outflows. This can be bearish for BTC&apos;s price.

42417109,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4ryX,1634666952,The CFTC Was Proved Right on Bitcoin Futures. What’s Next for the Agency?,"On Sept. 29, 2021, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced it had filed 14 complaints against various crypto trading platforms. It was the busiest day of action for the nation’s top commodities regulator and a noted departure from its usual course. Between 2015 and the end of June 2020 the watchdog had only brought 19 separate enforcement actions related to crypto businesses.  Despite that seemingly paltry number of investigations, for years many participants and observers of the crypto industry viewed the CFTC as the de facto overseer of virtual currencies. The agency of about 700, responsible for monitoring hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives trading, first classified bitcoin as a commodity in 2014.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). It published first in The Node newsletter. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In an industry where there is little positive guidance, where regulators historically seemed averse to commenting on the market, the CFTC stepped up to provide a little clarity. In late 2014, the agency affirmatively stated that digital currencies fall under the definition of a commodity and therefore its remit, in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). In 2018, Bloomberg called CFTC “the federal overseer of digital currencies.”  All that is largely subject to change. And indeed it already has. The agency that gave us pro-crypto regulators including “digital dollar” advocates Chris Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine, stablecoin-defender Brian Quintenz and ETH-positive Heath Tarbert is changing hands. There are currently three out of five vacant “commissioner”-level positions that President Joe Biden intends to fill. Who he appoints will undoubtedly have a significant effect on the next growth phase in crypto.  The CFTC is already ceding ground. Earlier this year Commissioner Dawn Stump, a Republican, said that sister agency the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a large role to play in regulating crypto markets. This came after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said cryptocurrencies, by and large, were neither currencies or commodities but securities, placing them in his domain.  “There has often been a grossly inaccurate oversimplification offered which suggests [crypto assets] are either securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” Stump said in August. “Even if a digital asset is a commodity, it is not regulated by the CFTC.”  Going forward, it seems, the CFTC will limit itself to dealing with crypto derivatives – like futures and options contracts – rather than the coins themselves.  This goes a long way in reducing the tension between the CFTC and SEC, in what some commentators call a turf war between agencies with overlapping jurisdictions. Crypto presents a unique challenge for legacy frameworks: Pure cryptos disintermediate builders and stakeholders from the underlying asset. But in their beginning stages, before they’re broadly adopted or “sufficiently decentralized,” they more often resemble investment contracts. Then there’s the question of who is at the center of a smart contract; Gensler wants coders to take ownership of their code.  Stump and Gensler’s statements also seem to reduce the importance of the supposed continuum between securities and commodities. For years, developers have operated under the understanding that a crypto, issued by a team, could eventually “morph” into a commodity that belongs to the world. That’s what happened with Ethereum’s native currency, ETH, which both SEC and CFTC officials stated point blank was a security during the initial coin offering (ICO).  Giancarlo advocated a Hippocratic, “do no harm” approach towards crypto. Before taking over as chair, he laid his views on the line, stating that blockchains could “revolutionize the world of finance.” He wanted the agency, founded in 1974 to monitor agricultural products, to become a “21st century regulator.” In 2017, he launched LabCFTC, an internal unit to study digital assets, led by Daniel Gorfine.  See also: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?  Investigations were limited to pretty clear, identifiable, fraudulent schemes; businesses that failed to register with the CFTC; illegal off-exchange transactions; gatekeepers and price manipulators.  In 2018, Giancarlo did the unthinkable and approved bitcoin futures trading. More specifically, he allowed CME Group and Cboe Global Markets to “self-certify” these products. In 2019, then-Chairman Heath Tarbert declared that ETH is a commodity. A year later ErisX, a cryptocurrency derivatives platform, launched the first ether futures contract.  “Reasonable regulation that is carefully tailored to solve for identifiable regulatory risks is helpful in advancing mainstream adoption of new technologies and innovations. It is important, however, to strike an appropriate balance and not prematurely box-in innovation that is still in its early innings of development,” Gorfine told CoinDesk over email.  The SEC’s historically limited role in the crypto industry was positive. It took a back seat, and innovators were allowed to innovate. They oversaw specific institutions, in the same way that states oversee applications of crypto being used as money transmitters, but left the market broadly in the hands of the CFTC. And actors, from BitMEX to CabbageTech Corp., were still brought to justice when they broke the rules.  There are still ways for the CFTC to ensure its greater role in the market. Last year, former U.S. Rep. Mike Conaway proposed the “Digital Commodity Exchange Act” that would create a path for crypto exchanges to be regulated by commodities regulators. The bill died, but Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is still talking it up.  Then, there’s the possibility that certain cryptos would qualify for a “de minimis” exception, making them more like foreign currencies.  President Biden’s pick to head up the CFTC is Rostin Behnam, who currently serves as acting chair; law professor Kristin Johnson and government watchdog Christy Goldsmith Romero are likely to be named commissioners. All have experience dealing with crypto and would make fine watchdogs.  “Acting Chairman Behnam is an excellent choice to serve as Chairman of the CFTC. He has a strong understanding of the issues and I believe will ensure that the CFTC remains forward-leaning in its oversight of the markets,” Gorfine said.  In 2018, Behnam even noted how digital currencies could become integrated in “smaller economies.” “These currencies will be outside traditional monetary intermediaries, like government, banks, investors, ministries or international organizations,” he said.  That was then, this is now. It’s unclear how the CFTC of tomorrow will treat the crypto markets. But if comments from the White House, SEC and U.S. Treasury Dept. are any indication, enforcement will pick up and the “do no harm” approach will likely be minimized. But the CFTC’s place in crypto history is still being felt.  Yesterday, the SEC finally allowed a bitcoin futures-focused exchange-traded fund to go to market. I asked Giancarlo about it:  “The SEC’s proposed greenlighting this week of ETFs on bitcoin futures rather than on the spot bitcoin markets suggests lingering hesitancy at the SEC about the stability and health of the spot market.  So will the new CFTC look like the old?  UPDATE (Oct. 19, 2021 20:28 UTC): Adds quote from Gorfine about Behnam.

Liquidity mining is a DeFi (decentralized finance) mechanism in which participants supply cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, and being rewarded with fees and tokens based on their share of the total pool liquidity.  According to a press release provided to CoinDesk, PsyOptions has closed a $3.5 million raise led by Alameda Research, with additional participation from CMS Holdings, Ledger Prime, MGNR, Wintermute and Airspeed18.  In an interview with CoinDesk, the founders said they focused on participants known for liquidity provision and market making.  “The majority of this round was all strategic liquidity providers.

42410955,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjzR,1634662911,Demand Spike on Binance Played Key Role in Bitcoin Rally: Kaiko,"Bitcoin’s steady march to near-all time highs came as traders correctly anticipated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But instead of it being a collective effort by both retail and institutional investors across multiple platforms, crypto exchange data shows that a large investor or investors on one particular exchange, using mostly a particular dollar-pegged stablecoin, are once again the main factor behind a rally.  An Oct. 18 newsletter by data firm Kaiko indicates that bitcoin’s recent gains took off after the BTC/USDT spot trading pair’s volume spiked around Oct. 10 on Binance, one of the world’s largest exchanges. The spike took place just a few days after one buyer or a group of buyers entered an order on Binance on Oct. 6 to buy $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin, which sent bitcoin’s price skyrocketing 5% to about $55,500 at the time.  The finding supports the narrative that whales (large bitcoin investors) on Binance continued to purchase large amounts of bitcoin using dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT, without worrying about moving bitcoin’s price up sharply.  A breakdown of ‘abnormal’ trading activities on Binance  The volume of BTC/USDT trading spiked to “abnormally high levels” between Oct. 9 and Oct. 10 on Binance, Clara Medalie, research lead at Kaiko, told CoinDesk.  “Binance’s market share spiked at the same time to levels not seen in a very long time,” Medalie said. “This suggests that a large trader(s) were transacting on Binance at the time of the price rally.”  Individual trade data on Binance also shows that the average bitcoin trade size rose to $2,500 from $2,000 between Oct. 8 and Oct. 13, a multi-month high. On Oct. 10, as buy orders on Binance exceeded sell orders between 2:00 UTC and 5:00 UTC, bitcoin’s price went up to around $56,000 from $54,000.  Why Binance?  A buyer with a long-term perspective would usually try to avoid buying a large amount of bitcoin on one exchange in a short period of time, in order to mitigate the risk of slippage. The more appealing approach for large purchases is usually the over-the-counter (OTC) market.  When the OTC market cannot source more bitcoin, traders could turn to exchanges for new supply. But as independent analyst Willy Woo told CoinDesk, OTC desks usually outsource bitcoin through algorithmic trading programs with tools including volume weighted average price (VWAP) to break down the order into positions across all exchanges. It is unlikely that an OTC desk would conduct a large transaction at once on one exchange and cause a significant price movement.  The Oct. 6 purchase of $1.6 billion worth bitcoin using USDT happened on an exchange with ties to China in the middle of a week of severe uncertainty in the country as several real estate borrowers were defaulting on loan payments.  However, as China doubled down on its ban on crypto trading and the most popular bull narrative appears to be the hype around the SEC’s approval of a bitcoin futures-based ETF, some argue that the seemingly strange move on Binance had less to do with China’s crypto investors.  “Binance does not simply represent the market in Asia now,” said Alex Zuo, vice president of Singapore-based crypto wallet company Cobo. “It’s hard to make the connection between Asia and the recent price rally.”  The reason that the “abnormal” activity took place on Binance in particular could be that Binance’s BTC/USDT trading pair is highly liquid, according to Zuo.  He added that whales in Asia do not appear to be in a rush to dump their USDT after a story on Bloomberg indicated that the reserves of Tether Holdings, the company behind USDT, included “billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies.”  Last week’s news that Bitfinex and Tether settled charges with U.S. regulators for a more than $42 million fine is even seen as “bullish” to many large USDT holders, Zuo said, as it removes uncertainty.  James Check, an analyst from blockchain data firm Glassnode, suggested that the latest rally is purely caused by more bitcoin demand than supply.  “I’m not really ever focused on which venue the buying occurs because I simply don’t think it is useful information,” he said.  “Perhaps there was a shortage of bitcoin,” Kaiko’s Medalie said. “As always, [it is] difficult to prove but it could explain the dramatic rise.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/19/demand-spike-on-binance-played-key-role-in-bitcoin-rally-kaiko,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c67fc4025cbebdfeb4c4c8f8794df5e27a53643d-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390164,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bW69zX,1634662880,Gensler for a Day: How Rohan Grey Would Regulate Stablecoins,"On paper, the concept of a “stablecoin” is relatively simple. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and traders like being able to cash out quickly. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that allow for just that. Tied 1:1 to the price of a particular fiat currency (usually the U.S. dollar), they’re a way for traders to turn volatile crypto into highly liquid digital cash. The value of a dollar-pegged stablecoin is always just about a dollar – hence, “stable.”  At least in theory. A chorus of regulators, politicians and academics has been raising the alarm about the potential instability and risk stablecoins represent to the broader crypto market. Chief among those voices is Rohan Grey, an Australia-born, Columbia University-educated attorney who’s now an assistant professor at Willamette University College of Law.  This interview is part of a series called “Gensler for a Day,” where we ask industry leaders in a position to set or influence law about concrete policies they would implement. Check here for more “Policy Week” coverage.  Grey described the role of stablecoins in crypto trading with a metaphor that feels very “Scooby Doo”:  “It’s the slices of bread in between a 12-foot-high sandwich. You’ve got the sandwich, then the meat, then bread, then the meat, then the bread, then the meat. It’s the stuff in between every layer.”  In other words, stablecoins are infrastructure. The issue is that they’re virtually unregulated; most stablecoins claim to be “backed” by cash and cash equivalents, but there’s no requirement that they prove it. A two-year investigation by the New York State Attorney General’s Office found that the shadowy array of companies behind tether stablecoin issuer Tether, with a market capitalization of $69 billion – didn’t even have a bank for most of 2017. Just last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) determined Tether was only fully backed about 26% of the time between 2016 and 2018. Where was the money? And who’s running the show?  Late last year, Grey worked with U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) on a bill called the STABLE Act – short for “Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement” – which proposed that stablecoin issuers be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. To hear him tell it, the shady tactics of stablecoin issuers are a threat not just to crypto, but also to the traditional financial system.  Here’s my conversation with Grey, edited and condensed for clarity.  More from Policy Week: David Z. Morris: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?  So, the name of this series is “Gensler for a Day” – how would you approach Gensler’s role, specifically?  I would tell him to have a phone call with all of the banking regulators and tell them to do their jobs, because it shouldn’t be his job to fix the stablecoin industry.  I think the securities regulation framework is already a losing framework. If you start at that point, you’re at best getting a half loaf, or putting it within a framework that is not actually able to deal with the major problems of the industry, which is that it’s fueled by shadow money.  Say more about “shadow money.”  The industry relies on liquidity at the off-ramp/on-ramp margins. And that liquidity is being provided right now by shadow banking institutions like the stablecoin issuers. It’s that liquidity, and those stablecoin issuers that allow the rest of the market to work the way that it does.  But the reason that those stablecoin issuers are able to do that is they’re not being regulated like banks, which have quite strict requirements on the kinds of instruments and actors that they can engage with. So if you’re engaging with stuff that isn’t allowed, or is an unregistered security – or could be – or even just is a not particularly reputable industry, then banks will often say, “We don’t want to let you do business.”  Imagine if everybody had to put in all of their crypto trading through their bank account. Would the crypto market look the way that it does right now? No, because all of those actors would be held accountable as fiduciaries for facilitating that kind of activity.  How did we arrive at this point where Tether is doing $70 billion a day in volume and the companies behind it have never been audited?  Historically speaking, the SEC has done a pretty [awful] job of navigating the margins of the “Wild West” of securities regulation. But the banking industry, at least since the 1930s [when the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was established], has done a pretty good job of keeping most people’s money safe.  The biggest reason that stablecoins haven’t already been dealt with is because there has been a loophole – a kind of carveout at the center of banking law that has been a serious problem, and in part led to the rise of the money market fund industry and some of the problems with shadow banking in 2008.  The law defines the concept of deposits in a very circular fashion. It says, “No one can issue a deposit unless you’re a bank,” but then it defines a deposit as “that which is issued by a bank” rather than functionally. [Per Grey: Banks “issue” demand deposits when they “accept” currency from a depositor.] So you have actors that issue something that by all accounts looks like a deposit, and by all definitions is functionally a deposit. But because it isn’t issued by a bank, they say, “Oh, it can’t be a deposit.”  This happened with money market funds. When money market funds first rose to prominence in the 1970s, there was a debate at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and elsewhere about whether or not they should be considered depository institutions. And [the funds] lobbied extremely hard, and finance-friendly actors gave them an exemption. So they became this sort of parallel, separate category even though everybody was using their money market fund accounts as equivalent to a bank account.  Liquidity from the money market fund industry is the thing that’s still today driving a huge amount of the hedge fund industry. Because it would be very difficult to do all the [stuff] that they do if they had to do it through a regular bank account. This isn’t even just a unique problem with crypto, it’s just the next iteration of this longstanding problem. And of course, what happened? The money market fund industry needed a massive bailout in 2008.  I was surprised to see Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who’s been such a friend to the crypto industry, say that stablecoins should be regulated.  I think they’re skating to where the puck is going, and they see the writing on the wall.  So what can securities regulators do about all this? If you’re Gensler, how are you beginning to chip away at the problem?  I would be very clear that some of these things are securities, I would launch a series of high-profile investigations on some of the worst actors and I would put pressure on other agencies.  Everybody assumes that everything can be done through securities regulation, which is the product of an extremely successful, decades-long strategy of lobbying, because it’s the weakest of all the financial regulatory frameworks. Everybody who doesn’t want any regulatory scrutiny or accountability says, “First, I don’t want any. Second, if I have to have some, I want it to be securities law.”  Who are the worst actors, in your opinion?  The exchanges. And I would say the stablecoin issuers, but I would make a really big point and shame the other banking regulators that they should be doing this.  When you say “the exchanges” and “the stablecoin issuers,” do you mean all the major crypto exchanges and all the major stablecoin issuers?  Yeah. Is there a single one that we can honestly say is not trading unregistered securities?  I think Gensler has even said that.  Exactly.  What do you say to the argument that regulators have bigger fish to fry than these somewhat arcane crypto concepts?  My view has always been that as technology evolves, existing categories and existing practices get refracted through those technologies. When the first STABLE Act came out I said, “I think 50 years from now, there’s a good chance that people will be saying, ‘What’s a bank deposit?’ And we’ll say, ‘It’s the thing that we used to call stablecoins.’ And they’ll say, ‘What’s the stock exchange?’ ‘Well, it’s a thing that existed that was sort of a primitive version of the crypto exchanges we have now.’”  I’m not saying that because I think all of these new things are amazing new solutions or doing innovative new things. I think it’s because our language and our legal categories evolve with our technology. And for better or worse, this is the new digital native language, a new digital native technology.  It’s not just Tether, it’s not even just [USDC issuer] Circle, it’s literally every bank out there that will go, “Oh, we can issue something called a different name and suddenly we get to exempt ourselves from all those deposit laws that we’ve been hamstrung by for decades? Sweet! Let’s do that.” JPMorgan is issuing its own stablecoin; do they want that to be classified as a deposit? Of course not.

Sequoia Games has tapped Algorand as the digital ledger behind its new Flex NBA product, a National Basketball Association-licensed board game that uses augmented reality.  The company said Tuesday that Flex NBA is a turn-based board game with similar mechanics to Catan that’s played with a physical board in combination with a mobile app.  Players assemble their own roster using “Flexagons,” which are physical collectible tiles that represent different NBA players also expressed digitally on the game’s companion app.  The Flexagons are brought to life within the app through augmented reality technology and can be upgraded to create more value within the game.  “There is a missing bridge between the ‘old school’ [board games] and the technology that exists today, a bridge that also connects our need to own something physical in a world that is moving too far into the digital,” said Sequoia Games founder Daniel Choi. “In today’s gaming landscape, we either have 1960s board games or mobile apps and PS5s. There is no reason these worlds need to be separate.”  Sequoia Games inserting augmented reality into a traditional board game setting is one of many recent examples of companies using blockchain to reimagine gaming.

42417110,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4rzZ,1634655427,DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?,"The cryptocurrency industry is going through a period of intense growing pains. Like a lanky tween, it is running faster and jumping higher than ever before, thanks to major milestones such as bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, a continuing surge in non-fungible token (NFT) interest and ever more involvement from established players like Visa.  But, again like an ambitious adolescent, the newly empowered crypto sector is also bumping awkwardly into the constraints imposed by society. Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission seems determined to be crypto’s strict disciplinarian, laying down the law about curfews, hemlines and exchange-traded funds. For nearly a decade, crypto regulation was absent or scattershot. The trade-off for crypto’s adulthood will be much stricter oversight by the graybeards who make the rules.  This feature story is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  The metaphor of crypto-as-teenager, though, breaks down on one front: decentralized finance (DeFi). In functional terms, DeFi protocols are venues for trading or lending crypto tokens and derivatives. But unlike a conventional crypto exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, DeFi protocols exist across a swarm of validating and coordinating nodes rather than as a single portal and matching engine run by an incorporated legal entity.  Furthermore, at least in theory, a DeFi protocol can exist without the formal leadership with which regulators would normally interact. This is a particular challenge for regulators because many existing DeFi systems are designed without any requirement that users reveal their identities. Again, that’s a stark contrast with entities like Coinbase and Kraken, which have comprehensive “know your customer” processes.  This matters because DeFi is a potential vector for all three of the key risks that financial regulators are tasked with controlling. One is criminal activity, including money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing (though these activities already appear very limited across crypto systems). The second is fraud, which was on major display with a series of fake or deceptive token sales during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom – facilitated by early iterations of DeFi. The third target is systemic risk. DeFi and crypto still probably aren’t large or influential enough to trigger broader financial contagion in the event of a major market collapse or system failure, but you no longer have to engage in wild speculation to foresee that level of influence in the future.  Traditionally, regulators rely immensely on the people running trading services to control those risks by monitoring their customers and suspicious activity on their platforms. The leaders of traditional financial services themselves sometimes become the linchpin of enforcement – the responsible arm the SEC twists to get what it wants.  More from Policy Week: Preston Byrne: Decentralization’s Challenge to Policymakers Is Coming  Without those pressure points, things will get tricky. “It’s going to be very difficult to regulate DeFi. Much harder than crypto,” says Katherine Kirkpatrick, co-chair of the financial services practice at King & Spalding. “The ultimate question, beyond how to regulate, is how do you enforce the rules? How do you make someone accountable for breaking the rules? It doesn’t make sense to regulate if you have no enforcement mechanism.”  In other words, trying to regulate DeFi is a bit like trying to parent a super-powered 14-year-old who can fly, teleport and turn invisible at will.  Should DeFi be Regulated?  Of course, that demands a question: If you had a kid like that, would you want to lay down the law at all? When something new appears in the world, should we immediately start building fences around it, or give it the space to see just how powerful it is?  Premature or misguided regulation could certainly stifle innovation and growth in DeFi. “If you try to regulate the technology itself rather than activity, you’re going to wind up having unintended consequences,” says Duane Pozza, formerly assistant director in the Division of Financial Practices at the Federal Trade Commission and now a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein. That could lead to “crushing the technology and probably not even stopping the [unlawful] activity.”  For better or for worse, though, regulators usually don’t think like that. “If they think something is enabling mass money laundering,” says Pozza, “They’re not going to sit on their hands.”  Despite the risk of misguided overreach, though, there are good reasons to want a regulatory framework for DeFi. Above all, it would make the fundamental advantages of the technology accessible to many more participants, particularly public companies and regulated institutions. That’s especially true now that the idea of private blockchains created by large banks has mostly fizzled out, according to Michael Shaulov, CEO and cofounder of Fireblocks, a DeFi custody and infrastructure provider.  “In the last 10 years, most financial institutions recognized that blockchain and DLT is the future,” says Shaulov, referring to distributed ledger technology. “Now they have quite a few good use cases, but what they all want to do is disintermediate. Uniswap is something that replaces for them the Nasdaq [market].”  Shaulov says he has frequent conversations with large players interested in DeFi, but the current U.S. regulatory landscape is a barrier. Using DeFi in its current state could expose banks like JPMorgan to money laundering or fraud risk.  That’s a major reason the DeFi platform Swarm Markets made the unusual decision to move from a largely unregulated jurisdiction to one with more oversight. The platform launched in the United States in 2018, but the ambiguity of the rules there soon became a constraint.  “The effective tone [of U.S. regulator statements] was, ‘We don’t know, and because we don’t know, we’re not going to make a ruling,’” according to Philipp Pieper, Swarm Markets’ co-founder. “It stated very clearly no one was willing to risk the current structure of the market.”  In mid-2018, Swarm started looking at alternatives, including other lightly regulated domiciles like Malta and Cyprus. “It was clear that wasn’t where things were going to happen,” Pieper chuckles.  Then in 2019, Germany passed new rules clarifying regulation of a variety of crypto-assets, including tokenized securities. Swarm Markets chose to relocate to Germany because that clarity gave it a firm platform for growth, while maintaining the key advantages of DeFi for institutions, including self-custody, decentralized liquidity provision and transparency.  “Controlling my own assets … and choosing whatever custody provider I see fit, that’s a huge differentiator versus putting a couple hundred thousand into a centralized exchange,” says Timo Lehes, managing director at Swarm Markets. Swarm users can also contribute to a liquidity pool and earn fees or yield much as through other DeFi protocols.  Finally, the transparency of a system that records orders to a public blockchain improves market fairness by making manipulation easier to spot. Running a regulated centralized exchange “involves all these questions about how you create an unbiased system,” says Pieper. But “all of that is answered very cleanly if you build transparently, and show all that to the regulator. Our [regulatory] application documents got thinner and thinner.”  Know your customer  Of course, there is a trade-off here and one that will understandably raise the ire of crypto purists. “The result of being a licensed outfit is that we have to do an extensive amount of customer due diligence,” says Pieper. “KYC [know your customer], AML [anti money laundering] and chain analytics. From a customer perspective, it’s no different from what you get today on a centralized exchange.”  By the same token, Swarm Markets has a degree of centralized control built into its system. “If we’re forced by regulators [we can] suspend a user. It could follow that basically funds are frozen, but it’s not that we can then take control of those funds.”  Customer oversight also impacts flows between DeFi protocols and pools, which could soon involve a sharp divide between “clean” and “dirty” operations. Funds from a platform with weak KYC likely won’t be free to flow into regulated and “whitelisted” pools like Swarm Markets’ because it would re-introduce the counterparty risk institutions want to avoid.  It’s an undeniably bitter pill. However, DeFi and crypto technologies also promise a variety of advancements to the KYC process that could make it more palatable. For instance, zero-knowledge proofs could be used to provide verification of a trader’s eligibility without revealing their identity to a regulated DeFi protocol. Under such a regime, traders could remain completely anonymous unless and until law enforcement subpoenaed their identity records from a protocol, substantially preserving user anonymity.  A related idea is “portable” KYC, which could allow a clearance from one trading venue to be used on another; that could include getting cleared by a centralized exchange like Coinbase and then using that credential elsewhere, possibly with an NFT housed in the KYC’d wallet. Both innovations, though, would require significant regulatory reform to enact.  Is a DAO a person?  The return of some sort of end-user KYC may be inevitable for any workable DeFi regulation. But on other frontiers, there are strikingly new questions that deserve innovative regulatory approaches.  Biggest among these is the question of how regulators should approach truly decentralized systems. In principle, DeFi systems have bootstrapping mechanisms that rhyme with Bitcoin’s, with protocols that distribute native tokens in exchange for liquidity deposits. That means a system can have basic rules written by one developer or a small team and potentially grow to the size of a major hedge fund or beyond. In theory this could also include decentralized governance by the user community, making such platforms a species of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  To be clear, not all DeFi systems are as decentralized as advertised. But some truly do seem to be exactly what they say: asset markets run by a distributed community rather than a middleman. SushiSwap, which arose from a fork of the more centrally run Uniswap, was one example sources considered on the more authentically decentralized end of the scale.  On one level, this isn’t as complex to regulate as it might sound, according to Stephen Palley, a partner specializing in crypto at the law firm Anderson Kill.  “Lawyers invented robots,” he says. “The corporation is a legal fiction – it has personhood under the law. We have a very robust series of laws that explain what that means.”  That means a DAO, like a corporation, could be the target of legal or regulatory judgments, even if it had no formal leaders.  “We’re starting to see that – who’s responsible for decisions made by an AI? Is it a software developer, is it code?” asks Palley. “For it to be a code, you have to recognize legal personhood for software. It sounds goofy and science-fictiony, but it’s not too far over the horizon.”  That leaves the question of enforcement a bit up in the air, since there’s no clear mechanism for a national regulator to force decisions onto an effectively stateless entity. But the variety of on-and-off ramps to any crypto system could become chokepoints for enforcement. At an extreme, a government could make it illegal for citizens to transact with a rogue DAO.  The state I’m in  The unhappy truth is that such hypothetical extremes will likely become reality if DeFi continues to grow. Regulators exist to regulate and have little stomach for powerful entities floating beyond their oversight. The modern state’s monopoly on violence as the endpoint of law enforcement will likely find some way to control your access to protocols living in the cloud.  There will undoubtedly be plenty of committed crypto-anarchists willing to test the resolve of regulators. For operators of DeFi systems, there will always be jurisdictions beyond the reach of tough regulation, and it seems plausible that small-time users who take sufficient privacy precautions will continue to take the risk of using them.  Even if they get pushed to the margins, such “pure” DeFi systems will continue to have social value as borderlands of innovation and privacy. In the broader sweep of history, they will be testing grounds for new forms of digital statelessness.  But for those interested in building on DeFi and leveraging most of its advantages to improve the financial system, there will be trade-offs even in the best-case scenario. That may not sound like much fun, but growing up rarely is.

Investors will now be watching closely to see if momentum is sustained early this week to tip over that threshold. Ether meanwhile has experienced similar gains, although it is still a little further off from its previous ATH. ETH traded as low as $3,419 on Monday before rising across the week to a high of $3,957. ETh previous ATH came on 12 May when it reached $4,177. It is currently trading around $3,820.

42417111,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4s0b,1634648775,Decentralization’s Challenge to Policymakers Is Coming,"“Decentralization theater” is something that crops up in my inbox on an almost daily basis. By this I mean the development, release and marketing of software that leverages decentralized infrastructure for one, several or even most of its components, but not all of them.  The principal reason why an entrepreneur might decentralize most, but not all, of the things, is obvious: Although calling a product “decentralized” is edgy and in vogue, writing software is a messy business that is never truly complete. Writing software on a blockchain is an especially messy business that is very difficult to fix.  Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill’s Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  See, for example, BitClout for one instance of decentralization theater in action. BitClout has long traded on its claims to be a “decentralized,” blockchain-based social networking system. At the time of its launch earlier this year, CoinDesk breathlessly reported:  BitClout is not a company. It is a proof-of-work blockchain designed for running social media. It was created by an anonymous group of developers. Backers only hold its token, BTCLT. Nevertheless, a set of prominent investors and crypto businesses have bought in.  This was not, in fact, true. Prior to launch, those navigating to BitClout’s webpage would see the following message:  Having run more than my fair share of blockchain clients in the past several years, when I navigated to BitClout’s site it was immediately clear to me that there was no node. I was navigating to a webpage, hosted on a web server, a server that, in BitClout’s case, was hosted on Google Cloud.  Some blockchain!  From a technical standpoint, BitClout’s go-live a short time later did not make it any more or less decentralized than its pre-launch. Famously, BitClout scraped the profiles of 20,000-odd Twitter users, including my own, pre-populated its own website with our profiles and then awarded balances of “creator coins” to each profile, presumably to induce creators to claim the balances and begin generating content for the site.  Unimpressed, and being a troll, I tweeted a cease-and-desist to the real identity of BitClout’s founder, Nader al-Naji:  Fewer than 24 hours later, my profile was gone:  It’s a Christmas decentralization miracle!  Of course, it didn’t actually disappear from the BitClout blockchain; it was merely de-indexed by the BitClout UI (user interface). The fact that BitClout could de-index my profile from its site tells us that it is not the blockchain or the users but BitClout’s site admin who is in charge of the platform.  Part of the reason I feel confident pooh-poohing BitClout on this point is that the OGs have all known that if you want to decentralize social media, you can’t just print an altcoin (which sometimes goes by a more unsavory, scatological term) and call it a day. You have to decentralize, i.e., eliminate, the web servers themselves. BitClout has a web server, ergo, it’s not decentralized.  A little-known fact is that before I ran a law practice, I – as part of a team of three including lawyer-coder Casey Kuhlman and quantum mathematician Dr. Tyler Jackson – designed and built the first Ethereum DAO back on the POC3 testnet in 2014.  Being the least software-proficient of the group, my role was mainly to write the paper and provide some of the legal-structural considerations. The product was called “Eris” and it was basically a decentralized version of Reddit. It included voting, discussion, moderation and content posting functionality.  The objective of the exercise was to develop a system that could eliminate all centralization. At the time, we wrote:  Where Bitcoin was designed to solve this problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, [we are] working on solving this issue for internet-based communications, social networking and community governance – bearing in mind that for free internet services such as e-mail, social networking, search and “open data,” intrusion into users’ private lives and the accumulation and centralization of vast quantities of personal information in centralized silos is not some minor and ancillary nuisance[…]. As such, Eris is not another web service; Eris is significantly different because it has been designed and implemented specifically to not use [web]servers.  Back in 2014, our issue was that we were nearly a decade too early; layer 1 architecture capable of being amended by majority vote had yet to be built (hard forks only), the problem decentralized social media fixes simply didn’t exist, and VCs regarded social as something of a “death zone” where existing behemoths like Twitter and Facebook controlled the battle space. Nobody needed, or even wanted, to express themselves anywhere else.  Put another way, in 2014, nobody needed decentralized social media because it was still a time when the internet could be described as free and open. That’s before GamerGate, before Donald Trump, before Brexit and before successive rounds of increasing corporate censorship and mass media partisanship.  Fast forward to the present day. I take several calls per week from entrepreneurs, some funded, some not, looking to decentralize aspects of social media. All recognize that Web 3 won’t use web servers because web servers are a point of contact on which a regulator or a tyrant can apply pressure to get the entire service taken offline.  In an increasingly politically volatile world, the need is for software that will continue to run, as Bitcoin does, regardless of social or legal pressure – state-driven, mob-driven or corporation-driven – directed at the system as a whole. The software will need to be architected in such a way as allows serious unlawful use to be targeted and excised (if necessary node by node) but makes lawful use very difficult to obstruct. This will likely be a mix of self-hosted infrastructure for content and decentralized infrastructure for coordination.  What will Web 3 look like, then? At minimum, it will be entirely peer to peer. A blockchain need not serve a role, as we see with Mastodon’s federated model, but it could provide some function – either as publicly accessible PKI infrastructure (similar to Mastodon or Microsoft’s ION Digital ID) or accounting infrastructure (which rewards the provision of the service’s infrastructure, similar to Helium). The blockchain will likely not host content, a task better left to users.  For so long as quasi-decentralized services possess even a scintilla of centralization, regulatory pressure can and will be applied. Any centralized infrastructure could be leveraged to eliminate the decentralized product. Eventually, however, and soon, someone is going to figure out the precise mix, the secret sauce, of how to build, and incentivize the continued provision of, user-friendly, wholly decentralized apps, with all functionality being run on a client running locally on users’ own machines rather than via a web server.  As a lawyer, I’m often asked what sort of regulation is appropriate for bitcoin and crypto. Usually I shrug my shoulders and say that existing regulation works perfectly well – mainly because, having worked in the crypto space since 2013, I have a good sense of what’s decentralized versus what’s decentralization theater. We are fast approaching a point, however, where there will no longer be decentralization theater. At that point, the actors our laws traditionally regulate – in social media, finance and other verticals – will have ceased to exist. After that point, crafting new laws – laws that allow the state to satisfy certain minimum standards for operating that infrastructure in civilized society on the one hand, but do not crush innovation completely on the other – will be a challenging task indeed.

42424473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oz1h,1634648732,How Riot Plans to Add Hashrate Without Adding Miners,"Riot Blockchain plans to increase its crypto mining hashrate potentially by up to 50% through adopting 200 megawatts (MW) of immersion-cooling technology at its Whinstone facility in Texas.  The technology allows the mining rigs to be submerged in a specialized fluid, which helps them operate at lower temperatures, resulting in a more efficient and stable environment, the Castle Rock, Colorado-based miner said in a statement on Tuesday. The initial deployment of ASIC miners in the immersion-cooled buildings is expected to commence by the fourth quarter of 2021.  “Based on industry data and the company’s own preliminary immersion-cooling test results, an estimated 25% increase in hash rate is expected, with an estimated potential to increase ASIC performance by as much as 50%,” Riot said in the press release. The company expects more test results from its pilot project by the end of the first quarter in 2022.  “If successful, Riot will be able to leverage its infrastructure development capabilities to increase its Bitcoin mining hash rate without relying solely on purchasing additional mining equipment, resulting in increased operating efficiencies, and thus, capital efficiencies,” the miner added.  Riot currently has a hashrate capacity of 2.6 exahash per second (EH/s) and plans to ramp up to 7.7 EH/s by the fourth quarter of 2022.  Riot will apply the technology to 200 MW of its previously announced 400 MW expansion of its Whinstone facility, hosting about 46,000 S19 Antminers from the miner’s existing mining rigs.  This is not the first time a miner is using this technology. Recently a Canadian cleantech cryptocurrency miner, MintGreen, said it will be using its own immersion technology to supply the city of North Vancouver, British Columbia, with heat generated from bitcoin mining.  However, Riot says its deployment of immersion technology will be the first to be used by any miner at this scale.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/how-riot-plans-to-add-hashrate-without-adding-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c40900ca8e3e43d0f79a8144a3a64e8a1472017-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

All of the mining machines will be ASICs and will only mine bitcoin, according to a statement emailed to CoinDesk. Recently, as part of its expansion plans, Atlas also signed a deal with Core Scientific in October to host new bitcoin miners.  With the environmental impact of crypto mining activities in the forefront of many conversations, most miners are trying to source more renewable energy to power their operations.  “To achieve sustainable growth in adherence to its ESG commitments, Atlas is carrying out a mass adoption of renewable energy, with a long-term goal to be 100% carbon-free,” Atlas Chairman Raymond Yuan said in a statement.  Compute North, which works to build and operate at locations where the majority of the energy provided is renewable, will power Atlas’ mining rigs via electrical grids, where a wide variety of fuel sources will be used, the data centers operator said in an email statement to CoinDesk.  “We also work with customers, like Atlas, to enhance their ESG program by helping to provide options for things like tax equity and renewable energy certificates (RECs) to address this challenge and to demonstrate their commitment to investing in renewable energy,” the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based firm said in the emailed statement.  The decision to expand in the U.S. comes as more miners are migrating their operations to North America following China’s sweeping crypto ban. In fact, recently the U.S. has taken the top spot in bitcoin mining, and the trend is expected to continue due to geopolitical certainty, access to cheap power and infrastructure.  Atlas has contracted more than 400 megawatts of infrastructure capacity with local partners in different regions and plans to add 1 gigawatt of capacity in the next 18 months, according to the statement. To date, the miner has purchased more than 200,000 mining rigs and aims to continue to acquire more over the next few years, the miner added.  Compute North’s colocation service entails providing a data center to host mining equipment. The company currently operates three such facilities in Texas, Nebraska and South Dakota.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/atlas-taps-compute-north-to-expand-esg-focused-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29166ac0a94034581d5542f36dcabb661ef77723-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The combined firm will be known as Variant.  Jesse Walden, who focused on blockchain investments at a16z, launched Variant Fund last year with the ownership economy in mind. Around the same time, Li Jin left a16z’s consumer team to found Atelier Ventures to target new platforms that enabled users to “monetize individuality” in a so-called “passion economy.” Last month, The New York Times called Jin “the investor guru for online creators.”  “Both of our funds are notably different in a sea of venture firms: They exist not just out of a desire for financial returns, but to support companies that catalyze greater social and economic equality,” Jin wrote in her personal blog post announcing the merger and the new fund. “Our missions were, and are, two sides of the same coin: Ownership is a cornerstone of financial freedom and enables greater enfranchisement of participants in the networks to which they contribute their time and energy.”  Read more: This a16z Alum Is Launching a VC Fund Focused on Platforms You Can ‘Own’  In a group announcement post from Variant, General Partners Walden, Jin and Spencer Noon wrote that “we believe that ownership will be a keystone of all next-generation products and platforms,” adding:  “The first to realize this were the developers and technologists who contributed to the movement by building and operating the first multibillion-dollar internet scale networks: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, a new generation of entrepreneurs are rebuilding the internet with this more meritocratic and competitive model in mind. From developer-facing infrastructure to financial marketplaces, social media, gaming, digital art and collectibles, ownership has unlocked a new design space for scaling products faster than predecessors because users are aligned with their success.”  Previous Variant Fund investments include financial exchange Uniswap, where users who make the exchange liquid are rewarded with fees and given tokens that carry governance rights, and publishing platform Mirror, whose users decide on how to grow the platform.  The new $110 million fund is designed for early stage investing across a broad range of companies from consumer platforms to gaming to infrastructure to decentralized finance (DeFi). The partners say the fund offers expertise in startup building, protocol design and consumer-focused, go-to-market strategies.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Walden said there’s an opportunity for Web 3.0 startups to build from the “ground up” with user ownership in mind. For that reason, Variant is interested in getting involved with companies at the earliest possible stage. “It’s literally never too early” for a startup to apply for funding, said Walden.  Variant says it is also embracing the concept of user ownership. The firm expanded the investor base to include over 100 members of Web 3.0, crypto and general technology companies, including Uniswap, Mirror and Yield Guild Games. The Variant community will also have an active role in shaping the fund’s future and supporting portfolio projects.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | UNI,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/vc-firms-variant-fund-atelier-ventures-merge-to-focus-on-the-ownership-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/597217723dc44d10cc1f04ba0a600e19f6492ebb-2384x1257.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Volume spiked on trades between bitcoin (BTC) and the stablecoin tether (USDT) on the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx between the hours of 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. UTC, according to data from TradingView.  From 2 a.m. to 3 a.m., the trading volume totaled 5,929 BTC on the exchange, and it reached 4,049 BTC from 3 a.m. to 4 a.m., the data showed. The total of more than 10,000 BTC works out to at least $620 million based on the cryptocurrency’s latest price.  The crypto industry blogger Colin Wu tweeted Tuesday that “there is a view that it seems that there was a pending sell order of about 14,000 BTC in the BTC/USDT trading pair on OKEx, but it was subsequently eaten by the buy order.”  When asked to comment on the trades, an exchange spokesperson sent the following, attributed to Lennix Lai, director of OKEx: “We see this as a healthy development within the market and do not currently notice any abnormalities.”  Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics, said the quick digestion of the elevated trading volume might demonstrate the asset’s high global liquidity.  “The fact that such a significant order was apparently absorbed by prevailing trader buying activity is an indication of the underlying strength and bullish bias of the bitcoin market currently,” Deane added.

Despite hundreds of decentralized applications and thousands of developers studying Web 3.0, to date these applications have not guaranteed users data sovereignty. What is that and why is it important? Before we answer that, we need to clear up what Web 3.0 is and why it is important. Breaking down the phases of web growth: First there was Web 1.0 - broadly used first in the 1990s, the worldwide web was composed mainly of static web pages uploaded by web developers. Then there was Web 2.0, which launched in the early 2000s. This refers to the change from mainly static web pages to interactive, user-generated content. For example, social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Twitch, as well as apps like Uber and Airbnb. Web 2.0 has created massive social media networks and massive volumes of data built on centralized networks on the Internet.

42424474,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oz7h,1634635305,Analysts Divided on Prospects of Sell-the-Fact Move as Bitcoin ETF Listing Nears,"There is an old saying on Wall Street: Buy the rumor, sell the news. The adage is based on the belief that market participants, being forward-looking, tend to buy an asset when expecting positive information and take profit, driving the market lower on confirmation of the news.  Bitcoin has rallied over 40% this month on expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing in futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrency. With ProShares’ product set to go live on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, there is a lot of noise in the market about the possibility of a sell-the-fact pullback in bitcoin. Analysts, however, stand divided on the issue.  “Will someone please remind [me] the day before the bitcoin ETF officially launches? I might want to take some chips off the table,” Dan Morehead, CEO and co-chief investment officer of Pantera Capital, wrote in his newsletter earlier this month. “On Wall Street, there’s a saying, ‘Buy the rumor, sell the fact.’ Definitely working in our space.”  Bitcoin had surged by over 2,000% in about six weeks leading up to the launch of futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Dec. 17, 2017. The cryptocurrency peaked near $20,000 on the same day and entered a year-long bear market.  Similar price action was seen earlier this year as bitcoin topped out at $64,801 when crypto exchange Coinbase debuted its stock listing on Nasdaq on April 14. The cryptocurrency fell to $30,000 the following month.  Blockchain data supports the case for sell-the-fact action after the ETF listing, as discussed in Monday’s First Mover newsletter. The exodus of coins from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has stalled in recent weeks, contrary to the steady decline in exchange balances observed during the bull run from $10,000 to over $64,000.  “This goes in line with the expectation that once trading goes live for a bitcoin ETF, we will likely see a sell-off event,” Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade The Chain, said in a Twitter response. “The reason you keep crypto on exchanges is because you plan to make use of that liquidity. Keep a lookout for a major selling event this week.”  Some selling may be seen if the uptake for the newly launched product is weak.  “Disappointment from the BTC futures ETF listing could provoke a correction. After other seminal BTC market moments such as the listing of BTC futures on the CME in December 2017 and the listing of Coinbase on Nasdaq in April 2021, the market fell sharply,” said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights Genesis Global Trading. “However, even if there is some sell-off, it is unlikely to be as deep or lasting as the previous examples because of where we are in the market cycle. In both previous cases, the market was already frothy and showing signs of exhaustion. That is not the case this time around.”  Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, and Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, also ruled out a big pullback, saying the focus will be on the first-day trading volume of the ProShares futures ETF.  Meanwhile, Stack Funds COO and co-founder Matthew Dibb doesn’t foresee a significant price drop. “BTC funding rates are mostly flat, indicating little leverage in the market. The structure of bitcoin futures is indicating a substantial premium for long-dated ownership as Sept. 22 is trading at $68,880,” Dibb told CoinDesk in WhatsApp chat. “We see no warning signs that the market is overheated in the short term.”  Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate refers to the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual swaps market, a derivative financial instrument typical in crypto markets that’s like a futures contract without an expiration date. A very high funding rate is widely taken to represent excess bullish positioning and often precedes price pullbacks.  Data from Glassnode shows the average funding rate has receded to 0.01% from 0.024% seen over the weekend.  The options market is showing no signs of nervousness with one-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews signaling a call or bullish bias with negative values.  Put-call skews measure the cost of puts or bearish bets relative to calls or bullish bets. A negative value implies calls are drawing greater demand than puts.  “The favored options contracts appear to be call options with strike prices above $100,000, with a typical open interest of $250 million to $350 million for call options expiring at the end of the year. The open interest in call options dwarfs that in put options, aligning with the overall bullish market sentiment,” Glassnode said in its weekly report published Monday.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $62,200, representing a 0.4% gain on the day.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/19/analysts-divided-on-prospects-of-sell-the-fact-move-as-bitcoin-etf-listing-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f1f238161d8ce974539153143c0182d59e9c895-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Examples include Japan’s World War II surrender, Nelson Mandela’s inauguration and the discovery of Pluto.  The AP confirmed the news in a tweet late on Monday. The news agency didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment as of press time.  The NFTs are available as mystery boxes, each priced at 29 BUSD (Binance’s stablecoin). There are four different levels of rarity, including normal, rare, super rare and super super rare.  Buyers who collect one normal, one rare and one super rare item, but also don’t sell them until 11:59 p.m. UTC on Oct. 25 will have a shot at winning another NFT that “symbolizes the AP’s reach in the world.”  The collection will be released at noon UTC time on Thursday, and each Binance account can buy up to 25 boxes.  The collection is curated by Metalist Lab, an Australian NFT publisher that has previously worked with Chinese video game company NetEase. Metalist Lab announced the news on Oct. 8.  The AP sold an NFT artwork for $180,000 in ether in March. The New York Times and The New Yorker have also sold NFTs.  Binance launched its NFT marketplace in June.

The Banque de France, along with a group of France’s largest financial market participants, executed the transactions using a system developed by U.S.-based IBM, according to a statement from securities depository Euroclear.  Nearly 500 instructions in both primary and secondary markets were executed, though the value of the transactions was not disclosed in a report published on Euroclear’s website.  BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole CIB, HSBC and Societe Generale made up the consortium.  Led by Euroclear, the pilot also included large French banks as well as the French public debt office, per the report.  The CBDC trial, reported earlier by the Financial Times, is one of the European Union’s largest to date, with France regarded as one of the highest-profile eurozone members to launch such an experiment. Sweden, whose Riksbank is also toying with digitizing its national currency, uses the e-krona.  Earlier this year, the Banque de France published a request for proposals for central bank digital currency (CBDC) “experiment” applications in a bid to help it understand the risks and mechanisms of CBDCs. The bank has also engaged in a number of experiments using a CBDC for the wholesale market and cross-border payments as well as interbank settlements.  China is currently the largest economy leading the charge with the implementation of a CBDC for use within its domestic market and plans to extend its CBDC trials to foreigners visiting the nation during next year’s Winter Olympics, to be held in Beijing.  And while the EU and the U.S. are yet to develop to advanced stages, the threat of private cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, has prompted a number of nations to pursue CBDCs.  “This project went well beyond previous blockchain initiatives because it successfully tested most central securities depository and central bank processes whilst eliminating current interim steps, such as reconciliation between market intermediaries,” said Soren Mortensen, global director of financial markets at IBM, as cited in the report. “We are rapidly moving towards fundamental change in the post-trade market infrastructure.”  Read more: Société Générale Shopping for Crypto Custodian: Sources  UPDATE (OCT. 19, 9:16 UTC): Changes sourcing to Euroclear, adds link to report.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/19/france-trials-cbdc-blockchain-for-government-bond-deals-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e59cd2d346c5c2528391753262c154f94f0a3fed-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424465,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oynh,1634607715,Blockchain ‘Blank Check’ SPAC Announces $100M IPO to Fund Acquisitions,"Blockchain Moon Acquisition Corp. (BMAC), a newly formed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) based in Jacksonville, Fla., has been given the green light by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list $100 million worth of shares in an initial public offering (IPO).  The company is pricing 10 million units at $10 each, and the units will be listed on Tuesday on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “BMAQU,” according to a Form S-1 filing with the SEC last month. Each unit consists of one common share, one redeemable warrant to acquire half a share and one right to purchase 1/10th of a common share.  Chardan Capital Markets of New York is acting as sole book-running manager, and the offering is expected to close on Thursday.  With the listing, BMAC CEO Enzo Villani told CoinDesk via email on Monday the next step is to “find the right target for the SPAC and execute a merger.”  “We ... have been working on this for the past few months,” Villani said. “The SPAC is focused on merging with a growth-oriented company in the blockchain economy who is seeking capital and can leverage the public markets to scale their business.”  A SPAC is a company without commercial operations. It is designed to raise capital via an IPO and then acquire or merge with existing companies. BMAC defines itself as a “blank check” company focused on pursuing high-growth blockchain technology companies in North America, Europe and Asia, according to its website.  According to the filing, the blockchain company will target companies that have “significant competitive advantages and/or underexploited expansion opportunities.” The expansion can be accomplished through a “combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets,” the company notes.  “We intend to seek to identify companies with strong, public-ready management teams, with solid corporate governance and reporting policies that have the experience to execute successfully and create value for stakeholders,” the filing reads.
