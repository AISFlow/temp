42408097,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9iqh,1717196945,U.S. President Biden Vetoes Resolution Overturning SEC Guidance,"U.S President Joe Biden signed a veto of a House Joint Resolution that would have repealed the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, he announced Friday afternoon.  SAB 121 is a controversial piece of SEC accounting guidance that directs financial institutions holding crypto for customers to keep the assets on their own balance sheets. Critics of the guidance say it makes it too difficult for financial institutions to work with crypto companies.  In his statement announcing the veto, Biden said he would not support any ""measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.""  ""By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues,"" his statement said. ""This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices.""  Biden's statement echoed his previous comments on wanting to work with Congress on legislation addressing the digital asset market, saying ""appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary.""  The veto came hours after banking groups and members of Congress sent a pair of letters to Biden's desk, asking him to sign the resolution to overturn SAB 121.  The banking organizations' letter said the guidance, which the Government Accounting Office said it blocks regulated banking groups from offering custody services. The lawmakers' letter urged the administration to at least work with the SEC to rescind the guidance if Biden still intended to veto the resolution, as he threatened before the House voted on the measure.  The resolution passed both chambers of Congress with easy majorities.  Earlier Friday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of Biden's party who voted for the resolution, said the guidance creates a different standard for crypto than other assets in the financial sector while at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/31/us-president-biden-vetoes-resolution-overturning-sec-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff0e6baaaa3a9b7ff10c7c6b668a6de900c3bb2-5837x3283.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This time, he outlined two scenarios that could occur and cause the crypto token to experience a breakout, potentially sending it as high as $7.5. This comes with the recent revelation that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached its lowest ever. Time For An XRP Price Breakout Egrag Crypto shared a chart in an X (formerly Twitter) post that showed that the crypto token could rise to $7.5 when it accomplishes the breakout, which the crypto analyst claimed is imminent. Egrag highlighted a “White Triangle” breakout on the chart, which he stated is “aligning perfectly” with the previous charts and the Fib 0.702 to 0.786 levels. He added that the measured move is projected to be between $1.2 and $1.5 before XRP could take off and climb to $7.5. Egrag further remarked that the “critical breakout point” for XRP is around $0.70 and $0.7’5 and that the crypto token is “poised” to achieve this breakout in the “next couple of weeks. Egrag warned that XRP could still experience significant declines before then, stating that a retest of the breakout might be on the cards. However, he is convinced that a “MEGA RUN for XRP is on the horizon.” Meanwhile, for the second scenario of how XRP could achieve its impending breakout, Egrag Crypto highlighted an ‘Atlas Line’ on the XRP chart and claimed that the breakout point for XRP is at $0.6799. He noted that XRP is still holding strong “like a boss” on the atlas line, suggesting it shouldn’t be long before it breaks above $0.6799. In the meantime, $0.5777 and $0.5000 are key price levels that XRP holders should monitor. Egrag labels them resistance and support levels for XRP’s upward trend along this atlas line. XRP Hits Its Lowest RSI In History Egrag revealed in a more recent X post that XRP’s RSI is at its lowest ever. He noted that this assertion was based on the monthly time frame and shared a chart to prove his claim. Following his revelation, Egrag highlighted how bullish this was for XRP, stating, “If this isn’t a positive signal, I don’t know what is.” The chart he shared showed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index is at 38, which is indeed bullish for the crypto token. Low RSI levels are considered a buy signal since they suggest that the coin is oversold and undervalued. Therefore, crypto investors might be looking to accumulate XRP, with these buy orders expected to trigger a move to the upside for the crypto token. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.52, up almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Riot is reducing costs by purchasing power plans from utilities in Texas and using a flexible approach to mining. Scaling production capacity is crucial to overcome the effects of difficulty and sustain production levels in the face of halving rewards. However, comparison with peer Marathon Digital shows that Riot may not have increased hashrate fast enough to avoid a YoY revenue shortfall compared to last year, when it will report second-quarter revenues in July. Therefore, there are volatility risks which explain my Hold position, but, with a focus on maximizing self-mining operations, the company could represent a long-term opportunity. I covered Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) with a Hold thesis in June 2021 highlighting the way it was scaling, and since it has lost 71.5% in value and is trading at around $10. Its growth strategy saw it recently make a takeover bid for Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF ) for about $950 million. This, I believe should be followed by other deals in a highly competitive crypto-mining industry where it is getting more difficult to produce Bitcoins. This difficulty was exacerbated by the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving event last month, which marked a drastic reduction in the rewards perceived by miners for each block they add to the blockchain as operating costs remain on the high side in a market where prices may be pressurized. Against such a backdrop, this thesis shows that despite a 35% year-to-date downside, Riot is not a buy. Data by YCharts Instead, this could represent an opportunity given the way it is managing direct costs to mine while also scaling operations. Reducing Costs to Address The Issue of Lower Rewards First, energy remains the largest cost item for Bitcoin miners, as it limits the ability to bring the hashrate online or increase production capacity. Thus, for Riot, power costs were $16,764 in the first quarter of 2024 (Q1) and represented 73% of the total direct cost to mine. The remaining 27% includes labor, insurance, network maintenance, equipment repairs, land lease and taxes, network costs, and other utility expenses. Looking across this highly competitive industry, miners like Bitfarms normally target low-cost, stranded, and renewable electricity. However, Riot has a different strategy, one consisting of purchasing power plans from utilities in Texas. Moreover, instead of just using all of them to maximize crypto output, these are used on an economically efficient basis. In other words, Riot only uses part of the energy purchased for business operations and sells the rest to utilities in exchange for credits to apply to future energy bills. Second, in addition to energy, the efficiency of mining operations also depends on the Bitcoin mining machines and the type of cooling used. In this respect, to compensate for the drop in revenue, miners improve the average energy efficiency of their fleet by replacing older, less efficient miners with newer, more efficient miners. As for Riot, it has chosen MicroBT M66S machines for its Rockdale facility and one of the particularity of this machine is its ability to use immersive liquid cooling, a technology the miner is deploying for its Corsicana facility purchased in 2022. For investors, immersion cooling is more efficient than air cooling and data centers equipped with this technology can consume as much as 50% less energy. Overall, flexible power plans, a more efficient mining fleet, and cooling technology are ways to improve margin profiles, but, equally pressing, is the need to increase production capacity since the reward earned for adding each block on the blockchain was divided by two, or from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC after halving. This entails a reduction in mining revenues unless additional hashrate is added. Mining Difficulty and How Bitfarms Could Have Boosted Riot's Position To complicate matters further, there is also mining difficulty. Thus, looking at production, only 1,364 BTC were mined in Q1 representing a substantial 36% YoY drop. This is explained by a doubling in average difficulty, from around 40 in the first quarter of 2023 to 80 in the same period this year, as shown in the chart below. This was caused by an increase in global hash rate, making it more difficult to mine the next block as miners boosted production in the pre-halving period to profit from higher rewards. ycharts.com Now, unless a miner diversifies into AI or another industry verticals, the only way to overcome the effects of difficulty and sustain production levels is to increase the hash rate. For Riot, this means more than doubling the 12.4 exahash deployed at the end of Q1 to 31 exahash by end-2024. Now, while the company is executing plans to add capacity organically, acquiring Bitfarms which intends to boast 12 exahash by the end of this year would have greatly accelerated its endeavor. However, the takeover was rejected on the basis that it undervalued Bitfarms which initiated a strategic review or a re-assessment of a company's strategy and finances to achieve optimum shareholder value through a merger, sale, or other transaction. Moreover, from the competitive standpoint, the 43 (31 + 12) exahash would have placed Riot closer to Marathon Digital ( MARA ) which plans to increase capacity to 50 exahash by the end of 2024. To achieve such a feat, the world's largest Bitcoin miner has been aggressively acquiring mining sites and was able to boost the hash rate from 11 exahash to 27 exahash at the end of Q1. Thus, by scaling, miners increase their hash rates to obtain more block rewards while at the same time, it provides them with a larger base of operations on which to spread fixed costs, resulting in better gross margins. In addition, it also entitles them to more influence regarding network changes, as voting power is proportional to a miner's hash power. Thus, with 27 exahash compared to only 12.4 exahash for Riot, Marathon is in advance. From this perspective, Riot seems to be playing catch up with the Bitfarms acquisition. Riot Has Increased Hash Rates Organically but This Could Not Be Enough Moreover, in addition to the absolute number of Bitcoins mined, investors are likely to focus on the degree to which miners can avoid revenue shortfalls. In this respect, a comparison of the realized Bitcoin hashrate, which is the hashrate actually achieved over the installed operational capacity shows that Marathon has increased its production capacity faster in Q1, indicated by the steeper gradient of the yellow line below, while the pace has been slower for Riot. Difference between production capacity prepared using chart data from (pro.theminermag.com) In these circumstances, given that mining difficulty remains above 80, likely Riot will again suffer from lower mining revenues for Q2 compared to the same period last year. This is further justified by its BTC production for April being 41% lower YoY. As a result, it may have to sell more Bitcoin to offset this shortfall and not suffer a dent in revenues. However, prices will likely be under pressure as other miners who have not been able to boost production capacity in time to offset the effects of mining difficulty may be constrained to sell some of the coins they have HODLed, possibly as much as $5 billion in total as per analysts at 10x Research . As a result, Riot could see a further decline in its revenue growth relative to its five-year average of nearly 282% as pictured below, which could in turn prove volatile for the stock. seekingalpha.com Riot is a Hold with its Power Credit Differentiator This means potential volatility risks when the company reports Q2 results at the end of July . Volatility also grappled Riot's stock when its takeover bid was rejected, and may again impact the stock in case another miner merges with Bitfarms. This is the reason why with a trailing price-to-sales of 6.91x three times lower than its five-year average of 22.96x as tabled below, it is not the right time to invest, but I am not bearish. seekingalpha.com The reason is analysts estimate revenue growth to pick up at 54% YoY for 2024. This is explained by the miner deployed a hashrate of 12.4 exahash at the end of Q1 resulting in an 18% YoY increase in production capacity. At the same time, the energization (powering up) of its Corsicana facility as part of the first phase deployment puts it on a clear path to achieve 31 exahash by the end of 2024. Thus, for those who want to position themselves, the support level has been in the $8 to $8.8 range during the last year as pictured below, yielding a median of $8.4, which would be a reasonable entry price. Chart prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Furthermore, looking at finances, the miner had 8,490 coins entering into Q1 which is worth about $594.3 million considering a unit price of $70K. When added to the $688.5 million of cash in its balance sheet totals $1.28 billion. This signifies it has sufficient money to cover operating expenses which averaged $216 million in the last three years, in case the halving/difficulty combination takes a bite at its revenue. Also, after terminating hosting contracts or leasing data center space to miners, at its Rockdale facility, the focus is on maximizing self-mining operations. Therefore, the stock is a Hold while it delivers on increasing hashrate efficiently. It could again benefit this summer ahead of what's predicted to be one more record-hot summer in Texas. For this purpose, as part of its long-term power agreements, it already received power credits totaling $71.2 million for the twelve months that ended in December last year, compared to only $27.3 million during the same period in 2022. This equates to approximately 1,017 BTC considering a unit price of $70K per coin, or 12% of its actual Bitcoin reserves, which is significant. Equally important, had the power curtailment credits been applied to the cost of sales, the gross margins would have increased by 2% on a non-GAAP basis , or from 45% to 47%. Volatility Risks are not excluded as the Industry Consolidates However, its energy strategy could induce volatility risks to the stock in case the United States were to face an energy crunch as a result of higher activity for AI and Bitcoin. In this respect, Riot has already been criticized by Greenpeace , as the ""largest and most energy-intensive Bitcoin mine"" causing pollution and climate change. In response, the miner put forward its flexible approach to Bitcoin mining which contributes to grid stability, especially in the summer when there is more demand for power. Finally, Bitfarms has received additional expressions of interest implying other parties could be interested in its assets, triggering a wave of consolidation in the mining industry. Potential bidders could include miners who instead of, or in addition to, investing to build or expand mining capacity opt to acquire or merge with existing ones. However, after having accumulated a 9.25% stake, Riot could be its largest shareholder and plans to request a special shareholder meeting to add independent directors to Bitfarms' board. Therefore, chances are it could eventually gain the upper hand.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696855-riot-platforms-potential-long-term-opportunity-in-a-consolidating-industry?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28737430.jpeg

She’s part of the art/protest project, UNFK, created by serial entrepreneur Gunnar Lovelace. Outside of work, Starfox says she’s friends with Lovelace and his girlfriend and also plays in a glam rock David Bowie-esque band called Starfox and the Fleet.  “This is how I dress in my everyday life,” Starfox said. I don’t think she was joking.  Dustin Lee drove down from Idaho to attend Consensus this year, in part to gain visibility for his Web3 marketplace DeStore.

The company, headquartered in art hub Marfa, Texas, is more of a proof-of-concept today but is hoping to one day get its algorithmically produced merchandise in stores.  “We want to prove we can produce unique, tangible assets at scale,” Calderon said.  Last year, the Association for Women in Crypto ran an inclusion survey of 500 people across 200 crypto firms that found around 80% of women in the industry felt either sexually, mentally or physically unsafe at work. Nearly 50% of men responded the same way. “Crypto scored lower than tech, generally,” AWC founder and CEO Amanda Wick said, although she is seeing signs of progress. She said that this year Consensus, for instance, felt more diverse. And that there’s evidence that firms can improve – especially if they’re competing for talent.  “If you don’t want toxic workplaces, you have to start with better companies,” she said.  Steven Bischoff is the community lead of TronDAO, the decentralized organization that technically comprises anyone who holds TRX tokens.

What generally happens after this pattern forms? Bitcoin Realized Volatility Has Decline To Extreme Lows Recently In a post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend taking place in the Realized Volatility of Bitcoin. The Realized Volatility here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about how volatile a given asset has been based on its price returns within a specified window. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the asset in question has experienced a large number of fluctuations during the period. On the other hand, the low indicator implies that the price action has been stale for the commodity. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Take On Sky-High Leverage: Brace For Volatile Storm? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 1-week Realized Volatility for Bitcoin over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 1-week Bitcoin Realized Volatility has declined to pretty low levels of around 7% recently. This is so extreme that only ten other instances in the past six years have seen the metric go similarly low. This means that the cryptocurrency’s recent consolidation has been amongst the tightest in its history; as for what this trend in the indicator could mean for the cryptocurrency, perhaps past patterns could provide some hints. An inspection of the chart reveals that such stale price action in the asset has generally unwound with a burst of sharp volatility. The latest instance occurred right before the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH). Given this pattern, it’s possible that the recent BTC consolidation could also lead to another sharp move for the cryptocurrency. Something to note, however, is that the volatility emerging out of lows in the Realized Volatility has historically gone either way, implying that the price move emerging out of this tight range could very well be a crash. It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin price will develop from here on out, given the historically stale action it has witnessed over the past week. In other news, as Axel pointed out in another X post, the recent movement from the bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox has meant that many on-chain indicators have shown false signals. The analyst has cited the Bitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) chart as an example. The aSOPR keeps track of the net profit or loss investors across the network realize. As the Mt. Gox BTC had been sitting still in wallets for quite a long time, it’s not surprising that its movement has “realized” a large amount of profit.

42408085,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9iD1,1717190799,Wall Street Asks Biden Not to Veto Congress' Rejection of SEC Crypto Policy,"The groups that lobby for big-bank interests in Washington asked the White House to step back from its stated intention to kill Congress' effort to cancel a controversial Securities and Exchange Commission crypto policy.  Two of the digital assets sector's biggest allies on Capitol Hill also sent a similar request to the president.  In a rare lobbying overlap with crypto world, Wall Street banks and members of Congress are asking President Joe Biden to reverse course on his vow to veto the U.S. congressional resolution to overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) crypto accounting policy.  In recent bipartisan votes that saw many members of Biden's party rebuff his opposition, Congress decided to reject SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) – a controversial accounting standard that would require banks to treat customers' digital assets differently than other assets, demanding they be kept on a bank's balance sheet. Crypto companies have argued this threatens their ability to do business with banks, and the bankers agree.  ""SAB 121 effectively precludes regulated banking organizations from offering digital asset custody at scale since it treats the assets as if they are owned rather than simply custodied by a banking organization,"" according to a letter to Biden on Friday, signed by several groups including the American Bankers Association and Financial Services Forum. ""Institutions that are forced to record custodied digital assets on balance sheet are subjected to higher capital, liquidity, and other prudential requirements, unlike their non-bank competitors.""  The letter came the same day Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) published their own letter to Biden, dated May 30, similarly asking him to not veto, or at least ""work with the SEC to rescind the staff guidance.""  ""Rescinding SAB 121 is well within the SEC’s authority and there is ample precedent for revisiting a staff accounting bulletin,"" the letter said. ""In fact, most staff accounting bulletins over the last three decades have been revisions and rescissions of prior guidance.""  Seven other representatives signed onto the letter, including Reps. Mike Flood (R-Neb.) and Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), the sponsors of the resolution.  Biden's threat to veto the resolution noted that erasing the rule under the Congressional Review Act would mean nothing similar can be implemented by the SEC in the future, which would ""inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability.""  The group of 11 Senate Democrats who went against the president included Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 on Friday that the SEC's policy ""basically sets up a different standard for crypto than everybody else has in the financial sector.""  Read More: U.S. Sen. Wyden: House 'Right' to Pursue Crypto Bill, Late in Session for More Progress  Last week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler sought to explain SAB 121 as an attempt for the regulator to respond to the turmoil and investor harms happening in crypto during 2022. He argued it was ""just"" a staff bulletin meant to address the fact that the failures of collapsing crypto firms were treating customer assets as part of their bankruptcy estates.

This bullish outlook on Bitcoin highlights its potential as a lucrative investment and underscores its evolving role as a ‘digital gold.’ As Bitcoin gains against gold, it solidifies its stature as a formidable asset in the investment world, offering potentially higher returns than traditional safe havens.

28733150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610869,1717185625,Solana-Based Dogwifhat Reaches Critical Level That Could Lead To Catastrophic Crash,"Crypto analyst Crypto Jack has suggested that Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) could soon witness a catastrophic crash. He noted what needs to happen for the meme coin to avoid this significant price decline. How Dogwifhat’s Price Could Crash Significantly Crypto Jack mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogwifhat’s price needs to stay above $3.5 as failure to hold above that level could be “catastrophic” for the meme coin. He also advised crypto traders to exercise caution while trading the meme coin so they do not get caught unaware and shaken out from their positions. Interestingly, data from CoinMarketCap shows that Dogwifhat has experienced a price drop below $3.5 from its weekly high of $4. Crypto Jack’s analysis suggests that the meme coin’s catastrophic crash may have already begun, as it could well hit new lows on its way down. It is worth mentioning that Dogwifhat is still up over 24% in the last seven days, which suggests that this recent price decline might just be a brief correction as part of an upward trend that the meme coin is currently enjoying. However, thanks to this recent price decline, over $1.2 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. Not Yet Time To Be Bearish On Dogwifhat Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto had previously revealed his bearish expectations for Dogwifhat, claiming that the crypto token could drop to as low as $1.6. He added that he would look to short the meme coin at $3.90, as he expected it to enjoy one last push to the upside before it declined significantly. However, despite Dogwifhat already attaining this height as predicted, CrediBULL Crypto suggested in a recent X post that it wasn’t yet the right time to be bearish on Dogwifhat. He claimed that the “Hat stays on a bit longer” because he believes Solana is approaching a bounce zone, which could cause it to climb to new local highs. If that is the case, he expects WIF to continue its upward trend, making it shorting it now a wrong move. Crypto analyst and trader Ponzi Trader also suggested that Dogwifhat still has enough bullish momentum to make another run following its recent price decline. He revealed that he is betting on WIF, bouncing from its current price range. Regarding how high Dogwifhat could rally on its next leg up, crypto analyst Alex Clay predicts the bullish sentiment towards the meme coin could send its price to $6.7. Crypto analyst and trader Unipcs (Bonk Guy) is bullish on Dogwifhat and predicts that the meme coin will reach $10 while claiming it will never drop to $1 again.

28730967,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610858,1717180205,Market Analysis: How Will Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Distribution Affect Crypto Prices?,"As the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox prepares to distribute around $9 billion worth of Bitcoin, some investors are worried about the potential impact on prices. However, industry experts and major creditors believe that any short-term volatility will be outweighed by BTC’s long-term bullish prospects. With the approval of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), many market experts anticipate that the market will absorb the newly available tokens. Bitcoin Optimism Among Market Participants As reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, Mt. Gox’s Japanese trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, recently announced plans to start distributing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to creditors. The process is expected to commence shortly, with most claimants set to receive their tokens before the end of October. However, concerns have emerged regarding the impact of this large-scale distribution on Bitcoin’s price. According to Bloomberg, significant creditors and long-time market participants remain confident in Bitcoin’s resilience despite concerns. Many intend to retain the distributed coins, anticipating continued price appreciation. Related Reading: Ethereum Bloodbath: Over $55 Million In Longs Liquidated As Price Plummets Adam Back, CEO of blockchain technology company Blockstream and a creditor himself, emphasizes the “illogicality” of selling at the beginning of a potential bull market. Back suggests that waiting further, after a decade-long wait, could yield even greater returns. According to the firm’s CEO Brian Dixon, other creditors, such as Off the Chain Capital, plan to sell Bitcoin only when “better investment opportunities arise,” recognizing Bitcoin’s historical performance as the best-performing asset in recent years. Dixon further highlights the significant maturation of the Bitcoin market since Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy. He argues that the potential impact of the distribution, although substantial in volume, is unlikely to have a lasting effect on prices. Cosmo Jiang, a portfolio manager at Pantera Capital, notes that while the amount is significant, the distribution will occur over an extended period, making it less actionable regarding market impact. With around $26.6 billion in daily Bitcoin trading, the distributed tokens are expected to be absorbed without major disruption. BCH Sales In Mt. Gox Distribution? Creditors do not anticipate a simultaneous distribution of tokens to all claimants. Instead, they expect the trustee to distribute the coins in tranches, potentially prioritizing earlier-filed claims. This approach may mitigate any immediate market pressure. Moreover, Galaxy Research estimates that credit funds, holding approximately 20,000 BTC, are unlikely to engage in significant selling. Instead, they are expected to distribute the Bitcoin to their limited partners (LPs) in kind. While BTC is anticipated to weather the distribution without major consequences, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may face more pressure due to its lower ideological commitment from holders. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, suggests that individual creditors owed the majority of tokens to be distributed this year, will likely be the primary source of sales, with some opting to sell their Bitcoin Cash. Related Reading: Near Protocol Breaks Out From Wedge Pattern: Why This Could Trigger A 37% Crash In summary, as Mt. Gox prepares to distribute billions of dollars worth of BTC, industry experts and major creditors remain optimistic, citing the maturity of the Bitcoin market, the potential for continued price appreciation, and the availability of newly approved ETFs. While short-term volatility is possible, most stakeholders are confident that Bitcoin’s long-term prospects will outweigh any immediate market impact. As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,900, representing a 1.3% price drop over the past 24 hours.

Wyden: House 'Right' to Pursue Crypto Bill, Late in Session for More Progress","The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee told a Consensus 2024 audience that the House of Representatives was on the right track with the FIT21 bill.  Wyden said he and others in the Senate decided to slam the brakes on the Securities and Exchange Commission's controversial crypto accounting standard and reconsider using a ""different standard"" on the custody of digital assets.  AUSTIN, Texas – Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the U.S. Senate Democrats who've shown some support for crypto issues, cast doubt Friday that a legislative solution for the industry would move quickly, but he suggested to an audience at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 that the momentum will continue next year in Washington.  In the wake of the recent approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) that was driven by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) in the House of Representatives – drawing support from a third of the Democrats there – the legislation to establish digital assets market structure is now in the hands of the Senate.  ""It's getting late in this session, so it's unclear how far that bill will move,"" Wyden said at the event in Austin, Texas. ""But I think Chairman McHenry is right to establish a kind of regulatory framework and put a sharper focus on fighting fraud and rip-off artists.""  ""We've made a lot of headway, but there's a long way to go,"" Wyden said.  Read More: U.S. Lawmaker at Center of Crypto Negotiation Predicts Digital Assets Law by Next Year  Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was among the 11 Senate Democrats who joined Republicans in seeking to overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto accounting policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). Though the House and Senate approved a resolution to overturn the policy, President Joe Biden has threatened to veto it.  ""It basically sets up a different standard for crypto than everybody else has in the financial sector with respect to custody,"" Wyden said. ""A group of us said, 'Let's just hold on here and take the time to make sense and not just establish a whole separate unique barrier to storing customers' crypto.'""  The senator, who is also a member of the Congressional Internet Caucus, said he supports stablecoins and is rooting for innovations in blockchain technology, such as in the creation of portable medical records.  He said Congress often struggles with new technology, but he added that crypto is a ""great issue for people to run on"" in this year's congressional elections.  ""There's no question that there's growing interest here,"" he said.

28728944,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610868,1717174823,"Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $69,000 Is Very Important In The Grand Scheme Of A Bitcoin Recovery","Crypto analyst Pierre has provided insights into why $69,000 is a significant price level for Bitcoin. He suggested the flagship crypto could hit a new all-time high (ATH) if it successfully holds above that range. A Breakout Above $69,000 Could Lead To A Bitcoin Recovery Pierre mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin must break above $69,000 as it would allow the crypto token to retest a range around the ATH region of $73,000. This could also open up the possibility of the flagship hitting a new ATH if it enjoys a breakout during the retest of the current ATH region. Meanwhile, Pierre outlined what needs to happen for Bitcoin to avoid declining significantly. He noted that the flagship crypto must avoid losing the range between $67,500 and $68,200 as support. He claimed that a drop below this range could lead to Bitcoin retesting the range between $65,000 and $66,500. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe also shared a sentiment similar to Pierre’s, although he specifically made reference to the $70,000 price level. He claimed that BTC will likely see a new ATH once it achieves a successful breakout above $70,000. In a recent X post, he claimed that Bitcoin must hold above $66,000 and $67,000 to avoid “further downward momentum to $60,000.” Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also suggested that Bitcoin simply needs to break above $70,000 to enter the ‘parabolic uptrend’ phase. However, it could take a while before Bitcoin achieves that successful breakout above $70,000. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, predicted that BTC will continue to range between $60,000 and $70,000 until August. Van de Poppe suggested that it might not take that long for Bitcoin to break above $70,000. He predicted listing the Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger a significant move for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas recently predicted that these funds could go live in June or by July 4th at the latest. A Weekly Close Above $69,000 Could Alter History In a recent X post, Rekt Capital claimed that a weekly close above the $69,000 range “would alter the course of history.” However, he suggested it was unlikely to happen, stating that Bitcoin doesn’t “favor a breakout this early post-halving.” The crypto analyst had previously mentioned that “history suggests that this historic breakout is still several weeks away.” However, he added that it has become clear that Bitcoin is “only one weekly close above the range high away from entering the parabolic phase of the cycle.” Before now, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin hitting a new ATH before the halving had brought about an accelerated cycle but that the flagship crypto could consolidate for longer to resynchronize with previous halving cycles.

28727417,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610784,1717171240,Ethereum Investors Take On Sky-High Leverage: Brace For Volatile Storm?,"Data shows the investors in the Ethereum derivatives market have been taking on very high leverage recently, something that could lead to volatility for the asset. Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Been At Extreme Levels Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the ETH Estimated Leverage Ratio has been on the up recently. The “Estimated Leverage Ratio” (ELR) refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum Open Interest and Exchange Reserve. The former of these, the Open Interest, here is a measure of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. The second metric, the Exchange Reserve, naturally tells us about the total number of tokens of the cryptocurrency that are sitting in wallets attached to all exchanges. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Is “One Of Crypto’s Top Leading Indicators”: Santiment When the ELR’s value rises, it means that the Open Interest is increasing at a faster rate than the Exchange Reserve. Such a trend implies that investors are opting for a higher amount of leverage on average. On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests the derivatives market users are moving towards a lower amount of risk as they are deleveraging their positions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum ELR over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum ELR has observed some steep growth recently. This sudden sharp uptrend in the asset came about as news around the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gained traction in the buildup to the approval. The cryptocurrency’s price also registered a sharp rally during the same time. Thus, the conditions were perfect for attracting fresh speculation related to the coin, so it’s not surprising that the indicator’s value saw a spike. The rise has also continued beyond the approval of the ETFs, but the price has fallen to a sideways movement. It would appear that the investors are willing to take even higher risk despite this consolidation, trying to bet big on where Ethereum could escape from here. Historically, a high value of the leverage ratio has meant a higher volatility for the asset’s price. This is because mass liquidation events can become more probable to take place when the investors are sitting in overleveraged positions. Related Reading: How High Can Bitcoin Go Before A Top? Analyst Chimes In With ETH trading sideways recently and all these positions building up, it might take only one break in either direction before a lot of these positions come crashing down. A large number of such liquidations happening at once would only fuel further into the price move that caused them, thus amplifying it. It now remains to be seen how the Ethereum price develops in the coming days and if a volatile move is waiting for it given the trend in the ELR. ETH Price May has been a good time for Ethereum investors as the asset is looking to close the month with positive returns of more than 18%.

At 11:45 am ET, bitcoin was changing hands at $67,300, lower by 1% over the past 24 hours and down by more than 2% from two hours earlier when it briefly rose above $69,000. The broader CoinDesk 20 was down 1.1% over the last day.  May, though, has been strong for bitcoin, which is now higher by 11% since beginning the month at around the $60,000 level. That's underperformed the CoinDesk 20's roughly 20% advance, fueled by a 31% gain in the price of ether {{ETH}} thanks to the surprising regulatory turnaround in the prospects for a spot ETF for that asset.  Macro conditions could provide next catalyst  This week's muted action in bitcoin – the price has essentially stayed in the $67,000-$69,000 range – came alongside struggles for other risk assets, U.S. stocks amongst them. While still remaining close to all-time highs, the Nasdaq is lower by about 2% this week, while the S&P 500 is off by roughly 1.5%.  U.S. economic data continued to have the scent of stagflation, with the April Core PCE Price Index up 2.8% year-over-year, in line with expectations and the same pace as the previous month. The May Chicago PMI plunged to 35.4 versus expectations for 41 and 37.9 in April. Only in the depths of the 2008/2009 global financial crisis and the March/April 2020 Covid lockdowns has May's weak read been matched. The bond market rallied following the news, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down 5.5 basis points to 4.50%.  June begins Saturday and next week should bring a bit more clarity to the U.S. economic picture thanks to Monday's national PMI report and Friday's national employment report.

28725903,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610783,1717167635,Rumor Of Apple Partnership Sends Crypto Altcoin Soaring By 20%,"A whirlwind of speculation is currently surrounding the crypto asset JasmyCoin (JASMY), colloquially termed the “Bitcoin of Japan,” following a recent announcement from the Prime Minister’s Office of Japan. Yesterday, it was disclosed that a video conference between Prime Minister Kishida and Apple CEO Tim Cook had confirmed the integration of Japan’s My Number Card function into iPhones by next spring. Crypto Investors Speculate On Apple Collaboration The news has sparked a significant rally for JASMY, leading to a 20% increase in its market value within the last 24 hours, pushing its market capitalization to $1.4 billion and ranking it the 67th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The altcoins’ 24-hour trading volume has also surged by 400% to $570 million. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Is “One Of Crypto’s Top Leading Indicators”: Santiment While the My Number Card system—a personal identification framework by the Japanese government—is not officially related to JasmyCoin, rumors have circulated regarding a potential linkage for a few months. Despite no formal confirmation, investors are seemingly speculating on a linkage, influenced by the broader interpretation of Japan’s digital strategy, which includes fostering Web3 technologies like blockchain and IoT, domains where JasmyCoin is a significant player. JasmyCoin, established in 2016 by former Sony executive Kazumasa Sato, aims to provide secure data transactions and storage for IoT devices. The cryptocurrency is rumored to be part of Japan’s broader approach to integrate advanced technologies into everyday life, including the Metaverse and NFTs. “Jasmy’s mission is to facilitate the democratization of data through secure management and storage solutions, allowing individuals to retain control over their personal information. Speculation about JasmyCoin’s involvement with the My Number Card system seems further fueled by an erroneous report shared on Binance Square, suggesting a direct integration of JASMY with the card’s functionality on iPhones. However, this claim has not been substantiated by any official sources. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Top Altcoins To Make A 10x Return In 90 Days The Japanese government has been a proponent of adopting Web3 innovations as a strategy for economic growth, with the Prime Minister himself emphasizing the importance of digital transformations in recent public addresses. The optimistic outlook for blockchain technology in Japan has been a boon for JasmyCoin, with the government’s digital policy indirectly benefiting the cryptocurrency. The recent surge in JASMY’s market activity demonstrates the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, where rumors and expectations can drive significant price movements. As it stands, while JasmyCoin is indirectly aligned with Japan’s digital ambitions, direct partnerships or integrations with governmental projects like the My Number Card have not been officially confirmed. Since February 19, JASMY has rallied by approximately 380%. However, the altcoin is still down more than 91% from its all-time high of $0.35 in October 2021. At press time, JASMY traded at $0.03068.

However, it seems that the altcoin may have exhausted its runway, as a crypto analyst believes its earlier breakout is very bearish for the price. Near Protocol Breaks Out Of Wedge Pattern At the start of the month of May, the Near Protocol price had formed a wedge pattern after falling to $5.5 and then recovering slightly. This wedge pattern would hold its price in a tight range for a while. However, by the middle of the month, the Near Protocol price broke out of the wedge pattern and began a move upward. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Elliot Wave Count Falls Into Place, Here’s Where The Bullish Wave 4 Says The Price Is Headed Following the breakout, the altcoin’s price saw an over 15% recovery that put its price firmly above $8, but this did not last for long. Once the Bitcoin price began to retrace and the crypto market followed, so did the Near Protocol price decline. This confirmed the bearishness hat was brewing in the price of the coin. Crypto analyst Kledji Cuni revealed in a TradingView post that this breakout remains bearish for the price. According to him, the pattern is still very solid, meaning that the breakout actually marked the beginning of the bearish trend. As for how the price will move from here, the analyst expects that Near Protocol will continue to fluctuate around its current level of $7.3. However, the downtrend is expected to happen regardless. “The price may spend some time in the same zone before it moves down for an impulsive,” he stated. Targets for the decline include an initial 8% drop to $6.78. Following this is another expected drop down to the $6 level. Then finally, the analyst expects the downtrend to bottom out around $4.6. If it goes this low, it would mean a total decline of 37% from its current price. A Reversal In The Cards? Recent developments in the metrics of Near Protocol lend credence to the crypto analyst’s prediction of an impending decline. For one, the coin is seeing losses in the last month after starting off 2024 on a very strong foot. This is in addition to the notable decline in its daily trading volume. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Forecasts 8,300% Rally To $38, Here’s When The Near Protocol daily trading volume has dropped more than 18% in the last day to approximately $246 million. This decline suggests a decline in interest in the altcoin and could be a contributing factor to the decline. At the time of writing, Near protocol is trending $7.3, with a 0.89% decline in the last day and a 4.28% decline in the last week.

Together with the team, we made a joint commitment to placing the right people in the right roles. The affected team members are not leaving the company but moved to take up other internal roles.”  Notcoin is a game based on the instant messaging platform Telegram. It is one of the largest cryptocurrency gaming projects with 35 million users. Early adopters of the game earned in-game balances that could eventually be converted to a Notcoin airdrop at a 1000:1 ratio.  On May 16, users faced delays in depositing the newly issued notcoin to Bybit, which resulted in losses as they couldn’t immediately sell the asset. The exchange received 370,000 on-chain transactions; 70% of deposits were credited before the market went live.  “We prioritized customer interests and conducted a thorough internal review to enhance the customer experience for the future,"" the Bybit spokesperson added. “This improvement led to some leadership role changes, which we believe are essential.”  Notcoin is currently trading at over $0.0115 cent, having more than doubled from a low of $0.0047 last week, according to CoinMarketCap.

The personal-consumption expenditure (PCE) data is scheduled for release at 8:30 EST (12:30 UTC) and will offer the latest clues on the Fed's next interest-rate moves. Bitcoin sits at $68,100 at the time of writing, an increase of around 0.4% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has risen by just under 0.5%, with the majority of its constituents showing changes of less than 1% in either direction.  The Donald Trump-themed meme coin TRUMP plummeted Thursday after the former president was found guilty of falsifying business records. The token sank as much as 35% after the verdict. Meanwhile, Jeo Boden, a meme coin inspired by President Joe Biden, soared 20%. TRUMP soon recovered though, rallying nearly 50% to just under $17, even higher than before the verdict, according to CoinGecko data. TRUMP is currently priced at $14.39, an increase of over 11% in the last 24 hours. On Polymarket, the blockchain-powered prediction market, traders continued to place money on Trump defeating Biden in the November election. Trump is well ahead – with 56% odds of winning, versus 38% for Biden – even after the verdict.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicts that more exchange-traded funds will list in the U.S. after the expected approval of a spot ether ETF. It is ""inevitable"" that there would be an ETF tracking Ripple's XRP and equivalent products for SOL and ADA, Garlinghouse said at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. He added that there would be a significant regulatory process before they are approved, but in the end these will be ""speed bumps."" Garlinghouse also took a swipe at the SEC for its approach to crypto. ""[SEC Chair] Gary Gensler has been called to Congress, and when asked if ether is a security, he won't answer the question. Yet, he insists that the rules are very clear and don't need updating,"" he said.  Chart of the Day  Notional open interest in Binance's SHIB futures, which are 1,000 SHIB per contract, has exceeded the $100 million mark.

Semler Scientific stands out as a recent example. The mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as digital gold and a safe haven asset is increasing, leading to more companies adopting BTC. The U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto is improving, which is expected to be very bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. There is a strong game theory element to all of this. I deconstruct this thinking in the article. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been fighting the $73,000 resistance for months now. The Halving in April has yet to deliver on the promises of parabolic returns. With the approval of the Ethereum (ETH-USD) spot ETFs, it seems that the U.S. regulatory picture for crypto has taken a much more favorable turn. There’s a lot going on under the surface for Bitcoin, but today I want to cover game theory. I think this will be extremely impactful for the price action over the next year. Bottom line is that I remain very bullish on BTC and I think adoption will continue growing, which inevitably drives the price upwards. Public Companies Entering First of all, Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) has announced that it will adopt a BTC treasury, taking a page from the MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) playbook. This is a very interesting move and the market certainly liked the news as the stock shot up over 20% after this press release went out. SMLR (Google) It doesn't really take a genius to see the benefits of adopting a Bitcoin strategy. MSTR is a mediocre software business that made one very important decision in 2020 which led to its outperformance over its enterprise software peers, most big tech peers, and even BTC. The latest MSTR quarterly presentation speaks for itself. MSTR Investor Presentation (microstrategy.com) Eric Semler, chairman of SMLR, had this to say about SMLR’s new BTC strategy: Bitcoin is now a major asset class with more than $1 trillion of market value. We believe it has unique characteristics as a scarce and finite asset that can serve as a reasonable inflation hedge and safe haven amid global instability. We also believe its digital, architectural resilience makes it preferable to gold, which has a market value of approximately 10 times that of bitcoin. Given the gap in value between gold and bitcoin, we believe that bitcoin has the potential to generate outsize returns as it gains increasing acceptance as digital gold. So the thesis here is frankly a very old one: BTC is digital gold, and is currently a tenth of the value of physical gold. This gap can be expected to close, and that would mean a very attractive opportunity. Mr Semler also speaks about BTC being a safe haven amid global instability and an asset that is uniquely finite. These are all things which have been discussed in crypto discourse for a very long time. It came into U.S. corporate finance discourse when MSTR adopted its BTC strategy, and now this idea is starting to spread, likely catalyzed by institutional recognition from big players like BlackRock and Fidelity when they pushed the spot ETFs through in January. SMLR had $62 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of 31 March 2024. It put $40 million into BTC per the press release. This is a commitment of two thirds of the cash treasury. SMLR carries virtually zero debt. It is financing everything purely through accumulated cash flows which could have been returned to shareholders via a buyback. And shareholders rewarded the stock by assigning it a much higher price. This is remarkable. The important takeaway right now is that this thesis is gaining attention in the mainstream. First it was the spot ETFs endorsed by major asset managers. Other public companies will probably take notice and replicate MSTR. With FASB rules for digital assets updated in 2023 and the U.S. government taking a more friendly stance on crypto in general, all the external pieces are in place for companies to start adopting BTC. The last thing that remains is for the C-suites to do their due diligence and arrive at the same conclusion that Eric Semler, Michael Saylor, and others before have come to. Bitcoin adoption is a bit like a prisoners’ dilemma. If everyone doesn’t adopt it, then nothing really happens. If everyone adopts it, then of course BTC will go up over time. The tricky part is when some people adopt it and some people do not. The fact is BTC is just neutral, digital hard money which has a tendency of storing purchasing power across time while being able to move value across space at lightspeed. So those who adopt it enjoy what are objectively benefits, which gives them a leg up against those who do not adopt it. And this advantage is sometimes within the context of a zero sum game, so the advantage gained by adopters comes at the expense of those who do not adopt it. MSTR, for example, has enjoyed some of these advantages at the expense of other companies who have not adopted BTC. MSTR secured extremely low interest rates on convertible debt; that money was not loaned to another entity presumably because MSTR offered a more attractive risk-reward profile thanks to its soaring stock price (which is obviously thanks to BTC). So in order for another company to get into that position, it needs to adopt BTC too. The Nash equilibrium to all this is that a sizable minority of companies will begin doing this. And eventually that will cause more boards, executives, and shareholders to take notice. The reason I think it has taken so long to play out is precisely because of the lack of institutional recognition. For instance, even after the spot ETFs were approved, some financial giants like Vanguard still refused to offer these products to their clients. There is a massive amount of inertia in all of this. But we are witnessing the early phases of the shift, and as more companies follow, the shift is going to get faster. Crypto Is Big For This Election In a very similar light as the BTC prisoner's dilemma in corporate finance, there is a similar prisoners’ dilemma playing out in politics. The SEC basically pivoted from trying to sue the Ethereum Foundation for securities violations to approving the Ether ETFs within a very short time frame. This pressure has largely come from the Biden Administration realizing that anti-crypto policies are a terrible political decision because it's a pretty hardlined stance against something that doesn’t really hurt anyone. There aren't a lot of people who are so strongly anti-crypto, who will make that a deciding factor for their vote. The opposite however, isn’t true because there are tens of thousands of jobs linked to crypto and these voters will prioritize pro-crypto stances. So as a politician, being anti-crypto basically wins a lot of strong resentment without winning any strong support. The Congressional vote about digital asset regulatory clarity saw many Congressmembers crossing party lines . This is an indication of the underlying game theory. Those who take a crypto-friendly stance win at the expense of those who do not take a crypto-friendly stance. The Nash equilibrium again is greater regulatory clarity and pro-crypto stances. Trump is certainly doubling down on the crypto vote . He is promising many things which are near and dear to crypto folks: the right to self-custody, the protection of innovation, and the illegalization of CBDCs. All of this means that the U.S. regulatory landscape, long since regarded as a minefield in crypto, is about to improve dramatically. This is going to be very, very bullish for BTC. And it could probably be even more bullish for altcoins. A Word Of Warning I don’t think extremely big changes will happen very quickly, although I am certainly not going to be surprised if they do. We could see several more companies announce BTC strategies before 2025, and even one or two S&P 500 companies. We could see more inflows in the spot ETFs and also more activity on Bitcoin and Bitcoin L2 ecosystems. We could see the U.S. government effectively pivoting to become a hub for crypto innovation. My warning is to not get carried away with any of this. I think it is easy to forget that there is an entire world that is uninterested in BTC. Many Bitcoin bulls were clamoring at the huge inflows of the spot ETFs signaling widespread enthusiasm for BTC as an asset. I wrote about a major reality check on this perspective. I estimate that much of the inflows are traders who are doing pairs trades and basis trades against Bitcoin ETFs, which are marginable securities. These positions should obviously not be taken as a long term bullish stance on the future of BTC. With the release of the 13F filings in May, we can finally get a global view of the institutional investors which have taken positions in the BTC through the ETFs during the first quarter of the ETFs’ existence. There were some standouts, like the State of Wisconsin pension fund . Even though there is certainly a large and impressive lineup of institutional longs, it’s good to remember that 13F’s don’t show shorts or a detailed lineup of derivatives positions. In the reality check, I talk about capturing the basis of the /BTC futures contracts. A trader could easily have locked in 16% annualized gains on a totally risk free position. These things are not covered by 13F filings (though we could probably assume that pension funds are not doing basis trades). The Bottom Line I am still buying BTC, and nothing else, hand over fist. The long term future is very bright, in my view. I did not discuss the macroeconomics picture or the thriving landscape of Bitcoin L2 and meta protocol development. These I have covered in the past, such as in this article from February . The point right now is that the game theory is playing out right in front of us. There are layers of the Nash equilibria which all point to further adoption. I think the opportunity and upside is immense.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696700-bitcoin-prisoner-dilemmas-another-pubco-adopts-microstrategy-playbook?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28720683.jpeg

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap experienced a surge that nearly reached its all-time high, only to be met with a sharp reversal, leaving long traders licking their wounds. Related Reading: Can DEX Boom Save Cardano? ADA Seeks Recovery As Trading Activity Surges Bulls Take A Hit, But Sentiment Remains Positive The past few days have seen a significant decline in Ethereum’s price, dropping from $3,880 to around $3,735. This has resulted in substantial liquidations for long traders, exceeding $55 million in the last three days compared to only $16 million for short positions. Despite the dip, technical indicators paint a bullish picture. The price remains above the short moving average, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits comfortably above 60, suggesting a strong underlying trend. The funding rate, which reflects the cost of borrowing and lending cryptocurrency, provides further evidence of bullish sentiment. It has remained positive, currently at 0.014%, suggesting that buyers are still dominant and expect the price to rise further. Open Interest Soars, Signaling Sustained Investor Interest While the price has dipped, investor interest in Ethereum remains robust. Open Interest, which reflects the total amount of outstanding futures contracts, reached a peak of $17 billion on May 28th, the highest level in over a year. This indicates that despite the recent volatility, investors are still heavily engaged with Ethereum and believe in its long-term potential. Ethereum Price Forecast Meanwhile, Ethereum’s current price prediction of $3,940 by June 30th suggests a potential 2% increase. While the technical indicators remain neutral, the high Fear & Greed Index of 73 indicates a prevailing sense of greed among investors. This could fuel further price movement in the short term. Looking at the recent performance, Ethereum has experienced a moderate amount of volatility with 57% green days over the past month. This suggests a potential for continued upward momentum, especially considering the significant price increase since the cycle low of $897. However, it’s important to remember that the market is dynamic, and corrections can occur even in bullish environments.

Crypto punters are giving Donald Trump a 17% chance of going to jail before the U.S. presidential election in November, odds on predictions application Polymarket show.  Trump was found guilty on Thursday by a New York jury on all 34 counts. He was accused of falsifying business records, becoming the first former president to be convicted in U.S. courts. Trump pleaded not guilty and said he will ""keep fighting until the end,"" according to the BBC.  Data shows that a market for “Trump in jail before election day?” saw increased buying and selling activity on Friday. The market was created in January and has racked up $900,000 in bets from crypto users.

28717445,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610782,1717151407,"Toncoin (TON) Forms Double Top Pattern, Bearish Or Bullish?","Toncoin serves as the native token of the TON ecosystem and has multiple use cases. The token like other native tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) has been doing well, as it experienced a notable price rise, especially with the launch of Notcoin (NOT) recently. Based on TON’s past price movements, the token has successfully formed a Double-Top chart pattern, which is typically followed by a price decline. With a 10% decrease in the past day’s trading volume to $152 million the price of TON is indicating a bearish trend. In the last 24 hours, TON was around -0.39% down with a market capitalization of about $15,52 billion and the price was trading around $6.44. TON, at the moment, is trading above the 1-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), but in the 4-hour time frame, it is trading below the range. Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Downtrend For TON From the 4-hour time frame, the price of TON is trading below the 100-day simple moving average, which is a clear sign that it might be poised for a bearish movement. The 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also signals that TON might move bearishly as the MACD histograms are already trending below the MACD zero line. In addition, both the MACD signal line and the MACD line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line of which there is a possibility they might move below it. On the 1-day time frame, it can also be observed that the price TON is showing signs of going bearish as it is attempting to move toward the 100-day SMA. Given that the MACD histograms are trending below the MACD zero line, the 1-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests a possible bearish trend ahead. Both the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed and are moving towards the direction of the zero line, as seen in the 4-hour timeframe. Crucial Points To Determine Next Move From TON’s previous price action, it can be observed that it has managed to create some highs and lows, which are key points in determining its next destination. Currently, there is one major resistance level of $7.677 and two major support levels of $4.688 and $3.34. If the price TON continues to move downward and breaks below the support level at the $4.688 mark, it might move even further to test the $3.34 support level. However, if it fails to break below the $4.688 level, it will continue in its upward trend toward the $7.677 resistance level. Should the price break above this resistance level, it might move even further to create a new high.

28713323,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610754,1717143655,Can DEX Boom Save Cardano? ADA Seeks Recovery As Trading Activity Surges,"Cardano (ADA), the smart contract platform, has been facing a rough patch recently. While the broader DeFi sector has seen an uptick in DEX volumes, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has plummeted, raising concerns about the health of its ecosystem. Related Reading: Political Memecoin Mania: Super Trump Token Explodes With 200% Surge DeFi Activity And NFT Market Slump Despite the surge in DEX volumes across the crypto landscape, Cardano’s TVL has witnessed a significant decline, dropping from $430 million to $230 million, according to data from Artemis, a leading blockchain data provider. This suggests a lack of interest in dApps built on the Cardano network, potentially hindering its long-term growth prospects. The NFT space on Cardano has also taken a hit. Popular NFT collections have seen a dramatic decrease in floor price and overall trading volume over the past month. This waning interest in Cardano NFTs could further dampen investor sentiment and negatively impact the price of ADA. Cardano: Technical Indicators Flash Warning Signs The technical outlook for ADA is currently bearish. The price has been trending downwards over the past few weeks, forming multiple lower lows and lower highs. Additionally, key technical indicators like the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) are pointing towards declining bullish momentum and money flow into ADA. Beyond the immediate price and DeFi woes, other factors raise concerns about Cardano’s future. The velocity of ADA, indicating the frequency of token exchange, has fallen significantly, suggesting decreased trading activity. Additionally, the MVRV ratio, a measure of profitability for token holders, has also dropped, implying that most ADA addresses are currently underwater. Cardano Price Forecast While Cardano remains a prominent player in the blockchain space, the recent developments highlight the challenges it faces. The combination of declining price, waning DeFi and NFT activity, and negative on-chain metrics suggests a potential for further downside in the short term. Cardano is expected to experience a modest increase in price, reaching $0.47 by June 30, 2024, indicating a predicted rise of nearly 5%. However, it’s important to consider various technical indicators and market sentiment to assess the potential movement of the asset. Related Reading: Are Whales Sniffing Out A Deal? Ethereum Holdings Balloon To 30% – Details The crypto’s bearish sentiment may be influenced by factors such as market trends, news events, or technical analysis patterns. Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 73, indicating a state of Greed among market participants. This suggests that investors may be more inclined to take risks or engage in speculative behavior, which could potentially impact Cardano’s price movement. It’s noteworthy that ADA has experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. Its highest price of $3.10 was reached on September 2, 2021, marking its all-time high, while its lowest price of $0.017 was recorded on October 1, 2017, representing its all-time low. These historical price points highlight the volatility and potential for significant price swings within the Cardano market.

""Bond yields are very unstable as the demand is weak compared to U.S. Treasuries issuance. If there is a negative impact on bitcoin, it will likely be due to yields and the dollar index.""  Treasury yields have been rising, predominantly due to persistent U.S. debt concerns, the deluge of bond supply and the uptick in Japanese government bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has climbed 24 basis points to 4.55% in two weeks, according to data from charting platform TradingView. Several traditional market analysts say a move above 4.7% could inject volatility into stock markets.  Other things being equal, elevated yields translate into higher borrowing costs for individuals and companies and dent the appeal of investing in relatively risky assets like bitcoin and technology stocks. Chang said he expects yields to remain volatile in June, ensuring a close correlation between bitcoin and stocks.  The two-year Treasury yield is already approaching 5%. The ability to lock in returns of 5% in government bonds, which are seen as safe investments, might persuade macro traders to rotate money out of stocks, cryptocurrencies and other, riskier corners of the financial market.  ""We're now at a level of bond yields where rising yields from here are really going to weigh on all asset classes,"" Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs said Thursday on Bloomberg Surveillance.  As such, traders will closely watch the personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for guidance on the direction of Federal Reserve interest rates. The data, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, is scheduled for release on Friday at 8:30 EST (12:30 UTC).  The overall PCE Price Index is forecast to have risen 2.7% on an annual basis in April, the same as in March, according to FactSet's consensus estimates. Forecasts see a 0.3% month-over-month increase, following March's 0.32% uptick. The consensus for the core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices, is a 2.8% rise in the annual rate and 0.3% month-on-month.  ""The most important main event of the day is PCE. The data the Fed loves. The 2% inflation target they talk about is PCE, not CPI. If the data beats expectations, people will not buy risk assets,"" Chang said.  A bigger-than-expected jump in the core figure would weaken the case for renewed interest-rate cuts, leading to a further hardening of bond yields. At press time, the Fed funds futures showed investors pricing just 35 basis points of rate cuts this year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/31/bitcoin-is-still-strong-but-macro-factors-pose-risk-crypto-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6120711d9f3cf9ebb6cec3d64c5328281d16845c-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28711272,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610751,1717139713,Bitcoin Whale Indicator Flashes Signal Last Seen Before 480% Surge In Mid-2020,"CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju today pointed out significant similarities in Bitcoin’s market behavior between the current state and mid-2020, a period marked by stagnant prices but high on-chain activity. Young-Ju’s insights were illustrated with two key charts and shared via a post on X, drawing parallels that suggest a robust undercurrent of large volume transactions, potentially outside the public exchange networks. The first chart, representing data up until 2020, shows Bitcoin’s price alongside the realized cap for new whales – a metric that tracks the aggregate value at which the newly acquired Bitcoin by large investors was last moved. It’s a different form of market capitalization that assesses each UTXO at the price it last changed hands, rather than its present market price. This metric reflects the actual realized value of all the coins in the network, rather than their current market value. Related Reading: Eye On $91,500: Key Bitcoin Level Could Trigger Massive Surge, Analyst Warns This value experienced a sharp increase around mid-2020, precisely when Bitcoin’s price was caught in boredom just like in recent months, consistently trading around the $10,000 mark. According to Young-Ju, this period was characterized by high on-chain activity which later analysis suggested involved over-the-counter (OTC) transactions among institutional players. In the second chart, extending to 2024, a similar pattern emerges with even more pronounced growth in the realized cap for new whales, despite Bitcoin’s price showing a sideways movement for almost 100 days now. The chart indicates a significant addition of about $1 billion daily into new whale wallets, a term typically referring to addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin, often linked with institutional or highly capitalized individual investors. What This Means For Bitcoin Price Ki Young-Ju elaborated on these observations: “Same vibe on Bitcoin as mid-2020. Back then, BTC hovered around $10k for 6 months with high on-chain activity, later revealed as OTC deals. Now, despite low price volatility, on-chain activity remains high, with $1B added daily to new whale wallets, likely custody.” Related Reading: Lost And Found: Hackers Successfully Access Decade-Old Bitcoin Wallet, Retrieve $3 Million He further referenced a tweet from September 2020 that corroborated his analysis, noting that the “number of BTC transferred hits the year-high, and those TXs are not from exchanges. Fund Flow Ratio of all exchanges hits the year-low. Something’s happening. Possibly OTC deals.” This comparison and the sustained high level of the realized cap for new whales suggest an ongoing accumulation phase among large-scale investors, reminiscent of the activity observed in mid-2020. Such movements are generally not visible on traditional crypto exchanges and indicate a strong institutional interest that could be a precursor to significant market moves. Following Young-Ju’s tweet, BTC price rallied by 480% from September 2020 till November 2021. If a similar move is brewing for Bitcoin price remains to be seen, but the continuous growth in Bitcoin holdings among new whales, along with sustained price levels, points to a potential buildup of pressure beneath the apparent calm of the market surface. As observed in the past, such conditions may lead to substantial price movements once the accumulated Bitcoin begins to impact the broader market through either increased liquidity or renewed trading interest. At press time, BTC traded at $68,271.

42408118,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9pIm,1717138664,"As Random Celebs Like Caitlyn Jenner Embrace Solana Meme Coins, Early Hoarders Fare Best","Niche celebrities have recently launched tokens in the crypto market using the Pump Fun application on Solana.  Early buyers of these celebrity-backed tokens have made significant profits, with some tokens netting six-figure profits in a short time.  The ease of launching tokens and the subsequent profits have sparked criticism and concern within the crypto community, with some describing it as a ""net negative"" for the industry.  It looks like froth season yet again in crypto markets as niche celebrities latch on to the instant meme coin creation hype.  American media personality Caitlyn Jenner and rappers Iggy Azalea, Trippie Redd, and Davido have all launched tokens in the past week. They used the Pump Fun application, which recently caught fire on Solana by enabling anyone to easily issue a coin attached to an image.  But the profits haven’t been widespread. Blockchain data suggests that early groups of traders were quick to accumulate most of the supply of these tokens before the celebrities promoted them on their X profiles – earning, in some cases, quick six-figure profits.  For instance, Solana blockchain data shows a single address bought over 70% of Redd’s BANDO token shortly after it went live early Thursday. The tokens were then dispersed to 190 other wallet addresses, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said on X.  Nigerian record producer Davido’s DAVIDO token netted early buyers a profit of nearly $470,000 worth of Solana’s SOl tokens in just 11 hours, on-chain firm Lookonchain flagged, from just over $1,000 in initial capital. This analysis was done by tracking the deployer of the original token, counting how many tokens they acquired after issuance and the sales in the hours afterward.  ZachXBT flagged that Davido had previously launched and promoted “multiple scams in the past” such as RapDoge, Echoke and Racksterli, an investment ponzi scheme. DEXTools data shows prices of these tokens dropped more than 99% in the days following their online promotion.  “Their sole interest is to extract $$$ for minimal effort,” ZachXBT said in an X post. “A random meme coin shill out of nowhere does the space no good + does not prove they have a genuine interest.”  Davido’s X profile did not return a comment requesting clarity on these allegations as of Friday morning.  Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER apparently made early traders $2 million in profits, data tracking firm Bubblemaps said in an X post. Bubblemaps said 20% of the supply at issuance hours had been bought by a small bunch of wallets before Azalea posted about the token’s existence on X. The token is down 70% since Wednesday.  Easy issuance, easy money  All of these celebrity-promoted tokens were launched on Solana token generator Pump Fun. These tokens are automatically listed on the decentralized exchange Raydium after a certain trading volume is met.  DEXTools data shows most of these tokens ran to market capitalizations of as much as $25 million in the hours after issuance, racking up tens of millions in trading volumes. However, all of them have been down more than 50% since highs – a sign of selling pressure amid the hype.  The first of these celebrity tokens was Jenner’s JENNER meme token on Monday, which sowed confusion among market observers as its legitimacy was questioned due to past celebrity X account compromises.  Jenner’s X profile has continued to promote the token, although CoinDesk has not received confirmation of her involvement in the token despite multiple messages to her official media inquiry department.  While issuing tokens is not a harmful activity by itself, crypto market participants are criticizing how these celebrities have seemingly emerged out of the woodwork in an easy environment, making quick money from unsuspecting followers. Some have described this as a “net negative” for the industry.  Memes are hard work  Meanwhile, some meme coin developers told CoinDesk in Telegram interviews that while creating meme tokens may seem like a fun activity from the outside, they often require substantial effort to become long-term projects that win community trust.  “Successful meme coins take a lot of effort: it takes time for the culture, community, and more to develop,” Floki core team member B told CoinDesk. “Even more so if you’re focusing on fundamentals instead of just quick hype, like we try to do at Floki.”  “Many of these celebs are just banking on the hype with a pump and dump cash grab and extract as much liquidity as possible from their followers,” B added.  However, B opined there’s a way to issue personal branded meme tokens and do it right.  “Celebrities coming into crypto and participating in the ecosystem is definitely a good thing if done right. If they are really keen on launching tokens, however, they can launch social tokens around their brand and products and add value to the token for holders instead of the current trend where they launch a meme coin and allocate a portion of the supply to themselves only to proceed to dump it on unsuspecting followers almost immediately.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/31/as-random-celebs-like-caitlyn-jenner-embrace-solana-meme-coins-early-hoarders-fare-best,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cec511dc7142e3298608f2bdaa37966a00165c7-1262x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bears were able to push the price below the key support at $0.5220. Finally, the price tested the $0.5120 support zone. A low was formed at $0.5126 and the price is now attempting a fresh recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.5165 level.

With a surge of over 30% within the past 24 hours, Notcoin has secured the 82nd spot among the largest 100 cryptocurrencies, boasting a market capitalization of $1.25 billion. Notcoin Attracts Millions With Tap-To-Earn Gameplay Launched in 2023 by Open Builders, a team focused on developing social games, Notcoin gained popularity shortly after its release. The game’s gameplay, combined with the strategic use of Telegram’s vast user base, attracted millions of users. Players engage in a Telegram-based Tap-to-Earn game, accumulating Notcoins by tapping on virtual coins. Completing quests, participating in leaderboards, and utilizing boosts enhance the earning potential, making Notcoin an accessible entry point for blockchain gaming newcomers. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Top Altcoins To Make A 10x Return In 90 Days Notcoin exemplifies a notable GameFi project, drawing over 35 million users through its engaging gameplay and viral growth. The game promotes social interaction by allowing players to form squads, invite friends, and engage in community-driven activities. With a total supply of 102.7 billion NOT tokens, Notcoin’s allocation strategy prioritizes the community’s involvement. Approximately 78% of tokens, accounting for around 80.2 billion, are allocated to early miners and voucher holders, ensuring a significant portion remains with the community. The remaining 22% is reserved for new users, traders, and future development phases, fostering a decentralized and community-driven ecosystem. NOT Surges To New All-Time High Notcoin experienced a decline in value down to $0.0045 on May 23 after a successful airdrop and listing on major exchanges like Binance. However, the token has since surged to $0.012 within the past 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high. One of the key drivers behind this surge is the increase in on-chain holders, surpassing competitors such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Notcoin boasts over 1.6 million holders, surpassing SHIB’s count of 1.4 million. According to CoinGecko data, Notcoin has also witnessed a substantial increase in trading volume, with a 45% surge compared to the previous day, reaching $1.4 billion traded within 24 hours. Notably, it has become the 7th most traded asset on Binance, surpassing Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. The introduction of passive earning missions in the Telegram Game has contributed to Notcoin’s recent surge in price, trading volume, and almost doubling of its market cap within a week.

The analyst also outlined factors that he believes could drive Cardano’s price to such heights. Cardano Could Rise To $38 At Some Point In a recent video on the Cheeky Crypto YouTube channel, Nick mentioned that Cardano could rise to $38 at some point in the future, although he admitted that it won’t be anytime soon. He highlighted Cardano’s technological advancements as one factor that could drive the crypto token to such heights. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Explodes 85% Amid 15% Price Jump, Why This Is Important The crypto analyst further claimed that, despite criticisms about Cardano, the network is well-positioned to become one of the leading chains because it boasts a technology built with the future in mind. As such, he believes that ADA has a good chance to stand the test of time and rise to $38 no matter how long it takes to attain such a price target. Interestingly, crypto expert Jason Appleton believes that Cardano could come close to this price target of $38 in this bull run. He once predicted that the crypto token would reach $32 in this market cycle. He claimed this price level is attainable in the “most prime of conditions by the peak of this bull market cycle.” Meanwhile, Nick highlighted the range between $5 and $12 as his “conservative” price targets for Cardano. He believes that the crypto token could rally to such heights soon enough, considering that altcoins are well primed for significant gains, especially given the run that Bitcoin and, more recently, Ethereum have had. He added that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger these moves for Cardano and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Nick is also optimistic that Cardano will soon have its own ETF following the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. The launch of a Cardano ETF is another factor he believes could trigger such rallies for the crypto token. Patience Remains The Name Of The Game Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, suggested in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that patience is key as ADA holders await a significant rally from the crypto token. He reassured investors that Cardano would still have its bull run in this market cycle. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Shows Unusually High Strength Against Dogecoin The analyst noted that Cardano was in a similar situation in the last cycle when it was down 90% from its all-time high (ATH). However, things turned around in the twinkle of an eye with the crypto token going on to enjoy a 3,000% price gain, rising from $0.10 to $3. He believes that Cardano could make such a run or even better in this cycle, noting that Cardano is more “secure, decentralized, and scalable,” this time around.

42408107,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9oli,1717114801,"Meet Mike Novogratz, the Political Commentator","AUSTIN, Texas – You might think, given Mike Novogratz’s penchant for wrestling, that he’d pick a team when it comes to politics and take his opponents to the mat. After all, we’re talking about the guy who once got a tattoo of doomed-to-fail stablecoin project Terra/LUNA – he doesn’t mind taking sides. But instead, Novogratz describes himself as a “radical centrist.”  “I am broadly a center-left Democrat … but I've donated to Republican candidates,” Novogratz said Thursday on the Main Stage at Consensus 2024. In other words, if Novogratz has a team, it’s crypto, making the Galaxy Digital CEO a kind of “single issue” voter.  Read more: RFK Jr. Says Guilty Verdict May Help Trump's Election Prospects  There are many voters in the U.S. who are increasingly concerned about how the asset class has become a political wedge issue. So many so that it appears that the laser-eyed focus of bag holders, perpetual industry lobbying and recent endorsement by former President Donald Trump have helped soften many Democratic officeholders’ stance on crypto.  “There's been a seismic shift in the political landscape in the last two weeks.” Novogratz said. “I've been in D.C. trying to tell people this is a bipartisan issue,” but over the years the Democrats seem to have lost the plot. Or as Novogratz said by way of comparison, “the Democratic party was the party that doesn't like dogs.”  Indeed, the legislative and regulatory advancements of recent weeks – including the House and Senate vote to repeal the maligned accounting bulletin SAB121, the House passing a crypto bill, major progress for ETH ETFs and President Joe Biden’s reported outreach to crypto firms looking for guidance on saner policy – happened bing-bang-boom.  “I don't know what happened,” Novogratz said. “It certainly feels like someone from the White House called Mr. Gensler [SEC Chairman] and said, ‘You got to change your stance,’” Novogratz said. Likewise, “Elizabeth Warren had a huge sway over presidential politics,” but unfortunately for the Massachusetts Senator she got into “hot water with this giant group of crypto voters in a very tight election year.”  However, Novogratz did note that the Democratic Party is not a monolith, and that many have been calling for positive regulation and consumer protections, including New York Representative Ritchie Torres and Democratic Leader of the House Hakeem Jeffries, who “got it.”  Echoing Rep. Tom Emmer (R–MN.), who said yesterday that while Congress appears increasingly willing to pass crypto legislation the Senate remains a potential roadblock, Novogratz said that the most important politician in office right now is Debbie Stabenow (D–MI), who chairs the agriculture committee and serves on the finance and budget committees, who may determine when votes are held.  Part of what is driving these recent political changes is the sheer amount of money entering campaigns and all but ensuring crypto becomes an election issue. Novogratz estimated that upwards of $150 million has already been directed to crypto-focused Super PACs, which have become “de facto” Republican.  See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)  The wonderful thing about any decentralized movement is it takes an army"" to take on,” Novogratz said, highlighting the number of high profile people like Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong “constantly pushing” for reforms. “There are tons of people who run companies and have vested interests” that have moved the needle. “I like to think Galaxy is part of that, but by no means can we take a lot of credit.”  Practical changes?  So, assuming a re-empowered crypto industry becomes a bone fide political force, what can the world expect to happen?  Well, assuming Biden reneges on his decision to veto Congress’ decision to repeal the Security and Exchange Commission’s SAB121 accounting rule, that would mean a number of TradFi custodians like State Street and the Bank of New York could start custodying crypto. And they will, Novogratz said.  “You will see a stampede of firms like Citi and Jeffries entering into this space. I'm hoping in some ways it’s delayed a little so guys like us can build our muscles stronger,” he added. Though baby boomers, which Novogratz called the wealthiest age group in the history of the planet with $45 trillion in assets, may not be immediately convinced on the merits of crypto. “That’s a 10-year conversation.”  But because the “government can’t stop spending money on the left and on the right,” the narrative of crypto will continue to take hold. “Donald Trump and Joe Biden normalized … profligate fiscal policies,” he said.  Relatedly, if crypto’s political influence continues to grow it will likely be able to exert pressure to change unfavorable rules. This might be the case for ETH ETFs, which at launch will likely not be able to stake the underlying asset in the funds. He estimates that if enough people gain exposure to ETH, within 12 to 24 months of launch, “they will change the rules to allow staking.”  “You'd rather get a yield than not get yield,” he said.  Then there is the matter of the plethora of open and expected SEC lawsuits. Novogratz expects that many of these cases will be thrown out due to a confluence of factors, including the nearing end of Gensler’s term, the regulatory uncertainty around market structure (i.e. whether tokens are securities or commodities) and fears of administrative overreach.  See also: Why the SEC Shouldn't Classify ETH as a Security  “Common sense will take over,” he said. “It really does feel like the assault on crypto companies over the last three years was one of the most un-American things I've seen. It was politically motivated, in my mind, and I don't think it was good for the country. And I think most civil servants and politicians believe that, too.”  Finally, there are practical considerations for Galaxy, which is a publicly traded company in Canada that is looking to list in the U.S. Novogratz explained that the firm failed to file its paperwork while Trump was in office, and has been trying “to go public literally since the very beginning of the against Gensler-Biden SEC.”  Explaining the “long and arduous process,” which has cost the firm an estimated $25 million, feels like it is accelerating (and that it was never clear why so many firms were being “slow rolled), Novogratz gave a cautiously optimistic estimate that by early next year Galaxy might enter the U.S. as a public company.  “It's been a complete and total disadvantage not having access to the world's greatest capital markets,” he said. With any luck, the political headwinds for crypto firms have come to an end.

28697409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610731,1717113658,"Lost And Found: Hackers Successfully Access Decade-Old Bitcoin Wallet, Retrieve $3 Million","In an extraordinary turn of events, two hackers have successfully cracked the long-forgotten password of a digital wallet, leading to the recovery of approximately $2 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). Lost Bitcoin Fortune Unlocked As reported by Wired, the story began in 2013 when an individual known by the alias “Michael” securely stored his Bitcoin holdings in a password-protected digital wallet. Unfortunately, over time, he lost access to the wallet due to a corrupted file containing the 20-character password generated using the RoboForm password manager. Despite his efforts to prioritize security, Michael’s concerns about potential hacking led him to refrain from storing the password in his manager, inadvertently locking himself out of his fortune.

Enter Joe Grand, a renowned electrical engineer and hardware hacker, popularly known as “Kingpin.” In 2022, Grand gained recognition for aiding another cryptocurrency wallet owner in recovering $2 million worth of digital assets after forgetting the PIN to his Trezor wallet. Since then, numerous individuals have approached Grand seeking his expertise, but he selectively chooses his projects. Michael initially approached Grand two years ago, seeking assistance in recovering his lost Bitcoin. However, due to the unique challenges posed by a software-based wallet, Grand declined the request. Nonetheless, Michael persisted, and last June, Grand agreed to give it another shot, teaming up with a fellow hacker named Bruno from Germany. Months of reverse engineering led Grand and Bruno to a significant breakthrough. They discovered a flaw in the pseudo-random number generator used by the RoboForm program, which was employed by Michael in 2013. The flaw tied the generated passwords to the date and time on the user’s computer, making them predictable. Armed with this knowledge, the hackers devised a plan to exploit the flaw and crack the password. The major hurdle in this process was Michael’s inability to recall the exact date when the password was generated. However, armed with the knowledge that Bitcoin had been moved into the wallet for the first time on April 14, 2013, Grand and Bruno configured RoboForm to generate passwords within a specific time frame, utilizing the parameters used by Michael. From Forgotten To Found Despite initial failed attempts, Grand and Bruno persisted, adjusting the time frame and parameters until they finally struck gold. On November 15, 2023, they discovered the correct password—20 characters long and generated on May 15, 2013. The long-lost Bitcoin treasure was finally within Michael’s grasp. However, the report notes that the successful recovery of Michael’s assets raises concerns about password security, particularly for users who generated passwords using earlier versions of RoboForm. While Siber Systems, the company behind RoboForm, claims to have fixed the flaw in 2015, questions remain about the vulnerability of older passwords. Grand stresses the importance of understanding the improvements made to password generation in newer versions.

He waited for the value of Bitcoin to rise before selling a portion of his newfound fortune. With 30 BTC currently valued at $3 million, Michael eagerly anticipates the potential for even greater returns as he aims for a future surge to $100,000 per coin. As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $68,200, consolidating for the past week below the key $70,000 threshold that is crucial to BTC’s uptrend prospects.
