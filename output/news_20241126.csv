36885296,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655000,1732660256,"Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin, Says MARA CEO","In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), shared his bullish outlook on Bitcoin. He emphasized the growing institutional interest and a favorable regulatory environment that could propel the BTC price to new highs. Thiel dismissed the impact of the recent Bitcoin halving, stating, “I think the halving had zero effect.” Instead, he attributed the Bitcoin price surge to the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year. “In January, you had the ETFs that launched that drove all of a sudden the beginnings of some institutional interest,” he noted. Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin While the initial investments in these ETFs were predominantly retail, Thiel observed a shift as institutional players began entering the market. “Then you started seeing some pension funds starting to buy into ETFs and into Bitcoin-related equities like our stock or MicroStrategy‘s,” he added. The CEO highlighted the potential impact of political developments on the BTC market. “With the election, you know, Donald Trump ran on a platform that is very pro-Bitcoin—Bitcoin strategic reserve, mining in the US, etc.,” Thiel said. He suggested that such a stance could lead to a more supportive regulatory environment in the United States. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next “What that’s ended up driving is a huge belief that all of a sudden the regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto will get much better, that the US will double down and really invest in Bitcoin potentially,” he explained. This anticipated shift could pressure other nations to adopt similar policies, fostering global adoption. Thiel also pointed out the robust market dynamics absorbing selling pressure from long-term holders. “Every single Bitcoin that had been purchased was in profit, and you started long-term holders who had held Bitcoin for years beginning to liquidate a little bit to take some profits,” he said. Despite this, he emphasized the market’s resilience: “There is so much demand in the market that it just keeps soaking it up.” Addressing concerns about Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, Thiel asserted that significant drawdowns might be a thing of the past, at least in the near term. “The volatility of past years, where you would hit a peak and then see a 20% or 30% drawdown, I think are gone, at least for the near-term future,” he stated. He believes that institutional investors are poised to enter the market aggressively. “I think what we’re going to see is essentially institutions just waiting to buy up Bitcoin,” Thiel predicted. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained He cited recent actions by major corporations to support his outlook. “You look at MicroStrategy—they’re [issuing a] $3 billion bond; they’re out there buying Bitcoin very aggressively,” he said. “We raised a $1 billion bond at 0% coupon the same week as Michael Saylor did, and we went out and acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin.” Thiel emphasized that this trend is gaining momentum: “Lots of people are starting to do this now.” Concluding his insights, Thiel expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. “Anybody who’s selling is selling into a market where there’s ample demand, and I think that for the foreseeable future we’ll continue to see Bitcoin price move up—you know, up and down, up and down—but generally the trend will be upwards,” he said. Notably, Cantor Fitzgerald recently adjusted its price target for MARA from $33 to $42. The revision follows Mara Holdings’ completion of a substantial $1 billion convertible note offering last week. From the $980 million raised, Mara used $199 million to buy back $222 million in principal of its 2026 convertible notes. With $781 million in proceeds remaining, the company plans to purchase additional Bitcoin, leveraging a strategy similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR). However, unlike MicroStrategy, which focuses purely on capital market maneuvers to accumulate Bitcoin, Mara also operates the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining operation by hash rate. Analysts at Cantor highlight this as a key differentiator with bullish potential. At press time, BTC traded at $92,531.

However, the market is showing signs of a shift—a flight to quality—favoring tokens that deliver real utility over fleeting buzz. In this evolving landscape, Real-World Assets (RWA) and privacy technology are taking center stage, offering tangible value and long-term resilience. This week, we spotlight four projects that go beyond the noise, showcasing how innovation and real-world application can redefine ROI potential in the crypto space. RWA as a narrative is growing in the crypto space, as seen in the DefiLlama chart below , with a TVL of over $6.5 billion in April 2024. Here’s a closer look at AgriDex, Mantra, Zano and dVIN Labs —four tokens poised to make waves in the coming months. AgriDex: Transforming Agriculture with Blockchain If you're looking for a high-growth opportunity, AgriDex should be on your radar. Set to launch on December 4th, this Solana-based platform is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. By cutting transaction costs from an industry average of 4-6% to under 0.5%, and payment settlement from days to second the project is a frontrunner of this week.The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) offers strong fundamentals, with a launch valuation of $65 million. AgriDex anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. AgriDex DAO will be formed and collectively managed and owned by its members involved in the DAO’s token distribution. The DAO will allow holders to vote and enact changes in a truly decentralised and open fashion. Mantra: Unlocking Real Estate Investment with Blockchain Innovation For retail investors seeking exposure to RWA, Mantra presents a compelling opportunity. This compliance-first blockchain platform is revolutionising the real estate sector by fractionalising ownership, thereby reducing entry barriers and democratising access to high-value properties. Mantra enables users to purchase fractional shares in premium properties, making real estate investment more accessible than ever. In 2024, the platform raised $11 million and secured a landmark partnership with UAE real estate giant MAG to tokenise $500 million worth of properties, underscoring its significant market presence. Real estate remains one of the most stable and profitable asset classes. By leveraging blockchain technology, Mantra enhances liquidity and transparency, allowing investors to trade property shares with ease. This innovation reduces traditional transaction costs and inefficiencies, potentially leading to higher returns. As of November 25, 2024, the Mantra (OM) token is priced at $3.59, reflecting a 56.03% increase over the past 24 hours and a 144.40% rise in the last seven days.

Zano: Privacy-Centric Layer-1 Zano , the L1 blockchain for confidential assets and private dApps was founded by Andrey Sabelnikov , the developer behind CryptoNote - a privacy coin protocol used by Monero and hundreds of other projects. Security and privacy have always been major concerns, especially with the increasing number of central banks exploring central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) survey, 94% of the 86 participating banks said they were looking at a digital version of their national currencies. That's up from 90% of 81 respondents in a 2021 survey conducted by the BIS, an umbrella organisation for the world's central banks. In response to rising concerns over the erosion of financial privacy, privacy coins have emerged as a potential solution. At the heart of the ecosystem is the Zano token ($ZANO), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that powers secure and untraceable transactions. The token is uniquely positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for privacy solutions in both the Web3 and traditional finance sectors. Key Features of $ZANO • Privacy by Design: Leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, $ZANO ensures all transactions remain confidential, protecting users' financial information from external scrutiny.• Utility Beyond Transactions: $ZANO is integral to the network, serving as the primary medium for transaction fees, staking rewards, and ecosystem services, including privacy-preserving dApps and DeFi platforms.• Cross-Platform Compatibility: Zano enables seamless integration with privacy-centric wallets and applications, ensuring a user-friendly experience. As of November 25, 2024, Zano (ZANO) is trading at approximately $7.74 USD. At the beginning of the year , on January 1, 2024, ZANO was priced at around $1.50 USD. This indicates that ZANO has experienced a significant increase of approximately 416% year-to-date. Notably, ZANO reached its all-time high of $8.10 USD on November 6, 2024.This substantial growth reflects the increasing interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and the expanding adoption of Zano's platform. dVIN Labs: Revolutionizing the Wine Industry through Blockchain For retail investors seeking exposure to RWA, dVIN Labs offers a unique opportunity by integrating blockchain technology into the $1 trillion wine industry. By tokenizing luxury wines, dVIN Labs enhances transparency, traceability, and engagement within the wine market. dVIN Labs has developed the dVIN protocol, built on the Solana blockchain, to tokenize individual bottles of wine. Each bottle is represented by a Digital Cork™ NFT, ensuring authenticity and provenance. When a bottle is opened, Tasting Token™ NFTs are minted, creating a virtual tasting journal and enabling winemakers to engage directly with consumers. The tokenization of luxury wines opens new avenues for investment, allowing for fractional ownership and trading of high-value assets. This approach not only democratizes access to fine wines but also introduces liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market, potentially leading to significant returns for investors. In September 2024, dVIN Labs launched its native token, VINCOIN ($VIN), during Solana Breakpoint in Singapore. The launch included an airdrop of 3,000 bottles of tokenized champagne, valued at $1 million, to event attendees. Additionally, a limited-edition NFT representing a bottle of champagne was airdropped to each Mad Lad holder, featuring their PFP on the label.

This huge growth is fueled by meme coin activity and increasing adoption. As the solana price rises and presale tokens gain attention, now is the time to watch the market closely.

SOL’s DEX Volume Breaks $100 Billion in NovemberSolana crypto recorded $109.8 billion in DEX transaction volume in November , according to DefiLlama. This is over double the $52.5 billion transacted in October. The data shows what is Solana: a blockchain that’s fast, scalable, and efficient.Meme coin activity played a key role in this growth. Solana platforms like Raydium and Pump.fun generated $71.5 million and $182 million in fees in November. In addition, Solana handles $53 million in daily transactions. This is far more than many other blockchains, which process less than $5 million a day.The Solana price hit $264 recently, though it has since dropped slightly to below $240. Still, many experts are optimistic about Solana prediction reports. Even if there were bearish pressures , they believe that Solana token could see more demand due to its adoption in DeFi and growing meme coin transaction activity.Excitement about Solana news has also grown with talks of a potential ETF approval. Fund manager VanEck applied for a Solana USD ETF earlier this year. If approved, it could drive more interest in the Solana coin and attract new Solana wallet users.Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Game-Changing PresaleJust like Solana has got everyone talking, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is capturing the community’s attention with its innovative blend of blockchain technology and gaming.

36884369,https://blockworks.co/news/former-solana-foundation-employee-media-venture,1732657500,Former Solana Foundation employee starts US media company,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Allmight founder Kevin Ricoy knew he wanted to create a media company after realizing that policy and social change are downstream from culture — and culture that is funny or entertaining is most effective of all. “What affected culture more? Was it CNN or MTV News? It was MTV News,” Ricoy opined on a call this week. Ricoy is the founder of Allmight, a new media startup focused on furthering the United States’ leadership in crypto. The initiative caught a nice boost from the recent US presidential election and a growing sense that a friendlier regulatory environment could drive crypto business back to the world’s biggest economy. Allmight’s first product is “This Week in Crypto,” a late night talk-style show that summarizes crypto news with a punchy, irreverent bent. A couple of these videos have garnered hundreds of thousands of views on X. He plans to expand Allmight’s content offerings, creating what he calls next-gen Americana — “low noise, high signal, and actually entertaining.” When I asked if Ricoy wants to become a sort of crypto version of Jon Stewart, he responded: “I would love that.” On top of monetizing content with ads and sponsorships, Allmight plans to host events and help in job placement for US-based candidates. It also hopes to boost awareness of policymakers’ efforts to legislate on crypto. Further down the road, it might even explore something like crowdfunded investment, Ricoy said. This was all in the works in the lead up to the US presidential election, but in the aftermath of a Trump win and presumably more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Ricoy said he’s seen a “500% increase in interest and optimism” surrounding his project. With crypto prices at record highs and crypto’s fear of US regulators seeming to abate, America’s crypto scene seems to be having a moment. “I’m in the right place at the right time, and it’s pretty cool,” Ricoy said. Years ago, Ricoy was running a construction labor company when he decided to found a crypto app. With the help of some developers, he launched an app to promote SoundCloud music with Kin, the cryptocurrency debuted by the messaging app Kik during crypto’s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom. Kik liked the app and extended Ricoy an offer to become its head of communications. Kin would spark a knock-down-drag-out fight with the SEC, and Kik messenger eventually shut down amid the legal battle. After some time working for Kin’s foundation, Ricoy joined the Solana Foundation as community relations manager, where he drove the launch of Solana’s community grants program. After a little over a year, Ricoy resigned to pursue Allmight. Allmight received a grant from the Solana Foundation, but Ricoy said he was clear that his mandate is to grow crypto outside of just Solana, and the foundation was supportive. I asked later in a text how Ricoy plans to grow a blockchain-agnostic crypto community in the US given all the sectarian fighting that seems to happen constantly between crypto ecosystems. Ricoy said a rising tide can lift all boats, and noted how the Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs have worked together on policy in Washington, DC. “[W]ho knows, maybe efforts like these can even help bridge communities and put a dent in the tribalism overall,” Ricoy wrote.

To read full editions, subscribe . The conditions Charles Schwab is waiting for before jumping headfirst into crypto could take shape soon, potentially bringing another big fish into the mix in a more substantial way. The company currently allows investors to trade spot bitcoin and ether ETFs on its platform, as well as crypto futures contracts and options on certain BTC funds. “We also would like to directly offer crypto and Schwabize the crypto market, which is to take a lot of the spread and the commissions out of the crypto area to create a better deal for clients,” incoming Schwab CEO Rick Wurster said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. He added: “We’ve been waiting on a change in the regulatory environment in order to do that and we’re confident…that will come in short order.” A Schwab spokesperson essentially echoed his sentiment to me in a Tuesday email, noting Schwab “plans to offer spot crypto trading” once the expected regulatory shifts occur. “We understand many of Schwab’s clients are interested and engaged in cryptocurrencies, particularly with certain segments of the market, and we are monitoring this space and the regulatory environment closely,” the rep explained. Charles Schwab’s asset management division launched an ETF that holds crypto-related stocks in 2022. But they were notably absent when a bevy of issuers (including mega competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton) brought to market US spot BTC funds in January. A Schwab spokesperson told me that month the firm “continues to learn and hear from investors as to their investment needs and considerations for investing in bitcoin ETFs.” And it seems it has learned something. After all, the US BTC fund category’s net inflows surpassed $30 billion last week (in less than 11 months on the market). Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research, said she expects Schwab’s pending deeper dive into the crypto space to be in the form of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. “The space is already crowded, and the iShares product has surged ahead,” she told me. “It won’t be easy for a new product, even with a powerful brand name, to compete with the leading products in the market.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

36882782,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654942,1732654838,What The 50-Day Moving Average At $0.22 Says About The Dogecoin Price,"The Dogecoin price has been gearing up for a major bull rally since it rose to the $0.4 threshold and began testing this resistance. Shedding light on Dogecoin’s future bullish trajectory, a crypto analyst has discussed the importance of the $0.22 50-day Moving Average (MA) in determining the Dogecoin price movements in this bull cycle. How The 50-Day MA Impacts The Dogecoin Price Rally The 50-day MA is a technical indicator that highlights a cryptocurrency’s average price over the last 50 trading days. It is primarily used to identify price trends, determine resistance and support levels, and generate buy and sell signals. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Remain Greedy Amid Price Break Toward $100,000, Why This Is Good Kevin, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has underscored the significance of this critical technical indicator in the recent Dogecoin price movements and its influence on the meme coin’s future bull rally. The analyst disclosed that historically, during Dogecoin’s previous bull markets, its price consistently stayed above the 50-day MA, never losing this crucial threshold despite testing it multiple times. Typically, staying above the 50-day MA is seen as a bullish indicator, while consistently dropping below this average suggests a downtrend. Presenting a detailed chart of Dogecoin’s price action in the last bull cycle in late 2020 to date, Kevin disclosed that the current 50-day MA for the meme coin is at $0.22. However, this price threshold is rising quickly as Dogecoin closes each daily candle. Additionally, the rapid increase suggests that if Dogecoin can remain steady around or above the 50-day MA, its price should see a significant bullish trend continuation, providing a strong foundation for even higher prices. Dogecoin Enters Distribution Phase, $9.5 Target In Sight In a different X post, Trader Tardigrade, a prominent crypto market expert, declared that Dogecoin has officially entered the Distribution phase in the classic Power of Three (PO3) market cycle. The PO3 cycle is a popular concept in technical analysis used to identify key market phases — Accumulation, Distribution, and Manipulation. Related Reading: Over $500 Million Wiped Out From The Market As Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Heavily With Dogecoin now firmly in the Distribution phase, large holders may be offloading their assets, potentially locking in profits following DOGE’s recent price increase. While the distribution phase could be seen as the end of a bull rally characterized by sell-offs and slow momentum, Trader Tardigrade believes that this phase could be calm before a massive price surge. The analyst shared two price charts comparing Dogecoin’s movements during the bull cycle between 2016 and 2017 and its future price action in 2024 and 2025. In the 2017 bull market, Dogecoin entered a distribution phase, which led to a significant bull rally to new levels above $0.00066. If this trend holds true for Dogecoin’s current distribution phase, Trader Tardigrade has predicted that its price could surge as high as $9.5 from its current value of $0.4.

36883493,https://blockworks.co/news/uk-fca-crypto-regulation-approach,1732654800,What the UK’s FCA is focused on while drawing up its crypto regime,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . New research by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) shows 93% of UK adults have heard of crypto assets. About 12% of those surveyed own them — representing about 7 million people. These findings point to “the need for clear regulation that supports a safe, competitive and sustainable crypto sector,” said Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets. Sounds like a good time for an update on the FCA’s approach. We received just that on Tuesday, as Long detailed some of the takeaways from the UK regulator’s chats this year with crypto companies, law firms, government officials and other regulators in the country. Even the US SEC gave its two cents. A few interesting bits from Long’s report: Participants liked the idea of an industry-led disclosures regime proportionate and tailored to different business models (i.e. institutional and retail). While some want disclosure rules similar to those in TradFi, others raised concerns about applying this approach to crypto. There were discussions around “best execution” criteria for client orders (beyond price, important factors include custody arrangements and asset safety). Participants believe exchanges issuing their own tokens or operating brokerage and market-making services pose conflict-of-interest risk. An FCA roadmap shows a go-live date for the regime sometime in 2026, with some other steps along the way. In the meantime, the FCA said it’s working on a market-abuse information sharing platform (to address stated challenges posed by data privacy laws across jurisdictions, for example). These details came after UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq said last week to expect legislation on stablecoins and staking services soon. So there will be plenty more to monitor in the UK as it seeks to catch up to the EU . And the US too is expected to make regulatory moves next year under a more crypto-friendly president and Congress. Stay tuned.

The rise in cryptocurrency investment in recent years came with a pronounced uptick in debt — most notably mortgages — sought in the areas where digital assets activity was highest, according to the research conducted by the Treasury's independent arm that sniffs out U.S. economic hazards. It was looking for evidence that such financial stretching may be a danger to U.S. stability, but so far the researchers found that delinquency rates in those places have remained low.  ""Low-income consumers in high-crypto exposure areas are disproportionately more likely to take out a mortgage, and the average mortgage size is large relative to pre-2020 average income,"" the paper concluded.  ""There is little or no evidence of higher levels of distress in mortgage, auto, or credit card debt among consumers in high-crypto exposure neighborhoods,"" according to the report. ""If anything, delinquency rates remain relatively low.""  This potentially sunny piece of federal research could further bolster the case of incoming presidential administration officials who seek to clear a path for greater U.S. crypto adoptions. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to appoint financial regulators who favor friendly regulations and lighter enforcement in the digital assets sector.  The OFR paper cautioned that these crypto households will warrant close observation in a financial downturn to see if such stresses expose them as a risk to the U.S. mortgage market. Cryptocurrencies have remained a much more volatile investment than most other asset classes.  ""An important takeaway for future monitoring is the increased debt balances and leverage among low-income households with crypto exposure,"" the report noted. ""Rising distress in this group could cause future financial stress, especially if exposure to these types of high-leverage, high-risk consumers is concentrated in systemically important institutions.""  The OFR's numbers suggested a 274% increase in mortgages in high-crypto, low-income areas between 2020 and 2024, and the average mortgage balances were much higher than low-income zones with less digital assets activity. They were even significantly higher than in middle-income areas.  ""Crypto sales may have supported access to larger mortgages through bigger down payments,"" according to the findings.  The study relied on U.S. tax data to find crypto concentrations, and because the latest available data was from 2021, the crypto sales would likely have been at the height of the market before the industry's 2022 collapse – meaning sales were more likely to result in significant gains. The investors apparently used those gains to back their other financial moves, including much higher purchase of homes and cars. But the OFR's credit data was as recent as this year.

36882682,https://blockworks.co/news/us-stocks-holiday-week-history,1732653000,US stocks head into holiday week with history on their side,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It’s a short week for our US readers with markets closed on Thursday followed by a half day of trading on Friday. Crypto markets, of course, will trade through the holiday. But let’s take a look at how US equities typically perform this time of year and what we might see in the coming days. Historically, stocks do pretty well during Thanksgiving week. Since 1928, the S&P 500 has finished higher 60% of the time following the holiday. During presidential election years, returns are even more common; the index closes higher 75% of the time, with an average return of 0.88%, according to Bank of America Global Research. The Nasdaq Composite, which debuted in 1971, has generally followed suit. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite ended Thanksgiving week 2.4% higher, building off of an already strong month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed the week ended Black Friday 2023 higher, posting gains of 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively. Equities were trending higher Tuesday while President-elect Donald Trump’s latest comments on his tariff plans rocked global currency markets. Trump plans to implement 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, plus an additional 10% fee on goods coming from China, he said in a Tuesday Truth Social post. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both fell sharply against the dollar. Midway through Tuesday’s session, the S&P 500 was up 0.3% since the start of the week while the Nasdaq Composite was virtually flat. Stocks were largely insulated from Trump’s comments — likely an indication that investors are going to hold off on making major trades until they have more information about what the Trump Administration might actually do after Inauguration Day. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trending 0.4% and 0.5% higher, respectively, over the day at 2 pm ET. If the upward trend continues, stocks should end November well into the green. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are both up close to 5% since the first of the month. Tomorrow’s economic reports should move markets, or at least expectations of an interest rate cut from the Fed come December. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 23 will drop at 8:30 am ET, followed by October’s PCE index at 10 am. Odds of a 25-basis point interest rate cut next month inched higher Tuesday, hitting 59% (compared with 52% a day ago), according to data from CME Group. There’s one and a half trading days (plus another hour in today’s session) left in the week. Here’s hoping the rally lasts.

Mr. Market had a different idea though and as families began to get together for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, a wave of selling took place. Between East Coast Wednesday morning hours and the first football game early afternoon Thursday afternoon, bitcoin plunged from roughly $19,500 to $16,200, a decline of nearly 17%. The action was quickly dubbed the Thanksgiving Day Massacre.  Exactly four years to the day later, bitcoin is seeing another swift decline after failing to surpass another milestone. There are, of course, key differences. First, this year's big number is $100,000, or five times that of four years ago. Second, the decline this time around has been more drawn out and is far less severe (so far) on percentage terms, a drop of just about 8% to $91,500 after nearly taking out $100,000 a few days ago.  The aftermath of 2020 will be encouraging to the bulls. Just four days after the plunge, bitcoin had returned to just shy of $20,000 and by mid-December had soared to a new record high above $24,000. By year-end, the price was above $30,000 on its way to the bull market peak of $65,000 in April 2021.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/bitcoins-tumble-to-91-k-evokes-thanksgiving-massacre-of-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f4fa538f847c1878483323e006f62789c7ec993-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Holders of Cardano’s ADA token removed around $175 million from exchanges since Nov. 22, in four straight days of net withdrawals, marking the steepest net outflows since September 2021, according to Coinglass data. The move points to increased confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Experts believe this trend reveals growing confidence among ADA holders as they shift assets to private wallets. When holders withdraw tokens from exchanges, it can indicate they intend to hold rather than sell. That’s because tokens stored in private wallets are less accessible for trading, which reduces the available supply. In turn, this can drive prices up due to decreased selling pressure.

Started in 2013 as one of the first investment products exposing customers to crypto, the fund has returned 131,165% after expenses and fees. As noted by founder Dan Morehead on X, the fund saw a huge surge following Donald Trump's election as U.S. president this month.  To get started in bitcoin investing, the Bitcoin Fund bought 2% of the world’s bitcoin (BTC) supply when the cryptocurrency's price was around $74. BTC has skyrocketed over 120% in this past year alone, pushing it to a new all-time high just below $100,000.  “I think we should buy aggressively now,” Morehead wrote in a letter dated July 5, 2013, that he shared publicly Tuesday. “The price is going WAY UP. It's going to squeeze up like a watermelon seed.”  Years later, bitcoin is “still squeezing up like a watermelon seed,” Morehead wrote in a memo on Tuesday.  He predicts that the cryptocurrency could reach $740,000 by April 2028, which would translate into a $15 trillion market capitalization, due to the fact that 95% of financial wealth has not yet addressed blockchain, he said.  Morehead gave credit to institutional managers like BlackRock and Fidelty, both which launched spot bitcoin and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds earlier this year, for easing access to the industry and allowing exposure to their tens of millions of clients.  He also said that blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds will now finally turn into tailwinds with the first pro-blockchain U.S. president taking office in January.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | ZRX,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/26/this-hedge-fund-now-has-a-1-000x-profit-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/652c8d138881ec63eb724678b727d4f8116edd63-3628x2718.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This marks a major turning point for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The coin rose more than 5% in a single day, reaching $3,525, and has gained 38% in the last 30 days. Analysts are buzzing, implying that ETH still has a lot of upside potential as it continues to rise. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $500 Million Liquidated As Bitcoin Slides To $92K – Report This latest breakthrough has inspired more general market confidence. ETH has risen by 10% over the past week, therefore confirming its dominance in the crypto scene.

What a move in ETHUSD This is how the price should behave when it breaks out of the descending trend channel. #crypto #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/tepsK7grmO — Logical Trader (@logicaltra6er) November 23, 2024 Bullish Technical Signals Ethereum’s technical indicators show a strong upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 70, indicating heavy buying pressure. Furthermore, ETH has broken its 30- and 200-period moving averages, strengthening its bullish trend. Titan of Crypto noted an interesting development: a weekly closure higher than the Kumo Cloud. With a probable second aim of $4,862 should momentum continue, this technical breakout projects ETH might soon test resistance levels near $4,189. #Altcoins #Ethereum Golden Cross Incoming 🚀#ETH has closed above the weekly Kumo Cloud: an important milestone. This breakout could pave the way to $4,100 next! 🎯 pic.twitter.com/q0eOVgxgnU — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) November 25, 2024 The upside would get further boosted with an upcoming Golden Cross, in which the shorter-term moving average will cross above the longer-term one. In fact, this has historically led to very strong price rallies. If such bullish signs are accompanied by sustained buying activity, ETH may approach these higher price levels in the near term. Ethereum Fundamentals Remain Solid Beyond the technical prowess, Ethereum shines still through its strong dominance in decentralized finance, or DeFi, and a myriad of blockchain applications. The network holds more than half of the total value locked into DeFi, so it is surely pertinent to the ecosystem. Furthermore, the emergence of ETH-based layer-2 solutions increases their scalability and appeal to both developers and users. Meanwhile, activity in the Ethereum derivatives market is soaring. Open interest has topped $20 billion, with traders eyeing $3,400 and $3,500 for options that expire soon. Increased transaction volumes per block are also driving up fees, lowering ETH’s circulating supply and potentially raising prices even further. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ATH Sparks $309 Price Prediction Frenzy – Details Room For growth amidst optimism While Ethereum’s price has increased by 66% in the previous year, many analysts say it remains undervalued. Predictions of a gain above $4,800 this cycle indicate the market’s belief in ETH’s future. At the same time, if pro-crypto legislation passes in the US, it could speed up the rise of crypto even more. Ethereum looks like it will go up, maybe even to new all-time highs, because its fundamentals are strong, it is becoming more popular, and its technical setup is good.

36879172,https://blockworks.co/news/dia-modular-oracle-testnet,1732647332,"DIA launches testnet for Lumina, a new modular oracle","DIA has launched the testnet for Lumina, its new modular oracle infrastructure aimed at improving transparency, scalability and integration flexibility. Designed to address common issues with existing oracles, Lumina allows for data aggregation, verification and delivery across blockchains. Its architecture is distinguished from other oracle solutions such as Chainlink and API3 , given its support for multiple messaging protocols, compatibility with non-EVM chains and comprehensive data traceability. Previously, access to oracle data’s origins and flow was often opaque, but Lumina offers full visibility into the entire process, according to Zygis Marazas, DIA’s head of product. Read more: Chainlink brings data feeds to Bitcoin L2 Spiderchain “Users can clearly see the entire data journey, from the source to the final price calculation,” Marazas told Blockworks. This approach aims to build trust in data reliability and accuracy. The testnet , which went live today, will limit participation. However, the mainnet is scheduled for release in Q1 2025 and will operate as a fully permissionless network. In addition to nodes, new chains and assets that need oracles services can plug in without direct involvement from DIA’s team. This eliminates the need for manual onboarding processes. “You can set up your own oracles if you wish, completely permissionlessly,” Marazas explained. This functionality is expected to appeal to developers working on emerging rollups and specialized blockchain ecosystems, where speed and autonomy are critical. This functionality should enable the long tail of assets to make their way into DeFi, Aiham Jaabari told Blockworks. Jaabari is the co-founder of Silo Finance, which uses DIA oracles. “Very few oracle providers provide data feeds beyond the blue chips — so that’s why we’re kind of excited about Lumina,” Jaabari said. “Technically speaking, you can actually create an oracle permissionlessly on a [layer-2] for really any token asset.” Lumina’s architecture is designed to integrate a wide variety of data sources. By aggregating data from multiple origins, including blockchain networks and external APIs, Lumina ensures broad coverage and accuracy. “You can get data from any source — offchain or onchain — from the hundreds of feeds that exist right now in the market,” said Marazas. To enhance scalability, Lumina employs an OP Stack-based rollup, called Lasernet. For data availability, Lumina uses Celestia, making its rollup an optimium — the optimistic rollup equivalent of a validium. Read more: So your layer-2 is ‘secured by Ethereum’ — what does that mean? Marazas noted the team was impressed by Celestia’s roadmap to one gigabyte blocks , and considers the scaling benefits to outweigh the minor risk introduced by adding a dependence, a view in line with the broader modular trend. While Lumina is optimized for Ethereum rollups, it is also designed to support non-EVM ecosystems such as Cosmos and Move-based chains. It uses Hyperlane as a cross-chain messaging protocol, but can work with other standards if needed. Lumina’s flexibility extends further with support for both push and pull models of data delivery, allowing users to choose the approach that best suits their needs. “Some customers prefer [a] pull-based approach, where they can get prices on demand, but there are other cases where push-based [updates] can be more efficient,” he added. Ultimately, it’s the flexibility that Silo’s Jaabari sees as a selling point. “Having control over the oracle is as important as the feed itself because there’s no one methodology that fits all assets,” he said. Jaabari is also a fan of the layer-2 strategy, calling it “the cheapest way to process the data and make it available.” Decentralization is a key part of Lumina’s roadmap. Although the testnet will initially rely on whitelisted data feeders, DIA plans to gradually open participation to anyone in 2025, introducing staking and slashing mechanisms to ensure data accuracy. “The vision of our protocol is that eventually it is going to run without the core team being involved,” said Marazas.

36877474,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654969,1732644017,Cardano Reclaims $1 As Network Growth Surges – Larger Breakout Ahead?,"Cardano (ADA) surged past the $1 mark over the weekend, marking a significant milestone in its recent rally. However, after reaching a multi-year high of $1.15, the cryptocurrency is now navigating a 17% correction as profit-taking sets in. Despite the pullback, the long-term outlook for Cardano remains bullish, fueled by renewed market momentum over the past three weeks. The price action reflects a maturing market, with ADA consolidating gains and building a foundation for its next move. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock highlights robust growth in network activity, signaling increased interest and adoption. This uptick in activity suggests that the consolidation phase could be temporary as the broader market gains strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? Cardano’s ability to maintain key support levels during this correction will be crucial in determining its next direction. Analysts are optimistic that the network’s growing fundamentals and favorable macro environment will drive ADA to new heights. As traders and investors monitor the $1 support level closely, Cardano’s evolving network metrics and bullish sentiment hint at a potential breakout shortly. Whether ADA’s price action will capitalize on these factors remains a key question for market participants. Cardano Daily Active Addresses Growing Cardano’s network activity shows strong growth signs, with daily active addresses increasing significantly. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the number of new user addresses has reached its highest since June 2023. This surge in network activity signals growing adoption and increased interest in the Cardano ecosystem, which is crucial for its long-term development. Over the weekend, Cardano reclaimed the $1 level, marking an important psychological milestone. While the price is currently consolidating, this movement comes amid a surge in network growth, indicating that market participants remain optimistic about ADA’s future. IntoTheBlock’s analysis on X suggests that Cardano could be preparing for a bullish breakout, with the potential to rise to new price levels as the current consolidation phase stabilizes. Despite the recent pullback from its multi-year high of $1.15, Cardano is still well-positioned for further growth. ADA remains more than 230% away from its all-time high (ATH), around $3.1, suggesting significant room for upside as the network matures and attracts more users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Benefits From US Buyers – Coinbase Premium Gap Reveals Strong Demand If the price maintains support above the $1 level and network growth continues to trend upwards, Cardano could be primed for its next bullish move. With the growing number of daily active addresses and a significant gap to its ATH, the potential for a strong rally remains intact. Investors are watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain this momentum and capitalize on the surging network activity in the coming months. ADA Demand Remains Strong Cardano is trading at $0.93 after an impressive 250% run from November 5 to its yearly high of $1.15. The price has since retraced more than 17% since Saturday morning’s peak, as it now attempts to find strong demand above the $0.90 level. This retracement is part of the natural consolidation process following a sharp rally, and ADA must hold above $0.90 to maintain bullish momentum. If ADA manages to hold above this level, it could position itself for a potential breakout, with the next key supply levels lying above $1.25. Such a move would indicate that the current pullback is simply a healthy correction before another leg up. However, if ADA loses the $0.90 level and fails to reclaim support, a deeper correction could follow, potentially bringing ADA to test lower levels. In that case, the next critical support zone would likely be closer to the $0.80 mark, where ADA might find further demand.

36878282,https://blockworks.co/news/depin-monetized-tesla-dashcam-data,1732644000,Turning Tesla cameras into data engines,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Modern cars are advanced computers on wheels, equipped with cameras that capture a 360° view of their surroundings. These systems play a vital role in navigation, safety and autonomous driving. Yet, their full potential is often untapped. NATIX Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) for collecting real-time geospatial data, is out with a new gadget that transforms a Tesla’s existing camera system into a 360° dashcam that pays you for collected data. The device, called VX360, aims to improve autonomous vehicles’ safety and introduce a variety of potential applications such as real-time mapping, property appraisal, insurance assessments and whatever else the market dreams up. Unlike synthetic simulation data, VX360 captures unpredictable real-world driving scenarios, often referred to as “edge cases,” such as sudden weather changes or unusual traffic patterns. Such data will help train autonomous vehicle AI. By leveraging the DePIN model, NATIX hopes to incentivize Tesla drivers to share real-world footage while ensuring robust privacy and data control measures. VX360 taps into each Tesla’s built-in cameras, using edge computing to process and anonymize footage at the source, according to CEO Alireza Ghods. “The anonymization AI blurs personally identifiable information like faces and license plates but doesn’t alter the footage, so it retains its integrity,” Ghods told Blockworks. This ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations. The footage is then uploaded directly to the cloud via Tesla’s built-in connectivity or a paired mobile device. “We’ve been refining anonymization AI since 2020, well before our pivot to NATIX Network, and open-source AI advancements have helped us build a high-performance stack for this,” Ghods said. NATIX rewards Tesla drivers for sharing footage through NATIX tokens, or for the non-Web3 crowd, incentives like gift cards and electronics discounts. The trip recordings remain available for the car’s owner to serve as a navigational reference or to aid insurance claims. Ghods emphasizes the device’s passive nature, predicting the hardware should pay for itself within about nine months. So, the switch from a strictly smartphone app-based model makes sense. For owners, “even if the rewards fluctuate,” he said, “they still get the utility of accessing and managing their footage from anywhere and anytime.” The network has a token buyback-and-burn system that uses 40% of revenue from data monetization. Since the token’s July 2024 launch, over 41.6 million tokens — from the 1 billion total — have been burned, Ghods said. The network has been targeting select cities initially, and NATIX plans to expand coverage as well as car compatibility in the future. So far, the VX360 has been tested with two additional car brands, Ghods said. “Our view on this is that car manufacturers are going away from building cars that are siloed, toward cars that can serve as platforms for others to build on,” he said. “The ‘iPhone moment’ of cars is happening now with Tesla and Google at the forefront of it.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

36877453,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/the-best-crypto-to-watch-for-december-high-potential-gains-ahead,1732643966,The Best Crypto to Watch for December: High Potential Gains Ahead,"As November progresses, the cryptocurrency market is alive with potential. Bitcoin is nearing its historic high of $100,000, while Ethereum is showing signs of a major breakout. But the real question on every investor's mind is: where will the money flow next? Historically, the capital surge in Bitcoin often sets the stage for a flourishing altcoin season. December could be the month where altcoins shine the brightest, and positioning your portfolio now could yield significant gains. In this article, we’ll discuss three standout cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Altura —and why they deserve your attention right now. Let’s uncover the trends and opportunities shaping the market. Bitcoin (BTC): All Eyes on $100K Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, cementing its role as the ‘safe haven’ asset in the digital economy. With global inflation on the rise and institutions increasing their BTC holdings, the market has entered a bullish phase. The king of crypto is now eyeing the $100,000 milestone—a record that seemed almost impossible just a few years ago. On-chain data shows strong network activity, increasing wallet addresses, and significant transaction volume. This signals robust investor confidence. However, as Bitcoin takes center stage, the market is beginning to shift its focus toward smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH): A Powerhouse Ready to Surge Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem. With its dominance in DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s an ecosystem of innovation. The recent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has made the network faster, more scalable, and energy-efficient, attracting developers and investors alike. Analysts predict that Ethereum could soon break its all-time high as adoption continues to soar. The buzz around Ethereum also fuels excitement for other smart contract-based platforms, creating a cascading effect throughout the market. For long-term investors, Ethereum is a solid choice with significant upside potential. Ethereum’s breakout narrative is even more compelling when we look at the technical patterns forming on its weekly chart. The cryptocurrency is currently in a textbook cup-and-handle pattern—a reliable bullish indicator. This pattern suggests a price target exceeding $16,000, a level that could serve as a major catalyst for the entire altcoin market. The weekly timeframe chart shows a significant structure forming, which aligns with the broader market momentum. If Ethereum successfully breaks out, it is likely to spark an altcoin season as investors rotate profits into high-potential smaller-cap coins. Altura (ALU): A Star Among Altcoins Altura is a rising star in the world of blockchain-based gaming and NFTs. It offers a unique platform where game developers can easily create and integrate smart NFTs into their games. This focus on utility and innovation sets Altura apart from many other altcoins in the market. As December approaches, the cryptocurrency market often sees a shift in focus from large-cap assets like Bitcoin to smaller, high-growth coins. Altura stands out for its partnerships with gaming studios and its clear use case. For investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities, Altura is a top pick. Altura Technical Analysis and Prediction Altura’s weekly timeframe reveals a massive W pattern, a well-known bullish structure in technical analysis. This setup indicates two clear price targets—the first at $0.55 per coin and the second, a more ambitious target, at $1.30 per coin. This technical setup is a strong indicator of potential growth, driven by increased trading volume and investor interest. As the pattern completes, Altura could see substantial gains, making it an attractive choice for high-reward opportunities this December. Why December Could Be the Month of Altcoins Historically, December has often marked the beginning of altcoin season—a period where smaller cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. As BTC approaches its record high, investors typically look to diversify their portfolios, seeking the next big opportunity in altcoins. This December, the conditions are ripe for an altcoin rally. Projects like Altura, which combine real-world utility with high-growth potential, are positioned to attract significant investor interest. By acting now, investors can capitalize on this trend before the broader market catches on. Conclusion: Prepare for December’s Altcoin Boom The cryptocurrency market is teeming with opportunities as Bitcoin nears $100,000 and Ethereum gears up for a breakout. But the real story might unfold in December, as altcoins take center stage. Coins like Altura offer a glimpse into the future of blockchain technology and the immense potential of smaller-cap assets. Now is the time to diversify and position yourself for what could be a transformative month for altcoins. As always, remember to do your own research and manage risks effectively.

It is, therefore, no surprise to the seasoned investors that the largest cryptocurrency fell below $92k today on Tuesday. Pullbacks and corrections are inherent features of a bull market. However, the global liquidity index is painting an ominous picture for BTC. The Global M2 Money Supply has seen a steep correction, falling by nearly $4 trillion since September. Jesse Cohen from Investing.com believes this could result in a Bitcoin price crash to $70,000 by the end of 2024. Big if true.Bitcoin $BTC could fall back to ~$70,000 by the end of 2024.Too many people were predicting $100K by the end of the year for it to actually happen. pic.twitter.com/JrFLIXYC9w — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) November 26, 2024 Is Bitcoin Still Worth Buying? Despite the recent correction to $92k, experts are in consensus that the Bitcoin price will surpass the $100,000 landmark. Even macro bears like Henrik Zeberg, the Head Macro Economist at Swiss Block who is forecasting a 1929-esque recession, expect BTC to hit $110k in the coming months. TARGETS FOR #BLOWOFFTOP 🚀🚀🚀 #DXY ~93.5 #SP500 : ~6150 #Nasdaq : ~27900 #Bitcoin : 110KNow calm down! 😆Bear Market and #Recession await after the Blow-Off Top pic.twitter.com/09ZkckJQeK — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) May 1, 2024 Meanwhile, bulls like Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor and ARK Invest’s Catherine Wood see the largest cryptocurrency hitting anywhere between $300k and $500k in 2025. These bullish projections aren't pipe dreams, especially if Donald Trump remains firm on his promise to set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, global liquidity serves as a reliable predictor for Bitcoin's future price trajectory. The fact that the Global M2 Money Supply is down by nearly $4 trillion, despite major cuts by the US Federal Reserve and China’s PBOC, is certainly concerning. Consequently, a Bitcoin price crash to $70,000 is no longer out of the picture. As such, 30% to 40% corrections are common, even in a bull market. Sidelined investors looking to stack will almost certainly get a better entry point in the coming months. In fact, whales are actively selling large-cap cryptocurrencies. A deep-pocketed whale unstaked $10.5 million of Solana and sent it to Binance today on Tuesday, data from LookOnChain reveals. On the contrary, smart money investors are buying new meme coins and presale cryptocurrencies, considering they show little correlation to the broader market outlook. Pepe Unchained Surges Past $53M In ICO Behind Large Whale Buys - Best Crypto To Buy Now? Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has firmly established itself as the hottest presale commodity, appealing to whales and retailers alike. While Bitcoin and large-caps are facing major downside volatility, a deep-pocketed investor purchased $140k worth of PEPU. Another whale purchased $120k worth of the new meme coin while $50k purchases are daily occurrences for Pepe Unchained. Behind such heavy whale bidding, the PEPU presale has surpassed the $53 million mark, a remarkable achievement for a meme coin that hasn’t even launched yet. With its ICO set to end on December 13th, it would be no surprise if it hits the $70 million mark in its presale. After all, Pepe Unchained isn’t an ordinary meme coin. Its Layer-2 chain, a Pump Fun-like meme coin launchpad on Ethereum and cutting-edge tools like custom DEX and block explorer make it more of a next-gen meme coin ecosystem on Ethereum, with PEPU at the centre of it all. It is therefore no surprise that prominent crypto influencers are eyeing anywhere between 50x and 100x returns from it, calling it the next billion-dollar meme coin.

36875526,https://blockworks.co/news/web3-blockchain-fees-onboarding,1732639073,"Unless Web3 changes, the ‘next billion users’ are never coming","Fees are killing Web3 — not because they’re expensive (many blockchains and layer-2s boast fees as low as fractions of a cent), but because their very existence creates friction for users. Fees don’t just cost money — they cost usability. Users are blocked from interacting onchain unless they hold a given blockchain’s native token. Want to use Ethereum? You’ll need ETH. On Solana? You’ll need SOL. Every network has its own currency. Before new adopters can engage with anything — be it a token transaction, an NFT mint or a decentralized app — they must navigate the process of obtaining and securely storing the proper native gas asset. For seasoned crypto enthusiasts, this might feel like second nature. You, of course, are a tech savant. You’re reading a crypto publication and you probably learned how to go to an exchange, share your bank details, obtain a token, store it on a hardware wallet, connect to MetaMask, exchange it for another token that you’ll use to power your transaction…and so on ad nauseam . Read more: Is mass adoption still crypto’s most important goal? And this is all fine if you’re using a blockchain for DeFi (for example). You don’t mind the learning curve if there’s a clear financial incentive. But…for the next billion users? Do we really expect a billion Facebook users to jump into this tangle of counterintuitive technobabble and make it work? No. It’s not going to happen. The only way for our industry to move beyond the “early adopters” phase and start onboarding the “early majority” is to eliminate these barriers. We need to make this process as intuitive and simple as using the internet we’re looking to replace. And that means no more fees. Ever. Period. Looking back, fees served several critical functions in blockchain’s early days. They acted as a deterrent to spam by requiring a small cost for each transaction, effectively discouraging malicious actors from overloading their respective networks with meaningless activity. Read more from our opinion section: DeFi’s slow infrastructure is holding back mass adoption At the same time, fees provided miners with financial incentives to validate and secure transactions, ensuring the network’s integrity and sustainability, especially as block rewards decreased over time. Fees also allowed users to prioritize transactions during periods of high demand. This framework was groundbreaking in its time, but that was nearly 16 years ago. With advances in blockchain technology and shifting user expectations, isn’t it time to rethink this outdated approach and explore what’s next? To start with, we need to shift focus onto building apps that feel seamless and intuitive for users. Imagine a platform where users can engage freely — minting NFTs, sharing content or transacting — without ever needing to think about gas fees. What if apps operated on an entirely different financial model — one where developers could delegate the ability to transact to users, entirely eliminating fees and the need for tokens? We’ve seen attempts to address this before; for instance, protocols that claim to be “feeless” by covering fees on behalf of users in a bid to win their loyalty. But such models are unsustainable. They depend on temporary funding or token incentives that distort the market, create reliance on artificial subsidies and inevitably deplete with time. Rather, I’m talking about a completely free-to-use model that doesn’t cost anything at all . There are a variety of ways a truly feeless blockchain network could be accomplished. One approach involves allocating network resources to users, which are consumed during transactions and automatically regenerate over time. Hardcoding this directly into the network would eliminate the need for users to pay fees directly while ensuring the network remains secure and efficient. Or perhaps more developers could focus on alternative consensus mechanisms, such as directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures, where users validate each other’s transactions without relying on miners or traditional fees. Read more: Rethinking Ethereum consensus with Beam Chain Regardless of the path taken to get there, our end goal should be an ecosystem where developers can build apps that look and feel just like the ones the uninitiated use every day — intuitive, seamless and free of unnecessary friction. Web3 was never supposed to change the world for a few million crypto enthusiasts. It was supposed to make digital life better for everyone. But instead of tackling the root of Web3’s dysfunction, successive protocols have doubled down on the fallacious assumption that fees are an unavoidable necessity. While these challenges continue to hinder mainstream adoption for now, the tides appear to be changing. And I’m pretty sure that in a few years, the idea of paying to use a blockchain will seem as antiquated as the landline.

In line with this, crypto analyst Tony Severino provided insights into what could come next for Bitcoin. What Next For Price After Close Above Bull Channel In an X post, Tony Severino mentioned that the Bitcoin price is now retesting the median in the bull channel, with an evening star pattern forming on the chart, which hints at a potential reversal. He noted that Bitcoin is fighting to stay above the $96,000 range, which could invalidate this sell signal. Related Reading: Over $500 Million Wiped Out From The Market As Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Heavily However, if Bitcoin closes below this median range, Tony Severino warns that the price could record a significant downtrend to the $90,000 range. If this median range holds, the crypto analyst expects Bitcoin to break into the upper channel above the $100,000 level. Tony Severino revealed that the target for this uptrend channel is $267,000. However, he doesn’t think the Bitcoin price will reach that level in this bull run. Instead, the crypto analyst predicts that Bitcoin could peak between $160,000 and $190,000, although Severino is more confident about the former being the market top. The crypto analyst added that the golden ratio is in the $160,000 range, which makes this target more feasible. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price eventually rallying to $169,000 as it peaks in this range. Amid this analysis, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin is currently at risk of dropping to this $90,000, having failed to hold the median at the $96,000 range. The $94,000 Range Is Another Level To Watch Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently suggested that the $94,000 range is another level to watch for the Bitcoin price. According to him, this is the key level that matters. He claimed that BTC is bullish on all timeframes as long as the flagship crypto stays above this level. However, if Bitcoin loses this level, it could lead to a significant downtrend. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Remain Greedy Amid Price Break Toward $100,000, Why This Is Good CrediBULL Crypto stated that a break below $94,000 will indicate a momentum shift and a potential larger correction that could cause Bitcoin price to drop to the low $80,000 range. The positive is that investors still look heavily bullish on Bitcoin’s trajectory despite a potential price correction on the horizon. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that investors are buying the dip. This came as he revealed that the percentage of all traders with long Bitcoin positions has increased from 45.36% to 55.93%. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $94,800, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Tron (TRX) is currently priced at $0.2052, having experienced a 24.78% growth in the last 30 days. The network reached a multi-year high of $0.22 and saw its daily revenue peak at $2.16 million on November 22. Tron’s Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $7.845 billion in November. It dominates the stablecoin market, processing 92% of all USDT transactions, with a weekly USDT volume of $150 billion in November. Despite hosting $60 billion in USDT, the market cap of TRX is only $17 billion. Analysts predict TRX could surpass its all-time high of $0.3004, last seen in 2017. Tether’s market cap has also grown by 50%, reaching $132 billion in 2024, reflecting the strong role of stablecoins in the market. AVAX Is Gearing Up For a New All-Time High Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at $40.24, showing a 4.70% decline in the last 24 hours. However, the price has surged 51.37% over the past month and is up 92.12% from a year ago, when it was priced at $20.94. The prediction for AVAX by Nov 29, 2024, is $54.91, representing a 31.32% increase. Key support levels are at $39.89, $38.36, and $35.88, while resistance levels are at $43.91, $46.39, and $47.92. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 70.53, suggesting the asset is overbought. Avalanche has gained 48.95% in the last three months, with a volatility of 16.46% over the past month. Conclusion Amidst all this heat, crypto whales are always on the lookout for altcoins with a strong dominance. Tron and AVAX made most analysts’ top picks for investments before 2025. However, $MASH gives the holder a ticket to a possible 1000% in 2025. Add $MASH tokens to your portfolio now to leverage the early investor advantage. Join The Community!

By integrating Securitize’s technology, Zodia seeks to deliver an enhanced custody service that ensures the safekeeping and regulatory compliance of tokenized investments. The move underlines Zodia Custody’s commitment to institutional investors trying to make sense of this fast-developing digital asset market. In fact, one of the main beneficiaries of this deal is BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With tokenization gathering steam in traditional finance, this agreement between Zodia and Securitize aims to leverage that momentum toward further enablement of institutions to take part in tokenized financial products. Institutional Advanced Custody Solutions Zodia’s custody services prioritize security and compliance, critical factors for institutional investors. The platform offers robust cold storage solutions, segregating client assets to protect against cyber threats and ensuring adherence to stringent regulatory standards. These features address the primary concerns of institutions managing digital assets, safeguarding their investments in the growing market. London-based Zodia Custody boasts backers including Standard Chartered, Northern Trust, and SBI Holdings. Its strong support by industry players means Zodia is well-placed to secure a foothold with institutional investors into the world of digital assets . Tokenization’s Expanding Role in Finance Tokenization is creating a revolution in financial markets through its digitization of tangible and intangible assets in the form of digital tokens kept on blockchains. This represents the potential for increased efficiency, costs, and access compared to conventional methods in asset management. For example, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund already attracted $530 million in assets under management since its launch in March 2024. The market for tokenized assets is expected to surpass the cryptocurrency market capitalization and reach more than $4.5 trillion by 2028. Although USD stablecoins are currently dominant in the tokenization landscape, many new financial products are fast emerging that are tied to assets such as real estate and debt, indicative of the growth potential of the sector. Driving the Future of Tokenized Assets Zodia CEO Julian Sawyer commented on the transformative potential of tokenized assets: Above all, this growth in BUIDL evidences the tokenized assets opportunity and its transformational potential both for traditional finance and for digital-native businesses. This partnership reflects the developing synergy between mainstream financial incumbents and digital-native solutions. As the tokenized asset market keeps up its pace of growth, Zodia and Securitize are working together to position themselves as key enablers of institutional adoption-bridging the gap between legacy finance and blockchain technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/zodia-custody-partners-securitize-enhance/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

""In this regard, Bank Al-Maghrib, with the participation of all stakeholders and the support of the World Bank, has prepared a draft law regulating cryptoassets, which is currently in the adoption process,"" he said at an international conference in Rabat.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! XRP (XRP) XRP (XRP) has experienced a remarkable surge recently. Over the past week, its price jumped by 35.56%. In the last month, it soared by 184.84%. Looking back six months, the price increased by 170.50%. Currently, XRP trades between $1.11 and $1.69, reflecting significant growth and volatility. The coin's moving averages support this upward trend. The 10-day simple moving average is $1.47, slightly above the 100-day average of $1.42. This indicates a positive short-term momentum. The relative strength index stands at 47.05, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. A stochastic value of 47.46 aligns with this neutral stance. The MACD level is positive at 0.0095, hinting at continued bullish momentum. Looking ahead, XRP faces resistance at $1.95 and $2.52. Breaking through the first resistance could see the price rise by around 15%. Surpassing the second resistance might lead to gains exceeding 50%. On the downside, support levels are at $0.7961 and $0.2199. If the price dips, these levels could provide stability. The data points to potential growth, but monitoring these key levels will be crucial for anticipating XRP's next move. Ondo (ONDO) In the past week, Ondo (ONDO) increased by 13%, continuing a positive trend with a 55% rise over the past month. However, the coin is still down by 16% over the last six months. Currently trading between $0.95 and $1.15, ONDO seems to be in recovery. Technical indicators give mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $1.06 and $1.03, indicating consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is 46.40, below the neutral 50, hinting at potential undervaluation. The stochastic oscillator at 18.58 suggests the coin might be oversold short-term. The MACD is slightly positive at 0.0042, indicating mild bullish momentum. Looking ahead, ONDO faces resistance at $1.24 and support at $0.83. A break above resistance could target $1.44, about 25% higher. Falling below support might test $0.62, around a 30% decline. Given recent upward momentum, there is potential for further gains, but key levels should be watched closely. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) has seen significant growth recently, rising 81.14% over the past 6 months. In the last month, it went up by 23.99%. Even in the past week, TRX increased by 0.90%. These numbers show strong interest from investors. Currently, TRX is trading between $0.19 and $0.23. This is close to its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.21. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.29, and the Stochastic is at 25.16. These indicators suggest TRX might be oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0006162, which could mean a positive change is coming. The nearest resistance level is $0.24. If TRX breaks this, it could rise by over 4%. The next resistance is at $0.27, which would be a gain of around 17% from current prices. On the downside, support is at $0.18, and stronger support is at $0.14. Based on recent performance and these levels, TRX may continue to rise. Conclusion XRP, ONDO, and TRX show strong potential in the ongoing bull run, but innovative projects merging sports and crypto may offer exceptional growth opportunities.

If HBAR breaks this resistance, it could climb to the second resistance at $0.3012, offering potential gains of over 65%. Technical indicators support this potential rise, with an RSI of 38.19 and a Stochastic of 29.80, both suggesting there's room for growth. The price is also aligning with the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $0.1418 and $0.1423, indicating stability. With altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, HBAR is a coin to watch. Sui (SUI) Poised for Potential Growth Amid Altcoin Optimism Sui (SUI) is trading between $3.06 and $3.82. Despite a 16.18% drop in the past week, it has surged 81.14% over the last month and 207.75% in six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 32.21, indicating the coin is oversold. This suggests a possible upward correction. The price is near the 10-day Simple Moving Average of $3.35, below the 100-day SMA of $3.48, hinting at a potential bullish trend. If Sui breaks the resistance level at $4.25, it could climb to the next resistance at $5.01. This would be an increase of about 31% from current prices. With altcoin season approaching, Sui may see significant growth soon. Toncoin's Price Rising: Set to Break Through Resistance Levels Soon Toncoin's price has surged over 27% in the past month, showing strong growth. It's currently trading between $5.36 and $6.77, edging closer to the resistance level at $7.39. If it breaks this level, it could rise toward $8.80. The short-term moving average is above the long-term average, indicating an upward trend. With the altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run expected, Toncoin has significant potential to increase further. Its recent momentum suggests it may continue to climb, offering opportunities for substantial gains. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) primed for significant gains Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is showing strong signs of an upward trend. The current price is hovering in the mid $1 range. The 10-day simple moving average is above the 100-day average, indicating bullish momentum. Over the past month, FET has gained almost 19%. In the last week alone, it rose over 14%. The nearest resistance level is at $1.82. Breaking through could see the price target the next resistance at $2.21, representing potential gains of over 40% from current levels. The RSI and stochastic are in neutral zones, suggesting room for growth. As altcoin season approaches, FET could be primed for significant advances. Conclusion While HBAR, SUI, TON, and FET may have less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and increasing to $0.0016 over 14 stages, and triple utility features, Catzilla invites participation in the fight against crypto villains.

Discussing this last month, Mickle cited comments from former Ripple developer Matt Hamilton on XRP’s technological edge over Bitcoin.Meanwhile, Chris Kline, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Bitcoin IRA, weighed in on the matter during a recent episode of the CoinDesk Podcast. He presented a new perspective on the potential of XRP and other assets while cautioning investors about the volatility in the market. XRP Utility Against BitcoinKline stressed that the utility of a cryptocurrency is important for understanding its potential growth. He noted that XRP was designed as a solution for cross-border payments, aiming to disrupt the traditional SWIFT banking system. Notably, several institutions see XRP as a potential competitor to SWIFT . Though revolutionary, Kline believes this utility limits XRP’s price potential in comparison to Bitcoin, which operates as a decentralized store of value with a capped supply of 21 million coins. According to Kline, if XRP achieved the same price levels as Bitcoin, say $50,000, it would essentially outprice itself from its intended purpose. Kline pointed out that this would undermine its use as a cost-effective payment solution. As such, he argued that the idea of XRP reaching Bitcoin’s valuation misaligns with its design and mission. Another factor influencing XRP’s price potential is its supply. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million, XRP's total supply is much higher. This abundance naturally limits its price ceiling.However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz previously presented an alternative view years back. According to Schwartz , the higher XRP’s price is, the easier it can be used to move large volumes of funds.For context, if XRP reached a price of $1 million, it would take just 1 XRP to move funds worth $1 million. Nonetheless, if XRP changes hands at $1, it would take many more tokens, particularly 1 million, to move $1 million worth of funds. As such, Schwartz argued that XRP cannot be “dirt cheap.”Warnings Around Market Volatility Kline’s latest remarks contrast this view. The Bitcoin IRA co-founder made the recent comments while advising investors on their investment choices. Kline warned that investing in digital assets demands a strong stomach. https://twitter.com/CoinDeskPodcast/status/1861168895995822260Price fluctuations are frequent, and many investors find themselves obsessively tracking their portfolios. He likened this experience to becoming a day trader, even if unintentionally. Kline also highlighted the importance of understanding market trends. During periods of Bitcoin’s dominance, some investors take profits and shift to altcoins, hoping to capitalize on their higher growth potential. This pattern is evident in XRP’s recent performance. However, he cautioned that such moves come with risks, as not all altcoins succeed. Kline encouraged investors to research the tokenomics of assets before making decisions.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/26/xrp-reaching-btc-price-bitcoin-ira-co-founder-weighs-in-on-the-possibility/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-reaching-btc-price-bitcoin-ira-co-founder-weighs-in-on-the-possibility,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The financial institution went on to say that it observes considerable inflation risks, especially as the Federal Reserve started its rate-cutting cycle back in September, even while month over month core inflation readings remain north of 2%. They have been above 2% for the past four years. As a result, Cantor believes equities will rally into year-end but says that the equity space will “prove to be a poor investment” over the medium term time horizon. In combating inflation, Cantor Fitzgerald indicated that it prefers both gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as potential investments. “Our view has been buy Bitcoin and gold as a way to play inflation theme.” For investors that share a similar mindset, highlighted below are a handful of gold and bitcoin related exchange-traded funds that can be further monitored.

36886144,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102893,1732634762,"Amid Bitcoin Dip, Analyst Pinpoints Specific Timeline for BTC to Reach $150K","Analyst Apsk has weighed in on the timeline for Bitcoin to attain a $150K market top consistent with the previous cycle. The Bitcoin market has turned bearish again after an unsuccessful attempt to break the $100K price level. Just yesterday, Bitcoin was priced at $98,935, but it has dropped by 7.5% at press time to $91,500.With this bearish performance sparking concerns, analysts now reassure market participants that Bitcoin is still far from its cycle top. In a post today, Apsk, an engineer and Bitcoin analyst, revisited patterns from Bitcoin’s past cycles, suggesting that the current cycle is still in its early stages.Apsk pointed out that Bitcoin’s price history has been marked by cyclical peaks occurring roughly every four years, with the last three surging in November or December. The previous cycle highs were: 10 Nov 2021: $69,000 17 Dec 2017: $19,891 29 Nov 2013: $1,242Based on this historical pattern, Apsk expects the next cycle peak to occur in November-December 2025. Essentially, while some may be concerned about the recent price dip, Apsk’s analysis highlights that Bitcoin is not near its cycle top and that the long-term trajectory remains intact.Bitcoin Potential Peak for This CycleThe analyst also highlighted Bitcoin’s adherence to a “power curve” that has provided consistent support for its price over the past 15 years. This curve represents what Apsk believes to be the intrinsic value of the Bitcoin network.As each cycle progresses, Bitcoin’s price rises above this support line but by progressively smaller percentages. The trend suggests that while Bitcoin will likely continue to rise, the magnitude of its future price explosions may not match the dramatic increases of previous cycles.For instance, after Bitcoin peaked in 2013 at $1,242, it later dropped to $171 by January 2015, presenting the cycle’s bottom at the time. It was from this point that Bitcoin soared to the $20K peak of the 2017 cycle. This represented an astonishing 11,532% growth during the post-halving bull run of the 2016/2017 cycle.However, in the 2020/2021 post-halving run, Bitcoin did not mirror the 115X surge of the previous cycle. Instead, it rose by 2,062% from around $3K to $69K. Essentially, Apsk’s analysis suggests Bitcoin’s peak could reach $150K in this cycle , which would represent a 900% rise from the $15K bottom. Bitcoin chart by Apsk Could This Cycle Be Different?While acknowledging the market’s potential for explosive growth, Apsk noted some key differences in the current cycle that could impact future price movements. These include the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a more favorable political environment, and institutional players like Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, who continues to leverage debt to acquire more Bitcoin. Apsk suggests that these factors might fuel further upward momentum in the short term, but he cautioned that they could also lead to volatility or corrections.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/26/amid-bitcoin-dip-analyst-pinpoints-specific-timeline-for-btc-to-reach-150k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=amid-bitcoin-dip-analyst-pinpoints-specific-timeline-for-btc-to-reach-150k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36872779,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/openledger-taps-ionets-global-gpu-resources-in-groundbreaking-partnership,1732634539,OpenLedger Taps io.net’s Global GPU Resources in Groundbreaking Partnership,"io.net partners with AI data blockchain, OpenLedger. The collaboration will see OpenLedger leverage io.net’s GPU resources. Decentralized distributed GPU resource platform io.net announced its partnership with OpenLedger , the data blockchain for AI, this week. The strategic cooperation will enable OpenLedger to access the DePIN services of io.net’s global GPU compute resources to refine and train its AI models. Known as the Internet of GPUs, io.net provides users with a powerful, distributed network of global GPU resources. OpenLedger becomes the latest AI platform to join the network, enabling it to gain the compute resources it requires to accelerate the development of its AI models. Developed using OpenLedger's datasets, this will empower developers to build smarter, more efficient AI-based DApps. On the partnership, Tausif Ahmad, the Vice President of Business Development at io.net stated: “We’re excited to be partnering with OpenLedger whose data blockchain for AI provides Web3 builders with decentralized datasets they can trust. With io.net providing the GPU compute, OpenLedger now has an infra provider it can rely on to scale its AI models built on top of them and to unlock new use cases that will reinforce its status as an innovative provider of decentralized AI models.” Adding to GPU resources, access to io.net’s GPU infrastructure will also support inference and hosting of the AI models, ensuring they are optimized for performance and scalability. This is expected to enhance OpenLedger’s reputation as a leading provider of reliable datasets that are fueling a wave of innovation at the intersection of blockchain and AI. The partnership will also enable OpenLedger users to access high-quality data securely and efficiently. With its vision to scale AI data creation with over one billion personas and driving innovation and performance, io.net’s GPU resources will come in handy, the team statement reads. “Our collaboration with io.net unlocks the full potential of our high-quality datanets, using the contributed data to create specialized AI models. By leveraging io.net’s GPU infrastructure, our protocol users will be able to fine-tune AI models more efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and scalability,” a team member from OpenLedger said on the importance of the partnership. Notwithstanding, the partnership will also bring OpenLedger closer to realising its vision of “creating a decentralized, transparent AI ecosystem that enables collaboration through data sharing and the development of trustworthy, explainable models.” A critical reason why OpenLedger selected io.net as its GPU resources provider is the cost-effective and scalable compute solutions the latter offers. Through the partnership, OpenLedger will be able to expand its services without being constrained by the high costs and limitations of centralized cloud providers. The platform can also scale up its operations, process larger datasets, and develop AI models with unprecedented efficiency, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized AI innovation. io.net GPU resources will also enable OpenLedger to unlock new use cases for AI models across diverse applications built using its high-quality datasets and contributed data. Additionally, the partnership will also help OpenLedger further bolster its track record as a pioneer in creating a decentralized ecosystem for trustworthy, accessible AI. Lastly, the partnership also bonds well with OpenLedger’s mission to provide an open, collaborative data environment while driving the adoption of blockchain-powered AI solutions.

The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF could benefit from Bitcoin's potential rally, though it currently faces overbought conditions and high volatility. WGMI's portfolio is concentrated, with 50% in its top four holdings, and has a high P/E ratio of 37.5, suggesting caution. Despite long-term positive trends, I maintain a hold rating on WGMI due to its stretched valuation and near-term technical warning signs. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) tends to end the year well. In data going back to 2010, the token has typically returned 11.3%, on average, in December. The median gain is 8.6%, according to data from Barchart. Median returns over in January and February are strong too, while March has featured more negative performances than positive. So, with bitcoin having returned more than 100% so far in 2024, there’s optimism that a FOMO trade could transpire over the final weeks of the year. If that thesis were to play out, then there would be obvious tailwinds in shares of the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). As it stands, traders place a 74% implied chance of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency reaching the psychological $100,000 price tag , per Kalshi. I have a hold rating on WGMI. I see the fund as somewhat expensive today, but the broad technical trend is positive. With the ETF working off overbought conditions and retreating off a key resistance point on the chart, patience could be rewarded in the weeks ahead. I will outline where a positive risk/reward long investment could be seen. Bitcoin Seasonality: Strong Returns December Through February Barchart Odds of Bitcoin Hitting $100k Fall From Last Week's Peak Kalshi According to the issuer, WGMI provides targeted exposure to the companies at the forefront of transaction verification, ensuring transparency and security on the blockchain. WGMI is a regulated, actively managed ETF traded on the Nasdaq. This structure provides a familiar framework for investors looking to enter the cryptocurrency space without direct exposure to bitcoin. WGMI is a small ETF with just $237 million in assets under management as of November 25, 2024. Its annual expense ratio is somewhat high at 0.75% while the forward dividend yield is low at 0.20%. But where WGMI shines is with its share-price momentum . Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system reveals a perfect A+ ETF Grade. Partly as a result, WGMI is currently the No. 1-ranked ETF in its Asset Class, according to the quant ranking tool. Along with the high annual expense figure and low yield, WGMI is a highly risky product . Its historical annualized volatility is extreme at 88%, and tracking error has been very high too. Liquidity can be an issue at times, though volume has increased significantly in recent weeks – the average bid/ask spread is 18 basis points, per ETF Central. Digging into the portfolio, WGMI’s risk profile should warrant caution by prospective investors considering that 95% of the allocation is considered SMID cap in size. More than half of the portfolio is invested in small-cap growth stocks, so I assert that a relatively small position size should be taken from a risk management perspective. WGMI has 70% US exposure with just below 30% foreign access. On valuation, the price-to-earnings ratio is high at 37.5. Long-term EPS growth is strong, however, above 30%. Of course, much depends on how positive price action in bitcoin is. CoinShares points out that WGMI’s correlation to the S&P 500 is just 0.6 while the fund’s correlation to bitcoin is higher at 0.83. WGMI: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar Adding to WGMI’s risk construct is the reality that the top four positions account for a material chunk of the ETF – about 50%. So, monitoring both the fundamental and technical trends in Core Scientific ( CORZ ), Iris Energy ( IREN ), Cipher Mining ( CIFR ), and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is important. Overall, concentration is high as 81% of WGMI is invested in the top 10 stocks. WGMI: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Looking closer at the four largest holdings, CleanSpark has an unconfirmed Q4 earnings report on Friday, November 29 AMC. The firm is then slated to present at the Wells Fargo 8 th Annual TMT Summit 2024 on Tuesday, December 3. Keep the rest of next week on your radar as we’ll get monthly production numbers from each of the major stocks in WGMI. Key Events On Tap Wall Street Horizon The Technical Take With a stretched valuation and as bitcoin works down from flirting with $100,000 earlier this month, WGMI’s technical situation is generally positive long-term, but cautionary in the short run, further pushing me to issue a hold rating. Notice in the chart below that an uptrend resistance line is seen in the low $30s – shares backed away from that spot two weeks ago. I like that the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph is in an uptrend, which helps to confirm upside price action, but the RSI is also coming off technical overbought readings. Also take a look at a price gap just above the $21 mark. If we see the ETF penetrate that gap, it would be a favorable risk/reward long area in my view. Right now, the rising 50-day moving average comes into play near $22 while the 200dma is also upward-sloping, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend. Finally, there’s a high amount of volume by price in the low $20s which should act as solid support. WGMI: Long-Term Uptrend, But Near-Term Warning Signs, Low $20s Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on WGMI. I see the long-term trend as positive on this crypto mining ETF while seasonal tailwinds are present. But several technical indicators lead me to a hold rating as well as the fund’s high P/E multiple.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740375-wgmi-the-bitcoin-mining-etf-pares-2024-gains-eyeing-an-entry-idea?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36872469.jpeg

Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) shocked the entire crypto market with a near-vertical breakout that saw it climb the crypto ranks with ease. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) is also gaining massive traction with its innovative framework that could disrupt the entire DEX space. Let’s dive deeper! Will Ethereum Hold At $3,500? Over the last month, Ethereum (ETH) tried several times to break above the crucial $3,500, but every attempt was met by a barrage of sell-offs that pushed its price downward. Today, Ethereum briefly soared above this level, but it already lost some ground as it’s now trading at $3,455 with a 4% intraday increase. According to analyst Yoddha , Ethereum’s long-term outlook remains unchanged despite any short-term turbulence. He points out that Ethereum is still moving within a multi-year ascending channel and is currently building up pressure for the next explosive leg-up that could see Ethereum soar to 5 figures at the peak of the bull run. Stellar Community Vindicated as XLM Soars Past $0.60 After ranging around the $0.10 level for years, Stellar (XLM) experienced a 6x multiplier in a matter of days that saw its price peak at $0.063, a level not seen since 2021. As investors booked profits, Stellar retraced and is currently selling for $0.50 with a 2.2% intraday increase. At $14.7 billion in market cap, Stellar has triumphantly re-entered the crypto top 20, as the 14th biggest cryptocurrency. According to some analysts, the writing was on the wall all along regarding Stellar’s blinding rally. Crypto expert Just Some Guy has shared some exchange numbers highlighting a massive $8.8 billion in derivatives volume for Stellar, accompanied by a 54% increase in open interest, sitting at roughly $450 million. Lunex Network Could Usher In A New Era In DeFi Lunex Network is a non-custodial exchange that integrates isolated blockchains into one place and offers seamless transactions between 50,000 assets at the lowest possible price. At the forefront of Lunex Network’s priorities is privacy and security. This means that no KYC is required to join and no third-party wallet is needed either. Users can simply select the tickers, input a receiving address, and confirm the transaction. Users will also be able to use an exclusive non-custodial Lunex-branded wallet that can be operated simultaneously via phone or desktop. This feature offers unmatched versatility and allows traders to seamlessly operate across the 40+ blockchains supported by the wallet. For investors who want to keep an eye on their assets and keep up to date with the latest market trends, Lunex Network offers a novel portfolio tracking app that comes with built-in data feeds and analytics.

On a weekly basis, Lunex Network will reinvest a portion of its earnings to buy back LNEX tokens on the open market and redistribute them among holders as recurring staking rewards for up to 18% APY. More than $3.1 million has been raised in record time during the ongoing presale of the native LNEX token, which currently sells for just $0.0031. By the end of the presale alone a 1,800% surge is expected, making today the perfect time to get involved. Don’t miss out!

36872119,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654968,1732633221,"Bitcoin Holds At $93,257 As Bulls Struggle To Avoid Deeper Losses","Bitcoin (BTC) stands firm at $93,257, a crucial support level that could determine its next major move. As the battle between bulls and bears intensifies, the stakes are high: a successful defense could spark renewed momentum, while a break below might trigger significant losses. As the market navigates this pivotal moment, this article aims to analyze BTC’s current position at the critical $93,257 support level, exploring the factors influencing its price movement. By examining key technical indicators and market dynamics, the goal is to assess whether the bulls can defend this level and potentially drive a rebound or if a break below could cause deeper losses. Analyzing The Recent Price Action Of Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a bearish trend, attempting to break below the $93,257 support level. If this continues, BTC could test the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, which could act as support or signal further weakness. A failure to hold above this level might lead to a deeper correction and possibly more notable losses toward lower support zones. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis shows that BTC may continue its decline, as the RSI has dropped to 35%, indicating increasing selling pressure. A reading below 50% suggests a weakening bullish trend and raises the likelihood of more declines. If the RSI continues to dip, it could signal that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next Despite trading above the key 100-day SMA, Bitcoin is showing strong negative momentum on the daily chart, highlighted by bearish candlesticks and increasing selling pressure. This suggests that the crypto asset is struggling to sustain its upward strength, and if the downtrend continues, it may lead to large corrections and test lower support levels. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart has dropped to 63% from the overbought zone, signaling a shift in market sentiment. This implies that buying pressure is easing, and the bullish momentum may be weakening. A move away from the overbought area could signal the start of a consolidation phase or the onset of a corrective pullback. Potential Scenarios: Rebound Or Breakdown? As Bitcoin tests key support levels, a rebound or a breakdown is expected. Thus, if the bulls manage to defend critical levels like $93,257, BTC witness a rebound, gaining upside strength and targeting its previous high of $99,575. Furthermore, a break above this level may pave the way for the digital asset to set new highs, extending the bullish trend.

Established entities including Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, Pepe, and XRP are all soaring before alt-season commences, though savvy investors are accumulating the new gem Rollblock during the presale for potential parabolic returns. Read on to learn more. Exploring Rollblock’s Potential: Why Analysts Can’t Stop Talking About This New Presale Gem Rollblock is setting a new standard in DeFi gaming with its innovative platform, poised for growth in Q4 and beyond. This rapidly rising project is earning its place as one of the most promising blockchain ventures in the current cycle in the high-potential and hype-based DeFi gaming space. Its expansive library of 7,000+ games includes casino favorites like poker and roulette, along with unique blockchain-based titles provided by leading players in the blockchain entertainment space. The platform’s forthcoming sports betting feature will elevate its appeal, capturing the interest of a wider audience. Rollblock’s revenue-sharing mechanism further enhances its investor appeal. Weekly profits are directed toward repurchasing RBLK tokens, with half being burned to limit supply and the other half allocated as staking rewards. This structure supports token stability and incentivizes long-term participation. The platform’s play-to-earn and hold-to-earn component further rewards active and engaged participants with tangible monetary rewards, fuelling investor interest. Solana Primed For Growth After Reaching A New All-Time High This Week In Q4, Solana has exceeded market expectations, surpassing the $250 milestone and strengthening its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Reaching a new all-time high at $263, Solana’s unprecedented recovery from bear market lows and the infamous FTX debacle perfectly showcases Solana’s resilience and immense investor appeal. As speculation grows, many believe Solana could reach a $300-400 price point in the coming months. New Bitcoin all-time highs could serve as a key catalyst to push Solana even further, including a projected imminent alt-coin season that will inevitably see Solana’s network activity rapidly grow. With the token now being a hair away from setting another all-time high, the momentum of the bull market is working strongly in Solana’s favor. Cardano Investors Are Proven Right In Q4 Following A Turbulent Year Cardano is now firmly rooted in the top ten as ADA hits $1 once again, boasting impressive 45% gains this week and a 200% rise in 30 days. Renewed retail interest and strong bullish momentum are driving Cardano’s rally, as investors flock to the familiar favorite from the last bull run in hopes of another parabolic surge. Increased attention on DeFi has positioned Cardano as a potential standout, with additional optimism fueled by Charles Hoskinson’s potential advisory role in Trump’s new administration and Cardano’s integration with Bitcoin via the BOS Grail bridge. Both of these factors could drive up Cardano’s growth going into 2025. Chainlink Cements Itself As A Utility Cornerstone Of The Blockchain Ecosystem Chainlink has recently experienced a rampant surge, and LINK is now trading at $15 after following a 30% rise this month. Chainlink’s ‘Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol’ (CCIP) has revolutionized cross-chain communication, attracting institutional interest and expanding Chainlink’s partnerships across major financial firms and DeFi protocols. As adoption grows, Chainlink’s role in powering decentralized finance and providing reliable smart contract data solidifies its long-term potential. With the rising demand for Chainlink’s one-of-a-kind oracle network technology, Chainlink is poised to thrive as a utility cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, despite the overall shift in market momentum towards hype-based assets like meme coins and iGaming gems such as Rollblock. Bullish Catalysts Could See Pepe Become A Top Two Meme This Cycle Rising through the ranks during the bear market, Pepe has become one of the most recognizable meme coins in crypto. Its recent 100% monthly surge can be attributed to undeniably bullish market conditions, along with new listings on platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, which have significantly increased its accessibility and appeal. Indicative of Pepe’s optimistic outlook, Pepe bulls recently transferred over $175 million worth of tokens into long-term storage units. This event triggered a supply squeeze, fueling a short-term rally and reinforcing bullish sentiment for Pepe ahead of a major meme rally. In addition, a whale recently acquired over 310 billion Pepe tokens, highlighting the ever-growing confidence in Pepe as a long-term investment opportunity for this cycle. Though Pepe may not match the parabolic potential of newer projects like Rollblock, analysts believe it remains an excellent choice for risk-averse investors seeking moderate returns in the 5-25x range, and bullish catalysts could see Pepe become a top two meme in this cycle. XRP Investors Finally Have Something To Be Excited In The Latter Stages Of 2024 XRP is unexpectedly making waves in the cryptocurrency space following an overall woeful 2024, where in multiple metrics pointed to XRP being the worst-performing crypto in the top ten. Breaching past the $1.1-1.15 resistance zone this week to reach $1.47, XRP’s 100% monthly rally is fueled by a mix of bullish market sentiment and pivotal developments. The rumored resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler has eased regulatory fears. Additionally, the resounding victory of pro-crypto president Donald Trump in the US election, coupled with XRP’s listing on Robinhood and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s assertion that a spot XRP ETF is “inevitable,” it’s clear that the XRP army finally have something to be excited about as Bitcoin nears $100,000 Rollblock May Be One Of The Best ROI Bets For The Bull Run Over Established Entities Many investors dive into the high-reward cryptocurrency space seeking parabolic returns. Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, Pepe, and XRP are all strong contenders for steady gains in this cycle in the 2-10x ballpark, though they all lack the explosive potential of Rollblock, a low market cap presale gem thriving in one of crypto’s most dynamic, high-potential sectors. Currently priced at $0.036 during its eighth presale stage and boasting over 20,000+ registrants already, Rollblock is on the brink of substantial growth. With an expected altcoin rally on the horizon, Rollblock could offer strong returns as soon as December and 2025’s Q1. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

The country's central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, is reportedly preparing a new draft law for crypto regulation, which is currently under review. Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of the central bank, confirmed that this draft law is in the process of being adopted, signaling a major shift in the country's stance on digital currencies. The proposed law is part of Morocco’s effort to regulate cryptocurrencies more effectively, acknowledging the growing interest in digital assets despite the initial ban. Morocco's ban on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies in 2017 failed to prevent the widespread use of digital assets among its population. The shift toward legalization comes as global interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is increasing, with Bitcoin recently nearing its historic milestone of $100,000, further fueling the global crypto conversation. In addition to legalizing cryptocurrencies, Morocco is also exploring the possibility of launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC) . Jouahri mentioned that the central bank is examining how a CBDC might help with public policy goals, particularly in promoting financial inclusion . Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, CBDCs would be issued and controlled by central financial authorities, operating on permissioned blockchain networks. The move to regulate crypto assets in Morocco reflects a broader global trend towards clearer regulations in the digital finance space. Many countries are looking to establish their own frameworks, drawing inspiration from the European Union's upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) , which is expected to take effect by the end of 2024. Morocco’s interest in updating its crypto policies is part of a worldwide push to regulate digital assets more effectively. The global rise in crypto adoption is also reflected in other countries’ actions. For example, in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced its roadmap to regulate cryptocurrencies by 2026. This comes after reports showing that more than 12% of UK adults now own some form of cryptocurrency. As more countries like Morocco join the movement towards legalizing and regulating digital assets, it signals a shift in the global financial landscape towards greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Morocco’s central bank’s move to prepare new crypto regulations aligns with the worldwide trend of developing more comprehensive frameworks for digital assets. The new regulations would likely provide clearer guidelines for investors and businesses operating in the crypto space, helping to protect users and foster greater trust in the market. In conclusion, Morocco’s steps toward legalizing cryptocurrencies and exploring the creation of a central bank digital currency highlight the growing recognition of digital assets' potential role in modern economies. With countries like Morocco, the UK, and others taking active steps towards crypto regulation , the landscape of digital finance is rapidly evolving. These changes indicate a shift towards a more structured and secure environment for cryptocurrencies, with more countries likely to follow suit as the global interest in digital finance continues to grow.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/morocco-moves-to-legalize-cryptocurrencies-and-explore-digital-currency,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36871521.jpeg

In today's latest bitcoin price news , Bitcoin has experienced a volatile week, with its price correcting after reaching an all-time high of $99,800 on Nov. 22. The premier crypto asset had aimed for the historic $100,000 price level , surpassing crucial resistance levels to claim $99,800 on Friday.However, the asset recorded a pullback from this level, breaching several support levels to reach the current value of $92,559. This marked a decline of over 7% from the $99,800 all-time high. A previous report from The Crypto Basic confirmed that analysts attribute the recent price collapse to profit-taking activities by both long-term and short-term holders. Nonetheless, despite this pullback, market data provided by Sosovalue reveals positive trends in Bitcoin exchange traded Funds (ETFs). In addition, whale activity has been rather positive, suggesting sustained bullish momentum. Bitcoin ETF Products See Record Inflows On Nov. 22, the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market recorded $490.35 million in net inflows, pushing cumulative total inflows to a record $30.84 billion, according to data from Sosovalue. This milestone shows strong investor interest in Bitcoin, even as the asset’s price corrected from the $99,800 top. Bitcoin ETF Flows Sosovalue Bitcoin ETF Flows | Sosovalue However, by November 25, the market saw net outflows of $438.38 million—the highest since Nov. 4. This reduced the cumulative net inflows to $30.40 billion. Despite the decline, total inflows remained above the November 21 peak of $30.35 billion.Throughout last week, Bitcoin ETF products witnessed consecutive days of inflows, contributing to the recent all-time high in cumulative net inflows. These investment vehicles recorded an impressive $2.379 billion in net inflows last week. Whales and Sharks Remain Bullish Meanwhile, as Bitcoin's price retraced below $95,000, whales and sharks displayed unwavering confidence. According to Santiment, wallets holding at least 10 BTC accumulated an additional 63,922 coins in November alone, worth around $6.06 billion. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1861152412863795352This behavior indicates optimism among large holders, who view the recent price correction as a buying opportunity. Analysts believe this sustained accumulation could support a bullish trend and suggest any further declines may be short-lived. Declining Exchange ReservesFurther, CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin exchange reserves are steadily declining, signaling a reduction in selling pressure. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve CryptoQuant Analysts point out that this trend resembles the market behavior from March to November 2020. During that period, Bitcoin exchange reserves fell, paving the way for significant price increases in December 2020. Current market conditions suggest a similar pattern, with some late entrants using the pullback to accumulate Bitcoin. This trend supports the idea that the current correction may precede another upward price surge. Interestingly, The Crypto Basic confirmed today that CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes the ongoing bull run remains intact despite the recent market pullback.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and cryptocurrencies emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ""Trump trade"" that gripped markets following the former President's election win. The world's largest crypto continues to flirt with the $100K level amid expectations that the incoming Trump administration will take a notably favorable stance toward the digital token. “However, as often it has been the case in the past, euphoria in the crypto market has spilled over to other sectors of the equity markets that are generally perceived to be darlings of the retail investors community,” Barclays stated in an investor note on Tuesday. Since the November 5 election, bitcoin has popped up from the $67.8K region to Tuesday’s $92.5K area, marking a near 37% advancement. It should be noted that bitcoin did top out at $99.8K on Friday but has since slid roughly 7.5% down to the current $92.5K region. Additionally, for investors looking to further track the price of bitcoin, they can look towards some of Wall Street’s bitcoin backed exchange-traded funds as an option: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

Bears have taken over proceedings in the crypto market over the last few days, driving Bitcoin’s price lower. The premier asset has faced massive selling pressure, capitulating over 6% in the past 24 hours to trade below $93,000.Amidst the downtrend, market veteran Peter Brandt has mentioned a few indicators that would signal that Bitcoin’s cycle top is near.Brandt Gives Indicators of Bitcoin’s TopIn a Monday tweet , the veteran analyst recalled the events that hinted at Bitcoin’s peak in the last two cycles. He then insinuated caution as the crypto market shows signs of saturation.Brandt mentioned that he accurately predicted Bitcoin’s 2017 cycle top but faced intense criticism. He shared a tweet dated December 21, 2017, where he made the assertion to confirm his claims.https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1861077993143025680The analyst, who started trading in the 1970s, stated that CNBC stalled his invitation after he revealed he was going to mention that Bitcoin had peaked for the cycle. In his place, the news outlet aired another guest who asserted more upsides for the asset, precisely $50,000.Notably, Bradt disclosed that he accurately predicted the top by observing the growing Bitcoin media coverage. According to him, he knew Bitcoin had peaked due to its heightened appearance on news headlines and magazine covers.Furthermore, Brandt insisted that the incessant use of laser eyes among crypto enthusiasts marked the cycle peak in 2021. Notably, the laser eyes symbol saturated crypto Twitter (now X), as proponents used it to connote Bitcoin’s bullishness.With Brandt’s analysis, he implied that increased Bitcoin media presence and bullish expectations from influencers precede the asset’s cycle peak.Brandt Hints Bitcoin Have Not Peaked YetMeanwhile, Brandt has hinted that Bitcoin would surge past the $100,000 level to new price discoveries. He teased the idea in an earlier Monday tweet , which he termed conventional wisdom.The market veteran argued that he always bets against conventional wisdom, which is stereotypically wrong. He described the idea as a general consensus among market participants, insisting a converse scenario always plays out.Brandt gave an example of this belief, citing market sentiments that Bitcoin will peak at $100,000. Then, he said he would bet that the pioneering asset would see higher prices.It bears mentioning that Brandt had earlier speculated that Bitcoin would peak at $150,000 . However, he later mentioned an indicator that could spur Bitcoin to $240,000 .In the meantime, Bitcoin trades at $92,457, with a market cap of $1.8 trillion.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/26/market-veteran-brandt-shares-indicators-to-identify-bitcoin-top/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-veteran-brandt-shares-indicators-to-identify-bitcoin-top,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Sun recently made headlines after spending $6.2 million at a Sotheby’s auction for a banana duct-taped to a wall. The Tron founder announced the news in a post on X, stating, “We are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial as its largest investor. The US is becoming a blockchain and Bitcoin hub and owes it to Donald Trump. Tron is committed to making America great again and leading innovation.” Trump and his sons are promoting World Liberty Financial as part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement. The President-elect is listed as the project’s chief crypto advocate, with his sons, Eric Donald Jr. and Barron Trump, named its Web3 ambassadors. The project aimed to raise $300 million at launch at a $1.5 billion valuation. However, the company disclosed its $300 million offering was marketed offshore. Sun’s investment is the largest so far and comes from on-shore. The project thanked Sun for his investment, stating, “We’re honored to have the support of @justinsuntron and @trondao. Together we’re driving innovation, aligning on a vision for a stronger blockchain future, and contributing to the growing ecosystem.” Currently, only accredited investors in the US can access the platform. According to Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, accredited investors must have a net worth of $1 million or an annual income of $200,000 individually or $300,000 with a spouse. While US access is limited, the project is open to all non-US individuals. However, the project intends to expand access to all Americans soon. “We envision a future in which all Americans can make use of this venue and have equal access to tools and opportunities.” Growing Investor Interest President-elect Donald Trump has licensed his name and promotional considerations to the venture through an LLC and does not assume liability. The LLC has received billions of tokens and the right to 75% of all revenues above a $30 million threshold. Before Sun’s investment in the project, $21 million worth of WLFI tokens were sold. Following the investment, $51 million worth of the token had been sold. Following the increase, sales crossed the $30 million threshold, triggering revenue distribution to Trump’s LLC. World Liberty Financial co-founder Zachary Folkman stated that over 100,000 individuals are on the whitelist to invest in the token. However, only 20,400 unique wallet addresses hold the token according to data from Etherscan, only 20% of the people registered. Folkman stated, “There have been several similarly significant purchases in recent weeks, and we are confident about future success and building out something that helps make finance freer and fairer. We expect more such developments to happen in the coming weeks and months.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

36871003,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-bull-market-drawdowns,1732630051,Bitcoin’s history of bull market drawdowns,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin’s wild price swings have beaten us all into submission. We naturally expect enormous corrections to crush hopes, dreams and wallet balances, even in the midst of monster bull runs. So, you’d be forgiven for expecting a sudden 50% collapse in the price of bitcoin on its way to six figures and beyond. Is it warranted? First, to be clear: bitcoin does have a habit of tanking by about 80% from bull run peak to bear market trough. It has happened every cycle going right back to its first major rally in 2011. But this column isn’t about bear market drawdowns (here’s our previous analysis on the topic). Instead, it’s about the corrections that happen specifically during bull markets, like the one we’re in right now. The charts below plot bitcoin’s price performance across six different timeframes, ranging from three days to three months, on a rolling basis, starting when the cycle starts (the trough) to an all-time high (the peak). Each line shows a different timeframe — the dark purple line shows the percentage difference between each daily low and the open three days earlier, for instance. Green does the same but over three months at a time. The dotted line at the bottom otherwise shows what a 50% drawdown would look like. As you can see, the bull run between August 2015 and December 2017 involved no drawdowns of that size. During that market cycle, the largest was a 40% retracement over two weeks toward the end back in September 2017. There were, however, three corrections of more than half during the following bull market between 2018 and 2021. One of those was the epic covid market crash in March 2020 — which roughly coincided with a series of “Black Mondays” for the stock market. BTC dove by half or more across every timeframe except three months, which only hit about 47%. The other big drawdowns occurred in May and July 2021, when bitcoin dove from a then-all-time-high of over $60,000 to $30,000. It would then climb back to almost $69,000 over the next four months. This time around has been much tamer, with the worst mid-bull correction coming in the first week of August. Bitcoin had fallen 30% across multiple timeframes, reaching a low of $49,200 from over $70,000 in June. All this isn’t to say that bitcoin has lost its volatility. I would still expect a rocky ride. What’s good to know, though, is that most brutal drawdowns have historically happened at the tail end of bull runs. So, the longer we go without one, the spookier it gets. All part of the fun.

Introduction of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Rumble, a video-sharing platform popular for its alternative stance to mainstream platforms, has announced a strategic shift in its corporate treasury. The company’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to diversify its cash reserves by allocating a portion to Bitcoin , signaling confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value proposition. The initial phase of this strategy will involve Bitcoin purchases of up to $20 million, as outlined in a public statement on Monday. CEO’s Perspective on Bitcoin Adoption Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s Chairman and CEO, emphasized the rationale behind the move, citing Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as an inflation hedge and its independence from government monetary policies. Pavlovski remarked, “We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption.” He further highlighted Bitcoin’s immunity to the dilution effects of excessive money printing, positioning it as a valuable addition to Rumble’s treasury portfolio. Aligning with Industry Trends Rumble’s decision aligns it with notable corporations that have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. MicroStrategy, a prominent advocate of Bitcoin, began accumulating the cryptocurrency in 2020 and has since seen its shares soar over 500% in 2024. Other major players, such as Tesla and Block, have also embraced Bitcoin for similar reasons. Smaller companies have joined the trend recently, including Semler Scientific and Acurx Pharmaceuticals, signaling a broader corporate interest in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Establishing and Strengthening Crypto Ties In addition to its treasury strategy, Pavlovski noted Rumble’s broader commitment to the crypto space, “We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.” The announcement also clarified that the execution of its Bitcoin purchase strategy will be flexible, depending on factors such as market conditions, Bitcoin’s price, and the company’s liquidity needs. Management retains the discretion to adjust, suspend, or terminate the strategy based on evolving circumstances. Context of Political and Market Dynamics Rumble’s move comes amid a favorable political and market environment for cryptocurrencies. The company has been linked to former President Donald Trump’s influence, given its conservative user base and its public debut through a SPAC led by Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary. With a pro-crypto administration incoming, Bitcoin-related corporate strategies are gaining traction, as evidenced by recent comments from MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor and discussions on establishing a U.S. Bitcoin reserve.

Pantoja shared this view in a tweet on Monday. He cited data confirming that influential crypto investors have added 50 million tokens to their holdings. Notably, these are investors who typically hold between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens.Whales Buying XRPThe accumulation occurred over the weekend, bringing their total XRP holdings to approximately 4.29 billion XRP, valued at around $6 billion. During the weekend, when they bought the 50 million XRP, its price ranged between $1.40 and $1.42. With XRP trading at $1.33 at press time, it implies these whales are currently seeing some unrealized loss from their latest acquisition.The accompanying Santiment chart from Ali Martinez illustrates how whale accumulation has mirrored XRP’s price movements during dips and pumps. While XRP's price is currently facing a downtrend, Pantoja stressed that the whales are positioning themselves for what’s next with XRP. According to him , “They definitely know something...”Meanwhile, some market commentators have dismissed the significance of the recent whale accumulation. Some have suggested that their actions are part of FOMO buying as XRP experiences an explosive price surge.XRP Price Action Following Previous Major Whale AccumulationMeanwhile, instances of a similar whale accumulation trend have dominated this month. In the second week of November, whales deployed $526 million to buy 453 million XRP tokens. This move elevated their holdings to the point where they controlled 18% of XRP’s supply, the highest concentration in two months. As a result, the price of XRP responded favorably.Specifically, in the week that followed, XRP’s price soared massively, breaking into the $1 price range . XRP hit $1.62 before the ongoing correction. Notably, proponents believe the current correction is merely a window of opportunity for those who missed the initial surge to accumulate XRP cheaply before the next wave of explosive price action.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/26/expert-says-xrp-whales-know-something-as-they-accumulate-50m-xrp-in-two-days/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-xrp-whales-know-something-as-they-accumulate-50m-xrp-in-two-days,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The initiative, aimed at catching up with global leaders in crypto regulation, will begin with consultations and discussion papers on key topics such as market abuse, stablecoins, staking, crypto lending, and trading platforms, starting in late 2024.This strategic move comes as the UK seeks to position itself as a competitive financial hub in the digital asset sector alongside global leaders like Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE, and the European Union.The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, set to take full effect by the end of 2024, have further highlighted the need for the UK to accelerate its efforts to remain globally relevant.The FCA’s regulatory priorities will focus on fiat-pegged stablecoins, staking services, custodial wallets, and related crypto services. The goal is to create a transparent framework that balances investor protection with fostering innovation. This approach is seen as essential for attracting digital asset businesses and maintaining the UK’s competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.Recent data shows crypto ownership in the UK has grown by 4% over the past two years, with approximately 7 million adults now holding digital assets. This increasing adoption has underscored the importance of clear regulations to safeguard consumers and encourage sustainable growth in the sector.The pro-crypto stance of Donald Trump’s administration in the US, which has hinted at policies like establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, has added urgency to the UK’s efforts.With global shifts toward crypto-friendly policies, the FCA is under pressure to develop a regulatory framework that keeps pace with international standards. The collaboration will play a central role in the FCA’s roadmap. The regulator has pledged to work closely with the government, industry players, international partners, and consumers to shape effective policies.Economic Secretary Tulip Sidiq, under the Keir Starmer government, has also committed to delivering draft crypto regulations, marking the administration’s first major step toward crypto policy reform.The FCA plans to release position papers on key issues by early 2025, with final policies expected by 2026.

APTOS: APT, INJECTIVE: INJ, OPTIMISM: OP","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp decline as its march to $100,000 faced a significant setback as the price slipped below $95,000. BTC is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours and trading at $94,351, with sellers in control. BTC dipped to a low of $92,868 before recovering to its current level. One analyst has warned of a significant correction that could take the price to the $80,000-$85,000 range unless the cryptocurrency went above the $100,000 resistance level. BTC’s recent price action has put a stop to its blistering post-election rally. Meanwhile, Ethereum rose sharply to cross $3,500, reaching as high as $3,545 before declining to its current level of $3,434. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up almost 2% over the past 24 hours as buyers look to reclaim the $3,500 level. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) registered a substantial decline, plummeting almost 6% to slip below $250. The crypto market cap is down by 2.80% and is currently at $3.25 trillion. What’s Keeping Bitcoin (BTC) Below $100,000? Bitcoin (BTC) has been unsuccessful in its attempts to go above $100,000 as its post-election rally hits a roadblock. BTC has witnessed an increase of over 40% since the November 5 election, which saw Donald Trump re-elected as president. While Trump’s election isn’t until January 20, 2025, it hasn’t stopped BTC and cryptocurrencies from surging, boosting sentiment within the crypto community. BTC hit a new all-time high on November 23, surging to $99,655. However, prices have declined since, and BTC has declined substantially, with the asset trading below $95,000 as sellers exert influence on the price action. But why has BTC’s stunning rally stalled, and what prevents a move past $100,000? Analysts point to several factors like investors taking profits and too much leverage. Andre Dragosch, the head of research for Europe and Bitwise said he believed BTC was being kept below $100,000 because investors were taking profits after the post-election rally. “Bitcoin has so far failed to breach $100,000 because long-term holders have started to distribute significant amounts of BTC into the recent rally.” Dragosch expects the rally to take a break in the short term as market sentiment remains elevated and positioning seems stretched. “However, this could be a bull market correction rather than a change in trend. Bitcoin valuations are still very far away from being excessive.” Meanwhile, Mark Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, said that while he expected BTC to cross $100,000, a pullback was expected. He also advised investors to buy straight Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin-exposed plays such as MicroStrategy which owns a significant chunk of BTC. He also added an unknown seller was dumping substantial quantities of BTC in the market, which could be pressurizing the asset price. “There has been a giant seller for the last week, between $92,000 to $94,000. Probably $14-$15 billion worth of BTC sold there.” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, believes $100,000 has become a high hurdle for further gains. “If Bitcoin starts to fade from here, that could be all we get, especially if longer-term holders decide to cash out early. Nevertheless, there is a strong probability that upside momentum can build up enough energy for a surge through here. If so, that could be the trigger for another push.” Bitcoin (BTC) Facing Significant Correction An analyst has warned that Bitcoin (BTC) faces a significant correction unless it surpasses the $100,000 price level. The trader flagged a bearish pattern in BTC’s 12-hour chart, anticipating the price to drop as low as $85,000. He added that BTC needs to close above $100,000 to invalidate the sell signal. Bitcoin (BTC) is on an unprecedented bull run, with its price surging to new all-time highs as it stands on the brink of going above $100,000. However, trading volume declined as BTC got closer to the landmark figure, indicating a cautious approach by investors. If BTC can break above the $100,000 mark, it could spark a renewed uptrend and fresh buying interest, pushing the price significantly higher. Donald Trump’s Crypto Portfolio Swells Donald Trump is set to become the first president to openly support the crypto ecosystem and the first president to hold cryptocurrency while in office. Trump’s crypto portfolio currently stands at $5.43 million, with a significant chunk of its value tied to Ethereum (ETH). According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Trump’s portfolio includes $1.7 million in ETH, $1.65 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH), and 579,289.81 TRUMP tokens, valued at $1 million. He also holds 210 billion TROG tokens, valued at $403,860. While Trump’s portfolio is significant, it was valued considerably higher at $14 million in June. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a substantial decline on Monday with many analysts predicting an impending correction if it fails to surpass $100,000. With BTC losing momentum at this crucial level, markets could see increased selling pressure in the short term should a correction take hold. The cryptocurrency is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours and is trading around the $94,700 mark after going below the crucial $95,000 level. The price chart shows a significant rally during the previous week, starting with an increase of 1.17% on Monday which saw BTC climb above $90,000 and settle at $90,059. BTC continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising by 2.15% and settling at $92,427. Wednesday’s increase of 1.89% allowed BTC to settle above $94,000 as buyers maintained control over the market. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rose almost 4% and settled at $97,784. Volatility increased on Friday as BTC neared the crucial $100,000 price level. BTC climbed to an all-time high of $99,317 but could not go higher and dropped to settle at $98,355. Source: TradingView With sellers active at $100,000, BTC fell back on Saturday, dropping by 1.26% and settling at $97,113. The price fell to an intraday low of $94,838 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. However, BTC recovered from this level to go back above $95,000 and settle at $97,891. BTC was back in the red on Monday as BTC faced a significant correction, with the price dropping over 5% and settling at $92,485. However, the price is back in positive territory during the current session, with the price up just over 2% and trading at $94,726. With momentum fading around the $100,000 level, analysts have flagged support levels between $92,000 and $95,000. More bearish forecasts have BTC dropping as low as $80,000-$85,000. However, if BTC breaks above $100,000, it could revive buying interest, reignite its bullish trajectory, and invalidate bearish predictions of an impending price correction. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a substantial jump on Monday despite facing considerable volatility, rising to an intraday high of $3,547 before declining to its current levels. The jump saw ETH gain almost 6%, a significant rebound after breaking out of its eight-month descending channel. ETH’s recent price action sees it up nearly 10% over the past week and a staggering 39% over the past month, as buyers look to consolidate above the crucial $3,500 mark and work towards $4,000 and a new all-time high. Some analysts are confident ETH could cross $4,800 during the ongoing bull run. ETH started the previous week on a positive note with an increase of 4.37%. However, it fell back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 3% to $3,109. Bearish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as ETH fell by 1.25% after a failed recovery and settled at $3,070. With strong support at $3,000, ETH rallied on Thursday, surging by 9.44% and settling at $3,360. Despite Thursday’s rally, ETH encountered considerable volatility on Friday and fell back into the red, dropping by 0.96% to $3,328. Buyers returned on Saturday as ETH surged to an intraday high of $3,502 before losing momentum and dropping back to $3,396. However, the price was back in the red on Sunday, falling to an intraday low of $3,288 before recovering to settle at $3,362, a drop of just over 1%. Source: TradingView Monday saw volatility return as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,547, and fell to an intraday low of $3,415 before settling at $3,415, breaking past the resistance at $3,400 and settling at $3,415. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers look to take control. The RSI and MACD indicate bullish sentiment. However, if sellers drive ETH back below $3,400, we could see a drop to $3,000. On the other hand, a break above $3,500 could see ETH surge to $4000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) witnessed a substantial decline this week as sellers drove it below $250, reversing the bullish sentiment. SOL was relatively muted for most of last week, starting Monday with an increase of 1.04% and settling at $239. However, it fell back in the red on Tuesday, dropping by 0.89% to $237. The price continued to drop on Wednesday and settled at $253 after a drop of 0.87%. SOL recovered on Thursday, rising almost 9% to surge past $250 and settle at $256. However, buyers lost momentum thanks to selling pressure at $260 and could register only a marginal increase on Friday. Source: TradingView The weekend saw bearish sentiment return as SOL dropped after a failed attempt to go past $260, falling by 0.78% and settling at $254. Sellers retained control on Sunday, driving the price to an intraday low of $241. However, SOL recovered from this level to climb above $250 and settle at $252. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL plummeted 7%, slipping below $250 and settling at $234. The current session sees SOL marginally up as buyers attempt a recovery. If sellers regain control, SOL could continue to drop until $220, where the 20-day SMA could act as a support level and prevent a further decline. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a substantial jump towards the end of the previous week, going past crucial resistance levels as buyers attempted to drive the price towards $20. After surging to an intraday high of $16.01 last Monday, LINK fell back on Tuesday, dropping to $14.63 after registering a decline of 4.24%. Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as LINK rose to $15.33 before losing momentum and allowing sellers to retake control. As a result, LINK dropped almost 3% and settled at $14.23. The price recovered on Thursday despite considerable volatility, rising by 4.74% and settling at $14.91. Bullish sentiment intensified on Friday as LINK rallied by 11.13% to move past the resistance at $16 and settled at $16.57. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment persisted over the weekend as LINK rallied to an intraday high of $18.39 on Saturday. However, buyers lost momentum at this level, and LINK fell back to settle at $17.39, registering an increase of almost 5%. Selling pressure increased substantially on Sunday as LINK fell to an intraday low of $16.15. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 2.96% and settled at $17.90. Buyers attempted to build on Sunday’s bullish momentum as LINK surged to an intraday high of $19.05. However, LINK lost momentum at this level, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, LINK fell over 3% and settled at $17.34. LINK has continued to drop during the current session, with the price down almost 3% and trading near the $16.88 price level. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) is oscillating between $11 and $14 as it struggles to build momentum after a stirring rally on November 11, surging almost 26%. However, it has seen significant volatility as sellers look to drive it below support levels and buyers struggle to build momentum. APT started the previous week positively, rising over 2%. However, it fell back on Tuesday, dropping by 1.90% to $11.81. Aptos experienced significant volatility on Wednesday, rising to an intraday high of $13.45 and dropping to an intraday low of $11.12 before settling at $11.79, registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Sellers attempted to drag APT lower on Thursday as it fell to a low of $11.23. However, buyers countered the selling pressure, allowing APT to recover. As a result, APT registered an increase of 2.40% and settled at $12.07. Buyers retained control on Thursday as APT rose by 3.55% and settled at 12.50%. The weekend was mixed as APT rose to an intraday high of $13.24 on Saturday before settling at $12.75. Volatility returned on Sunday as buyers attempted a move past $13, with APT rising to $13.35. However, buyers lost momentum, and sellers took over, driving the price to an intraday low of $11.57. With the 20-day SMA acting as a dynamic level of support, APT recovered and ultimately settled at $12.54. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as APT dropped almost 6%, slipping below $12 and settling at $11.82. The current session sees sellers retain control, with APT trading at $11.61, having gone below the 20-day SMA. Injective (INJ) Price Analysis Injective (INJ) has seen a substantial rally since the end of last week. INJ turned bearish last Tuesday as sellers drove the price down by 4.99%. Selling pressure persisted on Wednesday as INJ dropped almost 5% to $23.24. However, it made a strong recovery on Thursday, rebounding from a low of $22.47 to register an increase of 7.75% and settle at $25.04. Sellers made another attempt to drive INJ lower on Friday as it dropped to $23.97, but buyers mounted a recovery, and the price rose by just over 6% and settled at $26.57. Source: TradingView The weekend saw INJ surge past the resistance at $27 on Saturday, rising to an intraday high of $29.44 before settling at $27.83. Sellers drove INJ to a low of $25.57 on Sunday. INJ recovered from this level to register an increase of just over 2% and settle at $28.42. The current week began with sellers back in control, with the price dropping over 5% and settling at $26.90. INJ recovered during the current session and is up by 2.32%, trading at $27.55. Optimism (OP) Price Analysis Optimism (OP) dropped to a low of $1.64 after declining almost 7% on Wednesday. Despite the selling pressure, OP rallied on Thursday, surging past the 200-day SMA and $2 to an intraday high of $2.21 before settling at $2.08. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday despite considerable volatility, and INJ rose by almost 6% to settle at $2.20. Volatility persisted over the weekend as INJ rose to an intraday high of $2.33. However, buyers lost momentum, and INJ fell back, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2.20. OP fell to an intraday low of $2.04 and rose to an intraday high of $2.34. However, buyers failed to maintain momentum, and INJ fell back, registering another marginal decline. Source: TradingView The current week began with buyers returning to the market as OP rose by 4.59% and settled at $2.30.

36873941,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/yeagerai-launches-real-time-data-oracle-powered-by-genlayer-blockchain,1732628301,YeagerAI Launches Real-Time Data Oracle Powered by GenLayer Blockchain,"Artificial intelligence research lab YeagerAI launches Intelligent Oracle to provide real-time data access to decentralized applications (DApps). YeagerAI , the AI research lab behind the GenLayer blockchain, announced the launch of the Intelligent Oracle, a platform that will revolutionize how DApps collect off-chain and on-chain data. The Oracle is an advanced AI-powered oracle that delivers decentralized data on-chain, allowing DApps to leverage the data for various use cases. It is designed to support a new generation of DApps, fetching any type of online data and delivering it fully on-chain. Built on the GenLayer blockchain, the Intelligent Oracle is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), integrated directly into GenLayer’s Optimistic Democracy consensus mechanism. The Optimistic Democracy mechanism offers dynamism for the oracle, integrating AI to reach agreements on subjective tasks. The Intelligent Oracle will initially launch on a permissioned local network, with the GenLayer Testnet expected by the end of 2024. Building The Next-Gen Oracle For Futuristic DApps YeagerAI is a development firm that focuses on AI and machine learning to build advanced technologies with a focus on sovereignty, transparency, and decentralization. The research lab aims to provide blockchain developers with open-source tools and protocols that enhance human-AI interactions such as the GenLayer blockchain. The blockchain enables developers to create decentralized applications that can natively search the web, make complex decisions, and process natural language instructions. The launch of Intelligent Oracle is set to revolutionize on-chain and off-chain data collection across DApps, providing the applications with real-world live data feeds. Current blockchain oracles heavily depend on on-chain data only, which limits several applications from running smoothly. In addition, traditional oracles face a challenge in providing large sets of data away from the pre-defined datasets or, at times, require manual intervention, which makes them slow, costly, and inflexible. Established and emerging use cases require immediate, accurate, and sometimes subjective data from the Internet. This is what the Intelligent Oracle is aiming to solve, offering an autonomous solution and placing a virtually unlimited range of data types in the hands of dApp builders. To ensure the data collected is secure, decentralized and verified, the Oracle includes validators who connect to LLMs, enabling the network to process non-deterministic transactions by fetching data from the Internet. When a query is made, a lead validator generates a proposed result, while other validators independently verify this output against the pre-set equivalence criteria. Optimistic Democracy ensures all decisions are accurate, reliable, and secure. A Breakthrough For DApps’ Use Cases According to the team statement, Intelligent Oracle is a first-of-its-kind product based on AI-based Intelligent Contracts built on the GenLayer blockchain. The Oracle operates seamlessly within the GenLayer blockchain, delivering decentralized, transparent data access while supporting cross-chain compatibility. Following the launch, DApp developers can now design and create futuristic applications that wouldn’t be possible with traditional oracles. DApps that offer use cases such as prediction markets, insurance, and financial derivatives will have more secure large data sets, improving their overall efficiency. Notwithstanding, the Oracle also enables cost-effective and fast data resolution. While traditional oracles can take days to resolve prediction markets—incurring significant delays and costs—the Intelligent Oracle achieves transaction finality in less than an hour at a cost of under $1 per market. YeagerAI has already welcomed several partners and platforms to test and integrate the Intelligent Oracle. Some of the early partners who have committed to building with the technology include Radix DLT, Etherisc, PredX, Delphi Bets, and Provably. The move towards an AI-based oracle, removing human-driven resolution systems and providing a cross-chain platform is expected to provide users with a more scalable, efficient and future-proof solution for data collection. Additionally, the cross-chain compatibility will also enable DApp developers to integrate it seamlessly with multiple blockchain ecosystems.

This comes after an impressive surge from $67,500 on November 5, marking a nearly 50% climb in just a few weeks. The price action has largely been “only up,” attracting significant attention from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance However, the current pullback highlights growing caution in the market. Market caution said leverage levels remain elevated despite recent deleveraging efforts. Adler’s analysis reveals that increasing short positions and consolidation below the psychological $100,000 mark have contributed to the retracement. While Bitcoin’s performance remains strong in the broader context, this dip signals a potential shift in market sentiment. The question is whether BTC can gather enough momentum to break past the $100,000 barrier or if further consolidation is on the horizon. Many investors consider this pullback a healthy pause in a bullish cycle, but the high leverage levels suggest continued volatility. All eyes are on Bitcoin as it navigates this critical phase, with the next few days likely to determine its short-term direction. Bitcoin Bears Showing Up After three weeks of minimal resistance from bears, signs of their resurgence emerge as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $100,000 level. This critical price point, which many believed would act as a springboard for further gains, has instead highlighted growing bearish sentiment. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the recent price action marks a potential shift in momentum. Adler’s analysis on X reveals that despite a wave of recent deleveraging, leverage levels in the market remain elevated. Many key long positions were established around the $93,000 mark, providing bears with an opportunity to profit as BTC failed to push higher. This level has now become a battleground, with Bitcoin’s inability to sustain upward momentum signaling the possibility of further downside risk. Bitcoin’s price hovers around this key level, raising the likelihood of a correction toward $88,500 or prolonged sideways consolidation below $100,000. Such a scenario would impact Bitcoin and set the tone for altcoin performance in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? The next two weeks will be pivotal as market participants closely watch Bitcoin’s price action. A decisive move, whether up or down, will shape the broader cryptocurrency landscape and determine whether this is merely a pause in a larger rally or the start of a deeper correction. BTC Testing Fresh Demand Bitcoin is trading at $93,500 as bears regained control after it hit an all-time high last Friday. This retracement marks a shift in momentum, but bulls still can reclaim dominance if the price remains strong above the critical $92,000 support level. Holding this level would keep Bitcoin’s price action structurally bullish and signal resilience in the face of increased selling pressure. If Bitcoin sustains strength above $92,000, the outlook for the short term remains optimistic, with the potential for another attempt at breaking key resistance levels. However, a drop below this mark would signal short-term weakness, potentially triggering further declines. The next critical level to watch would be around $84,000, where the 4-hour 200 EMA aligns as a support zone. This level represents a major line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below it could accelerate bearish momentum, extending the correction and dampening market sentiment. On the other hand, holding above $92,000 would reinforce bullish confidence, setting the stage for a recovery and a potential pushback toward previous highs.

Ethereum's resurgence as the leading blockchain for stablecoins is indicative of its growing institutional adoption and DeFi leadership, while Sun's $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial suggests a convergence of blockchain, politics, and innovation. Justin Sun Invests $30M in World Liberty Financial Amid Trump’s Crypto Surge Justin Sun , founder of the Tron blockchain, announced his firm’s acquisition of $30 million worth of World Liberty Financial (WLFI) tokens. This strategic investment aligns with the resurgence of crypto markets following Donald Trump’s re-election as US president earlier this month. ”We are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial as its largest investor,” Sun wrote on X. ”The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and bitcoin owes it to Donald Trump. Tron is committed to making America great again and leading innovation.” World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project closely tied to the Trump brand, with its stated mission to make financial systems ”freer and fairer.” Despite its high-profile backers, the project faced a muted launch, with concerns about its tokenomics casting a shadow over its initial reception. According to its ”gold paper,” DT Marks DEFI LLC—a Trump family-linked entity—stands to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues and a tranche of WLFI tokens valued at $337.5 million at the token sale price. This significant allocation has raised questions about the project's decentralization and investor appeal. Sun’s statement that ”bitcoin owes it to Trump” references the remarkable rally in BTC prices following Trump's re-election. In the weeks leading up to the election, Trump adopted a crypto-friendly stance, declaring his intent to support blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency adoption as part of his economic agenda. Since his victory on Nov. 5, bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have experienced a significant uptick, with market analysts attributing much of the surge to renewed optimism about regulatory clarity and institutional adoption in the United States. Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm for Sun’s substantial investment, framing it as a vote of confidence in the project’s potential. “We’re excited about the momentum experienced by World Liberty Financial, and this sizable purchase of WLFI tokens underscores the early success of this project,” Folkman said in a statement. ”Indeed, there have been a number of similarly significant purchases in recent weeks, and we are confident about future success and building out something that helps to make finance freer and fairer. We expect more such developments to happen in the coming weeks and months.” Folkman’s optimism suggests that Sun’s involvement could serve as a catalyst for further institutional interest in WLFI tokens, potentially turning around the project’s underwhelming launch performance. Justin Sun’s Expanding Influence The investment in World Liberty Financial is the latest in a string of high-profile moves by Sun, who has become known for his headline-grabbing initiatives. Just last month, Sun was elected prime minister of Liberland, a self-declared micronation located between Croatia and Serbia. Under Sun’s leadership, Liberland has adopted bitcoin as its official currency and positioned itself as a hub for blockchain-based governance and innovation. The cryptocurrency market has reacted positively to Sun’s announcement, with WLFI tokens showing a modest recovery after the news broke. Market watchers are keen to see whether this development will lead to increased adoption of World Liberty Financial’s ecosystem or if skepticism about its token distribution model will continue to weigh on its long-term viability. Moreover, Trump’s return to the White House has rekindled hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the US. With Sun’s support and Trump’s renewed focus on blockchain, World Liberty Financial could find itself uniquely positioned to capitalize on the convergence of political backing and technological innovation. Justin Sun’s $30 million bet on World Liberty Financial signals a high-stakes gamble on the intersection of crypto, politics, and innovation. As WLFI tokens gain traction and the US solidifies its role as a blockchain hub under Trump’s leadership, Sun’s move could prove prescient—or highlight the risks of tying blockchain projects too closely to polarizing figures. Whether World Liberty Financial can overcome its rocky start to become a transformative force in the DeFi space remains to be seen. For now, Sun and Trump are doubling down on their shared vision of making blockchain a central pillar of the financial future. Ethereum Reclaims Stablecoin Crown as USDT Supply Surpasses Tron Ethereum has once again emerged as the dominant blockchain for Tether (USDT) supply. This marks the first time since June 2022 that more USDT is hosted on Ethereum than on Tron. Currently, 66.936 billion USDT tokens circulate on Ethereum, compared to 61.77 billion on Tron. The shift places the spotlight on a notable year-to-date trend: USDT supply on Ethereum has surged nearly 62%, compared to a more modest 24.4% increase on Tron. The ”flippening” follows a surge in USDT minting activity over the past week, which coincides with a broader bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. The catalyst for this dramatic increase in Ethereum-hosted USDT supply appears to be a mix of bullish market conditions and renewed investor enthusiasm. Bitcoin’s recent breakthrough of its all-time high has reignited interest from both retail and institutional players, creating fertile ground for stablecoins like USDT, which underpin trading liquidity across the crypto ecosystem. The momentum has been further amplified by growing anticipation of US regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Industry observers view spot ETFs as a pivotal development, unlocking institutional capital for the crypto market. With trading volumes poised to surge, the demand for stablecoins such as USDT, often used as a gateway for capital flows, has followed suit. Stablecoins like USDT play a critical role in Ethereum’s DeFi infrastructure, serving as the primary medium of exchange for lending, borrowing, and trading. The network’s vast liquidity pools and integration with major financial platforms make it the preferred choice for many institutional users, reinforcing its status as a stablecoin hub. Tron’s Utility Remains Resilient While Ethereum celebrates its return to dominance, Tron’s utility-focused model continues to carve a critical niche. Known for its low transaction fees and rapid processing times, Tron remains the blockchain of choice for high-volume, low-cost transactions. This is particularly true in remittance-heavy regions, where stablecoins like USDT are often used to transfer funds quickly and efficiently across borders. Tron’s role as a transactional workhorse ensures its continued relevance in the stablecoin ecosystem. However, its focus on efficiency over innovation in areas like DeFi may limit its ability to compete with Ethereum’s multifaceted appeal to institutional players. The flippening of USDT supply between Ethereum and Tron suggests a broader narrative of maturation and specialization within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum’s ability to attract institutional players and maintain its dominance in DeFi positions it as a long-term leader in stablecoin issuance. Meanwhile, Tron’s efficiency-driven approach ensures it will continue to serve a vital role in facilitating cost-effective transactions. As market conditions evolve, the interplay between these two blockchains will likely shape the future of stablecoin infrastructure. For now, Ethereum’s reclaimed crown is a strong indication of its adaptability and appeal in a rapidly changing landscape, bolstered by renewed optimism in the broader cryptocurrency market.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6253/justin-sun-invests-30-m-in-trump-backed-crypto-project,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

BTC has pared weekly gains from over 10% to just less than 1% amid profit-taking on the expected pullback. Major tokens have followed the tumble, with Solana’s SOL, BNB, Cardano’s ADA and DOGE falling as much as 7% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the biggest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, is down nearly 3%. Analysts view a correction of as much as 10% from the peak as perfectly natural while maintaining a short-term target of $100,000 per BTC.  Some indicators point to an ongoing correction in BTC's price, sending it as low as $90,000. Among them is the 25-delta risk reversal. This measures the volatility premium of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls, used to bet on price rallies, relative to OTM put options, which offer downside protection. On Deribit, calls expiring this Friday now trade at a cheaper valuation to puts, resulting in a negative risk reversal, according to data source Amberdata. The first negative reading in at least a month indicates a bias for protective puts. Perhaps sophisticated traders are prepping for an extension of Monday's price slide. On Monday, traders sold call spreads and bought put options tied to BTC on the over-the-counter liquidity network Paradigm.  After a prolonged downtrend relative to bitcoin, ether is showing signs of a resurgence. ETH climbed to over $3,500 for the first time since June on Monday, while BTC was falling from its recent highs. Ether has since been caught by the wider market correction, trading 5% lower in the last 24 hours while still outperforming the broader market, which has lost over 8%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). Investors have started to rotate capital to smaller, riskier cryptocurrencies over the weekend following the stall of bitcoin's near-vertical surge since Donald Trump's election victory. The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures ether's strength vs. bitcoin, plummeted to as low as 0.0318 on Thursday, its weakest reading since March 2021, but the gauge has gained 15% since to 0.3660 at press time.  Chart of the Day  Leverage is a double-edged sword, magnifying both profits and losses … and how.

36869182,https://blockworks.co/news/1inch-fixing-cross-chain-swaps,1732626000,1inch to fix cross-chain swaps with the full release of Fusion+,"Cross-chain interoperability has always been the weak link for the DeFi ecosystem due to the cumbersome and risky nature of such transactions. Since blockchains do not directly interact with each other, moving assets from one network to another traditionally involves cross-chain bridges, which expose users to heightened security risks. Decentralized options, while more secure, often lack user-friendliness, discouraging broader adoption. DeFi protocol 1inch brings an innovative approach with the full release of Fusion+ to eliminate the cross-chain bridges altogether, bringing simplicity and security to cross-chain swaps. Fusion+, now available in the 1inch decentralized application (dApp) and 1inch Wallet, integrates liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem. A new chapter in blockchain interoperability The solution ensures secure, operator-free swaps between multiple blockchains using atomic swap technology, cryptographic protections, and a novel Dutch auction mechanism for optimal rates. Integrating liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem, Fusion+ has the potential to establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability. Since its beta launch in September , Fusion+ has already processed millions of dollars in trading volume, demonstrating its efficiency and transformative potential. This system, designed by 1inch, offers a number of standout features: Security by design : Fusion+ employs atomic swaps and integrates Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) protection, ensuring trades are fully completed or safely reverted. This eliminates common issues like partial fills or failed trades. Seamless user experience : Users simply select the tokens and chains they wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until completion—no complex configurations are required. Optimal rates : By leveraging Dutch auctions and competitive 1inch resolvers, Fusion+ secures the best rates for users. Trustless transactions : Utilizing cryptographic hashlocks and timelocks, the system ensures trustless, decentralized swaps without reliance on third parties. How Fusion+ works Fusion+ builds on 1inch’s intent-based framework and atomic swap technology introduced in late 2022. The process involves three steps: Initiating the swap: Users set their desired minimum return, initiating a Dutch auction. Resolvers bid by lowering their fees until the order is accepted. Escrow and locking: Funds are deposited into escrow contracts on both the source and destination blockchains. Cryptographic secrets and timelocks secure the process. Completing the swap: Once conditions are met, cryptographic secrets unlock the user’s tokens on the destination chain, finalizing the transaction. If the swap isn’t completed within the designated time, funds are returned to their original owners. Fusion+ arrives at a critical juncture for DeFi, where growth has been virtually halted by inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. By eliminating reliance on bridges, the technology reduces risks associated with hacks and exploits, which have plagued the sector in recent years. Additionally, the streamlined user experience promises to attract a broader audience to DeFi, from retail investors to institutional participants. Users can immediately access Fusion+ through the 1inch dApp and Wallet without any additional setup. You only need to select the tokens and networks you wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until it’s completed. More information can be found on 1inch.io .

Since then, our experience has been outstanding, with consistent support from the Request Finance team, always attentive to our needs and inquiries."" Daniel Lustig, Head of Operations and BI at Ocean Protocol, added: ""Since the Request team introduced crypto-to-fiat payments, our workflow has become incredibly streamlined. The new solution has enabled us to handle both crypto and fiat transactions seamlessly, allowing us to focus more on our core business without worrying about complex conversions and payment tracking. It's been a game-changer for our team, providing a new level of transparency we've been looking for. Needless to say that our auditors love it, too."" Krisztin Lipárdi, COO at Galaxis.xyz, wanted to highlight the ongoing payment revolution: ""Request Finance has honestly changed the way how I at Galaxis handle payments.

Bitcoin Loses $130B in Market Cap After Endorsement,"Bitcoin has taken a tumble since TV host Jim Cramer endorsed the premier crypto asset, with the crypto community implying the ""inverse Cramer"" effect is in play. Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was on a bullish course to $100,000 last week. Notable analysts speculated the milestone was closer than ever, setting clear timelines for the price attainment.However, the crypto community bemoaned a November 22 event in which a notable Bitcoin skeptic endorsed the asset. On the day's Lightning Round, CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer applauded Bitcoin, calling it ""a winner.""Since then, the asset has suffered a significant downtrend, losing over $130 billion in market cap in a few days. Notably, the crypto community's skepticisms about Cramer's Bitcoin endorsement seem to be coming to fruition.Bitcoin Sheds Over 5% After Cramer's CommentsOn the day Cramer called Bitcoin a winner, the leading cryptocurrency traded near $99,000 with a market cap of $1.96 trillion. Following his positive remarks, the crypto community reacted skeptically in a humorous fashion, with analyst Ali Martinez noting it was a strong sign the asset was up for correction.Again, the "" inverse Cramer "" effect played out quickly, as Bitcoin has since nosedived to the current market price of $92,540. The crypto firstborn has lost 5% of its market valuation since then, with its cap dropping to $1.83 trillion.Meanwhile, the converse Cramer predictions continue. The TV host has a reputation for making blunt speculations in the past. Cramer's largely inaccurate predictions spurred the creation of an exchange-traded fund to trade the opposite of his calls.Crypto Liquidation Surpasses $600 MillionNotably, the rapid Bitcoin downtrend has sparked massive leveraged trading liquidation in the past 24 hours. Data from Coinglass shows that the market capitulation has liquidated $603.24 million in the past day.As expected, Bitcoin traders suffered the largest liquidation, losing $164.23 million to the market downtrend. About $136.9 million of the liquidated positions were long traders, while $27.33 million were late short traders.Ethereum and Dogecoin positions also saw substantial liquidations. The data shows that $91 million and $38.22 million worth of leveraged bets on these assets left the crypto market in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, a whale lost $4.76 million betting on higher Bitcoin prices on Binance, the highest single liquidation in the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/26/inverse-cramer-effect-bitcoin-loses-130b-in-market-cap-after-endorsement/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=inverse-cramer-effect-bitcoin-loses-130b-in-market-cap-after-endorsement,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Stellar’s XLM has captured significant market attention, displaying sharp price movements over recent days. As of now, the crypto trades at $0.4486, reflecting a 15.05% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite this, the asset has surged 95.47% over the last seven days, signaling heightened market activity. An analyst on X, Egrag Crypto, has pointed to several critical factors influencing this volatility and its upward trajectory. Insights suggest that both technical patterns and market dynamics play a role in Stellar's price momentum.Key Drivers Behind XLM's Price SurgeNotably, according to Egrag, a substantial capital injection has been identified as a primary catalyst. This influx of funds into XLM indicates a rising demand and growing interest in the crypto.https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1861350388160749853Additionally, shifts in the order book dynamics contributed to the upward trend. Thin order books, characterized by low liquidity, saw large buy orders that pushed prices higher. These conditions created a chain reaction, amplifying the momentum in a relatively short period.Another noteworthy factor is Stellar's breaking through low-volume areas, or zones with minimal trading activity. These areas, marked by sparse volume bars on the Volume-Range Profile, provide less resistance to price movements.Also, XLM always copies XRP as XRP rose from $0.55 to $1.60; soon after, XLM Started to rise. Ripple CTO, mentioning the same point, said in September that ""Even over 8 years, XRP price and XLM price track absurdly well."" Technical Patterns and PredictionsFurther, several technical analyses have emerged, predicting further gains for Stellar. This projection implies potential gains of 233% to 343% from recent levels. Notably, Egrag also anticipates XLM targeting a cycle peak ranging from $1.50 to $3.70.Charting Guy, another market commentator, highlighted a long-term bullish pattern forming on Stellar’s monthly chart. This Adam and Eve pattern, established since 2017, suggests a breakout could propel XLM to $3-$5.More Conservative PredictionsEgrag’s November 18 analysis emphasized that XLM's recent weekly gain is likely the beginning of further upward momentum. Having already climbed an impressive 2,312% from its lowest point this cycle as of the 18th, XLM is projected to see additional gains. Egrag particularly anticipates the crypto could rise another 850%, reaching a potential target of $2.27.On the same day, Egrag had identified a wave-like price structure that suggests an imminent breakout into the ""Inter Stellar Gateway zone.""

An estimated 562 million people owned some form of cryptocurrency in 2024. This represents a massive jump of 34% compared to 2023. However, the actual number could be even higher when you consider indirect ownership of crypto through Bitcoin ETFs, mining stocks, or shares of companies with direct exposure to crypto, like MicroStrategy. With so many new users diving into digital assets, the need for reliable, easy-to-use wallets has never been greater. Wallets aren’t just for storing crypto anymore; they’re a pathway to DeFi platforms, NFTs, staking opportunities, and many more advanced features. Among the countless options available, NOW Wallet deserves credit for earning a reputation of becoming one of the best choices for people who want a truly flexible crypto experience . In this article, we’ll revisit what makes NOW Wallet a successful product and compare it with four other popular wallets: Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Exodus Wallet. A Quick Look at What NOW Wallet Offers Let’s start with a quick refresher on why NOW Wallet has earned so much praise. Developed by the same team behind ChangeNOW , an instant crypto exchange service, it’s a feature-packed crypto wallet designed to be flexible, user-friendly, and secure. Here are some of its standout features: Works Across Devices: Whether you’re using iOS , Android , Windows , macOS , or Linux , NOW Wallet works seamlessly across all platforms. It even syncs transactions between devices, so your portfolio is always up to date. Non-Custodial Access and Security: You control your private keys, not the wallet provider. Add PIN codes and biometric authentication, and you’ve got a strong layer of protection for your assets. Diverse Features: From staking options to NFT support, NOW Wallet is more than just a product designed to store your crypto. It is the gateway to DeFi platforms, offering in-app exchanges that include cross-chain swaps, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and fiat-to-crypto purchases — each designed to ensure seamless usability. Asset Variety: NOW Wallet features 70+ coins and 1500+ tokens, providing access to a wide variety of digital assets, including popular cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and more. Notably, the wallet allows users to add custom tokens from supported EVM-compatible blockchains, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and others, as well as the Tron blockchain. Responsive Support: Users can also benefit from NOW Wallet’s attentive customer support via a live 24/7 chat feature. The team is standing by to assist with queries, troubleshoot issues, and explain features. Pro Features: For those seeking an enhanced crypto management solution, NOW Wallet integrates with ChangeNOW to offer its ‘Pro’ setting that delivers an even more streamlined experience. This includes cashback rewards for each transaction, AML address checks for ensuring legitimate operations, unlimited crypto loans for passive income generation, and private domains for accepting crypto payments. It goes without saying that NOW Wallet isn’t just a standard wallet designed to safeguard a crypto portfolio. Rather, it should be viewed as a complete suite of tools to manage digital assets. The Competition: How NOW Wallet Compares To really see how NOW Wallet stacks up, let’s take a closer look at four other wallets that are popular in the crypto space. Each one brings something unique to the table, but NOW Wallet often comes out ahead when it comes to offering a well-rounded experience. 1. Trust Wallet Trust Wallet is a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, offering a simple, non-custodial wallet with access to millions of assets, including NFTs. It’s also a great gateway to the world of DeFi. Advantages: Supports over 4.5 million assets, including tokens and NFTs. Makes it easy to connect with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and dApps. Beginner-friendly design with a clean interface. Disadvantages: Only available as a mobile app—no desktop version. Customer support is limited to email, which can be slow. How It Compares: Trust Wallet does a great job with asset variety and DeFi access, but its lack of desktop support and slower customer service put it a step behind NOW Wallet, which offers live chat support and works on multiple platforms. 2. MetaMask MetaMask is almost synonymous with Ethereum. It’s a go-to wallet for interacting with Ethereum-based dApps, though it’s branching out to other networks like Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Advantages: Best-in-class integration with Ethereum DeFi platforms. Now supports multiple chains, expanding its utility. Browser extension for quick access to dApps. Disadvantages: Focuses mainly on Ethereum and compatible networks. Can be tricky for beginners to set up and navigate. How It Compares: MetaMask was initially built for users investing within Ethereum and its ecosystem. As such, its initial narrow focus is viewed as a limiting factor for many users with a broad focus. In contrast, NOW Wallet supports over 50 blockchains, meaning it is designed for users with a wide range of interests and needs. 3. Coinbase Wallet Coinbase Wallet is designed for newcomers and casual users and is backed by Coinbase Global, one of the most recognized crypto exchanges in the world. The wallet supports NFTs ownership and as one would expect it integrates directly with Coinbase accounts. Advantages: Easy to set up and connect with an existing Coinbase crypto account. Simple tools for managing NFTs and crypto. Free access to educational resources for crypto beginners. Disadvantages: Tied closely to Coinbase’s ecosystem, which limits its independence. Advanced features (staking, dApp integration) are not readily available to all users. How It Compares: Coinbase Wallet is user-friendly and great for people just starting out. However, NOW Wallet’s staking options and extensive dApp support make it the better choice for users who want to do more with their crypto. 4. Exodus Wallet Exodus is a visually stunning wallet that’s perfect for people who appreciate good design. It supports a variety of cryptocurrencies and offers 24/7 customer support. Advantages: An easy to operate userface. Compatible with mobile, desktop, and hardware wallets. Access to 24/7 customer support. Disadvantages: Exchange fees can be higher compared to other wallets. Lacks advanced features like staking and dApp integration. How It Compares: While Exodus is a joy to use and has excellent customer support, it doesn’t offer the advanced tools found in NOW Wallet, such as staking and DeFi connectivity. Why Flexibility Matters More Than Ever The crypto world is evolving from investments to gaming, NFTs, DeFi, implying digital assets are being used in more ways than ever. This means crypto wallets need to reflect changing demands. Global Growth: There are more than 500 million crypto owners worldwide, implying the need for secure wallets is greater than ever. DeFi Strength: The DeFi sector boasts a market cap of around $100 billion, making it clear that demand for wallets that seamlessly connect to these platforms exists. NFT Expansion: NFTs are no longer just digital art—they’re expanding into gaming, ticketing, and other innovative applications, making wallet support essential. Wallets that offer support for NFTs, like NOW Wallet, remain essential even if the hysteria appears to have peaked in recent years. NOW Wallet’s adaptability to these trends, combined with its user-friendly approach, is a major reason it stands out. Closing Remarks Trust Wallet was created for every-day users who demand access to many advanced tools and features. This contrasts with MetaMask which excels at Ethereum-focused investments, Coinbase Wallet is beginner-friendly, and Exodus combines a sleek design with solid support. But NOW Wallet checks the most boxes for a typical crypto user. Its combination of cross-platform functionality, non-custodial security, in-app exchanges, staking, and NFT support make it an incredibly versatile tool. Add in its user-friendly interface and responsive customer support, and it’s easy to see why it’s leading the pack. As the crypto space continues to grow, having a wallet that can keep up with new trends and user needs will be more important than ever. For users that require an affordable, flexible, secure, and reliable crypto wallet, NOW Wallet ranks as a top-three option in an overcrowded and highly competitive market.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | ETH | EXCHANGE,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/5-non-custodial-wallets-for-effortless-crypto-management-pros-cons-and-which-one-to-choose/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

The Swiss-based company specializes in impact investing and will work with Phlomis to develop high-impact investment opportunities while setting a new standard for transparency and efficiency in the RWA market. Making an Impact Onchain The partnership between Phlomis Finance and responsAbility aims to transform the way digital asset investors access high-impact investment products. By integrating responsAbility’s portfolio of private debt and equity solutions into Phlomis Finance’s blockchain ecosystem, the collaboration unlocks new opportunities for retail and institutional investors alike. One of the most tangible aspects of the partnership is the onchain recording of financial and impact reporting events, including securitization, primary issuance, and secondary trading. By utilizing Chromia’s blockchain as its secure data layer, Phlomis ensures complete transparency and accelerated settlement for all transactions. Furthermore, Chromia’s infrastructure facilitates the seamless sharing of documents and reporting data, streamlining processes for investors and fund managers. The Rise of Real-World Assets Real-world assets have emerged as a major growth area in decentralized finance (DeFi). By tokenizing tangible assets such as real estate, private debt, and US Treasuries, RWAs bridge the gap between the digital and traditional financial worlds. Tokenized assets are on course to represent a multi-trillion-dollar market within the next decade, driven by demand from institutional and retail investors seeking yield and diversification. RWAs enable investors to access previously illiquid markets while benefiting from blockchain’s inherent advantages, such as transparency, faster settlement times, and reduced counterparty risk. The integration of RWAs into DeFi platforms also introduces stable, income-generating assets, enhancing portfolio resilience in volatile markets. The collaboration between Phlomis and responsAbility will give investors access to tokenized products that deliver measurable impact through a focus on measures such as poverty reduction, while simultaneously earning their investors market returns. responsAbility Makes the Case for Impact Investing Phlomis Finance, built on the Chromia blockchain, specializes in bringing real-world assets to digital asset investors. By leveraging blockchain technology, Phlomis enhances transparency and resilience in the investment process. Its platform not only enables the tokenization of assets but also provides tools like onchain financial reporting and virtual data rooms via Chromia’s Filehub solution. This architecture ensures that investors have secure, real-time access to key information, creating an ecosystem designed for trust and efficiency. Its decision to team up with responsAbility Investments AG, which was founded in 2003 and now manages over $5.1 billion in assets, will shine a spotlight on impact investing as a subset of the RWA market. The firm specializes in private debt and equity investments across three key sectors: Financial Inclusion, Climate Finance, and Sustainable Food. By aligning its investments with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), responsAbility empowers businesses and individuals in emerging markets to drive sustainable economic growth. From financing micro and small enterprises to advancing women’s economic empowerment, responsAbility has deployed more than $15.7 billion in impact investments globally. Its partnership with Phlomis Finance will combine decades of expertise in impact investing with the capabilities of blockchain technology to open up new opportunities for onchain users. By leveraging tokenization, onchain reporting, and transparent data layers, this partnership aims to set a new benchmark for how real-world assets are managed and accessed.

However, $MSTR is down 25% from its $540 high, and as per pre-trading, a further fall to $376 could take place. There can be no doubting the genius behind Michael Saylor’s consistent debt raises that are used to buy $BTC. Since the beginning of 2023, $MSTR is up 2,660%. That said, the most recent massive purchase of 55,500 $BTC has not moved the dial to the upside, neither for $MSTR, nor for $BTC. $MSTR falls through trendline Source: TradingView Looking at the short-term chart for $MSTR, it can be seen that the price has fallen through the ascending trendline. It is being held by the 0.618 Fibonacci, but with the pre-trading price still falling, it may be the 0.786 Fibonacci that ends up stemming this current drop. Current reversal could still be bullish for $MSTR Source: TradingView Looking at $MSTR on the weekly time frame it can be seen just how strongly the price surged from the bottom of the bull flag in early August. Taking a Fibonacci extension from here up to the top, it can be noted that the price still hasn’t even gone down to the 0.382 Fibonacci yet, so if it reaches this level and bounces, it is actually a very bullish reversal. A concern is at the bottom of the chart, in the Stochastic RSI. Here it can be observed that the indicator lines have just started to cross back down. It may be that the lines stay at the top for a while longer, as was the case back in mid November last year, through to early January. That said, they will have to come down at some point, bringing price momentum down with them. $MSTR price rejects at 10-year ascending trendline Source: TradingView Zooming out further on the weekly time frame, it can be noted that an ascending trendline bisects the tops of price action in 2014 and into 2015, in February 2021, and just recently the price has been rejected from this same trendline. Does all this mean that a top has been reached? Maybe. That said, the trendline is very steep, and therefore the price could continue to go up beneath it. The main sign of a top however would be if Bitcoin showed that it had reached a climax. The price is on the way down for $BTC, but the indications are that a bull market top has not been made yet. Therefore $MSTR should still have some upside runway. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A crypto analyst has revealed that a decline to $89,000 was well within possibility, as sell-offs below the $100,000 mark have continued to hinder Bitcoin’s price upward momentum. Bitcoin Price Correction To $89,000 Possible On November 26, TradingView crypto analyst Pejman Zwin shared a detailed chart representing a technical analysis of Bitcoin‘s price movements in a 1-hour time frame. The Bitcoin price chart highlighted vital resistance lines, support zones, and technical indicators suggesting an impending crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? At the top of the price chart is a yellow zone identified as the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ), where Bitcoin is expected to face significant resistance as it aims for the $100,000 milestone. The chart also highlights a horizontal resistance line of around $95,904, which Bitcoin previously struggled to break. At current resistance levels between $97,000 and $98,000, Zwin has indicated that if Bitcoin can successfully push above these thresholds, its price could rise significantly towards $100,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin could experience a massive price decline if it fails to reach the resistance levels mentioned above. The analyst’s price chart showcases green zones representing critical support cones where Bitcoin could bounce back if its price corrects. If Bitcoin drops below support levels between $95,600 and $92,000 and breaks the lower line of the ascending channel on its chart, Zwin has forecasted that its price could crash as low as $89,000 this bull cycle. The analyst describes this crash point as the “cumulative long liquidation leverage, where Bitcoin could see its price correcting between $91,000 and $89,000, representing an 8% to 10% crash for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Key Factors Pushing The BTC Price Upwards On the flip side, Zwin disclosed in his Bitcoin analysis report that the cryptocurrency is pumping again, driven by a wave of positive market sentiment sparked by recent developments in the crypto space that have been headlines. The analyst revealed that the news of the Chinese Court affirming the legality of Bitcoin and crypto ownership has been a key catalyst behind the sharp rise in the price of BTC. Related Reading: ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Chart Shows How High Ethereum Price Can Go This Cycle Additionally, Donald Trump‘s plans to appoint a White House crypto advisor have provided a significant boost to the BTC price, propelling it to current levels and enabling it to break through important resistance lines. Based on the above chart, Zwin reveals that Bitcoin has entered five new impulsive waves from the Elliott wave theory. This bullish development occurred after the cryptocurrency broke past key resistance lines. Moreover, Zwin’s Bitcoin price chart showcases a “Bump and Run Top Pattern,” with the cryptocurrency already completing the “Bump phase” and entering a “Run phase.” Taking this into consideration, the analyst has predicted that if Bitcoin can surge above $98,700, investors and market watchers should expect it to skyrocket to $100,000.

While the rapid rise of crypto iGaming signals a new era of innovation and growth, one traditional element of the industry—affiliation—has struggled to find its footing in this fast-moving ecosystem. Enter SportsWizard.io , a groundbreaking platform poised to redefine the role of affiliates in the crypto iGaming space through a unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) model. Crypto’s Growth vs. Affiliate Decline Blockchain-powered gaming has redefined the rules of engagement, leaving conventional affiliate systems behind. Crypto’s decentralized model often bypasses intermediaries, marginalizing affiliates who once dominated fiat iGaming traffic. Despite crypto players’ significantly higher lifetime value, traditional models have failed to harness their full potential. SportsWizard steps into this gap, introducing a dynamic P2E model that rewards users for their activity while driving value for operators. By aligning incentives, the platform paves way for affiliates regaining relevance in the crypto iGaming space. SportsWizard disrupts the old affiliate model Launched in beta version in Q2 2024, but unveiling its full offering in late November, SportsWizard integrates P2E mechanics to create a win-win ecosystem. Users earn the in-house currency Crystals—redeemable as deposits with top crypto betting operators, digital vouchers for everything from sporting gear to crypto deals, merchandise and other perks—through challenges, referrals, mini-games and other types of engagement. ""Margins in iGaming affiliation are definitely big enough for sharing with our members who are the true origin of revenue,"" says Jan Lindow, SportsWizard’s co-founder. ""In crypto, where player values are often multiples higher than in fiat gaming, there’s ample room for generous user rewards, fair traffic partner deals, and healthy margins."" Smart A-level partnerships delivers a strategic edge Traffic is traditionally the key cost driver for any affiliate, where user acquisition tends to be more expensive the more sought-after users are, as with iGaming. This is another area where SportsWizard comes in with a fresh approach. The backbone in Sports Wizard’s strategy is to grow through partnerships with big premium players, not just by accepting traffic but also by finding ways to integrate and sometimes elevate utility of existing partner tokens. First such partnership to go live in its first phase is with GameFi giant Spielworks, boasting over 7 million users and 3.5 million connected wallets, can prove a game-changer. Early results from the summer, before the P2E model was set in place, showed 6,000 new sign-ups in less than a week. The initial excitement from partner communities after unveiling the P2E elements indicate even larger sign-up volumes, showcasing the potential for exponential user growth. The Spielworks partnership, alongside further A-level partner deals to be announced shortly according to Lindow, as well as plans to launch an ambassador program with sports influencers, positions SportsWizard as an undisputed innovator and leader in an affiliate industry that’s been waiting on the sideline for way too long. The future of iGaming affiliation is collaborative With a possible tokenization on the horizon and plans to expand its offerings, including an eSports section and community-driven features, SportsWizard is just getting started. ""We’re in the early stages, fine-tuning our Play2Earn model and expanding our shop’s rewards catalogue are current tasks,"" Lindow adds. ""Our next milestone is completing our funding round to unlock resources needed to leverage some very interesting growth opportunities currently on the table."" By pioneering a sustainable, community-driven affiliate model, SportsWizard might have cracked the code on how to bring affiliates back to the forefront of growth. As crypto iGaming continues to surge, SportsWizard’s approach may just set the standard for the next wave of industry innovation.

Latest on Solana ETF & Cardano Price Surges,"The market trends show how quickly events can reshape investor priorities and decisions. This shift is evident in recent news — Bitwise's move to register a Solana ETF in Delaware has sparked discussions about institutional adoption, whereas Cardano's price surge to its eight-month high signals that ADA is inching closer to $1. As the market heats up, BlockDAG (BDAG) has made record-breaking moves — raising $20 in 48 hours, bringing the total presale to nearly $150 million. Driven by a huge number of crypto enthusiasts rallying behind the project, analysts predict that BlockDAG will achieve its ambitious $600 million target in the coming months. Solana ETF Predictions: Will Prices Rise with SEC Approval? The Bitwise Solana ETF is a bold step toward bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. Registered in Delaware, the ETF proposal aims to track Solana's price. Bitwise is entering a competitive race alongside VanEck and Canary Capital to secure SEC approval, which could be a pivotal moment for the asset. Solana recently saw a massive increase in its value during the recent bull run, with its current price hovering at $236.91. Experts predict that if a spot ETF gains approval by 2025, Solana could see a significant boost to $300. Cardano Price Surge: ADA Nears $1 Cardano (ADA) has recently hit an eight-month high, nearing the $1 mark, driven by growing trading volumes of $52.26 billion. Technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, with ADA breaking free from a downward channel. The balance of power (BoP) indicator also shows a balanced market, hinting at exciting moves ahead. Yet, not all signs are rosy. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, signaling a potential correction in the short term. Some investors remain skeptical of its ability to sustain momentum, fearing external market factors could stall its progress. BlockDAG Rakes In $20M in 2 Days — The Biggest Boom in Presale History! BlockDAG is rewriting crypto history by raking in an incredible $20 million in just 48 hours, totaling its presale revenue to nearly $150 million across just 26 batches. With its native coin BDAG's prices surging from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch, early BDAG holders have seen an incredible gain of 2240%, making BlockDAG the biggest presale crypto . Analysts predict that with the ongoing rapid presale rise, BlockDAG's $600 million presale goal seems to be achievable in the upcoming months. This massive presale surge is driven by crypto whales and developers moving towards the project because of unique DAG technology, reliable ecosystem, growth prospects, and standout features like its low-code/no-code platform. Its innovative low-code/no-code platform makes blockchain accessible to everyone, allowing users to create decentralized applications, meme coins, and NFTs using customizable templates without coding expertise. This innovation places BlockDAG alongside crypto giants like Solana. With its robust infrastructure, strong community backing, and remarkable presale success, BlockDAG is already in discussions with major exchanges for potential listings. These listings will enhance BDAG's visibility and also provide early BDAG holders with improved liquidity, seamless global trading options, and increased market activity, potentially driving demand and boosting the coin's value. For those looking to maximize gains but can’t afford the entry price of Solana and other similar established coins, BlockDAG offers a significant opportunity with its growing presale. With an entry price of just $0.0234 and its soon-ending BULLRUN100 bonus offer, now is the ideal time to jump into this growing project. Using this exclusive bonus code allows buyers to double their BDAG purchases at checkout and secure priority access during airdrops. But this exclusive offer is only available for 2 more days, making now the perfect time to buy BDAG coins for those looking to secure a stake before BDAG enters its next growth phase and prices get out of reach. Top Crypto Coins Right Now The crypto market is buzzing with activity. Solana's potential ETF approval has reignited interest in institutional adoption, while Cardano's price surge to an eight-month high showcases its growing momentum as it nears $1. However, BlockDAG is leading the charge with its record-breaking presale. By raising $20M in two days and pushing the total presale revenue to nearly $150 million, BlockDAG is rapidly moving towards its ambitious $600 million target. For those seeking top crypto coins right now , BlockDAG presents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on significant growth in the expanding crypto market.

The Liquity Protocol team was among the first to embrace the idea of committed and verifiable on-chain value when they introduced Chicken Bonds in October 2022. It would be opportune for LQTY stakers to cultivate LUSD’s appeal alongside BOLD. “To some extent, liquidity can be considered a public good.” - Jonathan Kearns and Philip Lowe, Promoting Liquidity: Why and How?, Reserve Bank of Australia, Research Discussion Paper 2008-06, October 2008 Among the most promising innovations to look forward to in DeFi as we approach the end of the year and the start of 2025 are Liquity V2 ( LQTY-USD ) and its stablecoin, BOLD . In the past, I have written extensively about Liquity V1 and its stablecoin, LUSD ( LUSD-USD ), both of which were introduced on Ethereum in April 2021 as a way of offering DeFi users the opportunity to borrow stable value against their ETH holdings in an interest-free manner. LUSD has since set an example to be followed in its commitment to the foundational principles of crypto, and it is described as “the most decentralized stablecoin” by the independent stablecoin rating agency, Blue Chip . Who better than the Liquity Protocol team themselves to now apply the lessons learned from LUSD to advance innovation in the stablecoin market and better tackle the stablecoin trilemma ? Particularly, with its introduction of Protocol Incentivized Liquidity (PIL) , Liquity V2 can drive a positive flywheel that sustains BOLD’s liquidity to contribute to its broad accessibility and price stability as a top stablecoin across DeFi. In this blog post, I therefore propose how progress towards this seemingly insurmountable goal of cracking the stablecoin trilemma can, at the very least, be advanced with BOLD vis-a-vis the consideration of liquidity as a public good for its on-chain DEX pools. Ahead of its Time: Chicken Bonds as a Precursor to Memecoins “Market cap is definitely the most talked about data point when it comes to crypto...however, liquidity is more important because liquidity is a measure of the amount of money that is actually inside of the trading pools that you need to participate in if you want to buy or sell...” - Understanding Liquidity: The Master Metric for Memecoin Traders, Faceless Labs, YouTube, March 2024 Trends have come and gone across the crypto space over the years, and the more recent memecoin craze is quite likely yet another manifestation of that historic tendency. Nevertheless, it is at this point undeniable that memecoins have instilled the criticality of on-chain liquidity as an underlying metric by which crypto projects will be scrutizined moving forward by both newbies and seasoned market participants alike. In fact, popular token trackers such as DEX Tools now highlight burned LP tokens and locked liquidity, reflecting the importance of these figures to traders and users across DeFi. Correspondingly, on-chain liquidity lockers such as UNCX have increasingly grown in popularity across various chains. Interestingly, well before the memecoin hype, the Liquity Protocol team was among the first to embrace the idea of committed and verifiable on-chain value when they introduced Chicken Bonds in October 2022. Specifically, the Permanent Bucket in the Chicken Bonds setup represents a portion of a user’s bonded LUSD once chickening in that can then shift between Liquity’s Stability Pool and the Curve Pool for LUSD + 3CRV. As noted in the Chicken Bonds documentation, “The Permanent bucket can only increase…,” and even with the wind-down functionality built into the Chicken Bonds system, the value as represented by the Permanent Bucket is ultimately redeemable. However, with the rise of interest rates across global markets in recent years, LUSD struggled to sustain its demand versus other stablecoins offering more enticing yields to their holders. By extension, the demand for boosted LUSD (bLUSD) through the Chicken Bonds protocol took a hit. Nevertheless, we can build on the ingenuity that Chicken Bonds introduced as it relates to sustaining liquidity and as further validated by the growing popularity of memecoins when we look ahead and reflect on how BOLD can entrench itself as the stablecoin of choice across DeFi in the future. The BOLD and LUSD Flywheel Effect From the get-go, the onus will be on LQTY stakers to judiciously steer PIL to uphold BOLD’s value proposition as a premier on-chain stablecoin. Since 25% of Liquity V2’s protocol revenue will be directed to PIL, this represents an ongoing and notable sum of value to be apportioned in support of sustaining BOLD’s on-chain liquidity posture. It would seem sensible for LQTY stakers to commit to incentivizing a BOLD + LUSD pool with a portion of PIL, since this would foster a sustained demand for LUSD, which by extension would bolster the revenue from Liquity V1 for LQTY stakers, which they’ll be able to earn as incentives while simultaneously directing Liquity V2’s PIL. “A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them.” - Satoshi, Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 2009 Aside from their own self-interest, LQTY stakers should also be compelled to perpetually incentivize a BOLD + LUSD pool with some of Liquity V2’s PIL because both are synergistic in representing decentralized and immutable attempts at offering stablecoins anchored to on-chain assets with varying degrees of risk, as BOLD will include staked ETH alongside ETH as collateral options, whereas LUSD is only borrowable against ETH itself. Moreover, since LUSD is not tied to off-chain assets and custodians, it is shielded from the “real world” counter-party risks that invariably would need to be accounted for by LQTY stakers in supporting pools of BOLD paired with more widely available yet centralized stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. This is self-evident from the precarious history of traditional financial institutions, as the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco in the Spring of 2023 most recently confirmed. Satoshi’s early elevator pitch for Bitcoin similarly cautioned against centrally controlled systems, and should be considered in this regard as well. In my estimation, there will remain an ongoing demand for LUSD as a stablecoin, as it offers an interest-free approach to borrowing against ETH for users who would continue to favor that, and since it continues to be minted , despite alternative stablecoin options offering better yields in the present high-interest rate macro environment. Assuming demand for LUSD is better upheld as a result of a BOLD + LUSD pool being continually incentivized vis-a-vis PIL from Liquity V2, this may also revive Chicken Bonds as a DeFi protocol and rejuvenate the utility of bLUSD, alongside LUSD and LQTY too, as collateral assets . Liquity as the Antithesis of a Liquidity Black Hole “Financial liquidity matters. In general market participants have a strong preference for trading in the most liquid markets... As important as the level of liquidity, is its uncertainty...” - Avinash Persaud, Liquidity Black Holes: what are they and how are they generated, April 2003 Considering the above, it would be opportune for LQTY stakers to cultivate LUSD’s appeal alongside BOLD. In so doing, the antithesis of a liquidity black hole could be spawned across the Liquity Protocol ecosystem at large, through an amount of BOLD from Liquity V2’s PIL being contributed to a permanently locked liquidity pool position alongside LUSD. To facilitate the creation and growth of such a permanently locked liquidity pool, a defined amount of LQTY could be sold from Liquity V1’s Community Reserve and/or the Liquity AG Endowment and then converted to LUSD. Then, a corresponding amount of BOLD could be allocated by LQTY stakers from PIL over some period of time and subsequently paired with the LUSD to initiate the locked pool. The locked BOLD + LUSD pool could be constructed vis-a-vis a UNCX liquidity locker for Uniswap V3, as this would enable concentrated liquidity within a defined and narrow price range around a dollar value, as the presumption is both BOLD and LUSD will trade roughly around a dollar each. Accordingly, the pool itself could then be further incentivized by LQTY stakers through PIL to attract individual users to provide liquidity on top of this baseline and continuous level of liquidity too. In this manner, the initiator of the locked BOLD + LUSD pool could collect the associated trading fees from Uniswap V3 and feed them back into the pool or use them for funding ecosystem growth initatives, as the UNCX locker for Uniswap V3 allows for the trading fees to separately be collected. Assuming the initiatior is Liquity AG, for example, it could then perhaps categorize the locked liquidity as falling under the Community Reserve, such that its trading fees can then be directed by LQTY stakers engaged in steering PIL for Liquity V2; a smart contract approach to managing this may also be explored, if possible. Full Circle Virtuous Cycle By extending the above-described locked liquidity model to Liquity V2’s licensed forks , LQTY stakers could also encourage aligned forks to initiate permanently locked positions and direct a baseline amount of their respective stablecoins to be paired with BOLD. As the initiators of the pools, the fork teams could similarly collect the corresponding trading fees and channel them back into their pools or use them for their distinct ecosystem’s growth purposes, assuming they use UNCX’s Uniswap V3 locker or a similar example. In approaching the build out of BOLD’s on-chain liquidity in such a manner, there would be both a certain and verifiable level of liquidity that is enabled to gradually increase over time. Forks could be incentivized to continue to support such permanently locked pools for their stablecoins even after the contractual end dates of their licenses pass, since LQTY stakers could show preference for routing PIL from Liquity V2 to such forks that remain supportive of the Liquity ecosystem as a whole. By extension, the demand and liquidity for such stablecoins would continue to be supported. Thus, through promoting a “give to receive” relationship with its fork partners via the use of PIL from Liquity V2 as leverage, LQTY stakers could anchor the Liquity brand as the hub around which DeFi’s premier stablecoins can ultimately grow and prosper together. This strategy may not solve the stablecoin trilemma in its entirety, but it would help to better address liquidity as a primary concern underlying the key question of price stability.

Ethereum price has hit new highs since July but the altcoin sector has seen much higher gains in other altcoins. Furthermore, the suffering Spot Ethereum ETF market led to high speculations about the Ethereum price this year. Many analysts closely watch the Ethereum price trends this week after days of net outflows from the Spot Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, an emerging presale giant has been stealing the throne from many established and bullish crypto assets, ready to show the biggest surge in history after its anticipated Q4 listing. Selling Pressures Trigger Price Correction After ETH Hit $3.5K Ethereum price has surged more than 40% in the last 30 days, displaying a promising trend after the US elections. This week, ETH broke past the July highs for the first time in this bull run after touching the $3.5K marker. However, the immediate bearish pressures due to high selling activity at this threshold level make the Ethereum price struggle. Source: CoinMarketCap This sudden reversal and failure of the ETH bulls to drive the Ethereum price past the resistance levels might trigger a short-term correction for the token. A bearish divergence and the RSI indicator also suggest selling pressures and profit bookings by traders, primarily due to the underperformance of Spot Ethereum ETF and rising sell-offs. Ethereum Price Prediction: How Spot Ethereum ETF Rally Can Help Spot Ethereum ETF can be crucial in shifting the ETH price trends this bullish month. After days of bullish performance post-elections, Spot Ethereum ETF witnessed notable outflows, especially from $81.3 million on Tuesday last week. This negative trend was broken by BlackRock’s Spot Ethereum ETF inflows of $91.2 million this Friday. If a notable shift happens in the Spot Ethereum ETF sector, following BTC ETFs’ bullish trend, the Ethereum price can move the way forward for a bullish rally. Experts say that if the market favors ETH-based assets and the bullish forces, ETH can easily top this cycle with a $5,000 rally by the end of December. DTX Exchange Will Steal The Throne With 10,000% Rally Prediction DTX Exchange (DTX) is ready to shoot up the highest this December as the trading community anticipates its CEX listing. The platform has made its reputation among newbies and expert traders as a landmark of successful trading experience through cutting-edge technologies and innovative trading features like the first-ever hybrid layer-1 blockchain and 1000x leverage. DTX Exchange has attracted large stakeholders to pump the presale past $8.6 million in batch 5 with an unstoppable volume influx, evidenced by 150,000+ sign-ups since the presale launch. DTX Exchange is the first-ever hybrid layer-1 blockchain to perform 10,000 TPS on the testnet and offer no gas fee to provide a seamless trading experience for traders. Many traders are buying DTX tokens this season at a low entry point of $0.1. As the hybrid trading platform, DTX Exchange has the capability to outrank established exchanges with its sophisticated infrastructure and end-to-end solutions, experts predict that DTX listing will disrupt the ranking tables this year with an explosive 10,000% rally. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange is poised for history’s biggest rally after its record-breaking presale momentum. As the Ethereum price faces resistance and the Spot Ethereum ETF market continues to stay flat, DTX emerges as the game-changer of this cycle despite ETH predictions about a $5000 rally in case of a bullish scenario. With its innovative features and $0.10 entry price, now is the time to secure your spot in the DTX presale before the flight takes off.

At $0.000025 as of writing, SHIB has a long way to go to hit the elusive $1 threshold. With a market capitalization of $14.76 billion and a circulating supply of more than 589 trillion tokens, SHIB's ascent to $1 would need an unheard-of market valuation—making such an accomplishment practically unattainable absent significant token burns or innovative triggers. Some of SHIB's top investors are turning their attention to Rexas Finance (RXS), a presale-stage token priced at $0.080 that presents both real-world use cases and exponential potential growth as SHIB confronts these obstacles. Rexas Finance is a unique investment in the current crypto scene since it is based on actual asset tokenizing unlike SHIB, which depends on speculative momentum. Why SHIB Can’t Replicate Its 2021 Bull Run Hype and community excitement drove SHIB's 2021 success most of which may not be as strong in this cycle. SHIB has an uphill fight in attaining new highs without major changes in its ecology or a comeback in buzz. The great quantity of the token complicates things even more. SHIB's market capitalization would have to be more than $589 trillion to reach $1 per token, much above the whole world GDP. Such a valuation is quite unlikely even with vigorous token burns. RXS: The Rising Star Poised to Surpass SHIB Rexas Finance (RXS) shows more promise as SHIB tries to regain the old momentum. Located at the junction between blockchain and actual asset tokenization, RXS aims to close the distance between established sectors and distributed finance. With a 14,900% increase over its presale price, RXS, which currently costs $0.080, is expected to touch $1 soon after its launch and could fly to $12 within a month. Early investors stand to gain greatly from this increase, hence RXS appeals to those looking for life-changing profits. Real-World Applications of Rexas Finance Unlike SHIB, which provides only limited value outside of its meme status, Rexas Finance concentrates on tokenizing real-world assets including: Real estate offers a $379.7 trillion market for buyers and sellers of fractional ownership of homes. Gold is one of the commodities with a $121.2 trillion market that allows flawless trade of valuable metals. Art and Collectibles: Blockchain technology opens a $65 billion market. With tools like the Rexas Token Builder, which lets anyone tokenize assets without knowledge of coding, Rexas Finance enables consumers. Additionally on the platform is the Rexas Launchpad, where people may donate money for tokenized initiatives. Avoiding venture capital funding to guarantee equitable distribution and empower individual investors, Rexas Finance has followed a community-driven strategy. Its most recent listings on Coin Market Cap and CoinGecko improve visibility and give investors real-time, reliable data. The project has also had a Certik assessment, therefore underlining its dedication to openness and security. With 20 winners expected to get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, Rexas Finance's continuous $1 million giveaway has already drawn over 244,000 submissions as of writing. Together with the success of the presale, more than 175 million tokens were sold, generating $10.2 million as of writing as this campaign highlights the mounting excitement about the project. Early investors have a rare chance to get RXS at a fraction of its potential value as the token slated to begin at $0.20 climbs steadily thereafter. However, giveaway participants can increase their winning by completing tasks on the Rexas Finance website. The Verdict: SHIB or RXS? Although Shiba Inu's group is still devoted, its path to $1 is difficult and makes such a mark unusual unlikely. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a convincing substitute in the meantime, combining great development potential with practical value. Investors seeking the next great prospect should move fast. RXS is still in its presale stage at $0.080, hence there is not much time to grab tokens before the price soars to $0.20 and beyond. Come to the Rexas Finance presale today to set yourself up for unmatched blockchain revolution profits. Don't miss—RXS is looking to be the breakout token of this cycle!

Competitor Priced at 9 Cents Might Just Beat It to the Punch,"The two prevailing coins are the Dogecoin (DOGE) and Rexas Finance (RXS) as people invest their attention in the development of these cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin remains a favorite meme coin that attracts market focus, and Rexas is changing the game with the creation of tokens representing actual assets. Both assets have attracted greater interest and have risen in price, which makes people think about their further development. Dogecoin’s Path to $10: Is It Achievable? Dogecoin was also reinvigorated in 2024 with political endorsement and famous personalities such as Elon Musk. The coin recently rose to a 200% increase within one month with the price reaching $0.377 before some fluctuations. However, DOGE might carry on with bullishness as more firms embrace it as a medium of trade as well as its usefulness. Source X Starting with Elon Musk himself tweeting that he owns DOGE and now Tesla, one of the most valuable car manufacturers in the world accepting DOGE for its products. Moreover, talk of Musk co-leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) along with Trump only heightened the token’s popularity. Analysts anticipate DOGE to test its ATH of $0.7399 and could head to $3 this year in the bull cycle. Yet, getting to $10 would mean an increase by 2,500 times, and raise its market capitalization to $1.46 trillion which is very achievable if the market stays bullish. Rexas Finance: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) has managed to gain attention due to its position as a key player in the real-world assets tokenization industry as it enters a stage of rapid growth. Thus, by allowing one to own a small part of valuable property, including real estate or artwork, Rexas Finance makes investments available to anyone. It comprises such applications as Rexas Token Builder, an API to generate tokens for assets easily, and QuickMint Bot that allows the incorporation of blockchain functionalities into the working environment effortlessly. According to analysis, it can be inferred that the reception reserved by the market for the project can be considered high indeed. There are six phases of the presale, and each R terrorists Finance has $9.8 million in various stages of a presale, each token is now priced at $0.08 on stage six. Some of the early investors have already garnered over 167% of their investment, there is future potential, having the ability to trade at $0.20 in early 2030. Whereas, the concern of security is also on the main agenda of Rexas Finance since there was a recent audit conducted in the firm by the CertiK firm, which focuses on the security of the blockchain-based platform. Fundamentally, to investors, it assures the credibility of the project by removing doubtful aspects of the financial outlook. Can Dogecoin Outpace Competitors Like Rexas Finance? The rivalry between meme coins and more practical use cases like Rexas Finance makes the crypto space even more exciting. As a payment option choice, Dogecoin has shown high demand, and it amplifies the ability in price movements through the support of the community and celebrities. However, it has a current market capitalization of $440 billion at a $3 target price, which might have issues in hitting such valuation targets as $10. On the other hand, Rexas Finance has taken a novel way of tokenizing RWAs and thus the company may be a profitable investment. Compared to traditional asset markets, illiquidity is resolved for the company and the idea offers an opportunity for more investors, especially those who want to identify long-term value.

Among them, a new crypto has emerged, offering massive growth potential. DTX Exchange (DTX) is dominating the list of cryptos to watch in 2025 despite being in its presale stage. Although Sui (SUI) and Hedera (HBAR) are also rallying, DTX Exchange has already proven to be the best cryptocurrency investment in the current market. Are you looking for an investment that will deliver huge returns in 2025? DTX, SUI, and HBAR could be the right picks. Here’s why! DTX Exchange: A New Crypto Dominating the Market with a Hybrid Blockchain The DTX Exchange network is underpinned by a hybrid blockchain, VulcanX, which has an exclusive design essential in maintaining the DTX platform’s operation. DTX Exchange is not meant only for traders. Non-traders are also served with several use cases. First, there are many tradable assets, including stocks, bonds, crypto, and other equity products, together with foreign currencies. The best part of using DTX Exchange is that some of the assets offered have up to 1000x leverage options linked, and there are nearly 120,000 asset classes. The possibility of success will increase as more users will enjoy access to better market positions. In that context, the DTX Black Club, a popular reward program for the most active and productive traders on the DTX Exchange platform, is accessible to successful traders. Interestingly, investors qualify for the club if they have $10,000 in their trading accounts. Users then get takebacks and weekly and monthly bonuses, influenced by the level of their activity on the platform. Furthermore, DTX Exchange developers installed a feature for Web3 fans, which makes simple Web3 actions on the Phoenix Wallet possible through various tools. Highly advanced functionality will soon be provided on the platform. With all these features and capabilities, the new crypto project has grown into one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. Sui Surges Amid Explosive Growth, Ranks Among the Cryptos to Watch in 2025 The Sui network has been expanding recently and enjoying accelerated adoption rates. On that note, the network exceeded 30 million active accounts and recorded a 500% gain in SUI’s value since August 2024. The token hit highs of $3.85 on November 18 and the current bull cycle is just starting. This surge has mainly been fueled by institutional investors who have purchased aggressively, with VanEck’s Sui ETN raising $102 million. Based on its technical analysis, SUI’s Relative Strength Index has persistently remained above 70%. This scenario highlights a strong bullish trend, indicating that parabolic growth is imminent for SUI, which makes it one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. SUI traded at $3.606 on November 24, up 6.77% in the last week. Market experts believe SUI can reach $3.796 this month, powered by the multiple developments in its network. Despite the recent SUI surge, investors are purchasing a new crypto, DTX, due to its massive growth potential. Hedera’s HBAR Surges Amid ETF News Hedera recently created a massive wave in the crypto space after rising by 37.67% to hit $0.1187. This growth was boosted heavily by Canary Capital after it confirmed that it had filed for an HBAR Spot ETF with the US SEC. This impressive milestone showed that there is unwavering investor confidence in HBAR’s potential, which was boosted by a growing market capitalization and a 32.93% increase in trading volume to exceed $1.23 billion. Market forecasts show that Hedera’s HBAR may exceed its year-to-date high of $0.1813, supported by growing trading volumes and ETF-related bullish momentum. Hedera’s HBAR traded at $0.1474 on November 24, up 74.48% in the last week. Market experts say HBAR will rise to $0.1575 this month, powered by multiple developments on its network. Despite the Hedera token price growth, investors are acquiring a new crypto, DTX, due to its long-term growth potential, making it the best cryptocurrency investment today. Hence, it is one of the best cryptos to watch today. DTX Emerges as the Best Cryptocurrency Investment Option Alongside SUI and HBAR While Sui (SUI) and Hedera (HBAR) have recorded huge gains in this bull market, investors have discovered a new crypto, DTX Exchange (DTX), which has massive growth potential. This coin has many features and utilities that make it a viable long-term investment. Currently, in Stage 5 of its public presale, valued at $0.10, it has already delivered a 400% ROI for the early investors. On that note, DTX has created a huge opportunity for investors seeking the best cryptocurrency investment in the current bull run. It will surge by 100% at the end of this presale when it gets listed on mainstream markets at $0.20. With that growth potential, DTX undoubtedly joins SUI and HBAR among the best cryptos to watch in 2025.

That's the biggest drop since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, sparking a rally that sent the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization soaring from a level of around $66,000 through its record high.  Even so, the slide isn't out of the ordinary. In bull markets bitcoin typically tumbles as much as 20% or even 30%, so-called corrections that tend to flush out leverage in an overheated market.   A large part of the reason the bitcoin price didn't get to $100,000 was the amount of profit-taking that took place. A record dollar value of $10.5 billion of profit-taking took place on Nov. 21, according to Glassnode data, the biggest day of profit-taking ever witnessed in bitcoin.   At the root of the action are the long-term holders (LTH), a group Glassnode defines as having held their bitcoin for more than 155 days. These investors are considered ""smart money"" because they tend to buy when the BTC price is depressed and sell in times of greed or euphoria.   From September to November 2024, these investors have sold 549,119 BTC, or about 3.85% of their holdings. Their sales, which started in October and have accelerated since, even outweighed buying from the likes of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and the U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).      How long is this selling pressure going to last?   What's noticeable from patterns in previous bull markets in 2017, 2021 and early 2024, is that the percentage drop gets smaller each cycle.   In 2017, the percentage drop was 25.3%, in 2021 it reached 13.4% and earlier this year it was 6.51%. It's currently 3.85%. If this rate of decline were to continue, that would see another 1.19% drop or 163,031 BTC, which would take the cohort's supply to 13.54 million BTC.   Each time, the long-term investors' supply makes higher lows and higher highs, so this would also be in line with the trend.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/bitcoin-long-term-holders-have-163-k-more-btc-to-sell-history-indicates-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17dfcb42b00e7b5b47fff6432e9930a8d40b7da8-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ten years ago, most people saw a meme; an aspirational investor saw promise. At $0.00021, they made a small investment which later turned into millions. Now the same legendary investor is calling Rexas Finance (RXS) the next DOGE, anticipating a stunning climb from $0.09 to $9—a 100x return. Should history repeat itself, RXS could be the narrative we will be discussing 10 years from now. Why has RXS taken the front stage? Rexas Finance is a breakthrough idea using blockchain technology that links real-world assets (RWAs) rather than merely another cryptocurrency. At presale Stage 7 RXS is priced at $0.09 as of writing. From its Stage 1 price of $0.03, it has seen a 200% rise already. With over 90% of the presale stage 7 filled, this is the time for investors to act before the price leaps another 17.11% to $0.10 in the following stage 8. From Memes to Mainstream: Learning from DOGE Although Dogecoin began as a joke, a concept of distributed finance and community support drove its explosive ascent. Though with a pragmatic edge, RXS embodies the same energy. It is more than just a token since it aims to innovate the trillion-dollar industries which include the following: The global real estate market is stated to be worth over $379.7 trillion. The ‘Gold and Commodities’ market worth is stated to be at $121.2 trillion. And also the art and collectibles market with a $65 billion-a-year market volume Rexas Finance tokenizes these assets such that anyone, anywhere may access them. With a few clicks, picture purchasing a fraction of a luxury house or a piece of great art. That is the strength of RXS. Why Investors Are Flocking to Rexas Finance (RXS) In early 2025, Rexas Finance is poised to debut at $0.20 on three out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges in the world. That by itself shows a 170% increase from the price of today. Its expected ascent to $9, a 9,900% increase, however, is the true miracle. Like those who gambled on DOGE 10 years ago, early investors stood to win handsomely. Rexas Finance has given its community top priority unlike many initiatives supported by venture money. This grassroots approach guarantees that early adopters, not large organizations gain most of the benefits. Selling 217 million RXS tokens, the presale has therefore generated almost $13.7 million as of writing. One of the most reputable brands in blockchain security, Certik, has completely audited Rexas Finance. Additionally, Rexas Finance has been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko for real-time tracking and reliable information. The foundations of the RXS ecology are openness and trust. Real-World Applications: Beyond Speculation Anyone may tokenize actual assets with the Rexas Token Builder; no coding is needed. This creates investment prospects once only available to the rich. Fractional ownership allows you to own a portion of a luxury property, a gold bar, or even a well-known painting. The Rexas Launchpad lets companies and people fundraise for their token initiatives. This promotes innovation in many sectors and democratizes money availability. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is holding a $1 million RXS giveaway to honor its presale success. With almost 279,000 entries as of writing, 20 lucky winners will each get RXS valued at $50,000. Share and finish activities on the Rexas Finance website to increase your chances. The Clock Is Ticking: RXS is the Next DOGE The presale is proceeding quickly, and the price won't remain at $0.09 for very long given Stage 7 is nearly filled. Early, life-changing opportunities will vanish after it launches at $0.20 on 3 out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Can you afford to miss the next 100x cryptocurrency identified by the fabled DOGE investor? History tends to repeat. Rexas Finance presents a 100x gain opportunity, the same as Dogecoin which turned early believers into millionaires. Among the crowded crypto market, it stands out for its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, great community support, and explosive development possibilities. Don’t wait—RXS has been identified as the next big thing by a legendary Dogecoin investor who predicts a $9 target for 2025. Join the RXS presale now and be part of writing the next great crypto success story!

36865061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654988,1732618934,Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies,"If you’re trying to navigate the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, you’ll need a PR agency. In the best of times, you need a media partner to get your business’s name out there and keep it in the minds of customers.

Finally, the agency leverages its extensive network of publications to make sure it is well-placed. Blonde might be pricier than others on the list but they work only with the best of the best. 5. FinPR For a lot of businesses, crypto PRs aren’t being released just for themselves but in a bid to court mainstream attention.

In his latest video, crypto analyst Rodney (@cryptojourneyrs) shared an analysis of the price potential in the post-Gensler era. At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading at $1.43, reflecting a remarkable 172% increase over the past month. The market capitalization had soared to $81 billion, accompanied by $22 billion in daily trading volume. “XRP is starting to return to its normal spot in crypto, being one of the dominant altcoins,” Rodney remarked. Why XRP Is Poised To Surge Higher In his video, Rodney suggests that Trump’s promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office may have influenced Gensler’s decision to resign preemptively. “Gary Gensler is going to be stepping down from his role as the chair of the SEC January 20th, the same day Trump is going to be inaugurated,” Rodney stated. “Trump promised to fire Gary Gensler on day one, so I think Gary Gensler wanted to go out on his shield and resign on his own.” Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? Reflecting on the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, Rodney noted the significant impact it had on the price and market perception. “When the SEC sued Ripple, [XRP] price dipped 50%. This was one of many lawsuits that the SEC and Gary Gensler filed against many different crypto projects. It seemed like they were trying to regulate the space out of existence,” Rodney stated. He pointed out that despite the legal challenges, XRP remained a top cryptocurrency. “Even through all the BS, XRP has still been a top crypto and it really hasn’t fallen out of the top 10 in many years,” he said. Rodney also discussed Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC in July 2023, which set a significant precedent in the crypto industry. However, he expressed surprise that the price did not react more positively at the time. “When we heard about that news of them partially beating the SEC, XRP started to pump to around $0.67 but then promptly dipped down to about $0.50 and didn’t really do anything,” he observed. “It wasn’t moving with the cryptocurrency market at all… It was a running joke that it was kind of our favorite stablecoin.” Turning to the political landscape, Rodney explained: “Donald Trump actually ended up destroying Kamala Harris and is going to be the next president of the United States,” he stated. He emphasized Trump’s pro-crypto stance, noting that he was “much more open about supporting crypto” and was “the first president to purchase anything with cryptocurrency.” Rodney highlighted the involvement of various crypto projects in political campaigns, mentioning that “many cryptocurrency products were funding both candidates’ campaigns behind the scenes.” Related Reading: XRP To Hit $40 In 3 Months But On This Condition – Analyst With the political shift, Rodney expressed optimism about the future integration of cryptocurrency into government systems. “Now more than ever, it seems like cryptocurrency is going to be involved with our government, and in my opinion, XRP is going to be up there with the top projects,” he asserted. He elaborated on XRP’s core objectives, stating, “What is XRP trying to do? They want to be used for international money transfers They want to enable fast and low-cost international money transfers and currency exchanges.” He suggested that with supportive figures in government, XRP could realize this potential. How High Can XRP Price Go? Rodney also delved into his price predictions for XRP, considering various market capitalization scenarios. If XRP were to achieve Ethereum’s market cap of approximately $400 billion, it would result in a 4.9x increase from its current price, bringing XRP to around $6.98. “Say, for example, XRP becomes a part of our government and we actually use it for its real utility. Everyone uses it, and it magically got the same market cap size of Ethereum,” he speculated. Imagining XRP reaching Bitcoin’s market cap of about $2 trillion, he calculated a 24x increase, which would place XRP at approximately $33. “Let’s fantasize a little crazier […] Say we gave it Bitcoin’s market cap size that’s currently sitting around $2 trillion,” he mused. He considered a $10 XRP, corresponding to a $600 billion market cap, as a reasonable possibility. “I think that a $10 XRP or an XRP with a $600 billion market cap size is reasonable,” he concluded. However, Rodney acknowledged the challenges inherent in these predictions, noting that “it would be tough for any cryptocurrency project to hit those market cap sizes because Bitcoin’s dominating the entire market right now.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.40.

This unprecedented move tokenizes Abrdn’s $4.77 billion US dollar Liquidity Fund, a serious step toward connecting traditional finance with the world of blockchain. Ripple and Archax forge a strategic partnership. Ripple’s collaboration with Archax allows the access of Abrdn’s Liquidity Fund to professional investors through a regulated tokenization platform. Given the expertise of Archax in the management of tokenized assets, this will further Ripple’s mission of bringing RWAs on-chain. The initiative gives an investment offering greater efficiency by leveraging the robust infrastructure of the XRP Ledger for seamless end-to-end cash settlement. Unlocking Blockchain Benefits Ripple focused on the operational and cost-saving benefits of tokenization. Duncan Moir, Abrdn’s senior investment manager, added that putting investments and settlements on-chain greatly enhances efficiency without sacrificing transparency and security. This launch underlines Ripple’s commitment to extend blockchain’s role in transforming asset management. A Vision for a $16 Trillion Market This puts Ripple squarely in the crosshairs of the fast-growing RWA market, which Boston Consulting Group estimates will reach $16 trillion by 2030. Today, tokenized money market funds have more than $1 billion in assets under management. Ripple is positioning itself to take advantage of this increasing market share and to go head-to-head with industry giant BlackRock. Competitive Advantage of Ripple Ethereum dominance hovers at $3.07 billion, followed by Stellar with $386.2 million. Ripple is not in the race to up the ante in the tokenized RWA space. Focusing on tokenized government securities and commodities, Ripple is trying hard to excel in the tokenization ecosystem. Ripple’s Market Surge XRP, the native token of Ripple, surged 27.9% in the last week to $1.43. This is indicative of market confidence in Ripple’s continuous innovations and its leading a blockchain initiative in finance.

Source: TradingView The 8-hour chart for the $BTC price gives a feast of information. It shows how $BTC failed to exit the top of the bull flag, and then rolled over, fell through the bottom of the flag, and ended up sinking below the ascending trendline. It also looks like the price was in an ascending channel. This broke down as well, as is generally the case with these patterns. The price has met the measured move out of the bull flag channel, but still hasn’t gone down to the measured move from the larger ascending channel. This would take the price down to $90,000 if it played out. Instead, it rather looks like the price has been caught by the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $92,890. The deepest Fibonacci level for this move is the 0.786 which is at $91,000. Finally, the Stochastic RSI, which signals price momentum, is at the bottom, meaning that a cross back up could be forthcoming. Weekly price momentum has topped out Source: TradingView Looking out at the weekly time frame, it can be seen that the price has held at the ascending trendline. However, a real point of concern is that the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has just experienced a cross-down of the indicators from the top. As can be observed from the Stochastic RSI, going back as far as the bull market of 2021, there aren’t many fake-outs of this indicator. In fact, there is only September 2021, and March 2023. That said, there is still the rest of the week to go, and it will only be at the end of the day on Sunday that this cross-down could be confirmed.

Từ năm 2020, dưới sự dẫn dắt của Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy đã mạnh tay gom Bitcoin về kho, biến nó thành tài sản dự trữ chính. Giờ đây, họ sở hữu hơn 331.200 BTC, trị giá khoảng 32 tỷ USD – một con số không hề nhỏ! Chiến lược “liều ăn nhiều” Để mua được ngần ấy Bitcoin, MicroStrategy đã không ngần ngại phát hành trái phiếu, bán cổ phiếu, thậm chí dùng cả tiền mặt từ hoạt động kinh doanh. Họ tin rằng Bitcoin là “vàng kỹ thuật số”, là lá chắn chống lạm phát hiệu quả hơn hẳn những tài sản truyền thống. Nói cách khác, họ đang đặt cược tất tay vào Bitcoin! Cổ phiếu MicroStrategy – phiên bản chứng khoán của Bitcoin? Điều thú vị là, cổ phiếu của MicroStrategy cũng tăng giá phi mã theo đà tăng của Bitcoin. Nhiều nhà đầu tư coi cổ phiếu MicroStrategy như một cách gián tiếp để đầu tư vào Bitcoin, đặc biệt là những tổ chức không được phép trực tiếp mua bán tiền điện tử. Thế là, cổ phiếu MicroStrategy bỗng chốc trở thành “ETF Bitcoin trá hình”, thu hút dòng tiền đổ vào ào ạt. Nhưng mà, “quá liều” liệu có tốt? Chiến lược của MicroStrategy giống như một cú xoay vòng tiền vô hạn vậy. Họ dùng tiền truyền thống để mua Bitcoin, giá Bitcoin tăng thì giá cổ phiếu cũng tăng, họ lại có thêm tiền để mua Bitcoin… Cứ thế, vòng tuần hoàn này tự củng cố và đẩy giá trị của cả Bitcoin lẫn cổ phiếu MicroStrategy lên cao. Tuy nhiên, trò chơi này cũng đầy rủi ro. Nếu Bitcoin lao dốc, cổ phiếu MicroStrategy cũng sẽ rơi tự do. Lúc đó, họ sẽ phải đối mặt với áp lực trả nợ, thậm chí phải bán tháo Bitcoin để cầm cự. Tương lai nào cho MicroStrategy? Dù sao đi nữa, MicroStrategy đã tạo ra một cú hích lớn trên thị trường tài chính. Họ cho thấy sự giao thoa giữa tài chính truyền thống và tiền điện tử có thể tạo ra cả cơ hội lẫn thách thức. Liệu chiến lược táo bạo này sẽ đưa MicroStrategy đến thành công hay thất bại? Chỉ có thời gian mới trả lời được. Tóm lại là: MicroStrategy đã all-in vào Bitcoin với hy vọng làm giàu nhanh chóng. Cách làm này vừa táo bạo, vừa liều lĩnh, và chứa đựng đầy rủi ro. Nhưng dù sao, đây cũng là một câu chuyện thú vị đáng để theo dõi trong thế giới tiền điện tử đầy biến động này!

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced his resignation, and will likely be replaced by former SEC Chair Jay Clayton. It was also recently announced that Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev will remain in pre-trial detention. The SEC’s annual report revealed that the regulator reported record financial remedies of $8.2 billion for 2024, which was driven by a settlement with Terraform Labs. Swan Bitcoin Takes Legal Action Against Law Firm Financial services company Swan Bitcoin filed a lawsuit against its legal counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, for legal malpractice. The dispute started after Gibson’s decision to hire lawyer Barry Berke, who represents Tether. The stablecoin issuer is one of Swan’s competitors. Swan accused the law firm of prioritizing Tether’s interests over its own, despite initially taking on Swan as a client to handle a legal battle against Tether and former employees. According to the lawsuit that was filed in California’s Superior Court on Nov. 22, Swan claims Gibson “wooed and won” the company as a client but later embraced Tether, leaving Swan without proper legal representation. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten even reportedly received a call from a Gibson attorney advising that the firm could no longer represent Swan because of a potential conflict of interest stemming from Berke’s hiring. The legal battle between Swan and Gibson was filed on the heels of a separate lawsuit Swan filed in September against former employees that were accused of stealing software code to launch a rival crypto-mining company called Proton Management. Swan claims Proton persuaded Tether to sever ties with Swan and support Proton instead. While Tether is not directly named as a defendant in this case, the implications of its involvement certainly fueled the tensions between Swan and Gibson. On Nov. 24, Gibson filed to withdraw as Swan’s legal counsel in the Proton lawsuit due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The firm alleged that Swan refused to pay outstanding legal fees and demanded millions of dollars in compensation to avoid opposing Gibson’s withdrawal. In response, Swan also filed for a temporary restraining order on Nov. 25 to prevent Gibson from exiting the case and to block the firm from formally representing Tether. Swan argues that Gibson’s actions violate the “Hot Potato” Rule, which is an ethical guideline prohibiting lawyers from dropping clients to resolve conflicts of interest. The Superior Court of California is scheduled to hear Swan’s request for a restraining order on Nov. 26. The outcome could have a big impact on both Swan’s case against Proton and Gibson’s ability to continue its representation of Tether. High-Profile Crypto Attorney Damian Williams Steps Down Another lawyer involved in the crypto space also made headlines recently. Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced his resignation ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s anticipated nomination of a replacement in January. Williams held the position since 2021, but will step down effective Dec. 13. He will be handing over responsibilities to Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim, the current Deputy U.S. Attorney. During his tenure, Williams led many high-profile cases involving crypto executives, including former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and several others tied to the exchange and Alameda Research. Williams was appointed by President Joe Biden, and has been a prominent figure in crypto-related enforcement actions. His expected successor is Jay Clayton, a former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair and Wall Street insider with ties to firms like Goldman Sachs and digital asset management platform Fireblocks. Clayton’s nomination is a sign of potential shifts in the direction of crypto enforcement in the Southern District of New York, which is a jurisdiction that is known for handling major financial and crypto-related cases, including those against OneCoin scheme creators. While it is still unclear how Clayton will approach crypto enforcement, recent comments from officials in the district suggest a possible reduction in these cases. Scott Hartman, a member of the office’s fraud task force, revealed on Nov. 15 that prosecutors plan to scale back the number of crypto-related cases. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams The announcement was made as the office prepares for the Jan. 28 trial of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. The trial is set to take place after Trump’s inauguration but likely before a new U.S. Attorney is confirmed. Tornado Cash Developer's Legal Battle Continues In other legal news, the developer of the Tornado Cash crypto mixing protocol, Alexey Pertsev, will remain in pre-trial detention . The decision raised quite a few eyebrows among developers of privacy-preserving technologies. Pertsev faces money laundering-related charges, and is very disappointed over the court’s decision. In a Nov. 21 post, he stated that his extended detention impedes his ability to prepare for an appeal. Tornado Cash is a non-custodial mixing protocol that does not hold or control user funds, but it still faced a lot of scrutiny from regulators. In 2022, the U.S. government sanctioned the platform due to its use for laundering illicit funds. Despite these sanctions, Tornado Cash saw an increase in activity. It even recorded about $1.8 billion in deposits in the first half of 2024, which was up 45% from 2023. On Nov. 14, Democratic lawmakers in the United States demanded answers from Treasury officials about ongoing efforts to address the platform's operation. Pertsev’s legal troubles started with allegations that Tornado Cash facilitated the laundering of $1.2 billion in illicit assets. In May, Dutch judges at the s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal found Pertsev guilty and sentenced him to over five years in prison. During his trial in March, Pertsev argued that he could not be held responsible for the actions of users who misused the protocol. However, the court rejected his defense, and stated that the developers failed to implement safeguards that were good enough to prevent criminal exploitation of the platform. Because of this, the case caused widespread concern in the privacy tech community. Developers worry that the outcome sets a precedent where people who create privacy-preserving tools could be held liable for how others use them. Matthew Niemerg, the co-founder and president of AlephZero, pointed out that future privacy protocols have to incorporate features that ensure legal compliance to navigate the regulations. SEC Nets Record Penalties If a Trump administration brings about change in how crypto legislation and regulation is approached, it will be a great relief to many. In fact, the SEC reported a record-breaking $8.2 billion in financial remedies for the fiscal year 2024, despite a 26% drop in enforcement cases compared to the previous year. The milestone was revealed in the SEC’s annual report that was released on Nov. 22. The record-breaking year was largely attributed to a $4.47 billion settlement with Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon. This settlement stemmed from fraud charges related to the 2022 collapse of Terraform’s blockchain ecosystem that caused billions in losses. It is, however, important to keep in mind that without the Terraform settlement, the SEC’s total collections would have been $3.72 billion, which could have been its lowest since 2013 when it brought in $3.4 billion. The agency recorded $2.1 billion in penalties and a record $6.1 billion in disgorgement. In the report, outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler shared that the agency is still very much committed to holding wrongdoers accountable. During Gensler’s leadership, the SEC intensified its focus on crypto, and peaked with 46 crypto-related enforcement actions in 2023. However, the number of crypto cases dropped to 11 in 2024, but fines still soared by more than 3,000%.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6247/swan-bitcoin-sues-law-firm-over-alleged-favoritism-toward-tether,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

It’s doing so through the launch of a new stableswap trading pair for STX/stSTX tokens, which is available now on its decentralized exchange platform. Stacking is crucial for Stacks , one of the leading decentralized networks bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin. Stacking really just means staking, where STX token holders lock their funds into smart contracts to support validators who process transactions on the L2, boosting its security. But one of the primary differences between Stacking and staking other tokens is that users don’t earn the native token as rewards, but rather BTC. It’s in the interest of Stacks and other projects built atop of it, like Velar, to entice more STX holders to stake their tokens and boost the strength of the network, and that’s what the new stableswap pair STX/stSTX is all about. Traditionally, Stackers have to wait a while to unlock their staked STX tokens, which means they’re unable to access their capital when they need it. With the new trading pair on Velar, users can quickly swap stSTX tokens, which are dished out to Stackers on a 1:1 basis for every STX they stack, so they can quickly enter and exit a staking position, boosting capital efficiency. It makes sense for Velar to support the growth of Stacks in this way, as doing so will help to accelerate its broader mission of bringing greater utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem and BTC holders. Velar is a liquidity protocol that’s best known for its Bitcoin-based perpetuals and DEX platforms. It taps into Bitcoin’s security while leveraging Stacks to achieve greater scalability. Through its DEX and other offerings, Velar provides BTC holders with a way to use those funds as collateral in various DeFi protocols on Stacks. It’s playing a key role in the evolution of Bitcoin, as the world’s top cryptocurrency morphs from being a store of value to an asset that’s just as flexible as altcoins like ETH or SOL. Velar says the STX/stSTX trading pair will help to solve a growing liquidity challenge in the Stacks ecosystem. It does this in a couple of creative ways, using a specialized “stableswap curve” mechanism to enable swaps with lower slippage and reduced fees that are palatable to those holding big bags of STX and stSTX. In addition, Velar is going all out to encourage STX and stSTX holders to provide liquidity for its swaps with some enticing incentives. These include a share of the 5,000 VELAR daily rewards pool for liquidity providers, and the promise of a 50% increase in StackingDAO points earned by those who stack STX via that protocol. The StackingDAO points don’t amount to anything just yet, but in many projects “points” are awarded to users for their participation and engagement, and are later used to determine eligibility for airdrops and other token rewards. That’s why most Stackers are keen to amass as many points as they can, and providing liquidity to the STX/stSTX pool will be a great way to obtain even more. With such strong incentives, Velar is confident that it can attract enough liquidity to support even the largest institutional investors that need an efficient, low-cost way to swap thousands of STX tokens and their staked counterparts. It’s also good to see the increased unity within the Stacks ecosystem. StackingDAO, along with Velar, is one of the biggest protocols running on Stacks. It’s a liquid staking protocol for Stackers that allows them to unlock liquidity while providing added protections against impermanent loss to boost investor’s returns from yield farming activities. StackingDAO’s expertise is evident in the stableswap pool’s “upgradeable variable midpoint”, which is a feature that’s designed to protect LPs and limit any impermanent loss they might suffer. Velar Chief Marketing Officer Peter Watson said the launch is a “proud moment” for him and his team. “Collaborating with the talented StackingDAO team has been an incredible experience, and together, we’re setting a new benchmark for what’s possible in Bitcoin DeFi,” he insisted.

To put things into numerical context, one can see that as of 2024, the sector’s total market cap stands at an impressive $638.23 billion, with conservative projections suggesting exponential growth to around $3.68 trillion by 2034. Projected valuations associated with the AI market (source: Precedence Research) This remarkable trajectory stands as a testament to the increasing integration of AI technologies across different sectors, with a recent survey indicating that 72% of organizations globally have already embraced AI solutions as part of their day-to-day operations. Moreover, the impact of AI adoption has become particularly pronounced in larger organizations, where over 50% of companies (with more than 5,000 employees) have actively begun leveraging AI tools to maximize productivity. Lastly, the technology's influence on revenue generation has been equally impressive, with executives reporting an average 15.2% increase in revenue attributed to generative AI applications alone. Do digital doppelgangers present the next iteration of AI innovation? Imagine a world where an individual’s digital replica can attend meetings, provide consultations, or share their expertise while the individual can focus on other priorities — be it at work or home. This futuristic scenario is rapidly becoming a reality thanks to the concept of ‘AI twins,’ which, as the name suggests, are sophisticated digital avatars capable of authentically representing individuals in the real world (within various work capacities). These AI-powered counterparts don't merely offer automated responses but are designed to be intelligent entities capable of engaging in meaningful conversations, making informed decisions, and even capturing the subtle nuances of an individual’s personality. This innovative concept is currently being helmed by a project called the ‘Twin Protocol.’ It combines advanced AI algorithms with blockchain immutability to create authentic digital representations of any individual (that can learn and adapt from their human counterparts seamlessly). By employing neural-symbolic techniques derived from the OpenCog framework, Twin Protocol ensures that each digital twin accurately captures not just the knowledge but the essence of the individual it represents. The technology's applications can span various industries. For instance, within the realm of healthcare, AI twins can provide 24/7 access to medical expertise, offering personalized advice and support to patients worldwide. Similarly, in the manufacturing sector, digital twins can oversee complex operations, monitor production lines, and even suggest improvements based on their real-world counterparts' expertise. Additionally, in an era where data privacy concerns are paramount, Twin Protocol’s blockchain-based ‘Twin Vault’ ensures that users maintain complete control over their digital identity and information — allowing professionals to scale their presence while maintaining the integrity and security of their digital representation. Lastly, it bears mentioning that Twin Protocol’s innovative offerings have already attracted significant partnerships, including a collaboration with SingularityNET, led by Dr. Ben Goertzel. The project has also collaborated with CyberHuman.ai and DECTEC, resulting in the creation of digitaldeepak.ai, an AI twin of Dr. Deepak Chopra that provides personalized health and mindfulness guidance to users worldwide. The future of AI interactions As the AI industry continues to march toward a future driven by continuous monetary growth — with a projected CAGR of 36.6% between 2024 and 2030 — innovative firms like the Twin Protocol are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping its future. In fact, the anticipated creation of 97 million AI-related jobs by 2025 suggests not just market growth but a fundamental shift in how individuals will approach work, communication, and knowledge sharing in the near term. In this context, as organizations seek more personalized and scalable ways to leverage expertise and enhance productivity, the future of human-AI collaboration now stands at a precipice.

The reality, of course, is that our present lives are shaped by conflicts, creations, and calamities that were anything but inevitable. Bitcoin is the perfect case in point. While someone was bound to create a decentralized currency that worked at some point, it didn’t have to be Satoshi or Bitcoin.Crypto may be a multi-trillion dollar asset class today, but it could have all been so very different. In Bitcoin’s early days, the future of the fledgling crypto network was anything but assured when its survival was predicated upon that of a handful of developers, not least Satoshi himself. So how did we get here, and what changed for Bitcoin to go from being a bold experiment to a legitimate asset class? From Zero to One The story of cryptocurrency, from its early days as a niche experiment to its current status as a mainstream asset, is one of technological innovation, financial upheaval, and shifting perspectives. What began with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 as a decentralized alternative to traditional money has since evolved into a multifaceted ecosystem encompassing digital assets, decentralized finance, and institutional adoption. Along the way, influential figures and major events including the COVID-19 pandemic have played a role in moving Bitcoin in from the fringes to the center of the global financial system. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as a response to the shortcomings of centralized financial institutions. Its pseudonymous creator envisioned a world where individuals could transact directly with one another, free from intermediaries and its early adopters saw Bitcoin as a tool for financial sovereignty, but it was far from mainstream. Volatility, skepticism, and limited use cases kept it on the fringes of finance. For years, Bitcoin and subsequent cryptos were dismissed by traditional investors and institutions as a speculative bubble or technological curiosity at best. However, as the blockchain technology underpinning these assets proved its resilience and broad utility, attitudes began to shift. Turning Converts Into Evangelists Many of those we associate with being Bitcoin bulls today, including Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump, were once hesitant about crypto assets. They either dismissed Bitcoin out of hand or, in Trump’s case, directly trash-talked it. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, exemplifies the changing perspective of influential figures. Once skeptical of Bitcoin, Scaramucci has become a vocal advocate for its potential as a store of value and a solution to systemic issues in the financial system. In a recent podcast with Farzam Ehsani , CEO of VALR , Scaramucci explored Bitcoin’s role in addressing challenges such as U.S. debt and monetary policy. He emphasized the importance of education in overcoming misconceptions about crypto and highlighted the shift among traditional investors who now see Bitcoin as a credible component of a diversified portfolio. As the world has grappled with economic uncertainty, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent geopolitical tensions, influential voices from finance, politics, and technology have been forced to reassess the value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Scaramucci is not alone. Forged in Fire The COVID-19 pandemic marked a pivotal moment in the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency. As governments implemented unprecedented monetary stimulus to combat economic fallout, concerns over inflation and currency devaluation took center stage. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, gained renewed attention as a potential hedge against inflation – a role traditionally played by gold. Bitcoin was forged in fire, launching in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and it was only appropriate that it should come of age in the next major economic event to shake the world. Slowly, institutional investors began to take notice. Firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square made headlines by allocating portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. These moves signaled a shift in perception, with Bitcoin no longer viewed solely as a speculative asset but as “digital gold.” At the same time, the rise of decentralized finance demonstrated the broader capabilities of blockchain technology, from lending and borrowing to yield farming and asset tokenization. Slowly Then All at Once Crypto’s transition from magical internet money to mainstream financial asset has been 15 years in the making and it’s entailed plenty of setbacks along the way. From punitive regulators to shady industry operators, Bitcoin has had its share of bad publicity, both warranted and unwarranted. But its believers – first the tech geeks, and the mainstream investors and then the suits – have provided the financial and vocal backing to elevate Bitcoin from fringe currency to a universal store of value. Along the way, the entry of major financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and PayPal into the crypto space has helped to lend credibility to digital assets. The approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was the culmination of this trend, but there were plenty of innovations that had to be lain in the preceding years for this to happen, from more robust compliance for crypto exchanges to better custodial solutions. Blockchain networks have also become more scalable, efficient, and secure while the emergence of L2s and cross-chain interoperability have expanded the range of applications for cryptocurrencies. DeFi has evolved to incorporate new use cases and verticals, from RWAs to AI. All the while, macroeconomic factors, including fiat inflation and low interest rates, have driven interest in Bitcoin and other cryptos as an alternative store of value. Crypto Today: A Multifaceted Ecosystem Today, cryptocurrency is more than just Bitcoin and Bitcoin is more than just cryptocurrency: it’s transcended its original limitations to become a multi-purpose asset that works for everyone. Whether you’re trying to save for the future, send money cross-border, or earn a yield on your digital holdings, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are up to the task. As the value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to grind higher, and everyone from presidents to Wall Street CEOs signals their support, it’s instructive to ponder what else is left to achieve. It’s already won over the naysayers and assuaged the fears of the skeptics who dismissed it as a bubble or fad. What else is left to be achieved? One outcome of crypto’s rise has been in reshaping financial markets, prompting governments and regulators to respond more rapidly to emerging tech. In response, regulators are working to establish frameworks that balance innovation with oversight. The development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is just one example of how governments are adapting to the crypto era, seeking to harness blockchain technology without ceding control of money issuance. The journey of cryptocurrency from inception to its current status as a legitimate asset class is a testament to its resilience. There were plenty of times, particularly near the start, when everything from major bugs to the fall of major figures, threatened to put a spanner in the works before Bitcoin had gotten up to speed. But its early believers refused to give in, persevering even as the world’s press were writing Bitcoin’s umpteenth obituary. Bitcoin may have won. But it could all have been so very different were it not for the support of the OG miners, the latecomers, the institutions, and the maverick CEOs. Whether early or late to the party, everyone who’s ever bought Bitcoin has played their part elevating it into the mainstream financial asset it is today.

The number of blobs or binary large objects posted to Ethereum has consistently averaged more than 21,000 this month, matching the record activity seen in March, according to pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby's Dune Analytics dashboard.  Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, which went live earlier this year, introduced blobs, which attach large data chunks to regular transactions, storing data offchain without congesting the mainnet, unlike call data which is stored permanently. Think of blobs as a consolidated large box filled with letters while paying for an entire box instead of call data, which is akin to paying for each letter posted separately.  The spike in the number of Blobs posted points to increased adoption of layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, Optimism and others. These protocols use blobs to bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then post them to the Ethereum main chain for verification.  ""Transactions for ETH and its L2s are continuing to reach all-time highs, now +40% vs. the Summer. Meanwhile, the average blob count has increased ~20% driving L2's Blob Fees to a 30-day high,"" Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said on X.  Blobspace is a dedicated area within Ethereum's blocks where layer 2s temporarily post their data, but it comes with a cost, depending on network conditions. Note that these blob fees paid in Ethereum's native token ether are burned just as transaction fees, taking out the cryptocurrency's circulating supply from the market. This contradicts the popular narrative that layer-2 protocols are predatory to the mainchain.  The blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 166 ETH worth $560,000 in the past seven days, the ninth largest, according to ultrasound.money.  ""Blob fees have historically been very low since the implementation of blobs in EIP4844 as they have their own fee market which has largely not seen price discovery. Recently, as onchain activity has begun to spike, demand for blobspace on the L1 has increased, and the blob fee market has entered price discovery,"" Artemis said in the newsletter.   The data suggests potential ether outperformance ahead. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose to a four-month high of $3,546 Monday, outperforming bitcoin's 5% drop, but has since pulled back to $3,370, CoinDesk data show.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/ethereum-blob-usage-explodes-as-traders-rush-to-layer-2-solutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01c56ac9804858faba9dc4370103ac930c630dbe-1388x798.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
36861593,https://coinpaper.com/6249/pump-fun-suspends-live-streaming-after-reports-of-abusive-content,1732612119,Pump.fun Suspends Live Streaming After Reports of Abusive Content,"Solana's blockchain ecosystem has made headlines recently with a mix of groundbreaking milestones and pressing challenges. On one hand, the platform's native token, SOL, surged over 60% this month, fueled by record-breaking decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and renewed investor enthusiasm following the US presidential election results. At the same time, the meme coin-focused platform Pump.fun, a key player in Solana's rise, has indefinitely suspended its live-streaming feature due to concerns over abusive content. Solana-Based Pump.fun Halts Live Streaming Amid Reports of Abusive Content The Solana-based meme coin platform Pump.fun announced on Monday that it has indefinitely suspended its live-streaming feature. The decision comes in the wake of alarming reports of abusive content being shared via the platform, including incidents involving child abuse, bestiality, and suicidal threats. The live-streaming functionality, introduced earlier this year, was initially designed to help users promote their meme coins, a core feature of the Pump.fun ecosystem. However, the misuse of the feature by some individuals for ”heinous” purposes has forced the platform to act swiftly to protect its community. In a community notice issued on Monday, Pump.fun’s team emphasized their commitment to user safety, explaining the rationale behind their decision: “To ensure the absolute safety of our users, we will be pausing the live streaming functionality on the site for an indefinite time period until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity,” the team stated. “Moving forward, we will be significantly more transparent about rules and regulations of using the site by publishing guidelines. We will also provide creators and users greater visibility into individual moderation decisions to ensure everyone understands the process and outcomes.” The platform also pledged to prioritize the development of a robust moderation system capable of handling the complexities of live-streamed content, alongside a renewed focus on transparency and clear community guidelines. Pump.fun serves as a launchpad for Solana-based meme coins, enabling users to create, promote, and trade their own tokens with relative ease. This unique offering has made the platform a significant player in the meme coin space, attracting a wide audience and substantial revenue. On Nov. 24, Pump.fun achieved an impressive milestone, generating $5.31 million in daily revenue. However, the rapid growth and heightened activity have also exposed vulnerabilities in the platform’s content moderation processes. The suspension of Pump.fun’s live-streaming feature brings attention to the broader challenges faced by platforms operating in the decentralized and relatively unregulated blockchain space. Live-streamed content presents unique moderation hurdles, particularly when paired with the anonymity often associated with crypto users. Pump.fun is not the first platform to grapple with these issues. Other blockchain-based social and content-sharing platforms have faced similar criticism over their inability to effectively moderate harmful or abusive content. For Pump.fun, the misuse of live streaming has not only raised ethical concerns but also posed potential legal and reputational risks. A Path Forward: Moderation and Transparency The indefinite suspension of live streaming is just the first step in Pump.fun’s efforts to restore trust and safety within its community. By promising enhanced transparency, the platform aims to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring accountability. Transparency will play a key role in these efforts, with Pump.fun committing to publishing clear rules and guidelines for platform usage. Additionally, providing users with greater insight into moderation decisions may help demystify the process, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or disputes. Despite the current challenges, the platform’s ability to adapt and implement necessary changes could solidify its position as a leader in the meme coin space, particularly if it demonstrates a robust commitment to user safety and ethical practices. The Pump.fun case also shows the growing pains of the wider cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. As adoption increases, platforms must navigate the tension between decentralization and the need for effective oversight. Features like live streaming—while innovative—can become conduits for harm without adequate safeguards. The crypto industry at large may view Pump.fun’s experience as a cautionary tale, spurring similar platforms to invest in preemptive moderation systems and clearer user policies. This incident could serve as a pivotal moment, pushing decentralized projects to adopt practices that prioritize safety and accountability without stifling innovation. Solana’s SOL Soars 61.5% Amid Memecoin Frenzy and US Presidential Election Results Meanwhile, Solana's native token, SOL, has experienced a meteoric rise, surging 61.5% from Nov. 5 to Nov. 22 and reaching an all-time high of $263. This remarkable rally has outpaced broader altcoin gains, which rose 58% during the same period, and aligns with Bitcoin nearing the highly anticipated $100,000 milestone. The surge in SOL is attributed to a confluence of factors, including the recent victory of President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 US Presidential election and unprecedented activity on the Solana network. The platform has seen explosive growth in its decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and on-chain metrics, driven by the resurgence of the meme coin frenzy. On Nov. 25, Solana’s monthly DEX trading volume crossed the $100 billion mark, setting a new record at $109.8 billion, according to DefiLlama. This figure dwarfs Ethereum's monthly DEX volume of $55 billion and represents a 109% increase from Solana’s October trading volume of $52.5 billion. Additional records include: Daily DEX volume peaking at $7.14 billion on Nov. 18. Weekly DEX volume hitting $41.6 billion during the week ending Nov. 17. These milestones show Solana’s dominance in the DeFi space and the growing adoption of its blockchain for trading activities. The previous monthly high was set in March, when Solana’s DEX trading volume reached $59.8 billion, fueled by a similar meme coin boom. The meme coin frenzy has been a significant driver of Solana’s performance. Platforms like Pump.fun and Raydium DEX have amplified network activity, attracting users with low transaction fees and a user-friendly ecosystem. Moreover, Solana’s active address count soared to nearly 25 million in November, according to data from Glassnode . Crypto analyst Aylo highlighted Solana’s growing prominence on X, stating, “Solana is the dominant chain by most metrics right now and has the largest share of DEX volume.” Aylo also noted that SOL’s market cap is approximately 29.5% of Ethereum’s, with room for continued repricing. SOL’s price action is underpinned by bullish technical indicators. The token recently broke above a rounded bottom chart pattern on the weekly chart, signaling the potential for further upside. The chart pattern’s technical target is $300, representing a 19% increase from the current price levels. The relative strength index (RSI), currently at 70, remains in the positive region, supporting the bullish narrative. However, an RSI of 70 also signals slightly overbought conditions, which could trigger a short-term correction toward the neckline of the rounded bottom pattern at $200. Solana’s ecosystem is not only dominating in terms of DEX volumes but also outshining competitors across multiple metrics: The platform’s low transaction fees and high throughput make it an attractive alternative to Ethereum for decentralized applications (dApps) and traders. On-chain activity and developer engagement continue to rise, bolstered by Solana’s reputation for scalability and efficiency. Analysts are optimistic about SOL’s prospects as it cements its position as a leader in the blockchain space. Trump’s Victory: A Catalyst for Market Optimism President-elect Donald Trump’s win in the US 2024 Presidential election has injected bullish sentiment into the broader cryptocurrency market. Market participants anticipate crypto-friendly policies and a potential push for regulatory clarity, fueling demand for digital assets. This optimism has also contributed to Bitcoin’s rally, as the flagship cryptocurrency flirts with the $100,000 mark. As Solana rides the wave of the meme coin boom and strong on-chain performance, the blockchain faces challenges in maintaining this momentum. Overbought conditions in SOL’s price and heightened competition from Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains could pose risks. Nonetheless, Solana’s ability to deliver scalable, cost-effective solutions positions it as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape. If the network can sustain its growth and capitalize on new opportunities, SOL may continue its upward trajectory, potentially surpassing its $300 target.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6249/pump-fun-suspends-live-streaming-after-reports-of-abusive-content,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

DOT's recent inflation rate reduction and decreased unstaking period are bullish moves, attracting new investors without long lock-in periods. Cardano's partnership with Polkadot and the future Polkadot 2.0 and JAM updates are major catalysts for DOT's growth and adoption. While the easy money in Solana has already been made, DOT's robust developer community and potential catalysts present a compelling investment opportunity. I believe that Polkadot is likely to be one of the best performing Crypto currencies over the next 6 months. This is not an easy call to make given the extremes to which DOT has underperformed the crypto market (and to a larger degree Solana) in 2024. The below graph highlights how Solana’s +1000% rise to the 3rd largest crypto project dwarfs Polkadot’s 48% growth. Seeking Alpha But due to a series of upcoming catalysts, a robust developer ecosystem, and a massive ceiling for growth compared to that of Solana, I believe 2025 will be Polkadot's time to shine. This article is meant to directly address PropNotes article, “ Polkadot Is Falling Behind, Short DOT And Buy Solana Instead ”, and while I highly respect their research as some of the best due diligence on Seeking Alpha, I respectfully disagree with their call of using Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) as a short hedge. Polkadot isn't building a meme coin generator, NFT marketplace, a DEX, or anything that is currently in demand. They are building a global super computer the likes of which has never been seen, and I believe that when they succeed, demand for the coin will follow. The Competition It’s worth noting that these two cryptocurrencies operate with radically different purposes and are not in direct competition. I believe it’s highly likely that they will both see success in their corresponding missions. Solana competes directly with Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). It’s faster and cheaper than ETH due to its pioneering technology of “Proof of History” and strict hardware requirements, which has led to SOL’s rise in popularity as it processes over 15,000 transactions per second compared to Ethereum’s 15TPS. The main argument against Solana is that it is far more centralized than Ethereum. Polkadot, on the other hand, seeks to operate as a communication layer between currencies. Where Ethereum and Solana are competing layer 1 currencies, both with wide arrays of Layer 2 projects utilizing their blockchains, DOT seeks to be a layer 0 allowing for Solana and Ethereum (or any other crypto project) to operate over top of it and communicate seamlessly with each other. While most crypto projects are competitive by nature, the purpose of DOT is inherently cooperative. It operates under the assumption that one cryptocurrency will never take over the entire market, as different projects will be better suited for different purposes. That said, Polkadot has its own competition in the interoperability space as new projects like Aptos ( APT-USD ), Sui ( SUI-USD ), and Sei ( SEI-USD ) come to market. For this reason, it is important that DOT continues to innovate and improve with its strong developer base. A Community Focused on Development over Marketing The comparison below highlights how robust the Polkadot developer ecosystem is. Despite being the 18th largest Crypto by market capitalization, it has the 2nd most full-time developers behind Ethereum and frankly blows most projects out of the water. For comparison, Ripple (XRP-USD), the 6th largest crypto by market cap, has just 33 full-time developers. Chart is my own, data from developerreport.com Even with DOT’s price struggling in 2024 while Solana hype exploded, it still has more full-time developers and only slightly lagged in monthly active developers. On the marketing front, Polkadot’s X account posts a little over half as often as Solana’s with content focused around attracting developers rather than attracting investors. One of Polkadot’s latest tweets advertised a whopping $89million programming prize (the largest in history) for implementing their JAM protocol. X Catalyst 1: Inflation and Staking Overhaul One of the biggest bear cases against Polkadot is its high rate of inflation. Back in September, Dot’s inflation rate was 10% compared to Solana’s sub 5%. Holders can stake their DOT and receive high staking rewards to help offset this high inflation, but this requires locking in for at least 21 days. This turned away anyone without a rock solid belief in Polkadot as it forced the buyer to forego flexibility by locking away their DOT or else face massive dilution. However, this month the project opted to lower inflation to 8% and to continue to decrease it year by year. In addition, over the next few months the project will be decreasing the unstaking time from 21 days to 2 days. I believe this is an incredibly bullish move for DOT, as new investors can take a shot at the project and stake for rewards without committing to 21 days. While it’s still quite high for an inflation rate, it’s a step in the right direction. Polkadot Wiki Catalyst 2: Cardano Collaboration, More to Follow Cardano ( ADA-USD ) and Polkadot recently announced their cooperation and intent to form a “bridge” and connect Cardano to the Polkadot project. This will mark the largest projects to partner with Polkadot and is a massive vote of confidence for the technology of DOT. As their entire purpose is the connection of communities, this cooperation announcement can’t be overstated. I believe this will cause others to follow suit, especially with the exciting technology coming to the Polkadot chain in the future. The most likely candidate for this is Near ( NEAR-USD ), currently the 25th largest crypto project by market cap. Near already uses Substrate, a blockchain framework created by Polkadot, making a collaboration extremely easy between the two projects. Founder of Polkadot Gavin Wood had this to say : Substrate-based chains are easy to integrate into Polkadot or Kusama to become a parachain or parathread. Essentially, Substrate is the SDK with which you can build parachains and Polkadot is the means of securing the chains and allowing them to communicate with each other. I should point out that it's not at all an issue for projects that don't use Substrate to collaborate with Polkadot. It only makes it slightly easier for them to do so. Catalyst 3: Polkadot 2.0, and Eventually JAM Reddit DOT has a steady pipeline of improvements, as highlighted in their roadmap above. Polkadot 2.0 provides updates to hopefully bring back the excitement that the project had in 2021, and the last and biggest piece of the puzzle is Elastic Scalability, due to drop in Q1 of 2025 . Elastic Scalability goes beyond the scope of this article. Oversimplified, it will allow projects operating on DOT to rent the exact amount of processing that they need at any time allowing them to grow without issue. This answers a key problem in the DOT ecosystem and will hopefully attract projects to work with DOT. Further in the future, JAM is a really exciting technological advancement on the DOT timeline. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood had this to say about it : Basically it's a big shared computer that always works exactly how you expect it to... You can upload your programs to run and your programs can be sort of services that solve particular problems and because it's a shared computer those Services can cooperate and coordinate with each other Rather than just being able to host communication between currencies, JAM will enable Polkadot to host full applications as well. I believe this has the potential to be one of the biggest and most influential innovations in crypto. While JAM isn’t expected until near the end of 2025, I believe that the future prospect will attract projects to work with DOT in the short term. Catalyst 4: Mythos, A Polkadot Parachain, Is Picking Up Steam X.com This week it was announced that a FIFA mobile game is coming to Mythic Games with a full web3 economy. Mythic Games operates Mythos, which is ran on a Polkadot parachain, so the traffic from the game will flow directly through Polkadot architecture. For reference of how big it could scale, FIFA's last mobile game has more than 500 million downloads . Mythos has been doing incredibly well in the NFT space. As the below chart indicates, They're punching way above their weight class, keeping up with Solana and Polygon. x.com Polkadot is likely to see success by proxy as projects utilizing its architecture succeed. While part of the bear thesis is that adoption has been slow coming to Polkadot, success stories like Mythos should not only spur on the price of DOT, but also attract more projects to the architecture. Conclusion While I’m a big fan of the Solana project, I believe that the easy money has already been made there. When it comes to DOT, the robust developer ecosystem and the mountain of potential positive catalysts on the horizon is an opportunity that shouldn’t be passed up, and should definitely not be shorted. I believe DOT has a good chance of returning to its $55 all time high in 2025 and substantially outperforming Solana in that time.",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH | SOL,DOT | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740281-polkadot-poised-for-significant-growth-why-shorting-dot-to-buy-sol-bad-idea?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36861592.jpeg

In just 24 hours, more than $550 million was liquidated. When Bitcoin fell to its weekly low, it caused a flood of sell-offs that caused about 170,000 traders to lose money on their accounts. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ATH Sparks $309 Price Prediction Frenzy – Details Coinglass reports such tremendous losses to be placed at $118 million in BTC longs, $54 million in ETH longs, and even $25 million in Dogecoin long positions. This surge in liquidations, in conjunction with a decrease in market capitalization and trading volume, emphasizes the volatility that traders have come to anticipate. This is perceived by analysts as a component of a more extensive pattern of corrections that have occurred in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent rally to near-record levels. Bitcoin Dominance & Liquidation Trends Bitcoin’s dominance remains robust, with a current market capitalization of $3.23 trillion, which accounts for over 56% of the total crypto market. The highest liquidation of the day was a $4.67 million BTC/USDT exchange on Binance, which is indicative of the high stakes involved in leveraged trading. Additionally, altcoins were not spared. Significant declines were observed in tokens with a smaller market capitalization, with the broader market losing approximately $100 million. Some analysts think this is just another usual correction, following the hefty close to 44% rise in Bitcoin price since early November. At present, the crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 82, suggesting that the prevailing dominance in the market is still “Extreme Greed.” Ethereum And Altcoins Maintain Their Poise Ethereum remains resilient, despite the fact that it was not spared from the day’s losses. The uncertain sentiment surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency was underscored by a combination of long and short liquidations in ETH positions. In the interim, altcoins such as Dogecoin, which were frequently bolstered by meme-driven enthusiasm, experienced the repercussions of market corrections, a warning to traders who were seeking rapid profits. An industry analyst named Miles Deutscher noticed that more traders are reactivating their wallets after not using them for months. They are doing this because they are interested in the possibility of altcoins and Bitcoin’s strong performance. As the market continues to follow its usual trends, this increase in activity could lead to both growth and volatility. Related Reading: XRP Below $1?

This investment aims to boost the security and utility of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto applications on the network. Kernel will use restaking to enhance BNB's security, turning it into programmable trust that will support a range of crypto services and applications. The first phase of Kernel’s rollout will focus on integrating BNB Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and restaked BNB as economic security. This will help drive innovation within DeFi on the BNB Chain. In the future, Kernel plans to expand its scope by incorporating Bitcoin and related assets into its restaking framework. Over 20 decentralized applications (dApps), such as AI co-processor Mira and ZK proof protocol Electron, will utilize Kernel’s system to enhance their security. Collaborations with other projects like ListaDAO, Solv, and YieldNest will further increase the utility of restaked assets. Kernel’s long-term goal is to scale its infrastructure to include additional layer-1 blockchains, improving the overall utility of its system. The platform integrates both native and liquid staking tokens from assets like BNB and BTC, optimizing capital efficiency while enhancing the asset’s overall usefulness. The integration of yield-bearing assets could open the door to more applications within the DeFi ecosystem. Binance Labs’ investment in Kernel is part of its larger strategy to support cutting-edge projects that align with its mission to promote Web3 and expand the blockchain ecosystem. Alex Odagiu , Investment Director at Binance Labs, emphasized the importance of projects like Kernel in driving the growth of Web3 by advancing key technological initiatives. This investment follows Binance Labs’ recent backing of Lombard, a platform focused on Bitcoin liquid staking. Lombard’s LBTC token currently holds 40% of the Bitcoin liquid staking market and plans to expand its multi-chain staking capabilities. Binance Labs has also ventured into the decentralized science (DeSci) space, investing in BIO Protocol, marking its first step into this emerging field. Binance Labs is actively diversifying its portfolio, which is now valued at $10 billion, by supporting projects that are reshaping different sectors within the blockchain and crypto world. With investments in areas like Bitcoin staking , decentralized science, and now restaking infrastructure, Binance Labs is positioning itself as a major player in the blockchain ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/binance-labs-invests-in-kernel-to-enhance-restaking-on-bnb-chain,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

For example, in September, his mention of D.O.G.E. appeared to drive the coin’s value up, though the rise was short-lived. Despite these fluctuations, it remains unclear whether Musk is purposely trying to manipulate DOGE’s market. His recent comments have been framed around the political use of the term ""D.O.G.E."" rather than the cryptocurrency itself, which raises doubts about whether these price movements are intentional. In a recent class-action lawsuit filed against Musk, Dogecoin investors accused the billionaire of using his tweets to artificially inflate DOGE prices since 2021. They claimed that his social media posts were part of a larger strategy to manipulate the market, alleging both fraud and insider trading. The investors argued that Musk’s influence on Dogecoin’s price is not coincidental but rather a deliberate tactic to boost the coin’s value. Musk’s meme-related posts often have an ambiguous connection to the cryptocurrency. For example, today’s tweet referenced the Department of Government Efficiency, yet it caused a noticeable increase in DOGE’s price. This spike was brief, but it highlights the recurring pattern of price movements following Musk’s Dogecoin-related posts. Critics suggest that by naming the department “D.O.G.E.,” Musk might be creating a convenient shield of plausible deniability. This could allow him to post about Dogecoin without directly referencing the cryptocurrency, potentially avoiding accusations of market manipulation. The question remains: is Musk using his platform to promote DOGE’s value, or is it all just coincidence? Musk is a well-known meme enthusiast with a long history of sharing Doge-related content. The Dogecoin meme itself has been around since 2013, long before Musk’s involvement with the coin. Therefore, some believe that Musk’s affection for the Doge meme could be independent of any interest in manipulating the cryptocurrency’s value. However, if Musk’s posts are influencing the market, the name of the department could provide him with a way to distance himself from any legal trouble. By focusing on the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk could argue that his statements have nothing to do with the cryptocurrency, even if they happen to affect its price. Critics of Musk’s actions suggest that his use of Dogecoin in his posts may be part of a calculated strategy to boost its price while avoiding accountability. Musk’s posts have often been linked to changes in the price of DOGE , raising concerns that he is manipulating the market for personal gain. Despite this, there is no definitive proof of his intentions, leaving room for speculation. Whether Musk is intentionally signaling to DOGE traders or not, it’s difficult to establish his true motives. The controversy surrounding Musk and his influence on Dogecoin highlights the challenges of navigating the relationship between social media, cryptocurrency, and market manipulation. As the legal battle over his actions continues, it will be interesting to see how regulators address the potential risks of such behavior. For now, Musk’s use of the D.O.G.E. label may provide a level of protection against allegations of market manipulation, but it raises larger questions about the ethical and legal implications of his influence on the cryptocurrency market. As the debate continues , the broader crypto community is left wondering how much impact a single individual can have on the value of a digital asset.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/elon-musk-s-doge-meme-sparks-debate-over-market-manipulation,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

36859618,https://coinpaprika.com/news/rumble-invests-20-million-in-bitcoin,1732608061,Rumble Invests $20 Million in Bitcoin,"Rumble, a video-sharing and cloud services platform, is taking a bold step into the world of cryptocurrency by dedicating up to $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. This move is part of the company's strategy to hedge against inflation and store long-term value. Rumble's decision to focus on crypto reflects its commitment to engage more closely with the growing crypto and gaming communities. The platform’s Board of Directors has approved the purchase of Bitcoin , which will be carried out as needed and at the company’s discretion. Rumble sees Bitcoin as a strategic asset that will help protect its assets from the risks of currency devaluation and potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term growth. This strategy aligns with the growing trend of large companies, such as MicroStrategy, adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience to inflation, explaining that unlike government-issued currencies, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through excessive money printing. Pavlovski emphasized that Rumble’s Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions and the company’s financial needs. With increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency and a crypto-friendly U.S. administration, Rumble’s move positions the company to take advantage of these trends, though the volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price could present challenges. Alongside its Bitcoin strategy, Rumble is making headlines in the gaming world with an exclusive $20 million deal with popular, yet controversial, streamer Dr. Disrespect. This deal will see Dr. Disrespect lead Rumble’s gaming division, where he will oversee the development of the Rumble Gaming Community . The partnership brings with it significant opportunities, as Dr. Disrespect’s millions of followers could help expand Rumble’s reach. However, his controversial history, including a Twitch ban, has raised concerns about whether his involvement could damage Rumble’s reputation. Pavlovski addressed these concerns, stating that Dr. Disrespect has committed to ""being on his best behavior"" moving forward. If the partnership proves successful, Rumble could become a major player in the gaming content space. This would align with the company’s broader vision of combining gaming and crypto, and could enhance its overall platform appeal. “Rumble is entering a new era,” Pavlovski said, adding that he is focused on expanding in these two key areas. While these ventures have the potential to boost Rumble’s growth, they are not without risks. Bitcoin’s price volatility could make it difficult for the company to manage its treasury strategy. Additionally, the presence of Dr. Disrespect could create challenges, as his past controversies might alienate some users. If Rumble can successfully navigate these challenges, however, it could transform into a leader in the gaming and crypto sectors, much like MicroStrategy has done with Bitcoin. Rumble’s innovative approach could make it a trailblazer in bridging the gap between the worlds of cryptocurrency, gaming, and video sharing. However, the company will need to balance its ambitions with the inherent risks of both the volatile crypto market and its controversial partnerships. If successful, Rumble could set itself apart from its competitors and emerge as a unique player in the digital content and crypto space.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/rumble-invests-20-million-in-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

The platform’s anonymous founder stated they would work to protect users from ""repulsive and dangerous content."" This decision came after several violent and inappropriate livestreams circulated widely on social media. By Monday afternoon, pump.fun had deactivated its livestream function temporarily. The controversial streams included token promoters making violent threats if the coin’s price didn’t rise, along with offensive content meant to shock viewers and manipulate token values. This occurred just after pump.fun achieved record earnings, making $14.3 million in one day, nearly tripling its previous best. Pump.fun has built a reputation for edgy and often controversial content. The platform has drawn comparisons to 4chan due to its lax moderation and history of racially insensitive and pornographic tokens. Prior to this incident, pump.fun had not enforced content restrictions. However, the recent viral spread of the disturbing livestreams led its founder, known only as alon, to announce that the platform would take action to prevent harmful content. In one of his posts, alon confirmed the platform had removed a stream where a user threatened to harm their dog unless a token's market cap increased. He added that the platform had already removed ""hundreds of streams"" in response to complaints. Around 2:00 p.m. on Monday, pump.fun disabled its livestream feature altogether. In an official statement , the platform explained that ""unprecedented growth"" had made content moderation difficult, leading to the decision to pause livestreams ""for an indefinite period."" This pause comes at a critical time for pump.fun, which has gained significant traction as the most viral application on the Solana blockchain. The platform has generated nearly $250 million in revenue since its launch, much of it driven by memecoin activity. This has led to a surge in demand for Solana’s blockchain space, which has in turn benefited the blockchain’s validators. Within the Solana community, many view memecoins as a test of the network’s capabilities, while others see them as a form of entertainment or even a legitimate financial product. Even among critics of memecoins, there is reluctance to impose restrictions on what developers do with blockchain technology. Some in the crypto community have brushed off the backlash, arguing that every major social media platform has faced its own content moderation issues. However, as Solana and other cryptocurrencies work to gain mainstream acceptance, some are raising concerns about the darker side of memecoin culture. One notable critic, Zach Rynes from Chainlink, warned that pump.fun’s actions could lead to lasting damage to the crypto industry’s reputation, comparing it to the fallout from FTX . Tech lawyer Preston Byrne also pointed out that pump.fun's approach might violate social media regulations. Up to this point, pump.fun’s strategy has often been to mock its critics with trolling responses. However, with the livestream feature now disabled, it seems that this particular wave of criticism has struck a nerve. It remains uncertain whether this decision will have a long-term impact on the memecoin community and the traders who frequent the platform.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | SOL | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/pump-fun-suspends-livestreams-after-backlash-over-disturbing-content,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

This filing is an important first step before submitting the formal application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposed ETF would track the market performance of XRP , which is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This move places WisdomTree among the growing number of asset managers seeking to offer an XRP ETF. Other companies, such as Bitwise and Canary Capital, have already filed similar applications. Bitwise filed its application last month, while Canary Capital applied in October to launch a spot XRP ETF that would track the asset’s price using a benchmark index from regulated exchanges. However, WisdomTree aims to create an ETF that tracks XRP's market performance, setting it apart from the others. WisdomTree, a major global asset manager managing more than $113 billion in assets, has confirmed that its filing is legitimate. However, the company has not yet disclosed the exchange where the ETF will be listed or its ticker symbol. It has also stated that most of its XRP holdings will be stored in cold storage , ensuring greater security for investors. There has been growing optimism about the approval of XRP ETFs due to the recent developments in the SEC. The news of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's resignation has contributed to the rally in XRP’s price, with the token surging nearly 180% in November. This surge has taken XRP to its highest price in over three years. Gensler's departure could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially easing the approval process for XRP ETFs. Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, has long advocated for clearer regulatory guidelines in the digital asset space. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed confidence that an XRP ETF is inevitable, especially with the increasing interest in institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. XRP is not the only digital asset seeking ETF approval. The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has encouraged other firms to follow suit. VanEck and 21Shares have both filed for Solana ETFs, with the SEC expected to make a decision on these applications by January 6, 2025 . This move by WisdomTree comes at a time when regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets may be shifting, opening new opportunities for institutional investments in XRP.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/wisdomtree-files-for-xrp-etf-as-market-optimism-grows,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

Archax has provided access to Abrdn’s U.S. dollar Liquidity Fund (Lux) in tokenized form on XRPL. Ripple will allocate $5 million worth of tokens into Abrdn’s Lux fund, part of a larger allocation to real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRPL.  XRP price jumped 6%, touching a high of $1.49 in the hours following the release, before paring gains in a market-wide drop. The token is up 27% over the past week and more than has more than doubled in two weeks on several positive catalysts.  Real World Assets (RWAs) are tangible or financial assets like real estate, commodities, or bonds that exist outside of the digital realm but can be represented as tokens on a blockchain. This process, known as tokenization, allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and easier transfer of these assets.  A money market involves trading short-term, high-quality debt instruments like Treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. It's where large institutions manage their short-term cash needs.  Archax has been using Ripple’s digital assets custody since 2022. Lux has over $3.8 billion in assets under management, per a release.  The launch of the tokenized money market fund on the XRPL is a further boost to the growth of real-world asset tokenization, a sector that some eye as one of the hottest in crypto.  In a July report, global consulting firm McKinsey & Company expects the tokenized asset market to reach $4 trillion in an optimistic scenario by 2030.

36858655,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654890,1732606206,"Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained","After reaching a new all-time high of $99,600 last Friday, the Bitcoin price has retraced to the $94,000 mark for the first time in nearly a week. This pullback comes amid growing speculation about a possible correction following a massive three-week uptrend that saw the leading crypto surge by 40% after Donald Trump’s election on November 5. Bitcoin Price May Drop To $70,500 Market expert and technical analyst Rekt Capital recently voiced concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), drawing parallels with historical price cycles. He highlighted that in the 2013 cycle, the Bitcoin price experienced six weeks of rising prices leading into what is known as “Price Discovery,” followed by its first major correction in Week 7. Similarly, in the 2017 cycle, a seven-week rally culminated in a significant retracement of 34% in Week 8. In the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin rallied for six weeks before facing its first meaningful pullback of 16%.Currently, Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin is in the fourth week of its current uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance Based on these historical patterns, it suggests that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a retest of lower support levels within the next two to four weeks, aligning with the previous trends, where the average declines have been substantial. Considering the data from past corrections, the Bitcoin price could experience a 25% pullback, potentially bringing the price down to around $70,500—a level not seen since the election day. Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Contributing to the current pullback, data from on-chain market intelligence firm Glassnode reveals that long-term holders (LTHs) have significantly increased their selling activity, with a notable selling pressure recorded at -366,000 BTC per month—the highest level seen since April 2024. The analysis indicates that among long-term holders, the 6 to 12-month cohort is leading the charge, averaging 25,600 BTC sold per day. This group of investors has capitalized on the recent Bitcoin price surge, having acquired their coins at an average cost basis approximately 71% lower than the current market price, which hovers around $57,900. Related Reading: Rocket Fuel For Shiba Inu Price: Kusama Says 99% SHIB Supply Burn Possible The increase in selling pressure among this group also reflects a potential shift in market movement in the coming days. With Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs just below $100,000, some investors may choose to take profits rather than ride out potential volatility. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $94,000, recording a retracement of nearly 5% on the 24-hour time frame. For the time being, however, the Bitcoin price continues to post gains in all other time frames, with the year-to-date being the most notable with a 150% surge in that time period.

36856742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654880,1732602611,Polygon: Analyst Sets ‘Wild’ Price Target Amid POL’s 38.2% Weekly Surge,"Polygon (POL) hit its four-month high today following its 11% daily surge. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $0.60 mark before retracing, sparking a bullish sentiment among investors and market watchers. As a result, a renowned crypto analyst predicted a massive 2,500% rally for POL in the coming months. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Rebounds Above $6: Is A Sustainable Rally In Sight? Polygon On-Chain Metrics Turn Bullish Polygon has seen a remarkable performance over the past three weeks, rising around 107% since the November 5 market pump. POL, previously MATIC, has seen its price move from below the $0.30 mark to a four-month high of $0.61. This performance has been fueled by several factors, which have propelled the token’s price by nearly 40% in the last seven days and could stage “one of the most hated rallies,” as Ali Martinez shared on X. The analyst explained that Polygon has been experiencing an “important spike in on-chain metrics” over the last week, which could drive POL’s price to a “wild” price action in the future. Martinez noted that a lot of investors hold Polygon from the previous cycle, where the project’s token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.92. However, most of them record losses since only 15.11% of Polygon holders are in the green. Per the post, this is a positive sign for POL’s price action, as most of its investors won’t sell for profit at the current price ranges. The analyst added that on-chain data suggests a new wave of investors are positioning themselves for the rally’s second leg. This was signaled by the recent increase in daily active addresses, transaction volume, and whale activity. POL’s daily trading volume has recorded a 190% increase in the last week, jumping from the $250 million mark to $736 million. Additionally, whales bought over 140 million POL, now worth around nearly $80 million, in the last week and a half, with large-scale purchases significantly increasing since November 5. POL To Hit $15 This Cycle? Martinez suggested that with the whales’ buying spree and the reduced selling pressure, the POL “technicals look very good.” To him, the cryptocurrency is nearing a breakout from a multi-year descending triangle. The analyst explained that Polygon has been consolidating in a descending triangle formation since hitting its ATH almost three years ago. Nearly a week ago, the token “bounced off the triangle’s x-axis,” and had its Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) “on the verge of a bullish crossover.” This suggested that while sentiment remains overall bearish, “bullish signals are piling up,” indicating a potential rally toward a new ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance Based on this, Martinez predicted that POL’s breakout could potentially lead to a 2,500% rally in the coming months. A weekly close above $0.7973 could spark a rally to $15.27, he detailed, adding that it could also ignite a 6,200% jump to $36.17. The analyst added that the most important support wall for POL was between the $0.375 and $0.386 price range, broken over a week ago, with little resistance in the higher levels. As of this writing, POL is trading at $0.58, a 75% increase in the monthly timeframe.

42389453,5a6dd8cc-0b66-4607-aced-5c19f2d4c6a5,1732601785,3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Risks Falling Below $90K: Godbole,"Bitcoin's (BTC) much-anticipated breakout above $100,000 remains out of reach, with prices retreating to $94,500 overnight. Key indicators point to further declines, potentially to levels below $90,000.  The first indicator is the 25-delta risk reversal, which measures the volatility premium of out-of-the-money calls used to bet on price rallies relative to OTM put options offering downside protection.  On Deribit, calls expiring this Friday now trade at a cheaper valuation to puts, resulting in a negative risk reversal, according to data source Amberdata. The first negative reading in at least a month indicates a bias for protective puts.  Perhaps sophisticated traders are prepping for an extension of Monday's price slide. On Monday, traders sold call spreads and bought put options tied to BTC on the over-the-counter liquidity network Paradigm.  The 24-hour change in the 25RR (risk reversal) shows the call bias has moderated across timeframes. Last week, calls expiring in December and January traded at a bigger premium relative to puts than what we see now.   Coinbase premium evaporates  The stateside demand for BTC, a leading source of bullish pressure for the cryptocurrency during the recent post-U.S. election price surge from $70,000 to $99,500, has weakened. That's evident from the renewed discount in BTC prices on Nasdaq-listed Coinbase compared to offshore giant Binance.  The negative flip in the so-called Coinbase premium indicator follows the bearish order book skew, indicating vulnerability to potential negative news.  RSI divergence  The relative strength index (RSI) divergence occurs when an asset's price moves counter to the momentum oscillator.  In BTC's case, while prices tapped a new high above $99,000 on Friday, the RSI did not, diverging bearishly. The pattern indicates that the bullish momentum has run its course for now and there could be losses ahead.  Intraday charts indicate support between $87,000 and $88,000, meaning an expected deeper decline could find a floor in that range while long-term technical studies continue to lean bullish.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/three-reasons-why-bitcoin-risks-falling-below-90-k-godbole,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/410da8dfb37bc79a5868e170626b187481feef32-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, the corporate adoption of Bitcoin is still steadily increasing as MicroStrategy increased its Bitcoin reserves yet again. Other firms like Semler Scientific and Rumble are also expanding their Bitcoin reserves. In contrast, the Bitcoin mining industry is facing delays as U.S. customs are holding shipments of Bitmain ASIC miners because of regulatory concerns. Bitcoin Staking Comes to Sui Blockchain Babylon Labs and Lombard Protocol are set to introduce liquid Bitcoin (BTC) staking to the Sui blockchain, which will be a major milestone for the layer-1 network. Starting in December, Bitcoin holders on Sui will have the ability to stake their BTC through Babylon, which is a Bitcoin layer-2 network, and mint LBTC, Lombard’s liquid staking token (LST). This initiative is designed to bring Bitcoin liquidity to the Sui ecosystem by leveraging LBTC as a collateral asset to enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activities like lending, borrowing, and trading. The collaboration will provide the infrastructure for depositing, staking, minting, and bridging BTC to Sui. Lombard’s co-founder, Jacob Phillips, shed some light on the untapped potential of Bitcoin’s $1.8 trillion market cap, and believes in the project’s mission to enable Bitcoin holders to participate in advanced on-chain finance without sacrificing security or liquidity. The Sui blockchain is sometimes referred to as a ”Solana killer,” and has already attracted $1.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) since its launch in 2023, according to data from DefiLlama . Sui TVL (Source: DefiLlama ) Bitcoin LSTs , which are tokenized claims on staked Bitcoin, currently hold around $4.5 billion in TVL, with Solv BTC (SolvBTC) leading the pack at $1.5 billion in TVL, followed by Lombard with $1 billion. Unlike Lombard’s LBTC, which is not yet generating staking rewards, some Bitcoin LSTs, like SolvBTC, offer yields of up to 1.2% APR through staking on networks like CoreChain. This latest development was announced after Solv Protocol’s launch of a Bitcoin LST on Solana in October. This proves that there is certainly a growing demand for yield opportunities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. MicroStrategy and Semler Bet Big on Bitcoin Other companies also want their own piece of Bitcoin after its recent success. MicroStrategy increased its Bitcoin holdings yet again after it bought close to 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion between Nov. 18 and 24 at an average price of $97,862 per coin. This purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 386,700 BTC, which was acquired at a cumulative cost of $21.9 billion and an average price of $56,761 per coin. More details about the acquisition were shared in a Nov. 25 filing . It is very clear that MicroStrategy is bullish on Bitcoin, especially as its price is closing in on $100,000, driven by rising institutional adoption and optimism surrounding potential pro-crypto policies under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. MicroStrategy funded this latest purchase through proceeds from a private offering of 0% convertible senior notes due 2029, which raised $2.97 billion, and its ongoing at-the-market (ATM) equity program, which generated $2.46 billion from the sale of 5,597,849 shares. These combined sources provided the liquidity for the firm’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm introduced a proprietary performance metric called “Bitcoin Yield,” which measures the percentage change in the ratio of BTC holdings to assumed diluted shares outstanding. By Nov. 24, MicroStrategy reported a BTC Yield of 59.3%, up from 35.2% at the end of the previous quarter. Semler Scientific, a U.S.-based healthcare company, also expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 297 BTC for $29.1 million between Nov. 18 and 22. This purchase increased the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 1,570 BTC at an average price of $75,039 per coin. Semler Scientific BTC yield (Source: Semler Scientific ) The firm doubled its ATM equity program capacity to $100 million, and generated $50 million in gross proceeds to support its Bitcoin acquisitions. Semler reported a year-to-date BTC Yield of 58.4% as of Nov. 22. Both companies’ actions suggest that there is a growing trend among corporations to adopt Bitcoin as a cornerstone of their financial strategies. Rumble Joins Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Trend YouTube alternative Rumble announced plans to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. The decision was approved by its board of directors, and allows the company to invest up to $20 million in Bitcoin at the discretion of management. The timing of the purchases will depend on market conditions, Bitcoin prices, and the platform’s financial needs. CEO Chris Pavlovsk teased the move in a social media poll where 93.9% of 43,790 people supported the idea. He believes in Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge and a strategic asset due to its resistance to dilution and increasing adoption under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration. Rumble also shared that the strategy could be modified or suspended at any time, however, the platform believes in Bitcoin’s role in strategic planning and it is eager to expand into cryptocurrency. The announcement led to a surge in Rumble’s stock price as shares rose 12.63% during the trading session to $7.31 and gained another 3+% in after-hours trading. This move places Rumble among a growing number of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. MicroStrategy is still the largest corporate holder. Other firms, including MARA Holdings, Semler Scientific, and Genius Group, have also expanded their Bitcoin reserves recently. MARA raised $700 million in convertible senior notes to buy more Bitcoin. Genius Group purchased 110 BTC for $10 million and plans to allocate up to 90% of its reserves to Bitcoin. U.S. Ports Hold Bitmain Mining Rigs Meanwhile, the Bitcoin mining industry is currently facing some headwinds with regards to equipment. The United States Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) is holding shipments of Bitmain Antminer ASICs at various U.S. ports of entry, which is causing delays for several Bitcoin mining companies. According to reports, seven unnamed U.S. mining firms have been waiting for their equipment for as long as two months. The affected shipments include Bitmain’s latest Antminer S21 and T21 series ASICs. Some companies are also incurring large holding fees because of this, some as high as $200,000 for 200 ASICs. The CBP’s actions seem to be linked to a request from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Agency. The agency’s Advanced Targeting Unit, which is responsible for identifying high-risk cargo, was reportedly involved in the holds. Industry insiders suggested that the freeze may relate to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce into chip designer Sophgo, a Bitmain affiliate, after chips it ordered in Taiwan were discovered in a Huawei AI processor. Huawei has been under U.S. sanctions since 2019. Interestingly, ASICs from other Chinese manufacturers are not being held, which raised some questions about the specificity of the action against Bitmain products. Bitmain is a major supplier of crypto mining equipment, and began shipping its Antminer T21 earlier this year. It supplies the vast majority of chips that are used in crypto mining globally. To avoid tariffs, the company established offices outside of China, but still faced accusations of dumping and price-cutting practices. Although the U.S. continues to enforce sanctions and trade restrictions, Chinese companies like Bitmain are still very deeply embedded in global supply chains and the U.S. Bitcoin mining ecosystem. Some Chinese-owned firms have been actively mining Bitcoin in the United States since China’s 2021 crackdown on domestic crypto mining.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6244/babylon-labs-and-lombard-protocol-bring-liquid-bitcoin-staking-to-sui,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36854874,https://coinpaper.com/6245/wisdom-tree-takes-bold-step-with-xrp-etf-filing,1732599032,WisdomTree Takes Bold Step with XRP ETF Filing,"Ripple's XRP Ledger is making waves in the financial sector with two significant developments. The first involves a groundbreaking partnership with Archax and ABRDN to launch the first-ever tokenized money market fund, leveraging XRPL to streamline asset trading and settlement. Meanwhile, New York-based asset management firm WisdomTree has filed to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), reflecting broader interest in regulated cryptocurrency products. WisdomTree Files for XRP ETF Amid Changing Regulatory Landscape in the US WisdomTree Funds, a prominent New York-based asset management firm, has filed an application in Delaware for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Nov. 25. This move signals the company’s broader intent to pursue approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a notable development in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. With its filing, WisdomTree joins a growing list of early XRP ETF applicants in the US, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. These firms are vying to capitalize on the increasing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. However, the SEC has yet to approve any XRP ETF applications. The timing of WisdomTree’s move coincides with pivotal moments for Ripple, the company behind XRP, which has seen its fortunes fluctuate amid its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Ripple’s partial victory in July 2023, when a judge ruled that XRP was not a security in specific contexts, marked a significant milestone in the company’s legal battle. This ruling buoyed investor confidence and sparked discussions about XRP’s potential as a legitimate financial asset. However, the SEC’s subsequent appeal on Oct. 2, 2024, injected uncertainty into XRP’s regulatory future. The agency’s request for a delayed opening brief until Jan. 15, 2025, has further extended the timeline for resolution, leaving the market in suspense. Political Shifts and XRP’s Regulatory Outlook The 2024 US presidential election has introduced a new dimension to the cryptocurrency regulatory narrative. Donald Trump’s victory has brought speculation about a potential overhaul in how the federal government approaches cryptocurrency. Trump’s campaign promise to position the US as a global hub for Bitcoin, crypto , and blockchain technologies stands in stark contrast to the SEC’s historically stringent stance under President Joe Biden and SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Analysts believe that Trump’s administration could usher in a regulatory environment more favorable to cryptocurrencies. Conservative appointees to key financial positions, coupled with Gensler’s expected departure from the SEC, may lead to a reevaluation of ongoing legal cases, including those against Ripple. If Trump’s administration takes a more crypto-friendly stance, the regulatory hurdles for XRP ETF approvals may diminish significantly. Analysts speculate that such a shift could expedite the approval process for firms like WisdomTree, providing an advantage to early applicants in the race for XRP ETFs. The prospect of an XRP ETF holds immense potential for the cryptocurrency market. It would provide institutional investors with regulated exposure to XRP, potentially driving significant capital inflows and bolstering market legitimacy. The XRP case exemplifies the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry as it seeks regulatory clarity. A more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration could encourage innovation and investment, but it also raises questions about the balance between fostering growth and ensuring investor protection. Industry observers are closely watching the developments surrounding XRP and the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency ETFs. The outcome of Ripple’s case and the approval of an XRP ETF could set critical precedents for the industry’s future in the US. WisdomTree’s bold move to file for an XRP ETF sheds some light on the growing confidence in XRP’s potential despite regulatory uncertainties. As the industry awaits clarity on Ripple’s legal battle and the SEC’s ETF decisions, the intersection of political shifts and regulatory reform could redefine the cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 and beyond. Whether XRP will emerge as a cornerstone of regulated financial products remains uncertain, but the momentum behind these filings is a strong indication of the increasing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets in a rapidly changing world. XRP Ledger Introduces First Tokenized Money Market Fund, Cementing Its Role in Capital Markets In related news, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has taken a pioneering step in the financial world by launching the first-ever tokenized money market fund. The initiative was executed in partnership with Ripple Labs, Archax—a leading digital securities exchange—and ABRDN, a global investment firm. The tokenized money market fund represents a significant leap forward in integrating blockchain technology into financial infrastructure. By enabling the deployment of capital markets infrastructure on XRPL, Archax is introducing ABRDN’s $3.8 billion money market fund to the blockchain space. This fund, now tokenized on the XRPL, provides investors with a stable, low-risk investment vehicle enhanced by the efficiencies of blockchain technology. Money market funds are traditionally prized for their liquidity and stability, offering a safe haven for investors seeking low-risk returns. Tokenization transforms the ownership of these assets into digital tokens, which can be traded on blockchain networks. Beyond money markets, tokenization on the XRPL could encompass assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks, opening up a wide array of possibilities for investors. Ripple projects that the tokenization of assets could grow to a staggering $16 trillion market by 2030, driven by the enhanced savings, settlement efficiencies, and accessibility that blockchain technology offers. The deployment of the money market fund on the XRPL eliminates intermediaries, significantly reducing costs and streamlining processes. Traditional capital markets often involve layers of intermediaries, each adding cost and complexity to transactions. By contrast, blockchain technology facilitates real-time settlements, reducing friction and making financial systems more efficient. For Ripple, this development is a demonstration of how blockchain can redefine asset ownership and trading, showcasing its potential to become a cornerstone of modern financial markets. The XRP Ledger’s infrastructure allows for increased liquidity, faster transaction times, and lower costs, making it a compelling alternative to traditional systems. Ripple’s move to integrate blockchain into capital markets aligns with its broader vision of leveraging the XRP Ledger for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The successful launch of the tokenized money market fund is expected to pave the way for additional financial products and use cases on the XRPL. This milestone also validates recent updates to the XRP Ledger, demonstrating its capacity to support complex financial applications. Tokenization is widely regarded as a transformative trend in finance, enabling a new era of accessibility and transparency. By tokenizing assets, ownership can be fractionalized, making high-value investments accessible to a broader audience. Furthermore, blockchain technology ensures immutable record-keeping, enhancing security and trust in financial transactions. Market Impact and XRP’s Price Momentum The launch of the tokenized money market fund has sparked optimism among market analysts, who view this as a bullish development for the XRP ecosystem. By establishing itself as a leader in RWA tokenization, the XRP Ledger positions itself as a vital player in the blockchain-based financial market. The news coincides with a strong performance by XRP in the market, with the token maintaining a value above $1 over the past week. Analysts believe the deployment of capital market infrastructure on the XRPL will reinforce confidence in XRP, driving potential price appreciation as adoption grows. Ripple’s partnership with Archax and ABRDN marks a critical step toward the mainstream adoption of blockchain in capital markets. By reducing transaction times, cutting costs, and eliminating intermediaries, XRPL offers a glimpse into the future of financial systems powered by blockchain technology. This development also emphasizes Ripple’s ongoing innovation in the blockchain space. By 2030, the projected $16 trillion tokenized asset market could redefine global finance, with XRP Ledger potentially playing a central role. As the adoption of tokenized assets accelerates, Ripple’s initiatives highlight the vast potential of blockchain to transform traditional finance. The tokenized money market fund is just the beginning, signaling a future where blockchain and capital markets converge to create a more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial ecosystem.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6245/wisdom-tree-takes-bold-step-with-xrp-etf-filing,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The price is holding the $625 support and might aim for a move above the $660 resistance. BNB price started a downside correction from the $685 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $625 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a close above the $640 level, BNB price extended its increase. However, upsides were limited above $685 and the price remained capped, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $666 and $650 levels. However, the price is now holding gains above the $625 level. A low was formed at $626 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $676 swing high to the $626 low. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $650 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $676 swing high to the $626 low. The next resistance sits near the $660 level. There is also a key declining channel forming with resistance at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $660 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $676. A close above the $676 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $685 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $660 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $632 level. The next major support is near the $625 level. The main support sits at $615. If there is a downside break below the $615 support, the price could drop toward the $600 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $588 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

36854014,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740237-ibit-options-and-insatiable-corporate-demand-historic-squeeze-coming-to-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1732597319,IBIT Options And Insatiable Corporate Demand: A Historic Squeeze Is Coming To Bitcoin,"Summary The launch of options on IBIT on 19 November 2024 marks Bitcoin's solidification as a legitimate asset class. A gamma vanna squeeze, a highly reflexive process induced by options and dynamic hedging, could materialize over an absolutely scarce asset. The growing adoption of BTC as a treasury asset is another catalyst which will at the very least set a price floor. It is likely to trigger a supply shock. All of this points to the possibility of a squeeze unlike anything financial markets have ever seen. For those who didn’t know, 19 November 2024 was a historic day because it was when options on a Bitcoin spot ETF first started trading. This is a monumental moment for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as it solidifies BTC as a legitimate asset class complete with ETF wrappers, futures, and now options. When the SEC first greenlighted options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), I wrote an article going very deep into the impacts of this development. You can read that here . On 19 November, IBIT options went live with just 6 expiries. The tick size seems to be $0.05, which is a bit large for an underlying that is $55 per share. The bid ask spreads were okay for now, and they will likely get narrower over time. The first 60 minutes saw 73,000 contracts traded , and I’m happy to say that I was part of this group. My first move was to buy calls as far OTM as possible, at the highest DTE possible. This meant the 100 strike calls expiring in January 2027. I opened this position for $14.70 (with the 100X multiplier and commissions the total debit was $1471.13). My breakeven is that IBIT must be at $114.71 per share by January 2027. This would translate to a BTC price of ~$200,183. On 21 November, weekly options were launched. This gives traders even more opportunity to make very specified bets. In my deep dive article about IBIT options , I talked about the potential for an option-induced squeeze unlike anything markets have ever seen. This was the core logic behind the trade. In my view, the real risk of BTC is perpetually to the upside. A long position in an OTM call option expiring in 2 years is the insurance plan for such an event. In my article, I wrote: So the possibility of a truly enormous and sudden gamma squeeze rally now exists if IBIT options are listed. Moreover, the possibility that this rally will outlive those of other assets also exists thanks to BTC’s absolute scarcity. This is now a factor which should be rationally priced into BTC’s valuation model. What is the new expected value of the price of BTC now that this is a possibility? Because the probabilities are positive, the extra boost in expected value must be positive as well. This constitutes a sustained increase under a rational expectations model for valuing BTC. To learn more about the nuances of gamma squeezes, please read the section titled “Impact 4: Unprecedented Upside Market Reflexivity Thanks To BTC's Absolute Scarcity And Option Greek Dynamics.” Now, there is another dynamic which I did not mention in that article, which I will explain here. Upside Skews And Vanna Squeeze You see, BTC’s historical returns exhibit significant skew to the upside. BTC option markets (BTC options have existed for a long time on Deribit) have usually priced this in. OTM calls tend to have higher IV than OTM puts, which is very different from equities markets, where OTM puts are more expensive than OTM calls. This can also be observed in the US options markets of BTC proxies like MSTR. There is another unique property BTC (and BTC proxies like MSTR) exhibits. As BTC goes up, its implied volatility increases too. This is quite different from equity indices: VIX tends to fall as the SPX rises. Now, to be clear, BTC IV also rises when BTC crashes. So really, BTC’s return distribution (both historical and implied) exhibits some kurtosis (tails are fat). Bitcoin Volatility Index (Deribit) When you put all this together, it is yet another catalyst for explosive option-induced upside potentially unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Option market makers try to stay delta neutral, which means they will buy or sell the underlying in a quantity that cancels out the delta on their books. If they sold some calls and their total delta is -101, then they will buy 101 shares of the underlying to get to delta neutral. The options-induced squeezes occur when delta changes due to various circumstances. While gamma is the most well-known way of changing delta (this is what gives the name “gamma squeeze”), when it comes to BTC, there is another potentially more potent factor called vanna. Vanna is the cross partial derivative of an option’s value with respect to changes in the spot price and the implied volatility of the underlying. Those of you who are mathematically inclined will know that this means vanna is the derivative of delta with respect to changes in implied volatility. It can also be said that vanna is the derivative of vega with respect to changes in the underlying price. Both statements are true due to how partial derivatives work, but pay attention to the former statement. Vanna is positive for OTM BTC calls. This means that as implied volatility increases, vanna causes delta to increase too. So this is another factor which will change delta and force market makers to make more spot trades to get to delta neutral. Recall that unlike equity indices, BTC IV rises as BTC rises. BTC rising contributes to a gamma squeeze situation . BTC IV rising simultaneously will contribute to a vanna squeeze situation. This is what would happen in a vanna squeeze: IBIT surges up and IBIT IV increases Vanna causes the delta on OTM IBIT calls to increase because IV is increasing. Market makers now deal with higher delta on OTM calls, so they have to buy more IBIT. This makes IBIT surge higher, which increases IBIT IV. This would happen along with a gamma squeeze, which looks like this: IBIT surges higher. Gamma causes the delta on OTM IBIT calls to increase because the underlying is moving higher. Market makers now deal with higher delta (on top of the vanna-induced higher deltas), so they have to buy more IBIT. This makes IBIT go higher. (Please note that in both of these situations, when I say, “market makers deal with higher delta,” I mean the magnitude of their delta exposure is higher. Technically, they are dealing with lower delta on their short calls since delta on short calls is negative.) Both vanna and gamma squeezes would happen simultaneously. Equity melt-ups rarely occur, partly because IV falls as the underlying increases. This makes vanna work against gamma, and it offsets how much market makers need to buy. BTC doesn’t have this problem. Corporations Are Creating An Immense Supply Shock With Their Bitcoin Purchases Here's something else to consider. There are now more companies running a BTC treasury thanks to MicroStrategy (MSTR). Business adoption of BTC reserves has grown by 30% over the last year, according to River. This is a very US-focused study, and it includes private businesses too. The economic energy of more entities buying BTC will surely set a price floor and increase the odds of a squeeze unfolding. MicroStrategy announced a plan on 30 October to buy $42 billion in BTC over the next 3 years . This included the biggest at-the-market filing in the history of capital markets: authorization to issue $21 billion in common stock. In just 3 weeks, MicroStrategy has already used over $6 billion of the $21 billion. $4.6 billion was announced on 18 November . And $2.03 billion was announced on 11 November . These were all used to purchase BTC, and it was likely a major demand catalyst that pushed the price from the upper 70,000s to the 90,000s. They also announced a $3 billion offering of convertible notes on 21 November. This will be used to buy BTC too. MicroStrategy announced $42 billion to be raised over 3 years. In just 3 weeks, they have raised nearly $10 billion of that $42 billion. Anyone who is paying attention should, in my opinion, be alarmed at the rate of capital moving into BTC via MicroStrategy alone. The key point is that MicroStrategy is not alone. On 21 November, MARA ( MARA ) announced a $1 billion convertible notes offering , upsized from an initial $700 million , which was proposed on 18 November. Please pay attention to the rate at which these capital flows are moving. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) is also continuing to use their ATM to buy more BTC, here they announced a $21.5 million raise on 18 November . Also, two more public companies have announced that they will be adopting a BTC treasury. Solidion Technology announced it on 14 November , with a “Commitment of Future Capital Raises to Acquire Additional Bitcoin.” And Genius Group announced it on 12 November . In the cases of Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group ( GNS ), their stocks both soared after their announcements. Even the Board of Microsoft (MSFT) will be having a meeting to consider adopting a BTC treasury and the shareholders will vote on this issue. Though the Board is advising against a BTC treasury, the very fact that this is being brought up by shareholders, and that there will be a vote, is proof that Bitcoin is gaining significant attention. It is becoming increasingly hard to ignore Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance. At this point, most public companies are probably aware of Bitcoin as an option, though they are hesitant for various reasons. While I cannot be sure of this, I’m betting that there are such deals in the private equity and debt markets too. The largest sizes might not be close to MicroStrategy’s or MARA’s offerings, but the total magnitude could still be enormous, given a long tail of smaller companies which buy BTC. After all, BTC adoption has been a trend for both public and private companies. The picture I’m trying to paint here is that Bitcoin adoption is rapidly accelerating, and this is taking the form of corporations piling into BTC and even raising money to buy BTC. The least impactful result of this is that it sets a very strong price floor for BTC and IBIT. The more likely result is that the BTC market will get cornered and pushed much higher due to a massive supply shock. With the new IBIT options market opening the door to highly reflexive gamma vanna squeezes, the chance of a massive rally in IBIT and BTC seems higher than ever before. Conclusion I believe a gamma vanna squeeze unlike anything we’ve ever witnessed could be coming to BTC now that IBIT options are live. The combination of BTC’s volatility and price dynamics with the fact that it is absolutely scarce creates a powder keg of explosive potential. The case is even stronger when you consider the coming wave of corporations which have or will adopt Bitcoin. Even if you don’t think BTC has any value, you should still consider the favorable economics behind it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740237-ibit-options-and-insatiable-corporate-demand-historic-squeeze-coming-to-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36854014.jpeg
36853875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654856,1732597215,Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next,"Bitcoin recently came close to breaking the $100,000 price mark last week, reaching a high of $99,645 before encountering resistance. According to CryptoQuant analyst Percival, the psychological barrier of round numbers like $100,000 often serves as a point where traders exit positions for “relative safety.” Since climbing from $73,000 to $99,800, Percival highlighted that Bitcoin has recorded a roughly 57% gain, ranking it among the ‘top six exit rallies from consolidation zones.’ Despite this, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests that Bitcoin may enter a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? BTC Faces Resistance Below $100K: What Lies Ahead? Percival emphasized the significance of the Choppiness Index, a metric that gauges market momentum. According to him, the index indicates that Bitcoin’s rally is losing strength weekly. This suggests the cryptocurrency could consolidate for several weeks before another rally begins. Analyzing previous market cycles, particularly in 2020, Percival noted that Bitcoin’s first post-consolidation correction lasted approximately three weeks, with an 18% price drop. If history repeats, the next rally may occur in the latter half of December. The analyst also pointed to Long-Term Holder (LTH) behavior as a critical factor in understanding Bitcoin’s current market dynamics. LTHs are currently seeing 350% in profit and are in a supply distribution phase, with approximately 575,000 Bitcoins (worth around $58 billion) re-entering the market. Despite this, demand has remained strong, driven by inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and purchases from institutional players like MicroStrategy. Using the STH Realized Profit and Loss metric, Percival further explored Short-Term Holder (STH) activity. He noted that short-term holders account for 30.2% of the profits recorded during this phase. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has exceeded 1.33σ, signaling that the average token is approaching the 1.4σ zone, corresponding to 40% unrealized profits. Historically, this zone aligns with the first correction following a significant rally, as observed in late 2020. What to Expect Next for Bitcoin Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s trajectory may depend on several factors, including the pace of its consolidation phase and the behavior of institutional and retail investors. If the current consolidation period mirrors the patterns of previous cycles, Bitcoin could stabilize before attempting another push beyond $100,000. However, short-term corrections may still occur with LTHs continuing to take profits and STHs remaining active.

42389118,3a855a40-df64-4594-84d7-a1e65f932a6c,1732596737,"Bitcoin Slides Near $94K, but Short-Term Bullish Target of $100K BTC Unchanged","A bitcoin (BTC)-led crypto market correction continued into its third day as the asset lost a further 3.5% in the past 24 hours, nearing $94,000 a week after it came within touching distance of the landmark $100,000 level for the first time.    BTC has pared weekly gains from over 10% to just 3% amid profit-taking on the expected pullback. Major tokens have followed the tumble, data shows, with Solana’s SOL, BNB, Cardano’s ADA and dogecoin (DOGE) falling as much as 7% in the past 24 hours.    The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the biggest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, is down nearly 3%.    As such, a short-term target of $100,000 per BTC remains unchanged, with analysts viewing a correction of as much as 10% from the peak (or as low as $92,000) as a “natural phenomenon.”    “This correction occurred due to leverage overheating, as open interest and estimated leverage ratio reached annual highs,” CryptoQuant independent analyst MAC_D said in a Tuesday note. “Therefore, a 10-20% correction can be seen as a natural phenomenon.”    “From an on-chain perspective, cycle metrics such as MVRV, NUPL, and Puell Multiple still indicate that Bitcoin is in a bull market with upward potential. The key here is to identify major accumulation periods during corrections, with the 'Short-Term SOPR' metric being particularly useful,” MAC_D added.      The Short-Term SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) looks at whether people who have owned bitcoin for a short time are making or losing money when they sell. CryptoQuant defines short-term holders as those who have held BTC for over 1 hour but less than 155 days.    If the SOPR value is over 1, these holders are thought to be selling their bitcoin for more than they paid (making a profit). If it's below 1, they're selling for less (taking a loss). The SOPR value reached 1.096 last week, showing that short-term holders made money and were inclined to sell — contributing to the current weakness in BTC.    However, bitcoin tends to bounce back when short-term holders sell at a loss. And some say this creates a buying opportunity for traders at current levels to reach a potential target of $100,000 and above in the coming weeks.    “The record inflow of stablecoin capital into Binance indicates that we are likely in the midst of, but not near, the end of the current bull market,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, told CoinDesk in an email. “Bitcoin is undergoing a corrective phase, likely driven by profit-taking, which may result in the price consolidating before a potential move toward the key psychological level of $100,000.”   It’s a ride that some expect to be packed with market volatility.   “It's going to be extremely choppy markets for crypto in the near future with BTC technicals flashing extremely overbought levels, against an 'animal spirit' charged public that's developing a FOMO appetite for the asset class,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message Tuesday.    “We can see a further squeeze on BTC prices to the 120k to 130k area if markets manage to break the 100k wall, but are less sanguine on a smooth ride up with asset markets being overbought across the board,” Fan added.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | BNB,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/bitcoin-slides-near-94-k-but-short-term-bullish-target-of-100-k-btc-unchanged,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ee7760e7689533b9cae95bce5944f33cedb243c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36852590,https://square.htx.com/?p=41654,1732594658,"Justin Sun Grabs Global Attention with a Banana, $6.2 Million Viral Artwork Embodying the Power of Crypto Culture","On November 21, 2024 (UTC), Justin Sun , Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON, recently made headlines by purchasing Maurizio Cattelan’s “Comedian” for a staggering $6.2 million at Sotheby’s Now and Contemporary Evening Sale. The artwork, featuring a banana taped to a wall, has now earned the title of the most expensive fruit ever produced. The news rapidly went viral, fueling a wave of discussions across the internet worldwide. People are now speculating about the true intentions behind this crypto mogul’s latest move. Justin attended HTX Live’s special program on November 22 (UTC), where he shared his story with the banana and engaged in discussions with renowned crypto influencers and blockchain media about the significance of this art auction for the crypto ecosystem. The Viral Duct-Taped Banana: A Phenomenal Meme Justin stated that he had known about the “duct-taped banana” for quite some time, but it was through meme coins that he truly grasped a deep understanding of this artwork. In his work with the asset listing business on the HTX platform, Justin did extensive research on the meme ecosystem and came across a meme featuring a banana (BAN, listed on HTX in late October this year), igniting his interest in “Comedian” and the auction. Justin was just taking a shot when he placed a bid on the banana, but to his surprise, he actually won! What came next was beyond anything he could have imagined.”I never thought this banana would become such a sensation. People might know it’s big in the crypto space, but I never thought it would go viral beyond that circle.” Justin said. “I watched my WeChat Index skyrocket, even surpassing Pony Ma (Tencent CEO Ma Huateng) at one point. This banana made headlines in the New York Times, BBC, CNN, and more. It becomes even hotter than the G20 summit.” What astonished Justin was the fact that despite the auction showcasing several items valued at nearly $20 million, “almost 90% of attendees came just for the banana during the preview, while the other $18 million worth of collections were largely ignored,” he added. “It reminded me of meme coins, which once stole the spotlight from Bitcoin and became the market’s darling. I hope this artwork inspires deep thought and bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.” From Buffett’s Lunch to the Banana Flying to Space The lunch with Warren Buffett is another of Justin’s auction successes that cannot be overlooked. Reflecting on that lunch, Justin recalled giving Buffett two pieces of advice: “I advised Buffett to invest most of his cash in two investment targets. One was Tesla, which was priced very low at the time, and the other was cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Four years later, the world has seen massive changes, with Musk’s rise and the booming crypto sector. Unfortunately, Buffett did not take the advice, and it now seems like a missed opportunity.” Musk also has a rather interesting connection with bananas. On its sixth test flight, Starship not only carried an artificial banana as a zero-gravity indicator, but its exterior also sported a banana-themed paint job. When asked about the fate of the auctioned banana, Justin remarked, “I hope to attach this banana to Musk’s SpaceX rocket and send it to Mars. It would be a scene full of meme-worthy humor. Imagine a banana strapped to a rocket, hurtling through the cosmos toward Mars or the Moon, then being auctioned off for charity upon its return to Earth. Such an act would be visually captivating, perfectly embodying the spirit of memes while showcasing how crypto culture can transcend boundaries and break conventions. Banana: A Bridge Between the Public and the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Expensive as the $6.2 million banana is, it acts like a lever, capturing worldwide attention. To Justin, the banana represents the unique aesthetic of the crypto community. Unlike traditional art, it carries a much stronger emotional impact. “The art world and the crypto space are closely intertwined. PEOPLE, for example, was also connected to art auctions, where people came together to fund a bid for a copy of the U.S. Constitution. However, the points that spark interest in these two communities are distinct. The crypto space, unlike the art world, excels at using humor and rebellion to convey culture, enabling it to more easily reach a broader audience. This aesthetic, which resonates more with the emotions of ordinary people, may be the thing that sets it apart from the traditional art,” Justin explained. For this auction, guests attending HTX Live’s livestream shared their insights and reflections. Crypto influencer DaDa remarked, “The banana artwork is a prime example of Meme culture. Its creation was intended to challenge the traditional concept of value in the art world through humor while evoking resonance with its absurd expression. The crypto community and Meme culture share a natural affinity, as cryptocurrencies inherently embody an anti-authoritarian and decentralized spirit. The global attention generated by this auction can help bridge the gap between traditional and crypto cultures, accelerating the globalization of Web3. Through this artwork, more people unfamiliar with the crypto market will come to see that Bitcoin is on the verge of breaking $100,000 and begin to appreciate the cultural dimensions of the crypto space.” Jack Kong, the founder of Nano Labs, believes that “Meme coins are an inherent part of blockchain’s financial culture, with a promising long-term future. Essentially, Bitcoin, in its early days, was also regarded as a meme, yet it evolved into a global financial miracle. This proves that memes can achieve the impossible. The true significance of Justin’s auction is not what he has contributed to the meme sector, but how he himself has become a meme.” According to HTX spokesperson @HTX_liuyego, Justin’s $6.2 million purchase of “Comedian” represents a remarkable milestone in both the history of art and cryptocurrency. He stated, “This will inspire more creators to enter the crypto space, enriching the ecosystem as a whole. I’m excited to see how this event will be re-evaluated in the years to come.” The post Justin Sun Grabs Global Attention with a Banana, $6.2 Million Viral Artwork Embodying the Power of Crypto Culture first appeared on HTX Square .",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | OTHER | PEOPLE,,0,0,Huobi blog,https://square.htx.com/justin-sun-grabs-global-attention-with-a-banana/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png

The price is now trading near $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is showing positive signs and might eye a fresh increase above the $1.50 resistance. XRP Price Holds Gains XRP price formed a base above $1.30 and started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.350 and $1.42 resistance levels. It even pumped above the $1.45 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past two sessions. The price spiked above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.50 resistance zone. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading near $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.4680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.50 level. The next key resistance could be $1.550 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. A clear move above the $1.550 resistance might send the price toward the $1.6350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.680 resistance or even $1.6850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.720 or $1.750. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.50 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.400 level and the triangle’s lower trend line. The next major support is near the $1.380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.3200 support. The next major support sits near the $1.2650 zone.

So far in November, Solana-based DEXes have recorded over $100 billion in trading volume, marking a major milestone for the ecosystem. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Gains Momentum, Outshines Ethereum DeFi Solana, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a reported market cap of $118.34 billion has been on a record-breaking price trajectory. Recently, the digital asset established a new all-time-high (ATH) of $263 after having hit as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX fiasco. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bulls Stay in Control: Rally Far From Over? Now, the layer-1 blockchain has achieved another milestone as Solana-based DEXes surpassed $100 billion for the first time in monthly trading volume. According to data from DefiLlama, the 30-day cumulative trading volume recorded by Solana DEXes stands at $116.51 billion. In comparison, Ethereum mainnet-based DEXes saw $61.61 billion in trading volume during the same period. This means Solana’s DEX trading volume was more than double that of Ethereum’s. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana’s DEX volume surged over 100% from October, which stood at $52.5 billion. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has increased to $9.30 billion, up from $6.23 billion a month ago. The unprecedented rise in Solana-based DEX trading volume can be attributed to several factors. These include the ongoing memecoin frenzy, the blockchain’s low transaction fees, and an intuitive user interface. It is worth highlighting that Solana’s TVL has yet to surpass its ATH TVL of $10.02 billion, which was recorded almost three years ago in November 2021. In January 2023, the blockchain’s TVL hit a low of $210 million, dragged down by the wider crypto bear market exacerbated by the downfall of FTX exchange. At the time of writing, $3.58 billion of Solana’s TVL is tied to the liquid staking protocol Jito, while Jupiter DEX holds $2.4 billion. Another prominent Solana-based DEX, Raydium, accounts for $2.37 billion of TVL. Where Is SOL Headed? Solana’s growing user adoption has played a crucial role in driving the recovery of its native token, SOL. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SOL has gained over 157%, rising from $101 on January 1 to $263 on November 23. Related Reading: Solana Records New ATH After 3 Years: Is SOL Ready To Flip USDT? Despite such extraordinary returns, crypto experts remain bullish on SOL, expecting further gains for the digital asset. According to a recent analysis by Titan of Crypto, SOL may hit $400 as it appears to be breaking out from a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern. Additional bullish factors, such as the declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance and the rising likelihood of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), could further propel SOL to new highs. SOL trades at $248.31 at press time, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Despite Bitcoin (BTC) being at the center of Trump’s presidential campaign, one notable asset among his holdings is Ethereum (ETH), of which he owns nearly 496 coins. This altcoin has been the standout performer among his investments, rising 38% over the past thirty days. Trump’s Crypto Holdings Shine Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe pointed out a bullish divergence on Ethereum’s daily chart, suggesting that the current market dynamics are ripe for further growth. The analyst identified a key driver behind ETH’s recent performance: a significant drop in government bond yields. As these yields decline, van de Poppe suggests that investor interest in riskier assets like Ethereum tends to increase, propelling prices higher. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy: MicroStrategy Adds 55,500 More BTC To Its Portfolio For $5.4 Billion Van de Poppe elaborated that the ongoing fluctuations in the yield markets could significantly impact Ethereum’s trajectory. With Labor Market Week approaching, he speculated that if economic indicators are weak, the Federal Reserve might implement more rate cuts. Such actions would likely lead to lower yields, further boosting Ethereum’s price. Another analyst, Jesse Olson, echoed this optimistic outlook, noting that Ethereum’s dominance over Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish divergence. His analysis indicates that positive momentum could soon lead to significant buying opportunities for ETH. As a result of these developments, Trump’s crypto holdings have surged by nearly $1.6 million within the past 24 hours, reflecting the positive market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and other tokens in his portfolio. Major Investment From TRON Founder In a related development, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has emerged as a major investor in Trump’s World Liberty Financial, committing $30 million to the decentralized finance (DeFi) project. Sun, the founder of the TRON cryptocurrency, declared his support for Trump’s vision of turning the US into a blockchain hub. He noted, “TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation,” highlighting the project’s ambition to democratize financial services by eliminating intermediaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance World Liberty Financial, which was launched shortly after Trump survived a second assassination attempt, aims to raise $300 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. However, the project has recently revealed that its WLF token offerings are primarily being marketed offshore, with only $30 million set aside for US investors. Once this threshold is met, the US offering will close, despite having a substantial amount of tokens still available for sale. Trump is also reportedly in discussions for the acquisition of the digital asset marketplace Bakkt Holdings Inc. through Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which he controls. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,435, up 2.4% for the 24-hour period.

Chainlink Could Find Major Resistance At The $20 Level In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed how the resistance barriers for LINK are currently looking in terms of the on-chain cost basis distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst. It shows the amount of the asset acquired at each price range that Chainlink has visited in its history. As displayed in the graph, many Chainlink investors purchased their tokens inside the $18.4 to $26.3 range. More specifically, around 100,220 addresses acquired 57.2 million LINK at these price levels. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price range to act as support or resistance is measured using the number of coins bought inside it. The reason behind this lies in investor psychology. Generally, holders consider their cost basis a special level since a retest of it can flip their profit-loss status. As such, they can be more prone to making panic moves when this retest happens. Investors carrying a loss before the retest may fear that the price would return shortly, so they could be tempted to sell and get their money back. Similarly, holders with their cost basis retested from above could decide to accumulate more, believing that the level will eventually become profitable again. Both of these effects aren’t consequential when the cost basis of a few investors gets retested. Still, in the scenario where many addresses have their cost basis in a tight range, the reaction produced from a retest may be big enough to cause visible fluctuations in the asset. Related Reading: 54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump The aforementioned Chainlink price range around the average value of $22 holds the cost basis of many investors, so it’s possible that LINK could find it hard to break through these levels. As Martinez has pointed out, however, if the cryptocurrency can clear this hurdle, it could potentially have an easy run up to a new ATH since not many investors currently have their acquisition level in the price range after the $22 demand zone. Regarding the ranges under the current price, there are a couple of hefty ones nearby, like $13 to $15 and $11 to $13. If the asset goes through a correction, these levels could potentially help cushion a fall. LINK Price Chainlink has witnessed a rally of almost 10% over the last 24 hours, taking its price to the $18.4 mark.

36845476,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654837,1732581020,"From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs","The crypto market witnessed a significant milestone last week as investment products recorded roughly $3.13 billion in net inflows globally, primarily driven by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to data from CoinShares. This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Metric Signals Market Heating Up—Here’s What Investors Should Know Bitcoin Takes The Lead, Altcoins Show Growth The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. Global Crypto Inflows And Regional Trends US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class.

Bitcoin’s inching toward a jaw-dropping $100K, and Ethereum’s recent updates are turning heads across the blockchain world. This November is bringing some serious heat in the crypto market. With Bitcoin dominating headlines and Ethereum hitting its extended price target of $3,565, the race for the best cryptos to buy in November 2024 has never been more exciting. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a rising star in the altcoin arena. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics isn’t just here to ride the wave—it’s solving the kind of real-life problems that leave others scratching their heads. From simplifying payments to shielding users from crypto’s notorious volatility, Qubetics is setting itself apart. Oh, and let’s not forget its scorching-hot presale phase, with a potential 900% ROI post-launch. If you’re thinking of shaking up your portfolio, stick around as we dive into Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Qubetics ($TICS): A Wallet for the Future Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin trying to make a splash—it’s a full-blown ecosystem. Their non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is like the Swiss Army knife of crypto wallets, handling everything from Multi-Chain asset management to seamless integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Picture this: you’re grabbing coffee, and instead of fumbling with cards or cash, you just tap your phone. Simple, right? That’s Qubetics in action, making crypto as user-friendly as everyday payment systems. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics is skipping those pesky No KYC processes . Hate jumping through hoops to verify your identity? Qubetics has your back, offering secure transactions without the red tape. And their smart contract conversion mechanism? Pure genius. It automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale, protecting users and businesses from market swings. Whether you’re a small business owner or a freelancer invoicing clients overseas, Qubetics ensures every transaction is smooth and secure. As of now, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 10, with each $TICS token priced at $0.025. The numbers speak for themselves—$3.2M raised, over 220M tokens sold, and a growing community of 4,100 holders. With the next phase bringing a 10% price hike and the final phase promising a 20% jump, early investors stand to gain big. By the time $TICS hits $0.25 post-launch, that’s a 900% ROI. If you’re wondering about the best cryptos to buy in November 2024, this might just be your golden ticket. Bitcoin (BTC): The King Keeps Climbing Bitcoin’s been around the block (pun intended), but it’s showing no signs of slowing down. As it hovers just shy of the $100K mark, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market like a rockstar on a comeback tour. This milestone isn’t just about numbers—it’s about cementing its place as the go-to store of value in the digital age. So, what’s fueling Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? For starters, institutional adoption is at an all-time high. Big-name players like BlackRock and Fidelity are doubling down on Bitcoin ETFs, making it more accessible to everyday investors. And let’s talk about those Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. These updates are making Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use, solving one of its biggest criticisms: scalability. Sure, Bitcoin isn’t perfect. It’s still energy-intensive, and transaction speeds aren’t winning any races. But with its limited supply of 21 million coins, it’s as deflationary as they come. Think of it as digital gold—except instead of gathering dust in a vault, it’s shaking up finance as we know it. If you’re looking for a crypto with a proven track record, Bitcoin’s your guy. It’s not just one of the best cryptos to buy in November 2024—it’s the O.G. of blockchain. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract Pioneer Ethereum has always been the brains behind the blockchain revolution, and it’s showing no signs of losing that edge. This November, Ethereum hit a key milestone, climbing to $3,565. But ETH isn’t just about price—it’s about power. With smart contracts driving everything from NFTs to DeFi platforms, Ethereum is the backbone of blockchain innovation. The recent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is a game-changer. By transitioning to proof-of-stake, Ethereum slashed its energy consumption by over 99%, making it one of the most eco-friendly options out there. And the speed? With sharding set to roll out soon, transaction times are about to go from a crawl to a sprint. What’s even cooler? Ethereum’s versatility. Whether you’re minting an NFT or launching a decentralized app, Ethereum makes it all possible. It’s like the tech nerd in school who ended up building the next big thing. That said, ETH isn’t cheap. But quality rarely is, right? If you’re eyeing long-term growth and innovation, Ethereum deserves a spot in your portfolio. It’s no wonder ETH is consistently ranked among the best cryptos to buy in November 2024. The Final Verdict So, which blockchain beast should you bet on? It all boils down to what you’re looking for. Want a revolutionary project that simplifies crypto for everyday use? Go for Qubetics($TICS). Looking for a tried-and-true investment with unmatched market dominance? Bitcoin (BTC) is your pick. And if innovation and versatility are your jam, Ethereum (ETH) is calling your name. Based on the latest research, we recommend adding Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to your watchlist as the best cryptos to buy in November 2024 . Time to take the plunge.

A road map released by the FCA, which oversees the industry, said the agency plans to publish discussion papers on market abuse and disclosures by the end of this year. It intends to have papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and lending by early next year. The regime is scheduled to go live after the final policy statements are published in 2026.  An FCA-commissioned study shows ownership of crypto assets grew by 4% in the past two years, to include some 7 million adults out of the country's roughly 68 million population.  The road map follows a speech by Economic Secretary Tulip Sidiq last week that promised draft regulation for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and staking by early next year. That was the first sign from the Labour government elected in July of how it plans to approach the crypto industry. The roadmap is the regulator's attempt to be ""transparent"" and canvass industry support.  “We’re committed to working closely with the Government, international partners, industry and consumers to help us get the future rules right,” said Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA.  The U.K.'s crypto regime will follow after the European Unions Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, regulations, a comprehensive set of rules for crypto, which is set to go live by the end of this year.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/25/u-k-financial-regulator-aims-for-crypto-regime-by-2026,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c27d71bef19117b7837df8ca2e12bd61097a3646-1432x806.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
