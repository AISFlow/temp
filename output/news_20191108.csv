Speaking at the World Blockchain Summit in Wuzhen, China on Friday, Tencent blockchain chief Yige Cai said the company's virtual bank received the SFC's green-light. Moving forward, the company will assemble a team to support the blockchain-based banking platform, according to Chinese media site Sina Finance.  ""Hong Kong’s new regulations and supervision on digital assets transactions validates the importance of blockchain technology and digital assets, which is good news for the whole industry,"" Cai said in his speech at the summit.  The SFC has granted virtual bank licences to 12 entities so far. On the list is Infinium Limited, a joint venture between Tencent, Industrial and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC) and other two Hong Kong-based institutional investors.  Tencent renamed Infinium to Fusion Bank in July after it received the license in May.  Cai did not disclose further details about the virtual bank, while stressing Tencent’s existing blockchain projects, including the offering of a supply chain financing for global fast food chain restaurant McDonald’s, according to the report.  According to another report, Cai is currently leading the consortium blockchain group out of the three blockchain development groups in Tencent. The other two are responsible for blockchain infrastructure and its blockchain-based cloud services, respectively.  Other companies include Alibaba’s fintech arm Ant Financial and SC Digital Solutions Limited, whose 65 percent stake is owned by Standard & Chartered Bank.  The SFC published details about its new licensing system to regulate virtual asset transactions on Wednesday, creating a similar framework to the one overseeing securities brokers.

42431160,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Vzh,1573245021,"Bitcoin Falls 4.3%, Slipping Below $9,000 for First Time in Two Weeks","Bitcoin fell 4.4 percent Friday, slipping below $9,000 for the first time in two weeks.  Analysts cited a lack of positive market drivers and speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve might pause this year's rate-cutting cycle, which could curb demand for the cryptocurrency as a potential inflation hedge.  The price dropped to $8,800 as of 18:57 UTC (1:57 p.m. New York time), according to Trading View. It's still more than double where bitcoin was at the start of the year, leaving the cryptocurrency as one of the world's best-performing asset classes in 2019.  Bitcoin had rallied more $2,000 in late October after Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that the country would embrace blockchain - the decentralized computing networks underpinning cryptocurrencies - as a ""core"" technology, followed by the reveal of hundreds of blockchain projects already in motion. Since then, though, the price had mostly fluctuated within a range between $9,100 and $9,600.  Friday's decline accelerated after bitcoin broke below its 200-day moving average of $9,186, which had been seen as a price support by some traders using technical analysis.  ""This is a pretty classic example of a technical move,"" said Kevin Kelly, co-founder at Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm in New York. ""It just sort of broke to the downside.""  The price drop appears to have triggered margin calls for some traders, leading to position liquidations and creating additional selling pressure, Kelly said.  One of the macroeconomic narratives for buying bitcoin is that, like gold, it can be used as an inflation hedge, Kelly said. But with increasing signs that the economy might be responding to the Fed's three interest-rate cuts earlier this year, speculation is mounting that the U.S. central bank might refrain in the near term from further moves to ease monetary policy, he said.  ""You have seen an unwind of the consensus on this doomsday narrative,"" Kelly said.  Some investors may also have become more skeptical that China's public push to use blockchain would translate into new demand for bitcoin, according to Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research.  While many traders thought bitcoin, as the original blockchain and biggest digital asset by market value, might benefit from broader adoption of the technology, if China has been at work developing a digital version of its own currency, it could be a win for blockchain technology on the whole but mean little for bitcoin today.  ""My opinion is that that wasn't the right read of that news,"" Cipolaro said. ""They were clearly saying blockchain not bitcoin.""  With that realization in the backdrop, ""you really haven't seen follow-through on the price,"" he said.

42431174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0WPh,1573227020,PODCAST: Meltem Demirors on the 3 Things Bitcoin Represents,"“Let's untangle that a bit,” says Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer of CoinShares. “Bitcoin represents three different things.”  In this episode of Bitcoin Macro  , one of the most prolific voices in the space speaks with CoinDesk’s head of strategy, Nolan Bauerle, about bitcoin as software, as a “supranational global communication network” and as an asset.  “For traditional investors, it's sort of a challenging paradigm when these three things are wrapped together,” Demirors explained.  The conversation takes place ahead of Demirors’ appearance at CoinDesk's Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12. The Bitcoin Macro pop-up podcast series features speakers and themes from the event, which explores bitcoin’s current role in the global financial system.  On the podcast, Demirors talks with Bauerle about:  Why crypto is all-encompassing to the people in the space, but barely registers for most investors.  Why Libra is in many ways the antithesis of bitcoin.  Why the U.S. dollar remains the most desired asset in troubled regions and why education is key to bitcoin one day playing that role.  Why speculation is a gateway for deeper engagement with bitcoin.  How the global “hunt for yield” is shaping the bitcoin narrative.  The “future fetish” era of blockchain development.  Why the idea of bitcoin as “unregulated” isn’t quite accurate.  The new battles around central bank digital currencies.  Why the most interesting metric in the crypto space is the percentage of bitcoin held by third-party institutions.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.      Nolan Bauerle: (00:09)  Welcome to Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast produced as part of the CoinDesk: Invest New York conference in November. I'm your host Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leaders thinkers in finance, crypto, and beyond.  Nolan Bauerle: (00:29)  I'm delighted to be joined today by Meltem Demirors, one of the most famous people in crypto, that's for sure. Meltem has been around for a long time, but really sprung to international prominence with her amazing testimony in a Congress Committee this past summer on the whole Libra offering. The people who have been working in cryptocurrencies for a long time have always been aware of Meltem's brilliance, and she's been kind enough to join us for today's podcast.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:05)  This podcast is really trying to look at bitcoin's place in the world today, and is a taste of the type of content that we're going to be focusing on in New York City on November the 12th at Invest. So Meltem, thank you for joining me.  Meltem Demirors: (01:21)  Thank you so much for having me, Nolan. That was such a beautiful intro. I feel like I'd love to have you intro me all the time.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:32)  [inaudible 00:01:32]. I have had the good fortune of knowing you for quite a while now.  Meltem Demirors: (01:35)  I know. We met a long time ago.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:37)  And watching you gather up all this ability to sort of let your ideas shine on the global stage has been a real treat, and I'm happy to have even met you on the train back from Washington that day.  Meltem Demirors: (01:49)  That's right. I think I was enjoying a Bud Light.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:57)  You definitely earned it. You definitely earned it. So let's jump right in. We're talking about bitcoin in the world today, and the first question I have really is around whether or not you see bitcoin as a true macro asset? Is it there? Is it in the main stage? Is it in the side stage somewhere? Is it in the wings? Or is this really something that can be thought of as the macro today?  Meltem Demirors: (02:19)  I think for most people in the world right now, particularly in the world of investing and finance, bitcoin and crypto assets are not yet an asset they think about. It's a very small asset class. It's around 200 to 250 billion right now. That's very small, and so for most investors looking to allocate capital moving even 5 to 10 million dollars into the coin creates a lot of price movement, and there are not really efficient ways to do that today. So that's one concern I think certainly.  Meltem Demirors: (02:55)  I think the other piece to think about just on a macro level that's really relevant is macro investors sort of define the world in the context of specific assets in markets, and so I think as an investor you look at sovereign debt, and you look at debt generally as an asset class, corporate debt funds, you look at equities, and then a lot of people like to lump crypto under the alternatives category. Alternatives is sort of a growing part of the investment world, and I think it's challenging for a lot of investors, even in the alternative space, to really try to figure out where bitcoin fits in.  Meltem Demirors: (03:38)  And so, I think the big challenge is to people in our industry, we like to talk about bitcoin as an asset class, because we live, breath, eat, sleep crypto all day every day, and certainly in our little part of the world bitcoin feels like the big asset, but I think frankly to most investors bitcoin's not really on their consciousness, and if it is it's far too early, and if anything the place are getting exposure if through their PA or personal account, certainly not through their firm, or their fund, and I don't think that's going to change in the near future, and we can talk about that more as well.  Nolan Bauerle: (04:20)  So in practice what you're saying is it's not quite there yet. If it was in this sort of macro level the features that would define it, the aspect of it that would sort of propel it forward, I think we can even trace to some of your testimony back in Washington in July. In that testimony, I think what we saw was you had Facebook, which was almost threatening, not a nation-state, but it was taking on certain powers. It was taking on certain responsibilities that we would normally prescribe to a nation-state, and it was saying we're going to issue this private money, that, of course, got everyone's back up.  Nolan Bauerle: (04:58)  I think one of the things that was remarkable about your testimony is you showed that bitcoin didn't propose these same challenges, yet it is coherently creating what amounts to a digital jurisdiction at the same time, and is perhaps is at the foundation for this type of macro asset going forward, the foundation for what could amount to an important money supply, a hard money supply.  Meltem Demirors: (05:25)  Let's untangle that a bit. So I think what's challenging when we talk about bitcoin is unlike debt or equities bitcoin represents three different things. Bitcoin is technology in the context of the bitcoin protocol, which is open-source code, and open-source software has been a part of our world for a long time, and open source is I think starting to gain acceptance as an investible category in the venture world and beyond. And so, bitcoin at its core is the bitcoin protocol.  Meltem Demirors: (05:56)  Bitcoin is a network and what's interesting here is bitcoin is kind of a supranational global communication network, and so there are tens of thousands of devices around the world, whether people are running minors, or people are just running full nodes there's this network of computational devices that are maintaining the bitcoin ledger, and engaging the invalidating transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the ledger, and so the bitcoin network is physical in nature.  Meltem Demirors: (06:26)  And then, lastly, you have bitcoin the asset. And so, what I think is interesting here is for traditional investors it's sort of a challenging paradigm when these three things are wrapped together, so when you see people look at bitcoin they'll talk about bitcoins in the context of software infrastructure. You'll hear people talking about bitcoin in the context of a commodity because it's produced in its mind digitally in the way that we sort of think about producing and mining things like gold, and oil, that are limited in supply theoretically.  Meltem Demirors: (06:57)  And then, you have people talking about it in the context of currency, of hard money. What I think is interesting about Libra is Libra styles itself as a cryptocurrency, but really the point I was trying to make in Congress is anyone can call anything a cryptocurrency but that does not make it so. What's interesting about bitcoin is unlike a commodity, unlike a bond, unlike an equity bitcoin is packed by nothing but the demand for it.  Meltem Demirors: (07:25)  And so, it's a little bit unique in that regard. It has no physicality, which I think is part of the larger conversation about the evolution from highly physical to where we increasingly engage digitally. So that's difficult for people to grasp. It doesn't necessarily fit into the constructs we have for assets in our world, even assets that have been dematerialized part in like stocks that trade, you know, they still have a physical share certificate that's somewhere.  Meltem Demirors: (07:53)  And then, I think the other component that's interesting is when we look at what Libra is comprised of, and what it proposes to do, it's really just a pooled investment vehicle where the interest in the fees accrue to the association. And so, I think it's an interesting series of choices made by Facebook. I'm not really clear as to why they felt this was the best approach, but I think if you look at the intent of Libra it's a pool of capital. You're taking money from people who purchase the tokens, you're putting it into currencies, and interest-bearing instruments, and we're holding it, and then we're distributing that plus transaction fees to people who participate in this private closed sort of group called the Libra Association.  Meltem Demirors: (08:37)  And so, to me, that's sort of the antithesis of bitcoin. So my only goal really in the testimony was to help clarify that bitcoin is not Libra, bitcoin is separate and distinct from every other cryptocurrency and it has features that make it incredibly unique. And Libra, and many things, are in fact not cryptocurrencies. There's a lot of ambiguity in language but certainly having specificity in how we use these terms is starting to become more and more important, particularly for regulators, policy makers, who are trying to understand what's happening, but sometimes the translation they're getting isn't particularly helpful, and in fact can be more confusing than not.  Nolan Bauerle: (09:19)  So I want to pick up on two things that you said, and you said that Libra's, of course, this pool investment, so the incentives of all these parties are definitely for protection fees, but you also mentioned that because bitcoin is only backed by the demand of the user that it really can exist as an uncorrelated asset, because Libra would theoretically be involved in all the ups and downs of a typical economy because the value of bitcoin is only really based on the demand that users and people have for it. Can it behave as a safe-haven asset?  Meltem Demirors: (09:59)  I think the idea of a safe haven is an interesting conversation. I think the way people typically frame this is this risk-on or risk-off asset. And I think the challenge with safe haven is again everything's relative, so if I live in the United States, and I have US dollars, and I have a driver's license, and I have a bank account, and a debit card I probably don't view bitcoin as a safe haven asset, because the dollar's pretty safe for me, and I'm able to do everything I want, and I don't necessarily in times of crisis feel that the dollar depreciates rapidly, and so my purchasing power parody, my PP, stays intact.  Meltem Demirors: (10:42)  Now, conversely if I live in a part of the world where there is a lot of instability, and volatility, now I'm from Turkey personally, I was just there, and speaking to people about bitcoin, I think within the bitcoin community there's this idea that people who live in regimes or parts of the world where their purchasing power parody, or their ability to buy the same basket of goods fluctuates a lot, because of the fluctuations and the value of their local currency. I think in our community we like to believe that they're just going to rush to adopt bitcoin, and go out, and hold bitcoin.  Meltem Demirors: (11:17)  What's really funny is if you actually go out and talk to people they don't want to hold bitcoin they want US dollars. And so, this is where I think some of the challenge emerges in explaining a new asset class, and also really understanding some of the macroeconomic shifts happening in our world. We live in a dollar-denominated world today, and at the end of the day you can't yet pay your rent, or your taxes, or your employees, or for your groceries in bitcoin, and I think someday you'll be able to, and there's certainly a number of companies I've invested in, and worked with, and support that are enabling people to do that, but I think again for your average person who's living in a part of the world where they don't have stability in their currency I think they're not necessarily thinking of bitcoin as the solution, it's maybe one part of the solution.  Meltem Demirors: (12:12)  I think right now they're looking more at things like the dollar, and unfortunately, I think it's going to take some time for the world to get to a point where bitcoin achieves that status in a larger sort of way. I think to us in the bitcoin community we certainly like to pontificate about what hyper bitcoinization will look like, and what a world will look like if people start holding bitcoin as a safe haven asset, but I just don't think that narrative on a global scale has gotten there yet, and I think again part of the challenge there is how you communicate something that is so new, and a lot of people ask who's the CEO of bitcoin, what's stopping bitcoin, and so explaining this it's really a fundamental shift in mental model and how people think. It's a shift in trust instead of trusting an institution, or company, or a brand, you're trusting an idea, and a set of principles.  Meltem Demirors: (13:11)  And so, that in my view is going to take some time, and it's going to take the technology being developed, it's going to take the on and off-ramps being developed, it's going to take the user experience putting it a little easier, but most importantly it's going to take some hard work from our community to translate a lot of the topics we talk about into things that people are actually thinking about on a day-to-day basis.  Nolan Bauerle: (13:36)  And so, your recent experience in Turkey did it strengthen your idea what it wasn't quite there yet, but there was this work to do, or did it actually bring you out of a state of let's say being disconnected, and sitting in one of these bitcoin ivory towers saying this is what bitcoinization is going to look like, and all that stuff, or was this just you've been enough times, you've seen it in this context, and you know that people just aren't ready, and even if we are seeing some increased trade flows out of Turkey on local bitcoins it really is still isolated individuals and it's not enough of a wave to really push the needle?  Meltem Demirors: (14:13)  So let's talk about that. I think first and foremost I feel like I've tried to constantly force myself to step outside the bitcoin world, and interact with people who come from a totally different perspective, totally different viewpoint. I think the context is really important, especially when one of your functions is serving as a translator. I sometimes feel like my role is I'm a translator between two very different worlds, and so we have these crazy bitcoiners over here, and I'm certainly a part of that community, but at the same time I'm also communicating with a very different audience who has the potential to really shape and influence the trajectory of bitcoin as a technology, as an infrastructure, and as an asset in very material ways, and so I think it's very important for me to be aware of all of the different perspectives and viewpoints in order to be an effective translator, and I do wish we did that more.  Meltem Demirors: (15:12)  I think hopefully that's starting, but we'll see. When it comes to Turkey, so Turkey's interesting because ING the bank releases this study every year, this is the second year they're done it. They just released it in October of this year, and what they look at is rates of digital currency adoption in different parts of the world, and Turkey ranks number one. And so, a lot of people are like oh yeah people in Turkey want to hold bitcoin because the lira is unstable, and that's an attractive narrative, but the reality actually is that Turkey is a place where people are already accustomed to trading FOREX.  Meltem Demirors: (15:50)  People like speculative trading. I'm a Turk myself so we have that cultural acceptance for speculation. And so, FOREX trading, currency trading, is something a lot of people engage in. You have a population that's already accustomed to digital banking because when banking services came to Turkey they kind of leapfrogged the '80s and '90s and it sort of went direct to digital. And then, you have a high population of young people who are really interested in the technology, and what they're doing is they're speculating on bitcoin.  Meltem Demirors: (16:26)  And I think that's certainly exciting, but I think the narrative that people have isn't, oh, I want to protect myself from price fluctuation in the lira, and certainly if you look at their experience over the last year even though the lira depreciated dramatically had they bought bitcoin when that happened, or before that happened, they would've lost more holding bitcoin. And so, I think again it's important to be careful with these narratives because it's very easy to overgeneralize, and I don't think we're quite at that point yet.  Nolan Bauerle: (16:56)  So you're saying the simple argument holds, they just want to make money like anybody else.  Meltem Demirors: (17:01)  And look, I think through that process I actually think speculation is one of the great drivers of bitcoin adoption, because as people start to speculate, and as people start to interact with bitcoin they start to appreciate some of the principles and social values, what it represents, and I think that leads to people holding bitcoin longer, and viewing it more and more in the context of a form of sound digital money, but I do think we get a little bit overly excited about narratives that aren't really quite supported by the evidence yet.  Meltem Demirors: (17:38)  Now, the good thing is I do think the bitcoin community's doing more diligent research. Cambridge in the UK releases their annual study on bitcoin and blockchain adoption. ING, which is a global bank, is now doing their report. The coverage and the research methodology keeps getting better and better. And within the crypto space there's also a number of new research firms that are starting to parse data in different ways to try to analyze, and provide more context, and insight as to what the actual growth metrics might look like, but I think as I travel around the world and interact with people all over the world that story just isn't there yet.  Nolan Bauerle: (18:16)  And so, going back to what you had mentioned about bitcoin presenting these opportunities for people to learn, and let's say inform their worldview, one sort of test that I've had for a long time about someone's world view is how accurately it can predict the future. A lot of bitcoin people have been saying we anticipate a global recession because of sovereign debt, and all these other factors. When we look around the world today we certainly see some of the things that people who have been in bitcoin as long as yourself have been predicting for some time. What we're not seeing, for example, recently in the United States not a recession, but we have seen let's say liquidity crunch with the repo news.  Nolan Bauerle: (19:00)  But bitcoin hasn't behaved in the way that most people had predicted according to these narratives, these narratives that sort of said if we have another round of quantitative easing in America you're going to see a lot of demand for bitcoin in America. The wider question being the following, what happens to bitcoin in a recession? Is it going to be this asset that you can use to get out of these little ups and downs around the world as many people have predicted for years now, or is it going to become more and more correlated and the demand will go down just because there isn't as much liquidity in general?  Meltem Demirors: (19:35)  I think this topic is an interesting one, and certainly, it's very tempting for people to buy into the recession narrative. After all, we are in the longest bull run in market history. We're not at 10 years and three months, and counting. And look, I think the fact of the matter is the financial system is changing. There're certain beliefs we're had for a long time about how markets should work, and how investing should work, and we're not seeing a lot of those beliefs we had being proven false.  Meltem Demirors: (20:11)  You look at just the sheer volume of negative-yielding debt. I mean, that's a bit mind-boggling. The numbers just don't make sense. You look at what's happening in the passive investing space. When you look at the challenges that many hedge funds are facing, and generating meaningful alpha, through active management. They're just a lot of challenges that the financial markets are facing, that investors are facing, but I don't think that points naturally to we are in for a recession, because at the end of the day capital continues to flow, we are continuing to see people continuing to move out on the risk curve investing in high-risk venture investing, more and more capital being deployed there.  Meltem Demirors: (20:57)  Alternatives continue to grow as an asset class. So I think this narrative of a recession is coming is a tempting one, but I think it's one that's sort of difficult to predict. I'm not really in the business of reading teal leaves if you will. What I think is more interesting to think about, and one thing we've never seen in how bitcoin behaves in a recession, right? Because bitcoin was introduced to the world in 2009 after the 2008 financial crisis, the bitcoin network launch, and so we've never seen it in an environment like a recession.  Meltem Demirors: (21:32)  And so, I think there are a lot of what I like to call unknown unknowns about what will happen when we enter that new time. And I think again the forces shaping our world and the forces shaping the financial system there are some known unknowns, but then I feel like a lot of investors I talk to feel like they're facing a lot of unknown unknowns, and so there are a lot of open questions about what the world will look like in this new era. It does feel like we're in a new stage of financial markets. Some people call this late-stage capitalism. Some people look to Japan as an example of what might happen.  Meltem Demirors: (22:11)  But again, I think my job really is trying to focus on what this means for bitcoin, and really trying to manage the ups and downs of what's happening with bitcoin and crypto assets, and put it in context for investors who are looking at the world feeling very confused, looking at bitcoin saying no way, this is too much, there's so much other stuff going on in my world that I don't need to add more risk, and add so much uncertainty by adding a highly volatile, poorly understood asset, that I just fundamentally don't get yet.  Nolan Bauerle: (22:45)  Yeah, so it's basically that perhaps we're living in an era of unlimited leverage for now, which makes basically everything funded including bitcoin, and all the ICOs, and all the crazy projects. What happens if that funding just isn't there anymore? Does bitcoin still stand up on its own, or is it a product all this free money all around the world that's just looking for risk? As you mentioned, appetites for risk are growing just because there is so much leverage out there that you can take in going.  Meltem Demirors: (23:16)  The hunt for yield, right? There is a hunt for yield because ultimately what we're relying on here in the US, and in many other Western developed economies, we have a population that is retiring, and pensions are underfunded. There are all of these social liabilities that need to get paid for, and historically the way we're paid for them is through the compounding of interest, and through yield, and when that stops working the only other alternatives is to extract it sort of from society through taxation, or through inflation, right?  Meltem Demirors: (23:51)  And we're seeing that effect around the world. You look at what's happening in Chile, you look at what's happening in Argentina, you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, you look at what's happening in the UK. There's only so much you can squeeze that out of a system, so I think there're a lot of fundamental existential questions about the relevance of nation-states, the relevance of currencies generally, and what I think is so interesting about bitcoin if we leave aside sort of the price of bitcoin, and these arguments around bitcoin as sound money, and these things that are very exciting, I think what's even more interesting is the questions that bitcoin introduces to the conversation.  Meltem Demirors: (24:33)  So when people first learn about bitcoin I think it opens their mind to the idea that there is a different choice, because we've never really contemplated a world where I could hold something other than government-issued currency, and so that to me is the more interesting, and more profound question, and now of course with China announcing the digital renminbi with a lot of US corporations including Facebook looking at getting involved in the currency game in different ways, or in the cryptocurrency game, or other versions of digitized dollar, or digitized store value, I think it starts to get really interesting.  Nolan Bauerle: (25:12)  Meltem, you've always enjoyed a real tremendous bird's eye view of the industry in your time with DCG and now with CoinShares. You're really someone who's able to not just be in touch with the sort of grassroots of the industry but also the more sophisticated investors, buyers, all of those folks. Have you seen a change from their perspective in the last six months around bitcoin in what they're looking for, the questions they're asking, and what they're interested in?  Meltem Demirors: (25:43)  Yeah. Absolutely. I think people are certainly getting smarter faster. I think a part of what's so amazing about the bitcoin community is just the extremely high level of quality content that's out there, that's produced by members of the community, for free, is easily available online, on Twitter, on people's websites, on blogs, and podcasts. There's just a real wealth of content information, knowledge being created to share, disseminated, expanded on, which I think is really exciting, and people are responding to that, and people are certainly reading that, and reacting to it.  Meltem Demirors: (26:23)  And so, I think people are starting to gain more of an appreciation for, an understanding, of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but at the same time I think there's also more confusion than ever, and unfortunately there're a lot of people who look to bitcoin's success and attempt to use it as a way to substantiate whatever their project is, and we saw a lot of this with the ICOs of 2017 and 2018. Everyone wanted to build a better, greener, faster, more scalable bitcoin, name your favorite feature here. I like to call this the era of future fetish in blockchains.  Meltem Demirors: (27:01)  But I think there are so many things about bitcoin that can't be replicated, but what you get is you get a bunch of people in the market who are spreading their own narratives around what bitcoin is and why their asset or their project is different, or better, and I think that market confusion is now being reflected at the government level where we see a lot of conversation around central bank-issued digital currency, a lot of fundamental misunderstandings about how bitcoin works, even in US Congress. I think there was this perception from some of our congressman and congresswoman that bitcoin was unregulated, and I think again the confusion there is yes as a protocol there is no regulation around bitcoin, but if you operate a bitcoin company, and you're domiciled in the US, or you touch a US customers your subject to the rules and regulations of this nation, and there are a lot of rules and regulations from every agency out there going from the CFTC, to the IRS, to FinCEN.  Meltem Demirors: (27:59)  So this sort of notion that bitcoin's unregulated I think is just a misunderstanding, and I think the media's also played a big part in that, in perpetuating some of the sensationalism of what's happening here, and so, unfortunately, there are these series of narratives that have defined bitcoin for the last 10 years of its existence. I think they're starting to die down and fade a bit, but I think that's just a really strong inertia that we as the bitcoin community need to overcome.  Meltem Demirors: (28:32)  And unfortunately, we have not done a very good job with storytelling, and with grasping the why. It still feels like it's stuck in a bit of an echo chamber, and so I'm really hopeful that as more, and more people start to understand bitcoin, start to get interested in bitcoin, and in digital currencies, and they go out there, and they educate themselves whether it's going through events, like Consensus: Invest, or whether it's listening to podcasts, or reading blogs that they'll start to piece together their own view of the world, but I guess that's one of the challenges of having no leader, and essential coordinator, and no marketing body for bitcoin.  Nolan Bauerle: (29:12)  I like the comment you made about that future fetish, because some of it comes up. People will say well what if there's a better bitcoin? Well, this isn't Nintendo. It's not consumer electronics. This is something different. This is cryptography and it develops at a different pace than Nintendo or video games. Just because something is newer doesn't mean it's more useful, and will sell at a fixed sum feature.  Meltem Demirors: (29:34)  Right.  Nolan Bauerle: (29:34)  The very idea that people have accepted demand for this secure network that in many ways is already the most secure network in the world, depending on your basis, or your metrics, you know, here it is. It's about the buy-in, you know? Not the same as consumer technology.  Meltem Demirors: (29:54)  Yeah, and I think when people talk about features a lot of the common complaints you hear about bitcoin are either around technical features, or certain aspects of bitcoin, and I think it sort of misses the point. Yes, bitcoin is technology. Yes, bitcoin is infrastructure, it's communication infrastructure, but we communicate about value, and we can also communicate other types of information. And yes, bitcoin is about money. But at the end of the day I think bitcoin more than anything else represents a social movement and a set of ideas, and I know that sounds very esoteric, and a bit philosophical, but I think what a lot of people are starting to grasp as they go down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole, and I love that we call it a rabbit hole, because it's such a strong reference to the movie The Matrix.  Meltem Demirors: (30:47)  I think as people start to learn more and more about bitcoin they understand that it's less and less about technical features, but it's more about some of the unique aspects of bitcoin's design that are impossible to replicate. And at the end of the day, we've seen this time and time again if you have a company that has paid employees, you have a known founder, you have entities that are set up that hold funds that were raised, that creates points of failure that governments can go after.  Meltem Demirors: (31:17)  And bitcoin's sort of birth and creation, and the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto, and how bitcoin was launched and released into the world I think has some of those characteristics of other social movements that sort of emerged that are leaderless that become really powerful. And by the way throughout history, a lot of revolutions have been started by pseudonymous or anonymous creators, writers who have hidden or obfuscated their names. And so, I think there's this interesting sort of tension there where a lot of people try to reduce or simplify bitcoin to just technology, or to just money, or to just one thing.  Meltem Demirors: (31:57)  And it is complex and multidisciplinary and multifaceted, so in order to have that conversation, I think it just takes time for people to understand these multiple components that are working together to imbue bitcoin with some of the really unique characteristics that it has.  Nolan Bauerle: (32:12)  And I did notice your reference to The Matrix on Twitter recently where you did that great Twitter thread sort of linking what it really meant for the pills, and I think that speaks to what you're mentioning right now, this sort of a choice of the foundation that you're going to create some of these super and national institutions out of, or even just ideas that link us together. Maybe they're not institutions at all, or maybe they're just the type of tissue that goes between us all, so that we can transact, and have these types of relationships without the sort of pieces in the wall that were necessary to make it happen before.  Nolan Bauerle: (32:50)  So once again mentioning the reference to your Twitter thread and graph, or chart, or particular visual insight you have to offer the audience that can really sort of capture what you're thinking right now with bitcoin in the world?  Meltem Demirors: (33:07)  Yeah, absolutely. I think just going back to that thread one of the points I was trying to make was the point around systemic risk, and SIFIs, or systemically important financial institutions, and what that means for systems. So I think one chart that's really important, one graph that's really important, I thought to keep in mind is the percent of the total bitcoin supply that's held in third-party custody, and there is this ongoing sort of meme in the bitcoin community around not your keys, not your coin.  Meltem Demirors: (33:40)  But there is a fundamental question I have that if we institutionalize and financialize bitcoin, and we take 50% of the world's bitcoin supply, lock it up somewhere with the GTCC, and we start trading paper certificates that represent an underlying bitcoin, and sort of dematerialize bitcoin markets, and detach them from the underlying, what does that really do for us other than to create a new tool for speculation? I'm not really sure.  Meltem Demirors: (34:06)  And so, one metric I'm tracking closely is the number of bitcoin in third-party custody according to our latest research, which is linked in the thread, and also on our CoinShares website. It's close to 20%, and so that's just an interesting thing to keep in mind. And then, the next thing I'm looking at ... So that's sort of relates to systemic risk we're creating, and in my view if we're just recreating the same financial system, if we're recreating banks, and institutions, and governments because they're the people who hold the coins ultimately, and control who can access them then that doesn't really accomplish much of the end state of bitcoin, which I think is interesting, and sort of intellectually challenging to think about. It's important to stay intellectually honest as we look at these things.  Meltem Demirors: (34:55)  And then, the second thing I think about that's really more relevant on the macro scale is the balance of accounts and trade flows between countries. I think one of the big questions that's emerging now US economic, political, military hegemony has been a reality for the last 100 years almost, and as we start to see geopolitics shift and get reshaped, and as we start seeing increasing anger, and social frustration in the world about wealth inequality, and income inequality, and the unequal consumption of our planet's resources, and what the implications are I do think we are starting to see nation-states, and people kind of waking up, and saying, well, wait a minute. Why are we living in a dollar-defined world?  Meltem Demirors: (35:49)  And it's interesting to see just over the weekend Rosneft, which is Russia's largest energy exporter, said that they were going to start taking steps to minimize their use of the US dollar with the plan to eliminate it completely. And so, they could use euros, maybe they use digital renminbi, maybe they create their own digital currencies as means for payment and settlement, but that I think is really material because the petro dollar, the dollar defines 90% of the trade flows in the energy industry, and the energy industry's a huge part of the global economy.  Meltem Demirors: (36:24)  And I think the other thing that's really interesting here is the narrative around China's adoption of blockchain technology, and the recent statements made by the government there that they fully intend to create a digitized currency that is going to be used by commercial banks to start, and what do commercial banks do? They finance trade flows.  Meltem Demirors: (36:44)  And so, I do think there's an increasing awareness on the importance of the base currency that's used to sort of shape economic activity around the world, and that's an area I think is really fascinating, because again some of the aspects of bitcoin that make it unique, the fact that it's leaderless, and not controlled by any one entity, and some of these things could potentially also position bitcoin well to be a neutral sort of means of a value transfer.  Meltem Demirors: (37:14)  And so, I think it'll just be very interesting to see how different nation-states attempt to capture that narrative, an attempt to use certain aspects of what we've learned from the growth and rise of bitcoin, and other digital currencies to shape their own place in the world's financial system.  Nolan Bauerle: (37:32)  Fascinating stuff, Meltem. We're coming up at the end of our time here. So you're going to be leading off Consensus: Invest. You're our first keynote speaker out of the block's that morning.  Meltem Demirors: (37:44)  Right.  Nolan Bauerle: (37:44)  So excited to have you there, excited to hear what you have in store, the research that you guys have been working on at CoinShares. I still use your Mining Profitability document that you guys created a year ago to really test, or to quantify mining profitability, through that whole big one, so keep up the good work. CoinShares' research continues to be a reliable resource for myself. Thank you a ton for your time.  Meltem Demirors: (38:08)  Thank you. I'll see you soon, Nolan.  Nolan Bauerle: (38:16)  Enjoyed this episode? I'd like to personally invite you to come to Invest: New York in November. The event features not only the speaker you just heard but an array of other amazing thinkers. Visit coindesk.com and click events, or simply follow the link in the description.

42431164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0W7h,1573227013,PODCAST: Josh Brown on Why Bitcoin Is Like the 1800s Railroad Boom,"“In the 1800s we had a bubble in railroads, and almost every one of them went bankrupt,” said “Downtown” Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management. “But what was left behind in the wake of that financial wreckage were the tracks, and the trains, and the stations, and the expertise to build more.”  That’s the analogy Brown sees with the bitcoin bubble of 2017, as explained in a recent episode of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast series featuring speakers from CoinDesk's upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.  “Eventually the technology [railroads] found a way to be profitable, useful, and became woven into the fabric of our society,” Brown said. “So it's possible that the crypto investments people made in 2017 were stupid, but that they had the right idea.”  The last six months have seen a growing dialogue between the bitcoin industry and leaders in global finance. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, increasingly people are asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?  Brown is a regular contributor to CNBC. In this episode of Bitcoin Macro, CoinDesk’s head of strategy, Nolan Bauerle, talks with Brown about:  Why bitcoin feels like a protest asset but doesn’t see huge amounts of capital flowing into it from turbulent regions.  Why U.S. dollars and assets like Manhattan real estate are still the top options for moving wealth out of countries.  Why it’s impossible to know how bitcoin will react in a recession given the unique set of circumstances surrounding the market’s past 11 years.  Why the bitcoin and crypto spaces have veered back and forth between overly optimistic and overly pessimistic.  Why true technology disruptions tend to happen long after their earliest promoters have left the stage.  Why the impact of bitcoin may be something very different than the macro, non-sovereign money narrative in favor today.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.      Nolan Bauerle: (00:09)  Welcome to Bitcoin macro, a Pop-up podcast produced as part of the CoinDesk Invest New York conference in November. I'm your host, Nolan Bauerly. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leading thinkers in finance, crypto and beyond.  Nolan Bauerle: (00:34)  Welcome to the latest edition of our pop-up podcast around bitcoin. This podcast, in particular, is designed to shed light on some of the content that you're going to hear about at Consensus: Invest on November 12th, here in New York City. Today we have a veteran speaker of our series and a crossover star, Josh Brown, who certainly is known for his role in mainstream financial news, a regular on CNBC, various other networks. Josh Brown has been with us at Invest since it launched in 2017. He gave terrific advice to the original attendees of that conference and was our final keynote fireside chat with Howard Lindzon, his good friend.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:23)  Last year he came back to let the audience know what asset managers are really concerned about when it comes to cryptocurrencies in general. And this year he's going to involve himself as our master of ceremonies, and we'll introduce all of our great panelists, and we're happy to have him. So crossover star, I think, is a good way to describe you. A lot of people know you over crypto, but you're certainly well known for your mainstream financial news.  Josh Brown: (01:48)  Hi Nolan, it's great to be with you.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:50)  Great to have you aboard. So we're going to jump right in. This podcast is really all about bitcoin. And the first question is about bitcoin behaving as a macro asset. So you've seen a lot of what's going on in the world today. You're pretty plugged in. How do you see bitcoin fitting in here? Is it an actual asset that you can see as a way to hedge macroeconomic changes? Or is it sort of still in the wings waiting to be built up and mature a little more before it's really in the major leagues of macro assets?  Josh Brown: (02:24)  As I said to you just prior to recording, I see myself as more of a student than a teacher in this realm, but I'm an apt pupil, and I try to pay attention to various opinions and, of course, look at charts and price action. And I try my best to understand what's happening. To answer that question directly, I would say I do not believe that bitcoin behaves in any way like a macro asset. And the only reason I'm saying that is because we have no evidence that it's correlated with any other macro development. In other words, I wish I could say when ... Think about gold. When people are worried about inflation, and I'm not saying gold is a great inflation hedge, but when people are worried about it, there are trades where you can see flows go into that asset class. It's demonstrative.  Josh Brown: (03:21)  So you could say whether or not you think gold is an inflation hedge, you know that other people do, and it acts that way. Think about utility stocks. All year long, the story has been the federal reserve about to lower rates, now they're lowering rates. Maybe they're going to lower rates more. And as that process has happened, you've seen money flow into utility stocks, which are prized for their high yields. So if you're not getting yields in bonds, what's the next best thing or the next, next best thing? It's high yielding equities, and utilities are considered to be among the safest high yielding stocks. So you could say that, that's a macro asset. What can we say about bitcoin that's even close to being comparable? In the month of October, I think it's a world record of people around the world involved in various protests, whether we're talking about Santiago, or we're talking about what's going on in Hong Kong. All over the world, there are millions and millions of people taking to the streets.  Josh Brown: (04:20)  Why isn't bitcoin up 50% if in fact it's a protest asset? Well, it isn't, so I don't know. If we're worried about disinflation and we say that maybe people, if they're scared of their own currency, there'll be this huge rush into bitcoin. Well, where is that happening? It isn't. So I would love to be able to answer in the affirmative and say, ""Yes, bitcoin has now taken its place among the Pantheon of asset classes that people can use to express a macro view."" But it just isn't, there's no evidence for that. So my answer to you is no it isn't, but maybe that'll change at some point.  Nolan Bauerle: (04:57)  Yeah. And that you're focusing on the behavior I think is the important part here. A lot of people get caught up with what they want it to be and they sort of will fall into kind of a bubble, where they see it behaving in ways that maybe it isn't actually, given the facts, and that you underlined here that the behavior of it, given all these conditions is pretty clear. It looks like a speculative asset that people are interested in making some money on, and certainly there needs to be a high risk tolerance to get exposure even to this day.  Josh Brown: (05:29)  If we're saying that bitcoin's most obvious use case is the ability to get out of a fiat currency and move money out of a country, or ... it's got huge competition. US dollars are what people want all over the world. In Asia, maybe they want the yen when they fear for the safety of the currency, or the capital markets, or the economy in which they live. This is a fact, and then if we're saying, ""Well, people are going to use bitcoin when they want to get out of the denomination of whatever their country is"", or the jurisdiction. They want to, I don't want to use the word hide money, but they want to literally move money where it can't be touched. Well, real estate has been a much, much more prominent way to do that. Look at Vancouver, half the buildings are Chinese money.  Josh Brown: (06:21)  Look at the towers they're putting up in New York. They just put the capstone, I think it's called, or whatever. They just put the cap on something called Central Park tower. I think it's 1400 feet high. It's the tallest residential building in the Western hemisphere. It's only going to have 70 something apartments. So who's buying those apartments? Well, it's not like a guy who's a lawyer in New York City. These are $7, $10, $20, $50 million apartments. You could think about these as safe deposit boxes for Russians, Indians, Chinese, people that are trying to have assets outside of the country. Nobody's even going to live in half these apartments. And that's just one tower of five that I could reference off the top of my head.  Nolan Bauerle: (07:10)  The one they built on Lexington, the skinnier one that went up earlier, I can't remember the name right now, but you can see the windows are empty. The lights are off every single night.  Josh Brown: (07:19)  Of course. You want to laugh? When they built 437 Park, which I think was the largest until this new one, the tallest, they did something for New York City called a traffic study. So if you want to build something of size, you have to spend millions of dollars and a couple of years studying what the impact will be on local traffic. And the joke is there ain't going to be no fucking traffic, because no one's going to live there. So that is the way you're seeing foreign nationals move money out of their currency, or out of their government's jurisdiction and into what they consider to be a safer place. And you're just not seeing those dollar flows into bitcoin to the same extent. So it's hard to make the case that functionally that's what's really happening there.  Nolan Bauerle: (08:05)  And you mentioned something that I hadn't really heard before. We call it a safe-haven asset, but you called it a protest asset as well. And I think that's a really interesting label, and that its behavior really hasn't mimicked what you'd expect from a protest asset. Now I saw it traded at a premium when the Hong Kong protests began, it traded about a $100 premium. And that was really because people were worried about using their Oyster cards, their Metro cards to get home back to China if they're going to the mainland, because they were going to get tracked, and basically just really worried about local dollars being tracked. But we haven't really seen that premium stick, and we haven't really seen that sort of flow towards using this so that you're not surveyed and you're not spied on so they know where your simple consumption dollars had gone.  Josh Brown: (08:52)  Somebody was telling me about Venezuela, and I'm aware of what's going on in the economy there, and it's been going on for years. And hyperinflation, the collapse of institutions, people starving. It's a horrible, horrible situation. Now, if you were to tell me 30% of all Venezuelans have moved their money from the local currency into bitcoin, then I would shut my mouth and I would say, ""Okay, there's something substantial here."" But I don't think that's the case, do you?  Nolan Bauerle: (09:24)  No, I mean, and we've seen Turkey, for example, has seen a lot of users, let's say buyer [inaudible 00:09:32].  Josh Brown: (09:32)  Yeah. Great example. Another inflationary situation where people for political reasons want assets out of that country, and the local currency and economy is collapsing.  Nolan Bauerle: (09:44)  Yeah. But, like you're saying, we just haven't seen that kind of use.  Josh Brown: (09:48)  Yeah. Where is it, where is it? When does it start? So I'm not saying it can't, I'm just saying I'm not seeing it.  Nolan Bauerle: (09:54)  Now moving onto a recession. A lot of rumors of recessions, we're still doing pretty well here in the United States, but it's certainly crept in, in other jurisdictions. So we've seen this sort of cheap money around the world for a long time, and it looks like even from high risk tolerance from the VC side of things, because money, it's just available and it looks like every idea out there is funded and the risk tolerance has grown to a certain extent here. Now, if that changes, if a recession does cause some kind of liquidity crunch, or some inability to get access to this cheap money again, how do you think bitcoin behaves?  Josh Brown: (10:34)  I guess we have no ... in the United States, we have no prior history of it, so we'll say we've been in expansion for 11 years, so it's the longest expansion ever. So I don't know the answer.  Nolan Bauerle: (10:49)  Yeah, well they're-  Josh Brown: (10:50)  We'll find out.  Nolan Bauerle: (10:53)  And my final question for you, and really this is sort of tapping on your exposure to mainstream media, mainstream financial world. Bitcoin really popped in everyone's consciousness in 2017 when I met you at that great dinner that we had down near Chinatown. And you wrote a beautiful blog post. I thought it was ... I really realized what a fantastic writer you were.  Josh Brown: (11:16)  Ah, thank you.  Nolan Bauerle: (11:17)  I think it was something into [inaudible 00:11:18], and it was great.  Josh Brown: (11:19)  Yeah. Yeah.  Nolan Bauerle: (11:21)  So here it is. It popped into world consciousness in 2017. Everyone started talking about it, and it's already mutated a few times in people's minds since then. In the last six months though, what have you seen that's changed, or if anything, is it just the same old story?  Josh Brown: (11:35)  So when I was a keynote speaker in the closing panel of Consensus: Invest 2017 the first year, the audience was filled with young people, primarily, mostly dudes, and they had made a lot of money. I think the price of bitcoin at that time was $15,000 or $16,000, and my message to that audience at that time was, ""calm down."" It's okay to feel like you're missing out. You don't have to do something just because everyone else is doing it and they seem to be getting rich. And of course, it would only take a couple of weeks for that to look like really good advice. But that is always good advice. Maybe now we're in the polar opposite situation, where instead of fear of missing out, there's this just incredible amount of pessimism that everything that people thought would be true about digital currencies, and cryptography, and blockchain is now like a joke in the mainstream financial media, or at least it's being derided on a daily basis.  Josh Brown: (12:47)  And so maybe now things have gotten too pessimistic. And the only other example of this kind of thing that I could think of for my own career and experience, I remember my formative years in the industry we were doing the dot com bubble, and everything came apart relatively quickly. It only took from March of 2000 to, let's say, the end of 2001 for people to just be completely wiped out, not just in financial terms, although they were, but emotionally, and mentally. And just nobody wanted to hear anything about technology ever again. And in the ashes of that experience, Google was born. In the ashes of that experience very quietly with very little fanfare Steve jobs rejoined Apple as the CEO. The seeds for the technology boom that we've now been living through over the last, let's call it 12 years or 15 years, were born in the ashes of that prior mania.  Josh Brown: (13:52)  So I think statistically, spiritually, any way you want to look at it, there was absolutely a bubble in anything related to crypto going into the end of the year of 2017. I don't think anyone would deny that it was insane just as the internet mania, but the thing is all of the predictions that were made about the transformative power of the internet actually ended up coming true. It just took longer than what people expected, and the companies involved were very different. If you think about the original dot com bubble, we were worshiping at the altar of fiber optic plays like JDS Uniphase and Nortel. And we were buying up stocks like AOL, and Excite, and Lycos and Yahoo. None of which are particularly relevant anymore. But all the predictions, we're going to buy groceries on the internet. It happens. We're going to buy pet food on the internet, it happened.  Josh Brown: (14:51)  Toys, books. We're going to communicate all day long. All of those predictions came true. It's just the investments weren't right. So if there is a crypto future and there is a blockchain future, it's highly possible that the early entrants, who came along in 2015, '16, '17, '18, aren't going to be a part of it. And a lot of the investments that have been made will turn out to be zeros. But it doesn't mean that the future is written. So if I could maybe flip the script and this year offer that, I know it's not that hopeful, but it's somewhat hopeful to the audience. Then I'll feel as though I've said something that's somewhat meaningful.  Nolan Bauerle: (15:33)  What you're basically saying is the world today is recognizable to the entrepreneurs and visionaries of 25 years ago. They would recognize what we're doing today as the thing they predicted, but as you said, maybe coming at it from a different angle, with different names, on a different platform. The specifics are perhaps different, but the overall outline of it is pretty much in line with what those folks had envisioned.  Josh Brown: (16:00)  You know, this predates what I just talked about. In the 1800s we had a bubble in railroads, and almost every one of them went bankrupt. But what was left behind in the wake of that financial wreckage were the tracks, and the trains, and the stations, and the expertise to build more. And I mean we have trains to this day, and we had bullet trains. And what they're building to connect ... I was just down in Orlando, and I saw all the facilities that they've built for the bullet train that's going to take people from Miami to Orlando in 15 minutes.  Nolan Bauerle: (16:37)  Jeez.  Josh Brown: (16:37)  But that system that they're building is a descendant of money that was lost to overambitious investment all the way back in the 1840s. So I know people don't have that much patience to wait 160 years to see their dreams come true, but I'm just pointing out, after the railroad bubble, there were probably a lot of people running around saying, ""You see, it's all stupid."" No, it wasn't all stupid. And we had functional railroads from the civil war on. So eventually the technology found a way to be profitable, useful, and became woven into the fabric of our society. So it's possible that the crypto investments people made in 2017 were stupid, but that they had the right idea. And that in the wreckage of the bubble having burst, new companies, new ideas, new entrepreneurs, new uses come about, and the whole thing rebuilds itself.  Josh Brown: (17:34)  And all of a sudden there are people with profitable investments. And just as a Coda to that, I took the long Island railroad into Manhattan today from long Island. And in every car, there are advertisement posters. And in a car I happened to have been riding in today were posters for the Genesis crypto exchange. And I know that's Tyler and Cameron [Winklevoss] and I would imagine they spent a ton of money on this, but everyone riding that train car was surrounded by posters for this new monetary exchange or brokerage or whatever you want to call it. And most of the people looking at this poster were like, ""What the hell does that mean?"" But some people know. And I just find it interesting that there were still people willing to invest, and advertise, and market new products. And as long as that continues, maybe there is a future that's more in the near term than what I think now for these types of technologies.  Nolan Bauerle: (18:32)  So like you're saying, the tracks were laid to bring you from Miami to the happiest place in the world in such a short amount of time. And perhaps the tracks are still there to bring bitcoin to the moon and realize everyone's-  Josh Brown: (18:48)  When moon.  Nolan Bauerle: (18:48)  When moon, when moon.  Josh Brown: (18:49)  Well, look, I think we could separate what we think the price of the thing does versus what we think the utility will be. That's where I've been since December of 2018. We wrote a blog post basically saying, I'm done speculating on the price of bitcoin. I think it's a mania. However, I'm open-minded to the possibility that blockchain will become a transformative technology. The caveat is that it might be very unsexy. It might show up in the income statement of a company that managed to save a few million dollars, by going from database to a blockchain. I don't know that that implies that the price of a digital coin will go up, but I'm trying to stay open-minded.  Nolan Bauerle: (19:34)  It's not the romance of pamphleteering around the French Revolution or the American Revolution that everyone was sort of-  Josh Brown: (19:42)  No, right, it could just be corporate cost savings. And again, that is a sort of revolution. It just won't involve people waving flags and storming the barriers.  Nolan Bauerle: (19:54)  Well, Josh, thanks for your time today.  Josh Brown: (19:56)  Did I bring everybody down? I don't want to do that.  Nolan Bauerle: (19:59)  No, no. It was fantastic and we're looking forward to hearing more in just over a week now. So thanks for your time and see you soon.  Josh Brown: (20:07)  All right, Nolan. Thank you.  Nolan Bauerle: (20:08)  Bye, Josh.  Nolan Bauerle: (20:14)  Enjoyed this episode?

42431161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0W1h,1573227008,PODCAST: Kaiko's Ambre Soubiran on Bitcoin's 'Intrinsic Value',"“One of the things I was hearing all the time when I was in the banking world was ‘OK, but this bitcoin thing, it doesn't have any intrinsic value,’” said Ambre Soubiran, CEO of cryptocurrency market-data startup Kaiko.  “And this is something to which I obviously completely disagree,” she continued. “How can you say that having a system that enables permissionless transference and a decentralized and secure way to digitally transfer ownership [doesn’t have value]? Just that system and the fact that it works and that it has been working for 10 years has value – and that's the intrinsic value in my eyes.”  Soubiran spoke with CoinDesk for the latest episode of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast series featuring the speakers and themes of CoinDesk's upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.  The event will explore bitcoin’s role in the financial system as it finds its place in the global macro community. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, more people are asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?  In this episode of Bitcoin Macro  , CoinDesk’s head of strategy, Nolan Bauerle, talks with Soubiran about:  The “macro” origins of bitcoin.  The shifts in the bitcoin narrative over time.  Why the ICO boom was a seminal moment for external markets to gain more interest in the cryptocurrency space.  Why the role of bitcoin as a safe haven is contextual to local politics and economics.  Why HODLing behavior shows the promise of bitcoin as a future safe haven.  The immediate-term risks to bitcoin in the case of a global recession.  What order-book data suggests about the state of the markets.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.      Nolan Bauerle: (00:09)  Welcome to Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast produced as part of the CoinDesk Invest: New York conference in November. I'm your host, Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leading thinkers in finance, crypto and beyond.  Nolan Bauerle: (00:34)  Welcome again to our pop-up podcast around bitcoin in the world today. Today I'm joined by Ambre Soubiran from Kaiko. Ambre, [foreign language 00:00:44] we could do it in French, but I'd say today to make sure that our audience is as wide as possible, we'll keep it all in English. So welcome from Paris.  Ambre Soubiran: (00:55)  Thanks, Nolan. Thank you very much.  Nolan Bauerle: (00:57)  So great to have you here and you'll be the last person that we'll be recording around this series of speakers and contributors to our session here. And you'll be the first international person. So the first person to bring an international flair to the bitcoin in the world podcast. We've had mostly Americans until now. I suppose Meltem [Demirors] can count as a non-American, but she is also American so we're not going to go that far.  Ambre Soubiran: (01:24)  All right, well thanks. I'm blessed.  Nolan Bauerle: (01:27)  Well, we're blessed and happy to have you. So let's jump right in Ambre. Right now, of course, we've seen a few big news items around sort of macro turbulence, so a lot of people are talking about it. Definitely changes going on in the global economy, particularly with the American Chinese trade war. Of course, all of the difficulties the European banks are having. And within all this context, of course, you work in the bitcoin world. How do you see bitcoin behaving in this environment? Are you seeing it really transcending what had been something interesting for tech folks to becoming a true macro asset?  Ambre Soubiran: (02:10)  Yep. So I think it's a great question and it's true how seeing how all the different narratives for bitcoins have evolved over time. I think it's really interesting to look at that now from a more macro perspective and say we're seeing more and more institutional drive and institutional demand for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world, the larger spectrum, but within the context of bitcoin. So let's, I think, take a step back and say, okay, but what is a macro asset? So macro assets are assets such as it can be indices, rates, affects, sovereign bonds, things that are mostly driven by geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. And they generally move with large market moves in a relatively predictable manner. So they have a constant correlation with typical risk assets.  Ambre Soubiran: (03:01)  So if we take that and we say, okay, now what is bitcoin? Initially, it's interesting because it was created as a more technical system, as a technical solution. However, the original context in which it was created was during a quite terrible economic downturn just after the subprime mortgage crisis, which had triggered bank bailouts and had shaken financial markets. So at the time it was really meant to become an alternative to the financial system that created its own crisis in some way. So I think it's interesting because we say it has evolved from the original peer to peer electronic cash system into a financial asset, but it was originally conceived as a reaction to that financial system. So it has definitely evolved over the past 10 years.  Ambre Soubiran: (03:51)  And when I talk to investors and people that are trying to put bitcoin in a box, I think it's interesting, it's like this giant disco ball that is spinning and every time you say, okay, it's a currency and you try to put on it a model or evaluation framework on top of it, it just doesn't work. And then you say, okay, actually it's technology and then you look at it against specific months and it doesn't work again. Okay. Is it a commodity? And there's like, it keeps changing and shifting.  Ambre Soubiran: (04:17)  So the question is, if we look at bitcoin from a financial asset perspective, I think it's important to have sizes and figures in mind because it has been thought of as an alternative to a financial system that was somehow broken. So we could say that it is a decorrelated macro asset. However, it's still way too small. Even if it's big from where we came from it, it grew incredibly fast in 10 years, however, it's still quite small.  Ambre Soubiran: (04:48)  So we're talking about a market cap of 170 billion, whereas gold, and I've been trying to look up actually the most recent market cap of gold. I found everything from five to 11 trillions. But we're talking about a significant difference in orders of magnitude. Same thing with traded volume, right? We're talking about 5 billion over the past 24 hours and gold is somewhere around 250 billion. So we're still talking about significant difference order of magnitudes. And if bitcoin were to be a true macro assets, as in it can be used as a hedged or a derisk for what it is in the traditional system or economy crisis. Well, it's still too small to actually handle that I believe.  Nolan Bauerle: (05:35)  So I'm glad you brought up the gold comparison. For Invest, we were trying to mount a debate, let's say, for the event next week in November 12th and we're going to say, you heard anywhere between, I think you said 6 trillion to 12 trillion.  Ambre Soubiran: (05:52)  Eleven. Yeah.  Nolan Bauerle: (05:52)  Eleven trillion? So I've sort of settled on the 8 trillion and we had actually written the title of the race to 9 trillion. Who's going to be first, bitcoin or gold? To sort of frame it, because if bitcoin continues to behave this way, perhaps it grows much faster.  Ambre Soubiran: (06:12)  Yep. Yeah, absolutely.  Nolan Bauerle: (06:14)  And I'm glad you also brought up that point about making sure that everyone understands the size of this market currently. Because if bitcoin is going to be this uncorrelated, let's say digital jurisdiction gold, that allows something that isn't a nation-state to have the attributes that could trade without the mismanagement or perhaps decisions that are made politically that it could actually grow in this manner and become something totally different. But we're not there yet is what you're saying. We're not there yet.  Ambre Soubiran: (06:45)  Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's something really interesting when you think about this as a financial asset or as a gold, is that indeed, bitcoin is not directly subject to interest rates or to any kind of currency debasement. It's decentralized, so thereby it's not dictated by a specific government. And you cannot have a political force that comes in and creates market volatility. So in some way it is appealing to investors because of this decentralized aspect.  Ambre Soubiran: (07:14)  On the other hand, that makes it closer to gold. However, I think we very often when we talk about sizes and when we talk about demand on bitcoin, we forget to think about supply. And we're today at 18 million bitcoin out of a total of 21 million. there's going to be the bitcoin holding and a couple of times this really makes bitcoin unique in terms of financial assets.  Ambre Soubiran: (07:38)  And I think it's the first financial assets for which after a point supply is actually likely to decrease. We already say that, I don't know, four out of the 18 million bitcoin are actually lost, lost somewhere on the blockchain somewhere because people have lost their keys for X, Y, Z reason. So supply and the fact that it's likely to start decreasing after a point is things that we don't really mention when we think about this as a macro asset. Price can increase, which will increase the market cap because it's divisible and because you could fraction bitcoin all the way to I think the power of nine. You can actually create value significantly. But there's this supply and this decreasing supply issue that I find interesting.  Nolan Bauerle: (08:29)  And you mentioned earlier about is it a currency and sort of people going back and forth trying to define it, and putting that next to what you mentioned about its size, a lot of these definitions come from basically looking in the mirror. So we've seen what currencies are over the past couple of years. We look in the mirror and we say, well it's got to be exactly like that. It's got to be like US dollar or the Euro or the Yen. What would you say if ... we're looking at bitcoin now because it's so small, it hasn't really been able to affect the definition of a currency. Is there a possibility that as it grows, could you see a time when it actually makes us rethink and redefine what some of these instruments are?  Ambre Soubiran: (09:09)  Yeah, absolutely. I mean I actually really think that it has already started to redefine the way we think of money in general. Like the idea that now there is this permissionless system that enables me to send a unit of accounts, effectively bitcoin, to whoever I want, whenever I want, at a relatively low fee is redefining the way we think about money. That's I think definitely the case already. But indeed, we really moved from the original kind of peer to peer electronic cash system, which is the original white paper presented by Satoshi 11 years ago now. Then it became this digital money narrative or this magic internet money, but today it's rarely seen as a cash system. There's an initiative, of course, like network in order to kind of improve efficiency and use cases for bitcoin as a currency, but it's still very little volume and it's not really seen today as money anymore.  Ambre Soubiran: (10:08)  Then it became this private and anonymous currency, all those things were from a time where institutional interest was barely existent. Actually, at the time where it was seen as this private and anonymous currency, I was working in banking at the time and we started to raise the idea that bitcoin was something interesting to look at and they were completely, completely reluctant to have anything to do with bitcoin. So institutional interest was not there yet.  Ambre Soubiran: (10:37)  And then the ICO craze happened and when that happened it started to raise interest both from the public audience, investors that wanted to make profits and also VCs. I mean it started to attract because it became big enough in size. It started to attract also interest from the more VC investor space initiative because that was disrupting.  Nolan Bauerle: (11:00)  Larger risk tolerance.  Ambre Soubiran: (11:01)  Yeah, larger risks. Absolutely. And they're financing their projects, right? A lot of projects that, I mean a lot of them were unfortunately scammy, but there's also a lot of great projects that actually raised funding and way more that would have raised playing the VC game and today, four years down the road, three or four years after the ICO, they're still not profitable but fully independent and autonomous. And they've grown in very different ways. I think it creates new forms of startups that wouldn't have existed without the ICO.  Nolan Bauerle: (11:29)  Yes. And separating the quality for a minute. Just the idea that it could happen to begin with was enough to make history.  Ambre Soubiran: (11:38)  Yeah, absolutely. And so that's I guess when it started having some form of mainstream adoption or if not adoption of more mainstream interest. And institutional interest then really started, interestingly not with the money but with the blockchain-not-crypto trend. We have a new way to create these programmable shared decentralized databases. And that was something that again, coming from 10 years of banking, I've heard a lot at some point it was bitcoin was a word you are not really supposed to pronounce, but distributed ledger and distributed database was really sexy. And I guess that started justifying more traditional interest for bitcoin in some ways. Like they liked it or not, but that justified that they could allow some resources into understanding that.  Nolan Bauerle: (12:27)  Yeah. And now it's starting to be called the global hegemonic synthetic currency I guess is the new tagline we're going with.  Ambre Soubiran: (12:35)  Exactly. And so that's exactly that. So the last actually, now the institutional interest is really more because we're looking at this and that's the point of this conversation from a more, oh, it's actually an uncorrelated financial assets. It's a new financial asset. It's censorship resistant, digital gold. We're not so sure what type of financial asset it is, but we know that it's decorrelated from traditional markets. And so it's interesting, we can start applying some trading strategies. We can start leverage, we can start doing different things on that assets that will generate returns. That's one part. And the other part is the reserve, right? It's a way to protect, to derisk from other types of financial assets.  Nolan Bauerle: (13:19)  So moving on to a more specific definition or type of behavior that we're seeing from bitcoin today, but still definitely related to being uncorrelated and perhaps not a victim of some of the political decisions jurisdictions are making. So you're in Europe, you've definitely got your own sort of political hot potato right now with Brexit and what that could mean. Do you expect or have you seen bitcoin even within those two sophisticated economies of France and England behaving as a safe haven asset? Of course, when the Brexit vote first happened, we saw bitcoin get a price bump back in 2016 and it was definitely a correlation there. Do you see anyone thinking along those lines in Europe? Do you see anyone worried about the Euro and using bitcoin or is it just not on anyone's radar right now in Paris and anywhere you'd see it acting as a safe haven is still in the Venezuelas of the world?  Ambre Soubiran: (14:16)  Yeah. So I think you're spot on on the issue you raised as well and I was going to get there. I think it's definitely seen as a safe asset in jurisdictions where there is much more political and economic uncertainty. So when you have high economic volatility and I was going to come up with Venezuela and Argentina, even Hong Kong recently, right? Hong Kong is generally one of the most stable and one of the best places to live from an economic standpoint because it's going through political dysfunctions and there's all these mass protests. Actually, if you look interestingly on the volumes on local bitcoin, which is a peer to peer exchange, volumes have significantly increased in all those countries.  Ambre Soubiran: (14:59)  So I guess, and it's also if you look back over the history and the early days of bitcoin, I guess it was 2013, 2014, at the time it was Ecuador and all these like more Central American countries that were also driving adoption. So from a safe haven perspective, I guess the question is where do you go and hide where you don't know where else to go. Like when really you're thinking I don't trust the current status quo anymore, where do I go? And the question is, is bitcoin a good place for that? So when things go wrong, there's only a limited number of things that you can do and a number of assets that are completely isolated from the rest of the system. And it is interesting in that way. I don't think at that point that people have a deep mistrust in the Euro or at least it's not a theme yet.  Ambre Soubiran: (15:51)  However, I read something that I thought it was really cool on HODLers and if you look at more the on-chain data stuff, you see that people that have been holding, you have bitcoins that have been sitting on wallets and even through the year to date ties of this year and the even all-time highs of the past years, you have people that haven't done or sold out or done anything over the past two years and five years. Meaning that those people, like there's two things. There's foregoing what you already to have to invest in bitcoin or to hide in bitcoin, and there is already having bitcoin and not wanting to get out of it and not wanting to actually take that existing gain, which is already on the table. If you've been holding for five years, you definitely make profits. However people are HODling, right?  Ambre Soubiran: (16:38)  So there's this idea, I don't think in Europe people are running away from Euro to invest in crypto because they see it as a safe haven yet. It might come to there if there's more political uncertainty. However, you definitely see that in the more already shaken economies that it's a way to avoid your government having control of your own wealth. Right?  Nolan Bauerle: (17:03)  Yeah. I did notice on LocalBitcoins, I haven't checked recently, but over the summer in Hong Kong, like you were mentioning, it was trading at about a hundred dollars premium, which meant the appetite certainly was there for whatever reason. But there was an appetite for sure.  Ambre Soubiran: (17:19)  Absolutely. That's really interesting. When you look at prices across different markets, you know we cover like a hundred exchanges, so there's even smaller local markets and Filipino markets, Mexican markets, you really see price difference depending on what is happening in the country. I think there was a 1% price difference in Hong Kong and in China recently, which I mean 1% might seem small, but as you said, when you put it especially over eight thousand dollars, it's actually $80, it's a lot of money.  Ambre Soubiran: (17:50)  On the safe haven thing though, there's also a still, even though it's much more, you know, bitcoin is now in I don't want to say everybody's mind, but close. However, there's still lots of misunderstanding of what it is. And one of the things I was hearing all the time when I was in the banking world was 'OK, but this bitcoin thing, it doesn't have any intrinsic value.' And this is something to which I obviously completely disagree, and my response to that was how can you say that having a system that enables permissionless transference and a decentralized and secure way to digitally transfer ownership, like just that system and the fact that it works and that it has been working for 10 years has value and that's the intrinsic value in my eyes.  Ambre Soubiran: (18:34)  But this is something because there are so many different narratives and so many misunderstandings, if you have an exchange that gets hacked and people understand that bitcoin was hacked, there's still too many misunderstandings, which I guess prevents people seeing bitcoin as a safe haven asset just because you just don't know what you're getting into. It's still muddy waters for most people.  Nolan Bauerle: (18:56)  They think of bitcoin exposure itself as risky, not as a hedge against jurisdictional risk.  Ambre Soubiran: (19:04)  Yeah, exactly. I think there's a lot of misunderstanding of I don't really know how this thing works, and so I'm afraid. And the reason they're afraid is also because they're in control, right? It's the first time that even if you don't understand, I'm sure you just say the random Joe in the street does not necessarily understand how the central bank work and how even their own bank works. The financial system is complex, right? But because you have intermediaries and you have people that are theoretically accountable for your money, it's not as scary. And also it's been working forever and that's the way they grew up. So it's not the same telling them, you have this new system that is transforming the way we represent ownership and the way we store value. It means that you have power back to the individuals, we're challenging many things, and because they don't understand it, they just don't want to go there.  Nolan Bauerle: (19:53)  And when you had mentioned HODL waves, of course, HODL waves are HODLing and then the data that goes along with analyzing a HODLing, which is the HODL waves. Can you really define the time preference or the trade that's happening? So you go back to the meltdown, for example, the people that made that bet, they bet against US housing. It was hard for them to hold and have a conviction on that trade through all of the FID and the people saying US housing is never going to go down. What are you doing making this bed? And of course, if you read the big short and all these other analysts who told the history of what happened then, of course, a lot of people sort of chickened out. They got weak knees and split. So when we look at the HODL waves, does it really tell you that people do believe that this safe haven behavior is bound to happen or they're at least hedging that it could happen and this is the instrument to use to avoid it happening in the future?  Ambre Soubiran: (20:51)  So it's a great question and I think it's already a very good signal to know that people who have made significant gains are not interested in exiting that system. Right? So that's the first thing. Then the second thing is what would show actual traction on the safe-haven narrative is if you had a lot of new inflows of people who were actually buying and holding. And the truth is that today bitcoin is still a very speculative asset and a lot of the volume that we're seeing are short term traders. That's no question.  Ambre Soubiran: (21:26)  However, I mean there's a reason why people are actually, you know, call it betting or call it speculating. The reason people speculate on that is hopefully they speculate on the fact that it will become a safe haven asset. And that's really the ... if we think about if a recession happened tomorrow, is the system sturdy enough yet to really be a safe haven and really have a significant inflow of capital into the bitcoin ecosystem and then hold through that. That's a question of the maturity of the bitcoin space as of now. However, people are trading it also because they think that it will increase, right? And if they think that they're going to profit, it's because they're hoping that it will become a macro asset or a safe haven.  Nolan Bauerle: (22:19)  So the next question I had, and you'd brought up recession, was what does happen to bitcoin in a recession? And what you're saying is there's the possibility and many people believe that it will be uncorrelated and will behave differently and will be a hedge against a recession. That's sort of out there.  Ambre Soubiran: (22:35)  Yeah. So that's a bit trickier I guess. And that really goes back to what I said about the maturity. It's in general, from an asset management perspective, you see historically that in big crisis, in the '07, '08 crisis, generally correlations just jump to one when things really go sour because people are just trying to save whatever they can.  Ambre Soubiran: (23:02)  So the question here is, is it going to be the same for bitcoin? And of course all of the more blockchain community and believers of which we are a part of would say that a recession would benefit bitcoin. But the truth is really when there's a crisis and when investors want to lower their risks, bitcoin is still considered a risky assets. We can believe whatever we want. It's still, unfortunately, a risky asset.  Ambre Soubiran: (23:27)  And it's about trust. And bitcoin is all about trust, right? The value of the ledger holds because there's this consensus mechanism and everybody agrees to trust the ledger. And so we can just try to imagine some scenarios, right? There's a crisis and investors are looking to move their money and they're considering bitcoin. And at that point, the system is overloaded, transaction fees skyrocket, everybody tries to protect their own interests. [inaudible 00:23:55] also will take transactions that have higher transaction fees. And so there's kind of a problem that happens at that point or a bottleneck into, I want to actually get my money into the bitcoin blockchain.  Ambre Soubiran: (24:10)  So the cryptocurrency infrastructure is still being built. And so would it support that? How would the world react to transaction fees skyrocketing? People saying, oh, that's actually really volatile. The price of the transaction, we thought it was low, but actually it's not. It's a crisis, so volatility will increase. How do people react? Right?  Ambre Soubiran: (24:31)  And the second thing is in that context is everybody gets scared and you have a main cryptocurrency player that either became rogue or just goes bankrupt or what does happen, what if there is a bank run? And at that point, everybody tries to protect their bitcoins and everybody withdraws all of their currencies that are currently in exchanges. Because exchanges are helping a lot in the mainstream adoption by providing a lot of services and they're increasing their custody services, they are more and more secure. But still, I doubt that tomorrow if I go and withdraw every single penny from ... I don't want to name exchanges but if everybody tried to withdraw their funds, that's a modern or a crypto version of a bank run. What happens then?  Ambre Soubiran: (25:16)  And what if that happens because people just tried to protect their coins, one of the big exchanges just goes bust and then it creates a complete shattering in the general trust in the ecosystem, and trust is what was the underpinning strength of that network. So in that case, what happens? And interestingly, if you look at the last 10 years, the best environments for bitcoin, and it's the same for most risky assets, is one where you have relatively declining market volatility, you have monetary policies that are quite accommodative and you have low return, low economic growth. And in that sense, it makes relatively risky assets more interesting. But in a real crisis, honestly, at that stage, I don't think the bitcoin space is mature enough to really, really handle a global economic downturn of the amplitude of what we've seen 10 years ago.  Nolan Bauerle: (26:18)  The sophistication of the platform isn't quite there yet.  Ambre Soubiran: (26:22)  And the irrationality of the players, right? Because that means all the super short term traders, nothing would ... like if transaction fees start skyrocketing and there's this kind of idea that people will risk-off and see what happens. But that means a lot less volume. And if you have a lot less volume, well you have order books that are completely depleted. Everybody that says wants to buy bitcoin, okay, well then you have a huge buying pressure on the order books and there is no market, nobody wants to sell. How does that work? In a market that weighs 170 billion of market cap and actually the actual volume is much smaller. What does happen if everybody wants to buy and there's no risk-takers and there is nobody on the other side. You have the order book that's going to be completely unbalanced. It's going to widen the spreads and people will end up buying at absurd prices. So you'll end up having takers, but it will completely shake the system. And I just don't know if it can absorb a lasting crisis.  Nolan Bauerle: (27:22)  So you've mentioned a lot about the sophistication of the users. You've mentioned that there is a certain growing risk tolerance. The types of people buying are changing. What have you seen in Paris dealing with this sophisticated market over the past, let's say six months? Have you seen a change in their opinion around bitcoin or is it pretty much just the same narrative and not much has happened in the past little while?  Ambre Soubiran: (27:49)  There's definitely much, much more tolerance, much more understanding, and also much more willingness to allocate resources and spend time to capture value in that ecosystem. I was yesterday in Stuttgart in Germany where all the German exchanges are really looking at that. In Switzerland, there's lots of initiatives by mainstream players. I'm talking about the Swiss digital exchanges [inaudible 00:28:15] platforms. Stuttgart Boerse is launching a trading platform where people can buy and sell crypto assets.  Ambre Soubiran: (28:22)  So there's really I think a genuine willingness to both regulate and accept and understand and also to support the developments there from more European regulation. I think they're seeing a lot of interest as well in the ... more in essence, and I'm stepping just one second away from bitcoin here, but on all the benefits of blockchain when it comes to these disintermediating the financing for SMEs, for example. So there's definitely the blockchain not bitcoin narrative at some point helped kind of go past specific limitations that were kind of old ghosts from the bitcoin is a way to finance the drug industry. There were those like mental blockages where institutional players saw bitcoin as something they didn't want to have anything to do with. And then they realize, oh blockchain is actually wonderful and now they're going back to bitcoin saying bitcoin actually is a new asset class.  Nolan Bauerle: (29:28)  Similar to what we're seeing with Libra and Facebook.  Ambre Soubiran: (29:31)  Yeah, I mean I would argue that Libra is not really a cryptocurrency. I guess that's maybe not the subject for now, but yeah, you're right. It's exactly that. It's bringing mainstream adoption to blockchain. Why is blockchain, why is it relevant and important? And then once people have accepted that blockchain actually is wonderful and important, bitcoin is the best expression of blockchain. And so then you go back to bitcoin. But it's this kind of acceptance phase that people need to go through. And I guess that's what happening now with Libra. It's what's happening with Chinese governments.  Nolan Bauerle: (30:05)  So now with what you do at Kaiko, it's really a data-focused company. Can you tell me a bit about a data point or a way of seeing data recently that's got you really excited and has brought certain clarity to you and you think is useful for the ecosystem?  Ambre Soubiran: (30:24)  Yeah, absolutely. So it's actually something I'm going to present next week at Consensus: Invest in New York. But one of the things, so at Kaiko, we only do market data. So we monitor in real-time and we've been doing that since 2013, price and volume on exchanges. So we look at every single order that is placed on markets and we look at every single transaction that is generated from a buy order and sold or matching on an exchange. So recently we've been looking more and more into order book data, and order books in some way represent the health, the strength and the structure of the markets. That's what I meant earlier. If everybody starts deciding that they want to transfer older financial wealth and bitcoin and we end up with a completely unbalanced order book because you'll have huge amounts of buy order and then no demand to absorb that.  Ambre Soubiran: (31:18)  So we've been looking at that for two reasons. One of them because it reflects the state of the market today. And second, because if you look at the way order books have evolved history, you also see how the market's become more and more sophisticated. And for that we're looking at two different data points. One of them is the market depth. And the way we define market debts is how many bitcoins are placed on the buy-side and on the sell-side for each markets, and by markets I mean for each different exchange, and what actually is the volume that is there that is at stake. How many bitcoins are people willing to buy and sell? And this is something we can see growing and I'll show this next week.  Ambre Soubiran: (31:58)  And the other one is slippage. Slippage is really interesting, especially for investors who want to back test the strategy. It's their free trade cost curve. It means how much percentage change am I going to get in my execution price depending on the different order sizes that I could place on percentage of the prevailing price. As in if I want to execute a 100,000 order, how much does it cost? If I want to execute a 500,000 order, how much is it going to cost? And we see that slippage these days are incredibly low. It goes down to two bips on some of the largest US exchanges for bitcoin markets. So bitcoin is by far the most efficient market. Slippage on bitcoin can go down to one to two bips, whereas it's somewhere between five and 10 bips for Ethereum for example, just as a horizon point.  Nolan Bauerle: (32:50)  So the buyers themselves are ... there's a lot of price discovery and they know if they're getting a deal or not.  Ambre Soubiran: (32:57)  Absolutely. So price discovery is super efficient. Prices are very tight. We even see some markets where you have crosses where there's so much buy and sell demand that people place orders above or below market price depending on if they're buying or selling. So looking at order book data shows very, very exciting insights to understand the space and to just monitor it in real-time, right? You can see exchanges, and by exchanges I mean just markets on bitcoin, becoming more and more efficient just because there's more and more price takers and price sellers on each side.  Nolan Bauerle: (33:30)  Interesting stuff. Interesting insights into the buyers and sellers and the market in general. So if you'd like to hear more of this type of content, you'll hear plenty of it next week, November 12th in New York City where Ambre will give a more in-depth presentation on this material. Thanks again for listening and look out for our next pop up podcast coming sometime in the next month.  Nolan Bauerle: (33:58)  Enjoyed this episode?

42431172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0WNh,1573221646,Pension Funds Double Crypto Asset Exposure in Morgan Creek's Fund to 1%,"Morgan Creek Digital now takes up around 1 percent of the assets of two Fairfax Retirement System pension funds – an investment which has more than doubled since taking their first position in the fund that closed in February.  Two of the three pension funds under the system from Fairfax County, Virginia, the Police Officer’s Retirement System and Employees’ Retirement System, invested $55 million in Morgan Creek’s second fund in October.  The new allocation came after seeing good preliminary results from the first fund, in part because of the performance of crypto, which makes up 15 percent of the Morgan Creek's investments; the majority of the fund’s positions are in blockchain-related infrastructure companies.  “The final close for fund one was only in February of this year, and it is a short time frame admittedly,” Katherine Molnar, chief investment officer of the police officer’s fund, told CoinDesk.  “It’s gone well and part of that is because of Morgan Creek’s decision for how they’ve timed buying bitcoin. The liquid part of the fund has done quite well based on how they have timed ramping that up in the portfolio.”  The police officer’s pension fund contributed $22 million of the investment while the county employees' fund put up $33 million. Molnar said $50 million of the investment went to the second fund raise while $5 million was a separate co-investment in a specific undisclosed project under Morgan Creek.  Those figures represent around 1.5 percent of the police officer’s fund’s 2018 total assets and around 0.8 percent of the county employee’s fund‘s total assets from the same year. For context, both pensions normally put up around 2 percent of their assets in a new investment.  This time around, convincing the board to re-up the investment was easier than taking the initial stake.  Molnar said:  “We didn’t have to do a lot of extra explanation or discussion, and people are generally pleased with the way the performance is off to a good start. It was a much easier legal process because the lawyers did a good job on the first contract.”  The Morgan Creek fund was characterized as a private equity venture capital fund, and a replacement for a small capitalization US equities fund in their portfolio – one of the higher return and higher risk parts of pension fund investing.  While the crypto part of the Morgan Creek Digital fund is performing well, the pension fund’s CIOs expressed the most interest in the blockchain side of Morgan Creek, which makes up 85 percent of the fund.  Andy Spellar, chief investment officer of the employee's fund, told CoinDesk:  “Think about every time you go to buy a property and refinance – you have to pay title insurance for someone to figure out if there’s a lien against your property. If the ownership of your property is digitized and transferred instantly, in the way that this is done in a day, title insurance goes away.”  As pension funds suffer from low interest rates, technology venture capital funds become more attractive to funds trying to meet their return targets, Spellar added.  “It’s a problem across the board for everybody,” Spellar said. “The level of interest rates is a major component of your total return over time.”  Since all assets are priced off of cash, low cash rate affects the price of every other asset class, Molnar added. This hasn’t yet convinced the two funds to invest in purely crypto-focused funds, however.  “We’re not doing this for crypto exposure, but we do get some of that, and it does so far exhibit some uncorrelated behavior relative to other asset classes,” Spellar said. “To be honest it’s so early in its lifecycle that I don’t have a good idea of whether that will hold up or not.”  Spellar, in general, sees any kind of disruptive technology as a hedge against traditional investment.  “We’re looking for disruptive innovation - anything that can be negatively correlated to other things we own,” Spellar said. “So if we own a bunch of banks, this is a way to hedge against their monolithic and slow moving processes.”  Image via Fairfax County Virginia Police Department Facebook page",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/08/pension-funds-double-crypto-asset-exposure-in-morgan-creeks-fund-to-1,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/416ac49ff05708f6f6942ab4b8beb6ceb52c1256-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The investigation is likely over allegations of intellectual property infringement by the firm related to the technology of its rival Beijing-based crypto mining giant Bitmain, according to one source close to MicroBT with knowledge of the matter. The news was first reported by Chinese crypto news source BlockBeats.  The source confirmed to CoinDesk that Yang was taken away by local police at the end of October – after the unexpected return to Bitmain of Jihan Wu, co-founder of the firm. Wu seized control of Bitmain last week by ousting the company's other co-founder and then-chairman Micree Zhan.  Yang was formerly processor design director at Bitmain, responsible for developing the firm's flagship AntMiner S7 and S9 models around 2016. However, he left the company and raised over $20 million to found MicroBT – which produces the WhatsMiner range of mining devices – after discussions with Zhan and Wu for stock options fell through.  Bitmain has already sued Yang and his company in 2017 over alleged infringement of a patent that Bitmain was granted for bitcoin miner-related technology. In 2018, Yang's legal team successfully appealed to a court in China to have the patent revoked, after which the case was dismissed.  The source said that at this point it's not clear how and why a police investigation has been opened over possible intellectual property infringement.  MicroBT has recently been posing increased competition to top miner manufacturers such as Bitmain and Canaan, having grown its market share in the bitcoin mining industry.  The firm had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment at press time. Bitmain did not wish to comment when asked.

Speaking in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Wray responded to questions from U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) about cryptocurrency, law enforcement and terrorist deterrence, saying:  “We are looking at it from an investigative perspective, including tools that we have to follow the money even in this new world that we’re living in.”  Wray supported Romney’s line of questioning concerning terrorist financing, saying that U.S. adversaries are becoming “more facile with technology and particular various types of technology that anonymize their efforts.”  It's not just crypto, however. Wray noted encryption is touching every aspect of emerging tech such as instant communications:  “Whether its cryptocurrency, whether it’s default encryption on devices and messaging platforms; we are moving as a country and world in a direction where if we don’t get our act together money, people, communication, evidence, facts, all the bread and butter for all of us to do our work will be essentially walled off from the men and women we represent.”  In 2018, the FBI said it had an estimated 130 cases involving crypto under investigation, from human trafficking to ransomware.

42403504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAlD,1573210829,Bitcoin's Weekly Chart May See Golden Cross for First Time in 3.5 Years,"View  Bitcoin’s short-term 50-period moving average is edging closer toward the longer-term 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, hinting at a potential bullish ""golden cross"" formation for the first time in 3.5 years.  In the shorter term, however, total weekly volume has fallen period-to-period as indecision continues to grip the market.  Price action is caught between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs). The next major move either way is likely to determine trend bias going forward, if a firm close above or below those averages is confirmed.      Bitcoin (BTC) looks on track to produce a bullish long-term signal not seen in 3.5 years.  The 50-period and the 100-period MAs have edged closer together on the weekly chart after BTC rebounded from $7,293 to $10,350 on Oct. 26, according to Bitstamp data.  A cross of the 50-period MA moving up above the slower 100-period MA, known as a golden cross, generally hints at a strong shift in a trend and can act as confirmation of a bullish bias for the long-term view.  The last time that bull cross occurred on the weekly chart was way back in May 2016, when the price of BTC started rising from $438 to near $20,000 in December 2017 – a 4,800 percent increase. If the MA's continue to converge as currently, the cross looks likely in late December or early 2020, but it's still too early for a precise call.  Weekly chart  There is inherent risk involved with making such comparisons from previous years, as market conditions have changed significantly. Yet there is merit for seeking additional confirmation in the long-term trend, since BTC's miner reward halving in May 2020 is likely to stir up a bunch of market activity as the supply-cutting event approaches.  Total weekly volume has shrunk from two weeks ago, an indication of market indecision on a fairly stagnant price, while the RSI is barely trending bullish above 52.7 (neutral being 50).  However, should the two lines converge and then cross bullish, that would be a strong indication that the 2019 reversal rally has legs. With a strong fundamental event for BTC occurring right around the corner, it's important to take note of the bullish signals on larger time frames.  More immediately, the daily chart suggests market equilibrium, as prices have been largely stuck within a $650 range for nearly two weeks.  Daily chart  BTC's price action has been caught between the 100-day and 200-day MAs for 12 days.  Generally speaking, when prices are above the 200-day MA, the long-term trend can be considered bullish. Conversely, if prices are beneath the 100-day MA then that is an indication of mid-term (30-60 day) bearish conditions.  The current scenario highlights the indecisive sentiment felt across the market. A repeated failure to close above the 100-day MA could open up doors to $8,800 in the immediate short-term, as previously discussed.  Indecision will continue until a firm close above $9,573 (100-day MA) or below $9,180 (200-day MA) occurs with conviction, until then, continued sideways ranging can be expected.

42403501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAiG,1573207218,Tether Says Its Stablecoin Is 'Fully Backed' Again,"USDT tokens are now fully backed by Tether's reserves, the stablecoin issuer said Thursday.  Tether published a response to what it described as ""a flawed paper"" written by John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, and Amin Shams, an instructor the Ohio State University which claimed a single address on the Bitfinex exchange was responsible for manipulating the bitcoin market in late 2017, sparking the bull market. The paper was an update to a version first published in the summer of 2018.  Tether  pushed back on this claim, saying in Thursday's statement that ""the revised paper is a watered-down and embarrassing walk-back"" of the first version.  Perhaps more intriguing, however, was the claim that ""All Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves.""  Whether or not USDT is fully-backed has long been a point of contention. The company has promised an audit of its stablecoin reserves (though it has not delivered one, and has since dissolved its relationship with its auditor), produced a third-party report saying it likely had more funds than outstanding tokens, and had a bank write a letter vouching for its holdings. (The latter two reports both acted as snapshots, only assuring the crypto community that on specific days, Tether's obligations did not exceed its assets.)  Tether's backing is even the subject of an inquiry by the New York State Attorney General's office.  Nevertheless, Tether maintained that its tokens were fully backed until April 2019, when general counsel Stuart Hoegner wrote in an affidavit that USDT was backed by ""cash and cash equivalents ... representing approximately 74 percent of the current outstanding tethers.""  At the time, Tether held $2.1 billion in assets, with 2.8 billion USDT tokens issued on the Omni blockchain. According to a block explorer, this number has fallen since then to 1.775 billion. However, a further 2 billion USDT is in circulation as an ERC-20 token.  Tether's ""Transparency"" page says the company currently holds more than $4.6 billion in total assets, including $4.56 billion in U.S. dollars, $44 million in euros and $3.3 million in Chinese renminbi (amounts are converted).  In an email to CoinDesk, Hoegner said the outstanding tokens are currently backed by reserves, adding:  ""According to the website and our terms of service, our reserves include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties. The 74% figure refers to particular assets at that point in time, not the aggregate reserves.""  He declined to detail the breakdown between Tether's actual cash holdings and the cash equivalents, saying ""we generally do not share the asset mix.""  'Lack of understanding'  As for the actual paper that Griffin and Shams hope to see published in the Journal of Finance, Tether's statement Thursday said ""the authors demonstrate a fundamental lack of understanding of the cryptocurrency marketplace and the demand that drives Tether token purchases.""  The paper itself said its analysis ""for the single largest player on Bitfinex"" found that ""the 1 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent of hours with the highest lagged flow of Tether by this one player are associated with 55 percent, 67.2 percent and 79.2 percent of bitcoin's price increase over our March 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 sample period.""  The paper went on to say:  ""This pattern is not present for the flows to any other Tether exchanges, and simulations show that these patterns are highly unlikely to be due to chance; this one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on Bitcoin that is not observed in the aggregate flows from other smaller traders.""  However, the paper suffers from having incomplete data, including insufficient data on capital flow or transaction timing, Tether said Thursday. As a result, the paper cannot ""establish a valid sequence of events"" for the claimed manipulation.  ""Furthermore, the authors now admit that the patterns of trading they observed could be consistent with the market purchase of Tethers, as opposed to the issuance of unbacked Tethers. Importantly, the authors do not possess or reference any data disputing that Tether has sufficient reserves to back up Tether token issuances in circulation,"" the statement said.  While the paper notes that ""some in the blogosphere and press"" have expressed doubts on whether Tether is fully backed, it adds that ""the cryptocurrency exchanges largely reject such concerns."" However, it later says its model and results ""are generally consistent with Tether being printed unbacked and pushed out onto the market.""  The paper has received skepticism and pushback from the crypto industry, with Tether skeptic Bennett Tomlin calling it ""inconclusive.""

Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York announced a plea deal with Hugh Brian Haney on Thursday, adding another postscript to the infamous dark web marketplace's history. According to a press release, Haney was accused of laundering close to $20 million using bitcoin in early 2018.  Silk Road  was among the dark web’s earliest drug marketplaces and a haven for its bitcoin-accepting vendors until its operator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in October 2013 and the site was shut down. Ulbricht is currently serving a life sentence on charges of narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy.  Haney was one of the sellers who used the marketplace. According to the prosecutors, Haney was a ""high-ranking member"" of a narcotics outfit known as Pharmville, and is said to have received nearly 4,000 bitcoin from Silk Road-linked accounts through February 2012. According to the complaint, he trafficked in fentanyl, oxycontin and other narcotic sales.  ""Hugh Haney used Silk Road as a means to sell drugs to people all over the world,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. ""Then he laundered more than $19 million in profits through cryptocurrency.""  He was caught after liquidating his remaining bitcoins on an exchange for $19,147,053 in January and February 2018. The unnamed company froze his account and launched an internal investigation that ultimately led to a search warrant. Haney was arrested in July 2019.  Initially, Haney claimed his bitcoin came from a mining operation. But investigators used ""blockchain analysis software"" to show the funds came from Silk Road, according to the July complaint.  According to his plea deal, Haney pled guilty to one count of concealing money laundering and one count of engaging in a financial transaction in criminally derived property. He is set to be sentenced in February 2020.

Alongside the Singapore government and the International Chamber of Commerce, these firms are looking to reduce the number of paper-based processes involved in global trade. Distributed ledger technology firm Perlin is providing the blockchain background to build the open-source platform, dubbed ICC TradeFlow.  DBS claims the new platform will connect partners from different countries, reducing end-to-end document transit time from 45 days to just 20. A $20 million trade in iron ore from Africa to China is expected to be the first transaction processed, according to a press release.  The ICC TradeFlow Platform is based on the Trade Trust network infrastructure provided by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information.  The partners plan to add more enhancements to the platform as more countries join the new trade finance system. According to the release, the participants claim they can build a more trusted relationship between counterparties, adding more background information such as credit ratings on trade participants, vessels and couriers.  The partnership could foster new innovations that can reinforce Singapore’s position as a leading commodity trading hub, said Satvinder Singh, assistant CEO of Enterprise Singapore, an agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry in the country.  Trade finance has been one of the frontiers for enterprise blockchain adoption. The trade finance blockchain Marco Polo has partnered with over 20 global banks, including Bank of America, ING and BNP Paribas. It has piloted its first trading arrangement between Germany and Russia in October.  A slew of Chinese state-owned banks have also launched their own blockchain trade finance platform to facilitate short-term financing between export companies and financial institutions, and the Construction Bank, one of four major commercial banks in the country, has revamped its blockchain platform with new factoring abilities as the platform’s trading volume surpasses $53 billion overall since its April 2018 launch.

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rohit Chopra wrote a letter to the Fed – the U.S. central bank – supporting the potential development of the ""FedNow Service,"" the potential high-speed payments system the group is now examining.  And, joining other government officials worldwide, Chopra criticized Libra, the Facebook-led cryptocurrency project first unveiled in June.  ""The vague and scant details on the tech platform’s proposed shadow global central bank have sounded international alarm bells, particularly in light of Facebook’s ongoing scandals and reputation for abuse,"" he wrote. ""The laundry list of risks raised by the Libra project will take time to unpack and address. I share the serious concerns raised by Chairman Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard.""  However, he sees getting a public sector solution to the current payments system as more important, writing:  ""Regardless of Libra’s ultimate fate, the proposal’s emergence underscores the appetite for real-time payments and the urgency of intervention by the Federal Reserve.""  He sees demand for fast payments, noting the ""pent-up frustration"" with large bank fees and noting that ""other real-time technologies"" have been spreading rapidly.  It is not yet clear what FedNow could look like, nor how it would operate. The project will not go live until 2024.  Though there is no indication that FedNow will utilize blockchain at any point, two U.S. lawmakers have written to the Fed to inquire about its views toward the technology. Last month, Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.) outlined a number of questions for the Fed, noting that the dollar's global supremacy may be at risk if other nations develop a widely adopted digital fiat currency first.

42403481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAVT,1573171931,MakerDAO Proposes New DAI Ceiling After Hitting $100 Million Cap,"The MakerDAO loan system, administered by the Maker Foundation, hit its debt ceiling Wednesday with roughly $100 million worth of the stablecoin DAI issued and more than $339 million worth of ethereum locked up as collateral.  On Thursday, the Maker Foundation proposed a new debt ceiling of 120 million DAI, which will now be voted on by holders of MKR governance tokens.  “MakerDAO has hit that limit and no more [DAI] can be generated until that debt limit is increased,” Maker Foundation president Steven Becker told CoinDesk.  This follows the previous raise in 2018, which doubled the DAI debt ceiling from 50 to 100 million stablecoins.  Despite the platform's rapid growth, Becker said the nonprofit’s employees don’t have any statistics or insights into which demographics are taking out these cryptocurrency loans. Whoever they are, LoanScan tallied users conducting 35,919 transactions over the past month alone.  Back in July, the MakerDAO Foundation's Joe Quintilian told CoinDesk he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the first $3 million loan was issued by 2020. As of November, there are at least five loans exceeding that amount, including two loans over $8 million each.  These loans don’t have fixed interest rates. Michael McDonald, creator of DAI analytics site mkr.tools, said in July that raising the debt ceiling might require a higher “stability fee,” the interest rate users must pay when they close out their DAI loans.  The stability fee fell from over 18 percent this summer to 5.5 percent today. The majority of the 35 voters who participated in a poll this weekhttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmdquxdmbabecafzsmtsm9wo4pmrpqyh93813mk7qadcxc voted to raise the rate again to 9.5 percent. However, Thursday's MakerDAO Foundation proposal to boost the debt ceiling to 120 million DAI also put a 5 percent stability fee back up for a vote.  Borrowers will have to pay whatever fee these voters decide on if they want to reclaim their collateral. Voter turnout remains low (just 1.97 percent of MKR holders participated in this week’s vote), perhaps in part because MKR tokens cost around $612 each.  Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto-centric fund holds 6 percent of those MKR tokens, with Polychain Capital and 1confirmation also holding significant amounts and nonprofit board seats. The MakerDAO Foundation has 85 contracted employees, Becker said. Furthermore, the system’s underlying ethereum backbone is being reconstructed, a project called Eth 2. Becker said it’s too soon to say when or how the system will migrate to the new blockchain, although mutual compatibility is the plan.  “The impact that we plan should be negligible and very much manageable,” Becker said of the ethereum upgrade.  Maker holder and DAI tinkerer Taylor Monahan, CEO of the wallet startup MyCrypto, told CoinDesk she is concerned there aren’t enough open discussions about the risks involved with decentralized finance [DeFi].  “Let’s be upfront about what the risks actually are, rather than say they are so minimal,” she said, adding:  “We can’t just let [growth] overshadow the fact that there are unintended consequences and unmitigated risks.”  The risks  One risk: These loans automatically liquidate if the price of ether drops below a designated point (which varies depending on the loan).  As of Nov. 18, MakerDAO will switch to a multi-collateral system, where users can put cryptocurrencies beyond just ETH into the DAI system. For starters, the system will only support one other token, BAT. Becker told CoinDesk OmiseGo is another prospective token being considered. Each type of token collateral will face prospective liquidation according to its own price feeds.  One aspect of the current MakerDAO migration that troubled Monahan is calling the collateral process a “vault,” as if the ether collateralized to issue DAI was stored for safekeeping with no further action required on behalf of users. (The previous name for taking out a DAI loan was “collateralized debt position.”)  Becker said there will be ample materials instructing users on how to transfer their loans from the current system to the multi-collateral system later this month. It could be as simple as pressing a button and indicating consent, he said, depending on the users’ platform of choice.  “Like any migration, you’ll have a dual system running until some time has passed,” Becker said, adding it’s not yet clear what will happen to loans that haven’t moved over by this time next year.  Monahan said she’s excited about the growing DeFi ecosystem, but that it also reminds her of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO] hack in 2016, where millions of dollars worth of tokens were stolen and the entire ethereum blockchain was reorchestrated to restore lost funds.  “I kind of hope we don't do the same exact thing. Let’s talk about [risks] before this gets too big,” she said, adding she hopes people are exploring every possible way this could impact users.
