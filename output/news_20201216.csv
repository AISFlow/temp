42411931,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhDhH,1608159445,What Is Proof-of-Work?,"Proof-of-work is the algorithm that secures many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most digital currencies have a central entity or leader keeping track of every user and how much money they have. But there’s no such leader in charge of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Proof-of-work is needed to make the online currency work without a company or government running the show.  More specifically proof-of-work solves the ""double-spending problem,"" which is trickier to solve without a leader in charge. If users can double-spend their coins, this inflates the overall supply, debasing everyone else's coins and making the currency unpredictable and worthless.  Double-spending is an issue for online transactions because digital actions are very easy to replicate, which is what makes it trivial to copy and paste a file or send an email to more than one person.  Proof-of-work makes doubling digital money very, very hard. It's much what it sounds like: ""proof"" that someone has done a significant amount of computations.  How proof-of-work works  Bitcoin is a blockchain, which is a shared ledger that contains a history of every Bitcoin transaction that ever took place. This blockchain, as the name suggests, is composed of blocks. Each block has the most recent transactions stored in it.  Proof-of-work is a necessary part of adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. Blocks are summoned to life by miners, the players in the ecosystem who execute proof-of-work. A new block is accepted by the network each time a miner comes up with a new winning proof-of-work, which happens roughly every 10 minutes.  Finding the winning proof-of-work is so difficult the only way to provide the work miners need to win bitcoin is with expensive, specialized computers. Miners will earn bitcoin if they guess a matching computation. The more computations they churn out, the more bitcoin they are likely to earn.  What computations are the miners making exactly? In Bitcoin, miners spit out so-called ""hash,"" which turns an input into a random-looking string of letters and numbers.  The goal of the miners is to create a hash matching Bitcoin's current ""target."" They must create a hash with enough zeroes in front. The probability of getting several zeros in a row is very low. But miners across the world are making trillions of such computations a second, so it takes them about 10 minutes on average to hit this target.  Whoever reaches the goal first wins a batch of bitcoin cryptocurrency. Then the Bitcoin protocol creates a new value that miners must hash, and miners start the race for finding the winning proof-of-work all over again.  Proof-of-Work FAQ  Why do miners follow the rules?  Miners earn bitcoin rewards for every block for which they find the solution. This is what drives them to mine in the first place.  This monetary reward also drives them to follow the rules – not double-spending their money, for instance. Say Alfred the Miner finds a winning hash for a block. If Alfred submits the solution with the block but breaks rules within the block – say, spends coins more than once – the rest of the Bitcoin network will reject Alfred's block. Alfred will lose all the bitcoin he should have won. The threat of losing the bitcoin rewards keeps miners honest.  Why is proof-of-work needed?  The goal of proof-of-work is to prevent users from printing extra coins they didn't earn, or double-spending. If users were able to spend their coins more than once, it would effectively make the currency worthless.  In most digital currencies, this problem is easy to solve. The bank that is in charge of the system keeps track of how much money each person has. If Alice sends Bob $1, then the bank deducts $1 from Alice and gives $1 to Bob.  But in cryptocurrency there isn't such an entity. Proof-of-work provides a solution.  Who invented proof-of-work?  Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto invented proof-of-work to get Bitcoin off the ground. No one knows who Nakamoto is, or whether the name is an alias.  What are the problems with proof-of-work?  There are at least a few problems with proof-of-work:  High energy use: Bitcoin uses as much energy as all of Switzerland because of proof-of-work. And its energy use is increasing as more miners join the hunt for bitcoins, though some of this is powered by renewable energy.  51% attacks: If one mining entity is able to accumulate 51% of Bitcoin's mining hashrate, it can then flout the rules temporarily, double-spending coins and blocking transactions.  Mining centralization: Proof-of-work is all about creating a currency without one single entity in charge. That said, in practice the system is somewhat centralized, with just three mining pools controlling almost 50% of Bitcoin's computational power. Developers are attempting to at least alleviate this issue, however.  Why does more mining power mean more security?  The more computational power being poured into securing Bitcoin, the more resources a potential attacker needs to amass in order to successfully attack Bitcoin.  Which cryptocurrencies use proof-of-work?  Most cryptocurrencies use proof-of-work, though some are experimenting with other ways of securing their networks. The most popular cryptocurrencies tapping proof-of-work include:  Bitcoin  Ethereum (though Ethereum recently began the long process of transitioning to Ethereum 2.0, an upgrade that will shift the cryptocurrency to the potentially greener proof-of-stake instead.)

42385388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1fMD,1608157624,Over $20K? Why Is Bitcoin Worth Anything at All?,"Bitcoin’s price continues to climb, a consistent flow of BTC is leaving exchanges and bitcoin ""whale"" sightings are becoming more frequent. But beyond the market frenzy, how does it all work?      Is bitcoin money or a technology? Is it a store of value like gold or does it emulate Milton Friedman’s “e-cash” idea?      And while the world struggles to come to terms with bitcoin – perhaps most clearly shown in the discrepancy between bitcoin’s current price and asset manager Guggenheim’s $400,000 figure – it’s helpful to revisit the digital asset's fundamentals.    Bitcoin's economic basis    Bitcoin’s groundwork is laid out in the 2008 white paper published by its pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. In the paper, Nakamoto describes their original intentions for the new money protocol, labeling Bitcoin as a proof-of-concept technology functioning as “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.”      Nakamoto further describes the Bitcoin network as a decentralized payments system, meaning third-party financial intermediaries (i.e. banks or credit unions) are unnecessary when transferring value with Bitcoin.      The system is also designed to prevent government agencies – or anyone else – from affecting the Bitcoin network’s monetary supply.      “Bitcoin was designed to oppose the existing fiat paper money and central banking regime that has reigned now for a century over the global economy,” Mark Thornton, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Ludwig von Mises Institute, told CoinDesk in an email.      Nakamoto goes on to describe Bitcoin’s network analogously to gold. The shiny metal has long been held as a store of value due to a few qualities, namely its natural scarcity and fungibility.      Read more: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis      In a similar manner Nakamoto wrote that Bitcoin miners expend “CPU time and electricity” to mimic gold miners smacking away at the Earth’s crust. In return, they receive a portion of bitcoin from the network itself while sending transactions on behalf of Bitcoin users.      Yet, Nakamoto’s argument by analogy of bitcoin to gold does not stand alone. Rather, it is on the shoulders of contributions from others, including academics, over many years. Indeed, Bitcoin’s features such as a hard supply cap and slow inflation rate lends itself naturally to a few select economic schools, particularly those focused on the free market. Valuing the bitcoin cryptocurrency is complementary to these ideologies.    'Free money' economics    Bitcoin has storied academic roots, regardless of its reputation for use in illicit markets. Two prominent economic schools of thought, the Austrian school and the Chicago school, are often cited by Bitcoiners as accomplices in the task to free money from government printers.      The Austrian school was founded by Viennese professor Carl Menger in the late 19th century. Even at the time, Menger was known for heterodox views and for sparring with the dominant economic thinking of the time (not much differently from many Bitcoin advocates today).      Arguably, Menger’s greatest contribution to Austrian economics was the development of the subjective theory of value, a component of the study of human action known as praxeology. Menger argued the value of any good is derived from humans themselves; that is to say, no good or service holds intrinsic value.      Menger’s arguments were taken further by the next few generations of Austrian economists including Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek in the mid-20th century. Mises, for one, crafted an argument demonstrating that the market created money, as opposed to the view that the government created money, known as Chartalism.      Hayek, winner of the 1974 Nobel Prize, would go on to advocate the creation of a money system outside of government in the later 20th century.      “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government,” Hayek said in a 1984 interview. “That is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government. All we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.”      Milton Friedman, the most well-known member of the Chicago school of economics, also called for the creation of a digital currency. Friedman believed an “e-cash” was not only a necessary component to the newly founded internet but also a logical tool for limiting government overreach.      “Friedman famously argued for a k-percent rule (growing the money supply by a set, pre-announced % every year, regardless of what happens in the country) and for having monetary policy set by a computer (where it could not be corrupted by humans),” Paul Sztorc, former statistician at the Yale Economics Department and creator of BitcoinHivemind.com, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.      “By the 2000s Friedman believed that the U.S. should just adopt a ‘fixed supply’ of base money, and declare that they would never change it. Bitcoin instantiates all of these principles.”    Bitcoin vs. inflationism    It’s important to note that Bitcoin is a technological product backed by, or even adopted by, a previous community. That, in itself, distinguishes it from other fringe monetary movements such as #MintTheCoin, which is a purely community-driven phenomenon.      The central tenet of Bitcoin is its 21 million BTC supply cap. The network’s rate of inflation is fixed similarly to how much gold can be mined from the Earth every year.      The issuance of Bitcoin decreases every four years in an event called a “halving.” These technical events decrease the supply of BTC created every 10 minutes by the network until no more BTC will be mined sometime in 2140.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The Bitcoin network’s last halving occurred two months into a global pandemic that spurred trillions of dollars of money printing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. Indeed, Bitcoin miner F2Pool included a New York Times headline in the last block mined before the halving:    NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue    Bitcoin’s supply schedule mimics gold, making it a “complete contrast to central bankers who can create money out of thin air,” Thornton said.      “As such, bitcoin has performed very well over the past several years as central banks seem to be hell-bent on destroying the value of their currencies. This would, of course, include the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan especially. They along with many other central banks have reduced their policy rates to near zero, or even negative rates,” Thornton said.    Valuing bitcoin    Bitcoin skeptics often decry a lack of intrinsic value, a lack of cash flows and a lack of historical precedent for the digital asset, among other points.      Indeed, a rise above $20,000 per bitcoin does not invalidate “bear” sentiments, CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson said. Bitcoin could crash down to Earth at any point. But that’s also what makes it interesting as an asset class, she said.      “One of the most fascinating things about bitcoin is that it doesn’t conform to standard valuation techniques. There’s no cash flow to discount and no physical assets that back it up,” she said.      Bitcoin and gold hold some correlations from a theoretical standpoint, but it depends on what point you focus on, Acheson said.      “Like gold, it is worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, and that is impacted by overall market sentiment, inflation expectations and technological trends. Unlike gold, though, bitcoin’s supply is not at all impacted by its price, which is one of the reasons it will always be more volatile: There will never be an increase of new supply to meet increased demand,” she said.      Eric Turner, director of research at market data provider Messari, said the $20,000 bitcoin price reached early Wednesday is “an important psychological milestone” for the digital asset as all investors stand in the green. Moreover, Turner said, bitcoin as digital gold “is really the big story of the year,” particularly against a backdrop of “macro concerns and poor monetary policy.”      “In my opinion this is just the start for this cycle, which is going to be dominated by larger and more established institutional investors adding allocations to BTC. The real tipping point is if pensions, endowments and sovereign wealth funds start to get in the game. Whether that is this time around or next cycle remains to be seen,” he said.    Next stop?    A successive all-time high valuation gives additional credence to bitcoin as a digital asset, Sztorc said. Yet, bitcoin remains “aspirational money,” he said.      ""Given the sheer distance bitcoin has to travel (from being totally obscure in the beginning, to being one half of every trade in the future global economy), it is probably more accurate to think of BTC as an investment in a unicorn-style winner-take-all tech-company,” he said.      Still, a higher price per unit translates into not only additional attention to the asset but more throughput in U.S. dollars and a larger security budget protect itself against adversaries, he said.      Robert Catalanello, president and CEO of over-the-counter broker B2C2 USA, told CoinDesk in an email bitcoin’s price rise “supports our view that crypto in general, and BTC in particular, is increasingly being viewed as a store of value.”      The last few weeks of price action bouncing between a range of $18,000 and $19,600 were a contest of miners offloading mined BTC and “new entrants, including many traditional finance clients, and selling from miners,” Catalanello added.      “There was a tremendous amount of supply from the latter, and that makes the move today even more impressive as we doubt the demand would have been there even three to six months ago to satisfy the supply,” he said.      Thornton, on the other hand, contextualized bitcoin’s breakout within the global pandemic, Brexit and other macro events. An all-time high event does not preclude the possibility of another “shape retreat in 2021 like we saw in 2018,” although he said he would not be surprised by further price gains.      “Despite these reservations nothing has fundamentally changed that supports higher cyber currency prices in the future as well as ongoing attempts on the part of central bankers and governments to capture and control this new form of currency,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/16/over-20k-why-is-bitcoin-worth-anything-at-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6965cc297f9018498eabc9e0b576494a5a68ae54-1794x923.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, with a short supply of bitcoin and a surging demand, traders and analysts are optimistic the oldest cryptocurrency can keep its bull run going for a longer time.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $20,808.28 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 6.70% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $19,293.30-$20,890.11 (CoinDesk 20)    Bitcoin’s price continued higher after it hit the $20,000 threshold, and that is likely due to a combination of a rising demand and a shortage of supply.      Read More: Bitcoin Hits Record Above $20K as Analysts Remain Confident of Future      “This bull run has been evidently driven by traditional financial institutions [that] have been actively buying bitcoin dips of late as an investment and treasury product. They have a long-term strategy for these assets,” Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, told CoinDesk. “So with increased demand, HODLing and fewer block rewards due to the recent halving, the price may have no limits.”      Moments before bitcoin’s price broke $20,000 earlier Wednesday, on-chain data provider CryptoQuant’s chart captured an unusual spike in the number of stablecoin inflow addresses moving to all exchanges.

With bitcoin surpassing its highest level since its 2017 high, if the breakout keeps going for the next two days new resistance at around $25,000 could be possible.      “Because there is no additional resistance and targeted levels have been exceeded,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, “we can use round numbers like $25,000 as gauges of potential resistance.”      Bitcoin’s options market also supports the widespread optimism on prices, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant. He noted that the most open interest for bitcoin is at $36,000 expiring in January.      “Although a rally of such magnitude is unlikely to be beneficial for overall market health,” Vinokourov said, “it would make the most sense to instead see price action around $19,500-23,000, which will be far better for long-term prospects.”    Ether May OutPerform Bitcoin On CME’s New ETH Futures    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was Wednesday trading around $623.58 and climbing 5.47% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Analysts expressed their bullish attitude towards ether after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced it will launch a futures contract on ether in February 2021.

42385384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1fHB,1608147047,The Big Banks Positioned to Ride Bitcoin's Bull Run,"Traditional banks are now taking the plunge and coming out with crypto-related services. The shift coincides with bitcoin’s price hitting all-time highs in December.      Banks may have been looking closely at digital assets for some time now, but have been skittish about saying anything in public. Now they appear to be joining a general shift towards crypto in the latter half of 2020 that has included payments giant PayPal (PYPL) and hedge fund mavens including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.      Starting with technologically advanced Switzerland and Singapore, where some of the first big moves are happening, the industry is seeing a growing list of lenders leaning towards crypto.      DBS Bank of Singapore recently announced its crypto trading and custody platform (which is 10%-owned by the national stock exchange SGX) was ready to go live, making it a frontrunner.    Read more: DBS Bank’s Digital Exchange to Begin Trading Crypto ‘Next Week’    The same week DBS made its announcement, Swiss digital exchange SDX said it was partnering with Japanese bank SBI Holdings, to build a digital asset exchange in Singapore, although that won’t be ready until early 2022, the firms said.    Read more: SDX Chief Gets Philosophical About Crypto’s Swiss-Singapore Connection    An important milestone in October was Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the Russian energy conglomerate, going live with crypto custody in Switzerland. The bank used institution-focused custody tech from Swiss firm METACO, which is working closely with core banking software vendor Avaloq.    Read more: Swiss Arm of Russia’s Gazprombank Launches Institutional Bitcoin Offerings    It later emerged Spanish bank BBVA will also be basing crypto operations out of Switzerland, and using METACO’s custody tech. BBVA declined to comment on the plans, which sources said would be ready in January 2021.    Read more: Spain’s Second-Largest Bank Will Soon Launch Crypto Services: Sources    Another leading bank to emerge from the bushes is London-headquartered Standard Chartered, which announced a crypto custody partnership with U.S.-based Northern Trust.      CoinDesk also learned that Standard Chartered is working with five or six of the largest trading desks and exchanges in crypto, including LMAX and ErisX, for a post-trade and settlement system which is also slated to go live early next year.    Read more: Standard Chartered Bank to Launch Crypto Trading for Institutional Investors: Sources    “What you could say is that we’re enabling an element of institutional trading by having an institutional infrastructure,” Alex Manson, head of the bank’s venture arm, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Accordingly, any exchange interested in institutional space is a potential client      In terms of whom the bank is working with, Manson said, “It's hard to be specific about names and exchanges. I would just confirm that we have been in touch with a number of the players and exchanges. Ultimately, all will come together and – assuming the right degree of safety, compliance and regulatory requirements – will become parts of an ecosystem and value chain.”    Pump the brakes    Providing a sanity check, LMAX CEO David Mercer said the headlines are great for adoption but pointed out that actual banking of crypto is still some way off; a couple of years down the road, he reckoned.      “Mostly the banks are extending existing custodian services. What they’re doing is leveraging their technology prowess,” Mercer said in an interview, adding:      “Entering the crypto space means taking delivery of and owning a crypto asset. Cryptoland is jumping on these technology services and saying, ‘Wow, a huge bank is launching crypto.’ They’re not. They’re just extending their services and future-proofing their business.”    U.S. regulatory clarity?    Earlier this year, there was a push from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for banks to embrace a more crypto-friendly atmosphere. In July, the agency published a letter telling nationally regulated banks they could offer crypto custody. Earlier this month, Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks hinted at the idea he’d provide clarity around banks plugging “directly into blockchains as payments networks.”    Read more: OCC Chief Hints at Coming ‘Good’ Actions on Crypto by End of Trump’s Term    There’s also evidence that additional guidance from the OCC would help more banks enter the crypto custody space. In August, just under a dozen banks, including U.S. Bank and PNC, indicated they might be interested in providing crypto custody services in response to the OCC’s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) in June, which asked the general public to weigh in on how crypto and other fintech tools might be used in the financial sector.    Read more: Following OCC Letter, Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services  More options    Cryptocurrency firms also have more banking options in 2020.      Historically, there have been a handful of firms willing to bank the crypto sector, with Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank leading the charge. Bankers have long been wary of not being able to trace the source of funds that cryptocurrency firms work with and having to do extra know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks to onboard crypto businesses.      However, each of these crypto-friendly banks hold just a fraction of the $2.87 trillion in assets controlled by JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. and one of the 10 largest banks in the world.      In May of this year, it was revealed that JPMorgan was banking crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini, in part because both firms are regulated by multiple regulators.    Read more: JPMorgan Bank Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as Its First Crypto Exchange Customers    When U.S. regulators get involved, large U.S. banks feel more comfortable offering services to an industry. Digital securities firm TokenSoft has been banked by JPMorgan since 2017, in part because of its regulatory sophistication, said TokenSoft CEO Mason Borda.      “I was able to walk across the street into the branch, accurately and effectively describe our business and additionally recommend that the banker personally invest in bitcoin,” Borda said. The banker “politely brushed off” Borda’s bitcoin advice but gave TokenSoft a bank account, he said.    In sum    Custody and checking accounts are still financial services with tight margins and the crypto industry is a new asset niche on which banks still have to figure out how to make risk-adjusted returns.

""Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,"" according to a statement released at the conclusion of this week's two-day, closed-door meeting of the central bank's monetary-policy committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.    Key target rate for federal funds to stay in a range of 0% to 0.25%  Fed plans to keep buying $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities every month ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.""  That's a change in wording from the statement issued after the Fed's previous meeting in November, where it said the bond purchases would continue ""to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.""  Summary of economic projections released along with the statement shows FOMC members have turned slightly more optimistic about the economy since September.  On average, they expect GDP to contract 2.4% in 2020, versus a September projection for 3.7% decline. The average expectation for growth in 2021 is 4.2%, versus a 4% projection in September.  Prices for personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise 1.8% next year, compared with a September projection of 1.7%.    Traders in digital-asset markets have tracked the Fed's decisions this year because many analysts say the U.S. central bank's trillions of dollars of money printing could bolster use of bitcoin among institutional investors as an an inflation hedge.

It's a floodgate that's now been opened.      Exchange data shows exactly how the dollar price of bitcoin broke the key psychological $20,000 threshold in early trading hours Tuesday and kept on going. The pattern could be a sign of long pent-up demand for the cryptocurrency, and underscores that seemingly arbitrary levels do matter to the market.      According to data provided by on-chain crypto analytic firm CryptoQuant, there was an unusual spike in the number of stablecoin inflow addresses for all exchanges, an indicator of “extreme buying power,” between 13:30-13:40 UTC (8:30 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. ET).      “Many people were trying to deposit stablecoins to buy BTC,” Ki Young Jun, chief executive of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk.      A chart provided by crypto data portal CryptoWatch shows that approximately $45 million was traded on Kraken’s BTC/USD spot market from 13:30-14:00 UTC as bitcoin’s price moved up by 5%.      It was not clear what drove the surge of bitcoin buying orders on exchanges at the time, but it occurred just as CoinDesk published a story that U.K.-based Ruffer Investments confirmed it invested about $744.26 million worth of bitcoin in November.      Also on Wednesday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced it will launch a futures contract on ether in February 2021.      Some analysts are anticipating larger buyers in the coming months.      “Looking forward to 2021, we should expect the outsized bids of institutions to have a much greater determining influence on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Artur Sapek, founder of CryptoWatch, told CoinDesk.

Ruffer, a $27 billion London-based asset manager, allocated 2.7% of the firm's assets under management to bitcoin in November, according to a client memo.

While some reported that bitcoin crossed this level in 2017, that was based on single trades on low-liquidity exchanges. CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index aggregates data from the most popular exchanges with verifiable data.    At stake    'Free Ross' Rumor is President Trump may pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder and administrator of the Silk Road darknet drug market, who is currently serving two consecutive life sentences plus 40 years without the possibility of parole.      In 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced for crimes related to his $183 million darknet operation, including computer fraud, money laundering and drug charges. Silk Road was an open bazaar for merchants and buyers to commerce, with thousands of drug listings at its height for anything from marijuana to heroin.      Despite the obvious criminality of such a website, Ulbricht was a first-time offender accused of non-violent crimes. Many criminal justice activists think Ulbricht’s sentence is excessive while others point to evidence of a mishandling of justice at the procedural level. Over the past five years, a strong movement – spearheaded by Ulbricht’s mom, Lyn – has formed urging clemency for the 36-year-old self-taught coder.      On its face, there is a discrepancy between Ulbricht’s punishment and what might be expected. For instance, other Silk Road admins charged with similar offenses were given sentences varying from 17 months to six and a half years. Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of the sex trafficking site Backpage.com, was sentenced to up to five years in prison for money laundering and prostitution charges.      It’s been said the book was thrown at Ulbricht to discourage future online misbehavior, at a time when peer-to-peer technologies were presenting themselves as potential threats to the status quo.      The Silk Road was a fixture within the popular imagination while still up, becoming the first private-routing Tor site to have name recognition, and the first substantial use case for the internet-native currency bitcoin. Then there was the Dread Pirate Roberts, the site’s mysterious operator – who steered the website with an iron fist, and even allegedly hired out hitmen to neutralize threats to his identity and the Silk Road.      While the government tied Ulbricht to this online DPR moniker and accused him of attempted murder for hire, these charges were not part of his trial. In fact, one of the charges brought by Maryland prosecutors for commission of murder was dismissed with prejudice.      Still, in 2015, when penalties were being laid out, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest included these unproven allegations in her decision. (In 2016, an appellate court said these charges – which were not decided on by a jury – “significantly justified the life sentence.”)      Crypto legal mind Jake Chervinsky notes, “The government convicted Ross of certain (nonviolent) crimes, and then had him sentenced for different, unproven (violent) ones.”      As it stands, Ulbricht has exhausted his options for legal recourse through the court system. His appeals have been denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case. In April, Lyn Ulbricht told me the last remaining avenue for leniency would be through a presidential commutation.      “The Eighth Amendment says no cruel or unusual punishment and this is very unusual for a first-time nonviolent offender, and it’s certainly cruel,” she said at the time. The Daily Beast, which broke the news of a potential pardon, reports there are several people close to Trump who are advocates for Ulbricht’s clemency. Trump is reportedly sympathetic to the case.  “In the beginning of the year, [Ulbricht’s] family had reached out to us for our support, and my organization and I have endorsed his full commutation, and I am hopeful that President Trump will commute his sentence in its entirety. This case has perhaps more support than I’ve seen in any case of this kind,” Weldon Angelos, a criminal justice reform activist, told The Daily Beast.      Trump ""can sign a piece of paper and Ross would walk out the door,” Lyn said in April.

An investigation from the Australian arm of the newspaper, published Sunday, traced the scam back to five names and addresses in Moscow, alleging the people had registered hundreds of websites used to promote the scam.  Run by what The Guardian called an ""organized global business,"" the scheme uses images of Australian celebrities such as actor Chris Hemsworth, entrepreneur Dick Smith and Fortescue Metals Group CEO Andrew Forrest without permission and takes out ""millions"" of Google ads.  The ads first started running on news sites in 2018 or earlier, but during the coronavirus pandemic, the ads reportedly captured the attention of ""tens of thousands"" of Australians who have fallen for the scam.  When a victim clicks on an ad they are taken to a site featuring what claims to be a cryptocurrency investment scheme and asked to enter details including a telephone number and to invest around $250 initially.  The scammers typically cold-call people who provide the details, urging them to invest larger sums, per the report. They are later unable to get their purported investment back.  Guardian Australia said the scheme is so large it's difficult for Google to block the ads and for regulators in Australia to take action.  A spokeswoman for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission told the newspaper that tracing scammers outside of the country is difficult and it may look at whether digital platforms are doing enough to stop such schemes.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America say the Fed might adopt ""qualitative"" guidance as a way of determining how long to maintain its stimulus-focused purchases of government bonds, ongoing at a pace of $120 billion a month. Led by Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed already has added about $3 trillion to its balance sheet this year, roughly three-fourths the amount of money previously created in the 107-year-old institution's history.      Read More: New Federal Reserve ‘Qualitative’ Approach Could Push Further Into Experimental Realm    Market moves    (Editor's note: This is the third installment of First Mover's recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of 2020 and what it means for the future. Today we cover March and April, when the fast-spreading coronavirus began to take its toll on the global economy, sending markets into a tailspin and leading to an unprecedented financial response from governments and central banks around the world.)      It started off in late February as just another thread in the bitcoin market commentary. Global authorities were struggling to contain an unusually contagious and deadly virus outbreak from spreading beyond China.      Bitcoin, fresh off a five-month high around $10,500, racked up three straight days of price declines greater than 3% each. Initially, it seemed like no big deal in notoriously volatile digital-asset markets, especially since global stock markets were getting hit, too.      “There’s certainly a bit of fear in the bitcoin market, but it’s not anything close to the panic we’re seeing on Wall Street today,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the analysis firm Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, said Feb. 24. “Three percent is a very different figure for stocks and for bitcoin.”      What happened next was one of the swiftest and deepest sell-offs in the history of global markets, dragging down bitcoin to as low $3,850 by mid-March.      Which of course was followed by a dramatic push by U.S. lawmakers, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and authorities around the world to ply markets and the economy with trillions of dollars of stimulus money, bringing asset prices roaring back. By the end of April, bitcoin had more than doubled to about $8,600.      And that's when the calls apparently started pouring into cryptocurrency startups from Wall Street. Bitcoin, whose ultimate supply is famously hard-capped at 21 million under the underlying blockchain network's 11-year-old programming, had been cast as a potential hedge against central-bank money-printing and currency debasement, a modern and theoretically more portable version of gold.      “I’m getting calls from real big investors we’ve never seen before, saying, `Tell me about this bitcoin,'” Michael Novogratz, CEO of the cryptocurrency firm Galaxy Digital, told CNBC on April 2.      Economists wrestled with the question of whether deflationary forces might overwhelm any inflationary impulse, based on the expectation that coronavirus-related lockdowns would decimate consumer and business demand. On a more abstract level, financial historians rekindled discussions over whether the new crisis might precipitate a change in the dollar-dominated global monetary order, similar to the Bretton Woods accord toward the end of World War II.      “I wouldn’t rule out anything at this point,” Markus Brunnermeier, a Princeton University economics professor who has advised the International Monetary Fund, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and European Systemic Risk Board, told CoinDesk in late March.      Stephen Cecchetti, who headed the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in the early 2010s, articulated a key concept that has lurked in the bitcoin market commentary ever since: In times of deep turmoil, the presumption of central bank independence is largely ignored, allowing money printing to finance government budget deficits racked up due to emergency relief spending.  “The central bank has to be a part of the war machine,” Cecchetti, now a professor of international economics at Brandeis University, told CoinDesk.      The dynamic helps explain why bitcoin has been swinging alongside traditional markets based on the on-again, off-again talks in Washington over a new government-funded stimulus package.      Some 10 months after the coronavirus pandemic first started to infect global markets and the economy, the Federal Reserve is still using freshly printed (electronic) money to buy U.S. Treasurys and government-backed mortgage bonds, currently at a rate of $120 billion a month.      In doing so, the central bank is indirectly financing the U.S. government's budget deficit, which surged to a record $3.1 trillion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, more than twice the prior record of $1.4 trillion set in 2009. The Congressional Budget Office has forecast a deficit of $1.8 trillion for the current fiscal year, remaining above $1 trillion every year through 2030.      U.S. government debt held by the public, which started 2020 at an already-lofty $23 trillion, has now surged to about $27 trillion, and some bond-market analysts predict the Federal Reserve might need to keep monetary policy unusually loose for years to come – just so the Treasury Department can afford its interest payments.      The dynamic, set in motion in March and April, continues to prompt more of those phone calls to crypto startups from Wall Street. On Tuesday, Bank of America published a survey of fund managers showing that ""long bitcoin"" was one of the most ""crowded trades"" in global markets, along with ""long tech"" and ""short dollar.""      ""Over the course of 2020, many institutions have started to endorse bitcoin,"" according to a report Tuesday by the cryptocurrency analytics firm Coin Metrics. ""One of the most commonly cited reasons for this change of tune is the growing narrative that bitcoin could serve as a good hedge against inflation.""      With bitcoin prices now above $19,000, the story doesn't seem to be going away.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    After testing investor patience for three weeks, bitcoin has finally crossed above $20,000 to reach fresh all-time highs.      The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market value jumped over the key psychological threshold during the early U.S. trading hours, surpassing the previous peak price of $19,920 recorded Dec. 1. At the current price of $20,374, bitcoin is up 5.4% over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).      Breaking above $20,000, which represented a significant hurdle in the mindset of most traders, is entirely new ground for bitcoin and opens the doors for a climb to $100,000 over the course of 2021, according to some analysts.      While bitcoin is now up over 180% on a year-to-date basis, gold has added just over 22%. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has decoupled from the yellow metal this quarter with a more than 80% rally.

Ether futures will be listed on Feb. 8, more than three years after bitcoin futures went live.  Each contract will have 50 units of ether and the derivative product will be open to trade between 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m CT from Sunday to Friday, according to the official announcement.  The new contracts will use the CME CF ether-dollar reference rate from CF Benchmarks, the FCA-approved crypto indices provider.  ""Building on the success of bitcoin futures and options, CME Group will add ether futures to the cryptocurrency risk-management solutions available to trade in February,"" the exchange said.  Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate parties to buy and sell a particular asset of a specific quantity and at a predetermined price, at a specified date in the future.  CME's announcement of an ether futures contract has coincided with bitcoin's much-anticipated break above $20,000.  The exchange rolled out bitcoin futures three years ago after the cryptocurrency reached a record price of $19,783. The derivative contracts were reportedly approved by the Trump administration to prick the bitcoin bubble.  However, since then, CME has steadily climbed ranks to become the third-largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest. Many observers consider it to be synonymous with institutional trading.  ""Today's CME news shows institutional demand continues to spill into other leading digital assets, such as Ether,"" CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung told CoinDesk in an email. ""CF Benchmarks' regulated, replicable and robust indices will now act as the foundations for leading providers, like CME, to develop cryptocurrency markets fully fit for the 'institutionalization' of crypto.""

42405576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed704,1608129213,Experiments in Crypto’s Governance Lab,"Two hundred and thirty-three years ago, a group gathered in Philadelphia. Fifty-five men entered the red brick Pennsylvania state house, shuttered the windows and embarked upon a rare sort of work: defining how they would govern and be governed. For 100 days they debated, compromised, drafted, edited, and debated some more. In the end, on Sept. 17, 1787, they emerged with the United States Constitution.      It is worth noting this was not the first attempt. The gathering in 1787 was first initiated with the intention of revising the Articles of Confederation, America’s first constitution that had been ratified six years prior. That constitution, however, was proving weak and lacking the teeth necessary for enforcement. As the Constitutional Convention kicked off, the conversation quickly turned from revising the old articles to scrapping them and starting over.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    It is difficult to overstate how painstaking this process was. Discussions turned into arguments and threatened to derail the work. Contention and fierce debate surrounded wide-ranging issues: the formation of the branches of government, what rights states would retain, how many delegates would represent each state, the legality of slavery and whether slaves would be represented, with whom veto power would lie, how monetary policy would be decided, who would have power over the treasury. The pressure was on to get to a constitution that all could agree to and that would work and endure for the centuries to come.      As the delegates in attendance were working on the final product, the oldest statesman there stood and gave a speech: “For when you assemble a Number of Men to have the Advantage of their joint Wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those Men all their Prejudices, their Passions, their Errors of Opinion, their local Interests, and their selfish Views. From such an Assembly can a perfect Production be expected?”      Benjamin Franklin, here, acknowledges the document’s imperfections and notes the fallibility of its framers. He captures the impossible difficulty of the task they have undertaken. Yet, he turns this perspective to optimism, ultimately supporting the Constitution and saying it is as close to perfect as anyone could achieve.    If you can keep it    Franklin, upon walking out of Independence Hall following the convention, is said to have uttered another truth about the outcome of the delegates’ work.      “What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?” called out a member of the crowd around the building.      “A republic, if you can keep it,” replied Franklin.      The framing of the constitution is worth revisiting as we close out 2020, this annus horribilis that has seen a presidential impeachment, a deadly pandemic, an economic shutdown, unprecedented unemployment, civil unrest, a national reckoning around inequality and race relations, the loss of a Supreme Court Justice and, finally, the defeat of a presidential incumbent. Given this context, it feels more notable than ever that we have in fact kept our republic intact.      See also: Money Reimagined Podcast - A Battle for Bitcoin’s Soul, With Jill Carlson and Raoul Pal      Amid all of the chaos, corruption and change, the basic framework of our government has persisted. We can debate about whether the individuals who hold the highest offices of the land are adequately and appropriately serving their constituents. But what is without doubt is the offices themselves and the protocols surrounding them have remained largely unmolested despite the personalities that have inhabited them over the centuries and despite the turmoil the country has experienced in the intervening years. Credit to those 55 framers.    The library and the laboratory    Earlier, I described the work of the framers as rare. Part of what created pressure on them was that it is rare for humans to experiment with governance. Such experimentation has almost always been prohibitively costly. The opportunities to do such experimentation follow wars, coups, and revolutions. The timing cannot be controlled and the consequences cannot be fully considered. These moments in history, on the occasions they arise, have demanded quick action to plug power vacuums, leaving little time or space for reflection and deliberation.      The cost and infrequency of opportunities to explore new models of governance has meant that most innovation in this space has historically happened among academics and philosophers, from the security of the library or the smoke-filled salon. Much progress is attributable to these thinkers. The main tenets of the Constitution grew out of the theories of Enlightenment philosophers: Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Paine. They pioneered fresh perspectives on individual liberties, religious freedoms, democracy and inalienable rights.      See also: Government Reimagined, With Michael Casey, Sheila Warren, Jeff Saviano and Glen Weyl      For centuries these have been the two options for working on governance: in the library or in the high-stakes aftermath of regime change when a country’s fate, and that of its citizens, is on the line. Never has there been a laboratory within which experimentation could occur.    Governance experiments    2020 has seen the emergence of governance laboratories at scale for the first time in history. Never before have we, at scale, been able to experiment with how decisions get made within a community or a collective and see the ramifications in real-time. Cryptocurrency protocols offer us this: a middle ground between the ivory tower and the riots in the streets. We now have a low-stakes (but not no-stakes) way to test and assess how we govern.      There have been many trends in the cryptocurrency space this past year. Decentralized finance has reached escape velocity, with projects attracting meaningful traction and liquidity. Stablecoins are exploding in use and volumes. Central bank digital currencies are being taken seriously by every major player in the world. Bitcoin has finally cemented its position as digital gold and is rapidly earning the price appreciation to prove it.      However, when I reflect upon the developments that have occurred across the cryptocurrency landscape over the last year, the most under-acknowledged trend and, I believe, the trend that still has the furthest to run, is that of governance.      It is hard to believe that only three years ago Tezos was still a white paper and a testnet. Aragon was just getting off the ground. Decred was one of very few governance projects with more than a year or so of track record. Now, in 2020, governance projects abound. Even products and companies for which governance is seemingly not central – from decentralized exchanges to stablecoins – have a strong and clear governance component. Crypto, over the last few years, has created a lab for experimentation with governance.      Teams and communities working on these products and protocols find themselves facing some of the same pressures and challenges of the men at the Constitutional Convention. They must, as Ben Franklin pointed out, be aware of their own biases and imperfections in defining their governance paradigms. They feel the pressure to get it right.      They are even working to answer similar questions as the framers were centuries ago: Who should be represented and how? Who has veto power? How do we raise funds to ensure the longevity of the project? How should funds be managed and doled out? How do we create checks and balances? How do we ensure that those checks and balances do not generate so much inefficiency as to hamstring progress?      See also: Jill Carlson - Bitcoin’s Price Is a Poor Proxy for Its Utility      These questions of who has a voice, how proposals are made, where they are debated and how they are decided are as old as the notion of governance itself. Now we have a smaller-scale and lighter-weight venue than a nation-state to test different answers. We also have the option to fork, meaning the new framers do not need to hammer out endless concessions and compromises. There is room for more rapid, radical experimentation than ever before.      The framers of the Constitution two centuries ago revolted against and seceded from the United Kingdom. They were not quite sure what the new system would be, but they knew the values it would be founded upon and hammered out their best attempt at a new model of governance, one that has persisted through to today.      So, too, have those who are working in the crypto industry seceded from an old system. Like the framers, we have not yet defined what the new system will be. But, with 2020, we are getting there.

Why blockchain?    Using a blockchain empowers the artisans being employed in places like Pakistan, which are doing slow and measured production of the garment rather than the fast and cheap trade normally carried out in sweatshop-type situations, Sunberg said.      “At first I wanted to do everything locally in France,” he said in an interview. “But it’s been a real blessing in disguise when we started enlisting craftsmen in other countries. Pakistan is just one example. I could also say Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Bangladesh and so forth.”      Read more: Blockchain Startup Founded By Deloitte Vets Unveils Supply Chain Platform      A pair of True Tribe shorts retails for about $200. “It is expensive,” said Sunberg, “but it’s a very high-quality product in which we invest a lot of time and resources.”      Under the hood, SUKU uses Quorum, the Ethereum-based enterprise blockchain variant originally developed by engineers at JPMorgan (and now owned by ConsenSys).

42405572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed6v9,1608127200,Kraken Exchange Will Integrate Bitcoin's Lightning Network in 2021,"One of Bitcoin’s most promising new technologies is coming to one of its oldest exchanges.    The Kraken exchange announced today it will add support for the Lightning Network in 2021, which adds it to a small (but growing) list of exchanges that support the scaling technology thus far. Kraken is hiring a teamhttps://jobs.lever.co/kraken/9b156690-f6ab-4d7b-8cb4-49d64c01c60e to manage the feature, which it anticipates will be open for client use sometime in the first half of 2021    “The Lightning Network has matured to a level where it can be used by Kraken. It really comes back to what our users are asking for. They want instant and efficient payment – the ability to deposit and withdraw bitcoin without having to wait for confirmations and without high withdraw fee withdrawals,” Pierre Rochard told CoinDesk, saying Kraken anticipates that it will behoove traders looking for arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.      Regarding what aspects of Lightning have ""matured"" to make Kraken comfortable with supporting the technology, Rochard said two Lightning tech advancements in 2020, wumbo channels and multi-path payments (MPPs), paved the way for the integration. Wumbo channels allow users to send larger transactions on the Lighting Network that are larger than a few hundred dollars, while MPPs allow users to break up large payments into smaller amounts to make them easier to send.      Read more: Ready to Wumbo: LND Enables More, Larger Bitcoin Transactions on Lightning      Rochard told CoinDesk the rollout will be an “API-first launch” with only withdrawals initially enabled. This launch will only be “the first of many iterative developments with the Lightning Network” for Kraken though, Rochard continued, adding that the exchange may even allow users to set up payment channels (Lightning’s transaction avenues) directly with the exchange.    What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?    Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a technical innovation that allows its users to send bitcoin faster and more cheaply than if they were using Bitcoin’s primary network. These transactions use bitcoin but take place on a “secondary network” with different rules for accounting payments than Bitcoin’s blockchain (these transactions are eventually settled and recorded on Bitcoin’s blockchain when a user is done using the network).      Read more: What is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      For an exchange like Kraken, the Lightning Network would lower transaction fees for users when depositing and withdrawing from the trading hub. Since one of the appeals of Lightning is that you can send bitcoin for as little as a cent, this could mean the difference between paying a few dollars or a few pennies to withdraw bitcoin off Kraken at times of high transaction congestion.    Exchanges integrating Lightning    Bitcoin’s more vocal and passionate community members have griped that Kraken (among other popular exchanges) has neglected to add support for Bitcoin’s cutting edge technology while being quick to add new DeFi coins.      Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has been blunt on social media, stating that the choice to list Ethereum tokens is purely a business one: As the nosebleed price action in DeFi this summer showed us, the real money is in attracting traders to speculate on altcoins.      But now with Lightning on Kraken’s list of priorities, it will be the third crypto exchange to integrate the network, joining early adopter exchanges like Bitcoin-only River Financial and veteran crypto venue Bitfinex.      Scaling technologies like the Lightning Network and sidechains like Liquid and RSK all offer lower fees and faster transactions than Bitcoin’s on-chain network. When asked why Kraken opted for the Lightning Network instead of other scaling solutions like sidechains, Rochard chalked the decision up to network effects.      “Let’s look at it from the perspective of the ecosystem and how many participants there are. The Lightning community has done a great job of growing and building several different implementations. There are multiple different wallet providers, application developers and there’s so much of education and business development.      “We want the whole industry to adopt this technology, and we want that because we believe it will help everyone. Part of the hope with this announcement is that it gives others the opportunity to join us.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/16/kraken-exchange-will-integrate-bitcoins-lightning-network-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/186cef0ca8e72f3c068365fe5f2467569852f466-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Massachusetts Securities Division has prepared a 20-page draft administrative complaint, seen by the WSJ, which states Robinhood had exposed investors to “unnecessary trading risks” and violated state laws and regulations.  During the coronavirus pandemic, many young, inexperienced investors have started using the Robinhood app, which offers trading in stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, as well as cryptocurrency buying and selling.  The platform has been reaping the benefits of the influx of users by ""prioritizing its revenue over the best interest of its customers,” the Massachusetts complaint alleges.  Robinhood is also accused of encouraging “continuous and repeated engagement with its application"" by ""gamifying"" trading, and allowing unqualified investors to trade options.  The Massachusetts regulator wants Robinhood to improve its policies by approving users for options trading, and is further seeking an administrative penalty be paid by the platform. It should also get outside help in improving the platform to tackle outages, per the draft.  “Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded.

42405581,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed740,1608125359,"Crypto Is a Low-Risk, High-Reward Career Move These Days","There has never been a better time to bet your career on crypto. A series of historic improvements to the fundamentals of the asset class this year have decreased the risk. Meanwhile, the potential rewards are as high as ever.      There's an old saying, ""Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM."" The implication of this statement is that if you make a bold decision and it backfires, you can get fired. But if you make that same decision and de-risk it by hiring a reputable firm to support your decision, you're good.    This post is part of CoinDesk's Year in Review 2020 – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Tony is the co-founder of Cozy Finance, a risk management protocol for DeFi investors. He is also an active angel investor. He is best reached on Twitter.    This is a loser mentality but undeniably true. I've heard a similar axiom applied to institutional investing – ""Nobody ever got fired for following Yale Endowment"" – which was why Yale's foray into crypto was such a big deal. It de-risked the asset class for Yale's peers.      Here's a simple framework to help illustrate the point:      Most people in most jobs stick to boring activities. They won't get fired for these low-risk, low-reward decisions but they're unlikely to make a name for themselves either. They'd love to find low-risk, high-reward opportunities but those are harder to come by.      Another way to put it is by highlighting the quadrants that could threaten their survival in their role:      Anything high-risk could lead to firing. Unsurprisingly, most employers don't want their people acting stupid or outright gambling.      Crypto fell squarely in the risky half of the diagram for most people. Indeed, early adopters took on massive risk by starting companies in crypto or being the ""crypto person"" at their firm. It took deep conviction in the inevitability of the asset class to take on that risk.      The risk tolerance required to jump into crypto has decreased substantially over the last year with breakout successes from startups, endorsement from the who's who of institutional investors and a top-to-bottom-to-top market cycle, proving the resiliency of the asset class and those who believe in it.      This time last year I wrote for CoinDesk about the need for ""lighthouse customers"" to illuminate the way for high caliber founders and investors. We got that in spades, most notably in decentralized finance (DeFi). I mentioned MakerDAO, Compound and Uniswap as potential trailblazers. MakerDAO's DAI supply recently crossed $1 billion, Compound has more than $1.5 billion supplied on its platform,and Uniswap volumes have surpassed Coinbase's several months this year at tens of billions of dollars.      Endorsements from legendary investors including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller embolden other traditional investors. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock and Citi have changed their bearish tune. And previously skeptical influencers such as Jim Cramer have turned into vocal supporters. Last year, I struggled to find enough examples to illustrate my point. This year, there are dozens of similar data points that I have to omit for concision!    Just as risk can jeopardize a career, so, too, can reward make a career.    Market conditions have validated those who kept their heads down and built during the painful drawdown from 2018 to early 2020. A full top-to-bottom-to-top market cycle turns ""crazy"" crypto people into ""visionaries."" And BTC doesn't look like a pump and dump, it looks like a macro hedge.      Altogether, this shifts the risk profile of crypto out of the danger zone for many people. Betting on crypto can still get you fired, but it's less likely now that billion-dollar businesses have been built and some of the most well respected figures in institutional investing have made their positions public.      See also: Pondering Durian – 4 Big Reasons Bitcoin Belongs in Your Portfolio      Meanwhile, the potential rewards are still immense. We have made tremendous progress but we are still in the embryonic stages of the industry. BTC is still a small fraction of the market cap of gold, and one could argue that its potential is much greater than that. While DeFi has exploded, it still represents only a nominal amount of capital compared to traditional markets. And companies everywhere have under-invested in crypto over the years, yielding white space for ambitious people looking for high potential opportunities.      Just as risk can jeopardize a career, so, too, can reward make a career.      Altogether, risk has gone down while rewards remain high. I expect ambitious people all over the world to recognize that.      Eventually the opportunity will sit squarely in the “boring” box as crypto becomes a part of everyday life. But now, the return on investment is as high as it has ever been. For everybody paying attention, the career risk has gone way down and it will take time for everybody to see that. Until then, savvy actors can take advantage of this asymmetry.      We'll get a wave of top talent looking for ways to make their mark in crypto. And they'll build alongside the battle-tested talent that has been here all along.

42405563,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed6lJ,1608124016,Fintech Company Launches Platform to Assist in Central Bank Digital Currency Development,"Fintech company EMTECH is launching a compliance platform that helps central banks tackle compliance issues or safely test their central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in partnership with Microsoft, the firm announced Monday.      “It is a regulator-based solution that allows central banks to seamlessly introduce CBDCs,” Carmelle Cadet, EMTECH co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.      According to Cadet, the goal of EMTECH’s Modern Central Bank Sandbox is to assist central banks in setting up a digital currency that is interoperable, meaning it can easily be converted to other cryptocurrencies and are compatible with payment devices and terminals across the world.      With the government of China closing in on issuing its own digital yuan, a number of large economies around the world including South Korea and Sweden have begun working on their own CBDCs. But according to the Bank of International Settlements, emerging economies report stronger motivations for developing national digital currencies as they could help address systemic issues like financial exclusion and payments inefficiencies.      Cadet said the firm is actively working with the Central Bank of Bahamas on the digital sand dollar, a project to issue a digital equivalent of the Bahamian dollar.      U.S.-based EMTECH competed against other fintechs to work with the Bahamas’ digital currency, Cadet added. The Caribbean nation’s central bank piloted its CBDC late last year. The Bahamas launched the sand dollar in October 2020.      The project appears to be in early stages, according to a spokesperson for the Central Bank of the Bahamas.      “EMTECH’s involvement in the project is limited to architecting our cross-border minimal viable product (MVP), which remains a work in progress,” a spokesperson for the Central Bank of the Bahamas told CoinDesk via an email.      Cloud computing platform Microsoft Azure has partnered with EMTECH to deploy pilot programs as the firm continues to work on engaging central banks interested in issuing CBDCs, Cadet said.      “We look forward to helping EMTECH on its global mission to enable accelerated central bank digital innovation, harnessed on Microsoft’s highly secure, compliant and scalable Azure platform,” said Chris Lwanga, principal director of software partnerships at Microsoft, in the announcement.      Cadet explained her research has shown central banks are keen on introducing national digital currencies but they often work behind closed doors.      “If they build it internally, not thinking about interoperability, is probably going to fail when it comes out,” Cadet said.      The EMTECH leadership team includes Diane R.

42405579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed722,1608121800,"Valid Points: The Four Keys to Unlocking Ethereum 2.0, Explained","Three weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is close to tripling its initial deposit threshold of 524,288 ETH. These deposits made in increments of 32 ETH represent the stake of active or soon-to-be active validators on the network.      In order for Eth 2.0 to progress to its next phase of development, the new, recommended minimum number of validators is 262,144, which multiplied by a stake of 32 ETH would also mean a minimum deposit threshold 8,388,608 ETH. As background, the next phase will initiate the creation of 64 mini-blockchains, also called “shards,” to boost transaction throughput and network scalability.      Thereafter, in phase 1.5, developers are expected to activate ETH transfers on the network and seamlessly merge all Ethereum users and decentralized applications (dapps) to the new proof-of-stake blockchain.      There’s much work still to be done on Eth 2.0, but the highly anticipated launch of the network and the onboarding of hundreds of thousands of validators are thought to be the most difficult technical tasks in the entirety of this phased rollout.    Subscribe to Valid Points    Danny Ryan told CoinDesk in an interview back in late September, “Phase 0 is much more complex than I believe phase 1.5 is. This merger ... [phase 0] is essentially a bootstrapping phase where this new consensus mechanism and system is bootstrapped in parallel to the old system.”      As of Tuesday, Dec. 15, Eth 2.0 is 18% closer to successfully completing its bootstrapping phase. There are roughly 33,700 active validators on Eth 2.0, with close to 12,500 additional ones waiting in an activation queue for entry.      Phase 0 is far from complete. While the first few weeks after launch have been promising, there’s still a long way to go before we can all breathe a sigh of relief at getting past the most difficult phase of the network’s live development unscathed.    New frontiers    It’s important to remember not all Eth 2.0 staking options are equal.      Staking services come in two flavors: custodial and noncustodial. In practice that means the validator key is either held by the service provider or it's created and held by the investor.      “Not your keys, not your coins” is a crypto rallying cry for a reason, and it’s no different with Eth 2.0. Knowing who holds your keys is the same as knowing who controls your funds, and it is the most important part of setting up your validator.      When you deposit funds in Eth 2.0, you create a total of four keys: a public and private validator key set and a public and private withdrawal key set.      The validator key is your car key. The key “actively signs on-chain (ETH2) operations such as block proposals and attestations,” according to Ethereum Foundation researcher Carl Beekhuizen in beaconcha.in.      It’s also called the signing key and is always online (unless you stop validating by exiting the network). A malicious party snagging the key could cause you to miss attestations and lead to a variety of penalties.      The withdrawal key is your safe key. It controls the 32 ETH deposited in Eth 2.0 deposit contract plus rewards from validating the network. While the validator key is considered “hot,” the withdrawal can be placed in cold storage for extra protection until deposits open in Phase 1.5. If you lose the withdrawal key, you’ve lost access to all your funds.      Decentralized staking allows the user to determine the future of their deposits. You never surrender control of your keys to anyone else. The trade-off comes in technical risk which falls squarely on your own shoulders. In other words, you need to know what you’re doing, technically speaking. If you deposit to the wrong contract, for example, it’s on you.      Still, you may not have the internet connectivity needed to validate the Beacon Chain or the technical know-how. Luckily, options exist: There are at least 30 providers staking providers including mainstream exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken, according to staking firm Stakefish.    Staking-as-a-service    Most centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken are custodial staking services. That means you deposit the minimum 32 ether to participate and let them set up a validator on your behalf. They also hold your validator key.      Custodial services have their place, but they also carry a different risk profile because of their centralized nature. Validating with a service means you are trusting them not only to run your set up correctly, but also to honor the initial staking agreements down the road.      Although staking with a custodial firm is always alluring, given the ease of use, you necessarily open yourself to a new set of risks.      In fact, a staking service was one of the first validators to be slashed following the launch of the Beacon Chain on Dec. 1. Staking service Ankr had10 validators slashed for “surround voting,” wherein a validator publishes a “vote within the span of another of its votes,” according to Run Time Verification. The penalty for being slashed, in this case, is not only a forfeiture of a small amount of ETH, but being booted from the validator queue until deposit withdrawals are available in at least a year or more. Ouch!      A general trend worth watching is the network participation rates and penalties compared between custodial and noncustodial node services. While custodial services will likely have more stable setups, those who went through the trouble of personally setting up a device probably share higher enthusiasm for Eth 2.0 as a project, which may translate into better maintenance going forward.

42405577,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAed713,1608116187,Bitcoin Hits 2-Week High Above $19.7K,"Bitcoin has breached the tough hurdle of $19,500 and jumped to two-week highs on Wednesday.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value reached as high as $19,874 during the European trading hours. That's the highest level since Dec. 1, when bitcoin hit its all-time high of $19,920, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      It remains to be seen if bitcoin can hold ground above $19,500. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to establish a foothold above that level since Nov. 22, courtesy of profit-taking by some investors. Forcing the much-anticipated breakout above the psychological hurdle of $20,000 may be an uphill task for the bulls in the short run because there are still large sell orders on the road to $20,000, as discussed Tuesday.      That said, the long-term bullish case for bitcoin, a widely touted hedge against fiat currency devaluation and a store of value asset, continues to strengthen with observers predicting a deeper dollar decline in 2021 and a rising global stockpile of negative-yielding bonds.      French multinational investment bank and financial services company Societe Generale now predicts a 5% fall for the Dollar Index (DXY) in 2021 and more losses in the following year, according to efxdata.com. Other prominent investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan also expect the greenback to continue losing ground next year.      The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is hovering at a 32-month low of 90.20 at press time. The global reserve currency has declined by 6.5% this year, mainly due to Federal Reserve's money-supply boosting policies aimed to counter the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown.      Bitcoin has consistently moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index this year. Prominent public-listed companies such as the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy have adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset as protection against the dropping dollar.

The Miami-based company had purported to offer crypto-based financial products such as a debit card, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday.  It had touted an impressive executive team that did not exist, as well as falsely claiming it held 38 state money transmitter licenses, prosecutors said.  In July 2017, Farkas and his partners, Raymond Trapani and Sohrab Sharma, held an ICO, or token sale, raising the $25 million from investors who had believed Centra Tech's claims.  Farkas had previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in connection with the use of material misrepresentations and omissions to solicit investors to purchase securities in the form of the firm's tokens.  “Farkas and his co-conspirators created fictitious executives and fabricated business relationships with legitimate institutions to dupe investors into handing over millions of dollars for a fraudulent ICO,” said lan T. Graff, chief counsel to the acting U.S. attorney, in a statement.  Farkas will also face three years of supervised release and must forfeit $347,062 and a Rolex watch purchased with the proceeds of the scam.  The United States Marshals Service sold ether cryptocurrency seized from Centra Tech for approximately $33.4 million earlier this year.

In a notice Wednesday, the FCA said those companies that began operating after Jan. 10, 2020, will be granted temporary registration over the period from Jan. 9, 2021, until July 9, 2021.  The watchdog warned those cryptocurrency firms that had not applied for registration by Dec. 16, 2020, would not be eligible for the temporary regime.  Due to the coronavirus restrictions on visits and the “complexity and standard of the applications” received, the FCA said it has not been able to assess and register all the firms that applied.  Since July of this year, the FCA has been warning cryptocurrency businesses it will need at least six months to fully process applications before the hard deadline in January 2021.  There had been fears in the industry crypto firms might be left in no man's land as the deadline looked set to pass with many applications still waiting to be processed.  In the notice, the FCA also warned that those firms that have not applied by Dec. 16 must return crypto assets to customers and stop trading by Jan. 10, 2021.  Companies failing to do so will be breaking the law and ""are at risk of being subject to the FCA’s criminal and civil enforcement powers.""  The FCA requires any company carrying out activity related to crypto assets in the U.K. to register and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements.

According to a report by the Daily Beast on Tuesday, the White House Counsel's office is reviewing Ulbricht's case documents.      The Daily Beast cites three sources familiar with the matter claiming the president has been reviewing cases ahead of his next round of pardons and commutations before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.      A final decision on Ulbricht's case has yet to be determined, according to the report, but the notorious Silk Road founder reportedly has influential backers within the president's inner circles pushing for a pardon, the report said.      “I’ve had documents forwarded to my contacts in the White House as early as February,” said activist Weldon Angelos, a former music producer and ex-federal prison inmate, cited in the Daily Beast article.      Weldon was quoted in the report as saying he had been contacted by Ulbricht's family and was ""hopeful"" that Trump would commute his sentence in full, adding, ""This case has perhaps more support than I’ve seen in any case of this kind.”      Ulbricht was the founder and main administrator of the dark web marketplace the Silk Road back in 2011 that used bitcoin as its main payment method for dealing in illicit contraband including drugs and weapons.      The Silk Road used Tor anonymity to hide the location of servers and drew the ire of law enforcement as the site grew in popularity and notoriety.      See also: No Visits, No Parole: Ross Ulbricht Is More Alone Than Ever During COVID-19      After a long investigation, Ulbricht's online identity – Dread Pirate Roberts – was revealed and he was subsequently arrested, charged and convicted for money laundering, computer fraud and various drug charges.
