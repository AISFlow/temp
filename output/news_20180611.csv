The partnership between American Express, Ripple and Santander Bank that began back in November of last year is reaching new heights as the trio continues to advance blockchain solutions to foster secure, high-speed cross-border payments. In a recent job posting on the American Express careers board, a clear reference was made to the partnership as evidence of the company's focus on ""growth, new products and technology offerings to meet customer needs and build on the American Express brand.""  ""In 2018 we are introducing a [blockchain] solution with Ripple and Santander,"" the ad said, which appears to have since been edited out.  Both American Express and Santander Bank, since the advent of their partnership with Ripple, have been using startup's technology for the purposes of moving money across borders.  As reported by Smartereum, American Express vice president Colin O'Flaherty confirmed last week at Money 20/20 Europe that the firm would be using Ripple's xCurrent tool to enable global transactions at higher speeds and greater levels of transparency.  ""Ripple offers instantaneous, point-to-point conversations between the sender and receiver of funds. And that provides a real opportunity to alleviate most of the issues our customers are facing,"" said Flaherty at the event, speaking of the challenges small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) encounter when engaging in cross-border payments.

Investor Alistair Milne ran a Twitter poll on Sunday soliciting input on what people thought sparked the dip – in perhaps a sign of the times, half of the roughly 3,700 respondents blamed ""aliens"" with 9 percent and 12 percent blaming the Coinrail hack and the CFTC subpoenas, respectively.

WENN Digital – the company that licensed the photo-centric KODAK's brand for a cryptocurrency and associated digital rights management platform – announced Monday that it is working with Oak View Group to bridge the sports world with the upcoming KODAKOne platform. The idea is that fans and photographers at the six participating arenas, including the San Antonio Spurs' AT&T Center, can upload and register photos on the site.  ""We want to introduce the KODAKOne Platform to a creative audience that we believe will both benefit from its functionality and serve as early adopters,"" Jan Denecke, CEO of WENN Digital, said in a statement. The focus, he continued, is on ""paying photographers fairly and giving them an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new economy tailored for them, with secure asset rights management built right in.""  The platform, KODAKOne, and cryptocurrency, KODAKCoin, accordinghttps://www.kodak.com/us/en/corp/Press_center/KODAK_and_WENN_Digital_Partner_to_Launch_Major_Blockchain_Initiative_and_Cryptocurrency/default.htm to WENN Digital CEO Jan Denecke is ""all about paying photographers fairly and giving them an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new economy tailored for them, with secure asset rights management built right in.""  Photographers can register their work and store it on the KODAKOne platform. Then, the community of artists engaging with the platform are able to use the KODAKCoin as a means of payment either for licensing or sale under the protection of an encrypted blockchain that tracks ownership and enforces artist rights to content.  At the six participating sports arenas, fans will be encouraged to upload, register and share their live-event photos or videos on KODAKOne and have the opportunity to be rewarded with payments in KODAKCoin.  Dohnanyi said on the partnership that the venues would provide ""groundbreaking access to the world of sport and entertainment."" Denecke further added that the arenas were a ""natural"" place to start given ""the millions of fantastic live event photographs generated each year at OVG's Arena Alliance venues.""  The OVG Arena Alliance is a membership alliance of world-class venues reaching over 65 million consumers each year combined across major cities in North America.

As the British regulator for around 58,000 financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K., the FCA has issued formal warnings before on the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.  In this latest warning, the FCA addresses the banks specifically and urges greater scrutiny of client and customer activities if they are deemed to be dealing in what the agency calls ""cryptoassets.""  For bank clients who offer services to consumers in cryptocurrencies, appropriate steps to lessen the risk of financial crime include, ""carrying out due diligence on key individuals in the client business"" and ""ensuring that existing financial crime frameworks adequately reflect the crypto-related activities which the firm is involved in.""  While acknowledging that not all businesses and individuals holding or trading in cryptocurrencies would pose the same degree of risk, the FCA did flag a few ""high-risk"" indicators. These include a client using a state-sponsored cryptocurrency, ""which is designed to evade international financial sanctions"" – presumably a hint that trading Venezuela's petro token will get your account closed.  Another red-flag cited includes retail customers seen to send large sums to token sales, or initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to the FCA letter, these customers are at a ""heightened"" risk of investment fraud.  Not all motives for using cryptocurrencies are criminal in nature, it continues, but given the ""potential anonymity and the ability to move money between countries,"" the FCA expects financial firms to exercise ""particular care"" when dealing with cases involving cryptocurrencies.

Fifty-year-old Theresa Tetley, who worked under the name ""Bitcoin Maven,"" made at least $300,000 a year from trading bitcoin on Localbitcoins.com between 2014 and 2017, according to NBC Los Angeles. She also made transactions over that time worth from $6 million to $9.5 million.  Tetley has already pled guilty to operating an unregistered money transmission business and exchanging around 80 BTC for $70,000 in one transaction that prosecutors allege involved the proceeds of drug trafficking, according to court documents.  The ex-trader now faces a 30-month federal jail sentence for the crimes, if the government gets its way in court on Monday, although her defense team is pushing for a lesser sentence of one year. Federal prosecutors also hope to seize 40 BTC (currently worth $270,000), $292,264 and 25 gold bars seized by law enforcement agents in March, according to the report.  The Prosecutors Office said in court documents that Tetley's activities ""fueled a black-market financial system in the Central District of California that purposely and deliberately existed outside of the regulated bank industry.""  While the case is thought to the first of its kind in Southern California, according to NBC LA, other bitcoin traders have run afoul of authorities in other parts of U.S. in the last year.  A Detroit bitcoin trader was sentenced in December 2017 to 366 days in jail for similarly operating an unlicensed money services business. Sal Mansy funneled bitcoin transactions – also using localbitcoins.com – through a corporation he owned, ultimately conducting $2.4 million-worth of bitcoin transactions over a two-year period.  In another case linked to Localbitcoins, father and son trading team Randall and Michael Lord were last May handed down jail sentences of 106 months and 46 months, respectively, for running an unlawful money business. Michael Lord also pled guilty to a charge involving narcotics distribution.

A common thought experiment in the crypto community is to ponder how cryptocurrencies would fare in the event of another global financial meltdown.  It is not an idle question. There is a host of troubling developments in the global economy: the threat of a trade war, jitters in Italian debt markets, problems at Deutsche Bank and new emerging market crises in Turkey and Argentina.  Meanwhile, central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, are tightening or signaling tighter monetary policy. That's putting a brake on the huge gains that low interest rates and quantitative easing had bestowed on global markets in the eight years since the end of the last crisis.  With this combination of risk factors already in play, there's always a chance that some unforeseen trigger could set off another terrified rush for the exits among global investors.  What would the impact be on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Would their reputation as independent assets see them benefit from safe-haven inflows? Or would the market-wide reduction in risk appetite spread wide enough that crypto assets get caught up in the selloff?  Opposing scenarios  Some crypto hodlers salivate at the idea of market panic.  They contend that, unlike the 2008-2009 collapse, when Satoshi Nakamoto's newly launched cryptocurrency was essentially out of sight and unavailable to the hordes seeking a haven from the fiat world's chaos, bitcoin is now widely recognized as a more versatile alternative to traditional flight-to-safety assets such as gold.  In a crisis, they say, bitcoin could shine – as might other cryptocurrencies designed as alternatives to fiat cash such as monero and zcash. Unaffected by future monetary policy responses, immune from draconian interventions such as the Cypriot bank deposit freeze of 2013, and easily acquired, they could prove their value as digital havens for the digital age in such a moment. Accordingly, the bulls' argument goes, their prices would surge.  On the other hand, if there's enough of a market-wide departure from risky investments, it's hard not to see this sector being swept up in it.  Just as the most extreme gains in crypto prices in the latter part of 2017 were inextricably linked to the rapid ""risk on"" uptrend seen in stocks, commodities and emerging-market assets, so too a major selloff could easily infect these new markets.  Cryptocurrencies and tokens are perceived by most ordinary investors as high-risk assets – you buy them with money you can afford to lose when you're feeling upbeat about market prospects. When the mood sours, this class of investment is typically the first to be retrenched as investors scramble to get cash.  At $300 billion, according to Coinmarketcap's undoubtedly inflated estimates, the market cap of the overall crypto token market is more than three times its value of a year ago (even though it's down more than half from its peak in early January).  But it's less than 1 percent of the end-2017 market cap of $54.8 trillion for the S&P Global Broad Market Index, which includes most stocks from 48 countries. If risk-hungry investors are panicking and looking for things to dump – or for that matter if they're looking for something safe to buy – it won't take much of their funds to move the crypto markets, one way or another.  Low correlations  Backing the bitcoin bulls' argument is the fact that correlations between cryptocurrency and mainstream risk assets – the degree to which prices move in tandem with each other – are quite low.  A 90-day correlation matrix compiled by analytics firm Sifr put bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 index of U.S. equities at minus-0.14. That's a statistically neutral position since 1 represents a perfect positive correlation while -1 is a perfectly negative relationship.  But they say that in a crisis ""all correlations go to 1."" The panicked state of the crowd, with investors selling whatever they can offload to cover debts and margin calls, means that everything could go out with the flood.  Intellectually, too, that sort of wholesale downturn would comfortably stand as a logical counterpoint to the conditions seen last year when market valuations reached excessive levels. We cannot separate the flood of money that flew into crypto at the end of the year from the fact that eight years of quantitative easing had driven a ""hunt for yield"" in once-obscure markets as the return shrank on now pricey mainstream investments such as corporate bonds.  With bond funds paying little more than, say, 2 percent for years, bitcoin looked attractive to mainstream investors. When that artificially-stoked liquidity disappears, the reverse could happen.  Despite all of this, I do believe a global financial crisis could be an important testing moment for crypto assets.  Perhaps there'll be a two-phase effect. In the immediate aftermath of the panic, there would be a selloff as every market is hit by the liquidity squeeze.  But after things settle, one can imagine that the narrative around bitcoin's uncorrelated returns and its status as a hedge against government and banking risk would gain more attention.  Just like the mid-2013 surge in bitcoin that accompanied the Cypriot crisis' lesson that ""they can come for your bank account but not for your private keys,"" so too a wider financial crunch could spur conversation around bitcoin's immutable, decentralized qualities and help build the case for buying it.  The wider point here is that, whether it's as an aligned element that rises and falls in sync with the broader marketplace or as a contrasting alternative to it, cryptocurrencies can't be viewed in isolation from the rest of the world.

The e-voting pilot, which will take place between June 25 and July 1, has been developed as part of the city's efforts to adopt more blockchain applications and will tie in with a digital identity trial currently underway, the city government said in an announcement on Friday.  In July 2017, the city announced plans to launch an ethereum-based application called ""uPort"" to digitize local residents' ID information. The pilot phase got started in November and now has over 200 residents signed up for the new service, according to the announcement.  By using their digital ID, local residents will be able to cast votes in the one-off blockchain polling pilot, though the city government indicated that the vote is a ""consultative test"" and the results will not be binding.  The primary goal of the trial, it added, is to the review the security aspects of the polling system, examining whether the platform is able to achieve ""immutability, testability and traceability"" while maintaining voters' privacy.  The use case for blockchain in voting systems – with its potential to remove election fraud and provide immutable records – is one that has seen notable interest both from authorities at various levels of government, as well as within finance.  Nasdaq announced in November it was developing an electronic shareholder voting system based on blockchain for the South African capital markets, while Santander used the tech for shareholder voting at its annul AGM in May – possibly a world first.  Over in Russia, Moscow's municipal government announced in March that it was extending its use of a blockchain-based voting platform to the city block level. The Digital Home service allows neighbors in high rises to electronically vote and communicate on issues to do with building maintenance and management.  And, in the same month, the U.S. state of West Virginia launched a voting pilot project for absentee voters in the military by using a mobile application powered by blockchain technology, while Sierra Leone also notably piloted the tech in a presidential election.

According to a The Wall Street Journal report on Friday, the financial market regulator is demanding comprehensive trading data from Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken, which altogether serve as a base for the bitcoin futures price listed by CME Group.  Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said the subpoena was issued because the CFTC was ""upset"" that CME had not succeeded in negotiating with the exchanges for access to their trading data.  The exchanges rejected the request initially, calling it ""intrusive,"" according to the report. Although the exchanges in the end did submit some trading data, their compliance only came after CME had compromised by limiting the range of its access from a full-day's activity to just a few hours, and to limited market participants.  According to the report, the failure irked the CFTC, which supervises CME and gave it the green light in December 2017 to list bitcoin futures.  ""All participating exchanges are required to share information, including cooperation with inquiries and investigations,"" said a CME spokeswoman in the report.  News of the investigation first emerged on May 24, indicating that the U.S. Department of Justice had launched a probe into illicit trading practices in the crypto market in conjunction with the CFTC.

42401621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Fri,1528711224,$6K Next? Bitcoin Bear Market Back After 10% Drop,"The bitcoin market has come alive in the last 36 hours, with the bears gaining the upper hand and now aiming for fresh 2018 lows below $6,000.  The cryptocurrency dropped nearly 10 percent on Sunday, hitting a two-month low of $6,619 on Bitfinex, having spent the last two weeks trading in the narrow range of $7,000–$7,800.  Across the media, the price drop has been put down to a hack on South Korean exchange Coinrail, revealed Sunday, and renewed concerns regarding security at cryptocurrency exchanges.  However, a big move was expected anyway – as an extended period of consolidation or low volatility is often followed by a sharp move on either side – and prices started falling Saturday, so the theft of ERC-20 tokens at a minor exchange seems an unlikely cause.  Either way, the technical studies now spell trouble for bitcoin. The convincing move below $7,000 marks a downside break of the four-month-long narrowing price range and has opened the doors for a drop below $6,000 (Feb. 6 low).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,773 on Bitfinex – down 6.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  Weekly chart  The cryptocurrency created a pennant in the last four months, signaling that the sell-off from the December record high of $19,891 had ended at $6,000.  An upside break of the pennant would have signaled a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, prices closed (as per UTC) well below the pennant support yesterday, implying a downside break of the pennant pattern and a resumption of the sell-off from the December high.  The chart also shows a bearish crossover between 5-week and 10-week moving averages (MAs). The relative strength index is also biased bearish (below 50.00).  So, bitcoin looks set to extend the decline over the next couple of weeks. On the downside, support is seen at $6,000 (February low), $4,496 (100-week moving average) and $3,300 (trendline drawn from the August 2015 low and March 2017 low).  While the bears appear to be in control, minor corrective rallies could be seen, as the cryptocurrency looks oversold as per short duration chart studies.  4-hour chart  The extreme oversold conditions as shown by the relative strength index could put a temporary bid under bitcoin. However, the long-term bearish breakdown as seen in the weekly chart will likely restrict the corrective rally to around $7,200.  View  The pennant breakdown (bearish continuation pattern) indicates that bitcoin could drop below $6,000 in a week or two and may extend the losses to the 100-week MA of $4,496 over the following weeks.  A minor corrective rally to $7,000–$7,240 could be seen in the next 48 hours before further sell-off.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently located at $7,444, would abort the bearish view.

According to the document published Friday, a defining feature in the recommended framework is whether a token ""grants profits or governance rights"" to investors who obtain the token through an ICO.  While existing civil code should apply to all projects with tokens that can only be used as a payment tool or the right to access certain products, a variety of financial regulations should apply if a token grants profits or governance rights.  The finance ministry further dissects an ICO into several areas, including tokens that are issued, the entity that organizes the sale, whether it participates in secondary market exchanges and whether the ICO itself is a crowdfunding activity, etc.  It goes on to say that these aspects should be regulated by corresponding laws already in place in Lithuania, such as those governing securities, crowdfunding and financial instruments markets.  While the ministry states that the framework is not a formal piece of legislation, the effort aims to bring transparency to the industry so that ICOs can grow in a regulated environment.  ""ICO market has not been regulated yet. It has huge potential but there are risks that we must manage. We should make our efforts for Lithuania to become the main headquarters for those ICO project promoters who are willing to operate in a transparent and orderly legal environment"", Vilius Šapoka, Minister of Finance said in a statement.  In addition to financial regulations, the guideline also outlines thoughts from the country's auditing, taxation and financial crime investigation agencies regarding how tax and anti-money laundering rules should apply.

42401612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Fhs,1528704008,Crypto Startup Wala Is Reaching Africans with Ethereum Micropayments,"In several countries throughout Africa, citizens are spending an average of 27 cents to top up their mobile airtime, and they're using a crypto token to do it.  That might sound strange to many in the crypto industry, since the vision of today's blockchains allowing the movement of millions of microtransactions across the globe has proven a challenging one to reach.  Yet, a South Africa startup, Wala, is proving that a little ingenuity and an effective embrace of a nascent technology can make cryptocurrency a better payment mechanism than any of the traditional options many citizens of African nations currently have.  ""We really believe cryptocurrency is what is going to drive a financial revolution in Africa,"" said Tricia Martinez, the CEO of Wala, which raised $1.2 million selling ethereum-based ""dala"" tokens in an initial coin offering (ICO) in December.  And it seems like that is starting to play out.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Wala is now facilitating roughly 6,300 daily dala transactions for more than 57,000 wallet accounts across Uganda, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The vast majority of those transactions are micropayments under $1.  As such, the startup is displaying that not only are blockchain micro-transactions possible, but also the narrative that cryptocurrency is better suited for people in developing countries is right on the money.  Because before the token sale, Wala was facilitating customer transactions via its mobile app with the existing infrastructure in these African countries. To support their business models, though, local banks charge high fees – not just on transactions but for nearly every function, including customer inquiries on fraudulent account activity, Martinez said.  This was hurting Wala's customer base and the company's business model.  ""Zero-fee is the solution, but banks could not support this,"" Martinez continued.  Cryptocurrency offered an out by allowing them to facilitate payments across a peer-to-peer network with lower fees.  And with 100,000 merchants offering goods and services through Wala's platform, the startup has created a small-scale circular economy – something crypto enthusiasts have long vied for.  ""They can buy airtime, data, pay their electricity bills or their kids' school fees,"" Martinez said, adding:  ""Not only can they do it in their country, but they can do it across 10 markets. So if you are in South Africa and your mom lives in Zimbabwe, you can buy her airtime or pay for her electricity.""  Microraiden for micropayments  So how is Wala facilitating these microtransactions on the ethereum blockchain, which has been dealing with growing scaling concerns as of late?  Sure enough, according to bitinfocharts.com, this year ethereum transaction fees have ranged from between $0.17 to $4.15, which would make sending microtransactions like Wala users are facilitating too expensive.  But by using a technology called microraiden, Wala is able to get around those transaction fees.  Microraiden is a slimmed-down version of raiden, a technology similar to bitcoin's lightning network, which pushes transactions off-chain in an effort to increase scale. Unlike raiden which facilitates multiple channels and payments hopping bidirectionally, though, microraiden allows decentralized app developers to set up a channel that only receives payments.  As such, Wala takes in all user payments through that channel and then batches those transactions at some point to settle them onto the ethereum blockchain.  While that settlement process does incur a transaction fee, Wala is currently able to absorb that cost because of the money it raised through the token sale and its venture capital investment ($2.2 million total).  Still, even though the system functions for Wala now, the company is looking at other options should scaling become a problem.  ""We're also actually exploring the opportunity to work with a few different blockchains simultaneously,"" Samer Saab, Wala co-founder and COO, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""For us, it's too big of a risk to take to go all-in on any one blockchain.""  This is a strategy other token issuers that have launched on ethereum have taken recently, based on concerns over scale.  As Saab envisions it, multiple blockchains and scaling solutions could provide a ""buffer between consumers, people who are actually engaging with the blockchain via dala, and the effects that might be happening at the base layer.""  Centralized for now  Until then, though, another way Wala is getting around the costs and delays of transacting on blockchains is by centralizing their operations somewhat.  As mentioned, Wala acts as the intermediary party between dala users and the ethereum blockchain.  And for now, being that custodian – one that understands user habits because the team has lived and worked throughout Africa for years – for customers is useful.  ""At the rate at which our users lose phones, delete the app, share phones, do these things, it would be very difficult,"" Martinez said. ""You can't solve these problems unless you are living amongst your customers.""  Still, Martinez said the company has plans to slowly decentralize themselves out of the equation.  ""Our plan for decentralization is dependent on how ethereum scales in the future,"" she said, adding:  ""Our goal, on that path toward decentralization, is to enable users to control their own private keys in order to have more ownership and control over the entire process.""  Alongside this effort, Martinez is also looking for ways to make dala more attractive than cash.  ""Our biggest competition isn't the banks, it's cash,"" she said.  One way Wala is enticing new users is adding rewards they wouldn't get from using cash. For instance, users can earn dala by recommending the app to friends, plus later this year, the company will launch a 'microjobs platform,' which will offer dala for simple tasks like filling out research surveys or taking pictures.  ""We're trying to make a continent-wide currency,"" Martinez said.  Partnering with the incumbents  This year, Wala plans to expand to 11 countries, including the United Kingdom, through various partnerships.  Cross-border payments from expats in countries like the U.K. are an integral part of many African economies. But such remittance services are expensive and are often bogged down by delays.  According to the World Bank, Africa is the most expensive continent in the world to send money to. And Quartz reported remittance payments to sub-Saharan Africa can cost more than 9.7 percent of the sum received. That's where the global dala network comes in.  ""Consumers can receive remittances and then go purchase products in the app, or in person. So it's a fully functioning financial product a consumer can use instead of cash,"" Martinez said.  Even though Wala can afford to take on the costs of operation, for now, long-term plans require monetization at some level.  For now, the startup brings in revenue by buying commodities – like airtime – in bulk at a discount, then selling smaller chunks of these commodities to users at the market price.  But above and beyond that, Martinez said the company will have several new partnerships to announce this year. For instance, Wala is partnering with the British trading firm Block Commodities to provide the equivalent of $10 million in dala loans for subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.  The startup will reap a small percentage of those loan payments.  Wala plans to partner with a bank in Zimbabwe and the global microfinance bank FINCA to offer similar loan products, and possibly also savings services.  Whereas the U.S. dollar in the U.S. is a strong currency to invest, Martinez said currencies like the Ugandan shilling or the South African rand are not as stable and so could lead to problems when invested.  As such, Martinez concluded:  ""Enterprises are looking for more stable, alternative solutions so they can move value across borders and start investing in these emerging economies.""

According to its website, the exchange has already suspended services after it suffered what it calls a ""cyber intrusion,"" which resulted in a range of ERC-20 based tokens stolen from the platform.  However, Coinrail only provided the names of some of the tokens that were taken in the alleged breach without disclosing the exact amounts at stake. These included the NPXS token from the Pundi X project, ATC from Aston and the NPER project's NPER token.  However, a blog post published by Pundi X on Sunday suggested that the hacker may have stolen 1,927 ether, 2.6 billion NPXS, 93 million ATX and 831 million DENT coins, as well as significant amounts of six other tokens.  These assets in total were worth around $40 million at the time of the hack and have since dropped to around $30 million at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Pundi X's article suggested that following the hack, Coinrail alerted the project on Sunday to an ethereum address which is believed by Coinrail to be associated with the hacker. That address is now flagged as ""Fake_Phishing1432.""  Data from Etherscan.io shows the address tried to sell some 26 million NPXS tokens at IDEX, a decentralized ethereum asset exchange, right after it received 2.6 billion NPXS from another address that is also now labeled as a suspicious account – ""Fake_Phishing1431.""  Coinrail and Pundi X claimed that IDEX froze the assets sent from the Fake_Phishing1432 address upon investigation and the NPXS tokens were not liquidated.  In addition, transactions associated with Fake_Phishing1431 show it received a range of cryptocurrencies from a single address several hours before Coinrail reported the hack, which, besides ETH, NPSX, ATX, DENT, also included tokens from other projects such as Kyber Network, Storm, Jibrel Network and Tron.  Data from etherscan.io further indicates that, following the hack, while the NPXS was sent to IDEX, other stolen tokens appear to have been sent for trading to EtherDelta, another decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.  However, it remains unclear at this stage whether the assets had been liquidated or not. Coinrail could not be reached for an update, and EtherDelta has not yet responded to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Coinrail said on its website that 70 percent of its reserves are safe as they have been moved to a cold wallet which is not accessible through the internet.  For the 30 percent that were compromised, the firm said two-thirds of them are currently frozen. Meanwhile, it's still investigating the final third of those tokens with ""police, investigators, relevant exchanges and project developers.""  Data from CoinMarketCap showed the platform was ranked around 90th largest around the time of the hack, with 24-hour trading volume amounting to some $2 million on the site. Its data is currently not available on CoinMarketCap due to the system suspension.

In a piece published Friday by Yahoo Finance, Sheila Bair, the former chair of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), emphasized the pressing need for the Federal Reserve Bank to seriously consider the prospects of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).  She warned:  ""If it does not stay ahead of this technology, not only could banking be disrupted — but the Fed itself could also be at risk.""  A CBDC, in theory, would not have the same kind of culpability to large fluctuations in value given proper oversight and management by a centralized authority, she said. Beyond this, Bair points out that centralized digital currencies would be ""much more effective tools for conducting monetary policy to address economic cycles.""  Currently, the status quo allows the government to stimulate and slow economic activity in periods of recession and boom, respectively, through government-sponsored securities sales directed towards domestic banks.  But what if the ""FedCoin"" – a digital currency issued and backed by the Federal Reserve Bank, was held by all consumers? Then, changes to interest rates encouraging savings and in other times, spending, would be felt by consumers directly rather than through the policy changes of domestic banks.  Bair counters such a perceived benefit to centralized digital currencies by offering a potential downside – credit availability. Consumers wanting to hold all of their wealth in CBDCs would naturally cause credit deficits if parameters are not put in place ensuring banks and other financial businesses remain competitive against a hypothetical ""FedCoin"".  Bair's comments on the viable use of CBDCs by the central bank are timely as government officials around the world are also chiming into the conversation considering the merits of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in structure but state-controlled in vision.

42421800,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtfMD,1528689639,"Just Diversify? With Crypto Portfolios, It's Not So Simple","Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire.      With over 1,560 cryptocurrencies for investors to choose from, the abundance can seem overwhelming.  But it also raises an interesting question: How important is it to have exposure to a range of cryptocurrencies? Is it worth diversifying your holdings in order to mitigate risk? The work of Harry Markowitz might lead you to think so.  The Nobel Prize-winning economist, author of the classic 1952 article ""Portfolio Selection,"" devised modern portfolio theory (MPT), which stresses that diversifying assets is crucial. If you diversify enough, you will make risk go away and get the mean. Time and time again, Markowitz's research has shown that investors can assemble the perfect portfolio.  Indeed, recently published research by the Bocconi Students Investment Club at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy, showed that applying the MPT framework to crypto beat all other portfolios, at the cost of a greater volatility.  The investment club wrote:  ""Our findings, consistently with MPT, are that portfolio variance can be significantly lowered by exploiting low covariances between coins.""  In this way, it's a validation of the idea that 50 to 60 percent of a crypto portfolio should be core holdings of the two largest coins by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether. Alternatives, the thinking goes, should be added only after.  Jeffrey Van de Leemput, a co-founder of Cryptocampus, a crypto mentoring group, says diversifying your portfolio is very important. Not only will this mitigate risk but it can also substantially increase the reward factor of a portfolio.  ""Personally, I like having 80 percent large caps and 20 percent small caps mixed in for performance,"" says Leemput.  All go down together  But this risk mitigation strategy may be hard to pull off in crypto. When we saw the price of bitcoin plummet earlier this year, it dragged all the other cryptos' prices down too.  Hence, some disagree with Markowitz's theory, or at least its applicability to the brave new world of cryptocurrency.  Dejun Qian, founder of the FUSION Foundation, a public blockchain project, says diversification could help to increase the possibility of finding a good bet. He warns that in this market, 90 percent of the projects will die in the future. Diversifying will help us to capture that 10 percent.  The fun part is hunting for those golden nuggets – the initial coin offering (ICO) tokens and small caps that you believe will have the potential to succeed in the long run. But in most cases, diversification doesn't help with limiting risks because cryptocurrencies have repeatedly entered periods where they move in tandem, Qian said.  And it bears repeating that in this market the risk is high and crypto investing is not suitable for every investor. Do your own research.  That includes at least entertaining the arguments of so-called maximalists, who claim that there can only be one winner in cryptocurrencies (whichever one they've invested in, naturally), because money relies on network effect.  Maximalists can be rude and clannish, especially on Twitter, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And if they're right, diversification is just ""spraying and praying.""  Going mainstream  Then again, stocks and bonds aren't riskless either, and even some Wall Street analysts say crypto itself could serve as a diversification play for mainstream investors.  JP Morgan strategist John Normand examined the potential role of cryptocurrencies in diversifying a global portfolio in a 71-page research report on cryptocurrencies published in February.  He wrote:  ""Given both their high returns over the past several years and their low correlation with the major asset classes, offsetting some of the cost of high volatility. If past returns, volatilities and correlations persist, CCs could potentially have a role in diversifying one's global bond and equity portfolio.""  Qian observes that we have seen the market cap of cryptocurrencies soar from no more than $1 billion to $700 billion early this year (though it was down to $329 billion at the beginning of June). No one can deny this market is becoming more and more important. But it remains very small compared to the fiat currency market.  ""Along with this exponential growth, having some cryptocurrencies in someone's investment portfolio not only can help him catch the return from this booming but also can help him to understand more about this new world,"" says Qian.  Summing up, Markowitz's MPT is for risk-averse investors.  It is a well-known investment strategy which guides investors to combine a portfolio of assets with returns that are not always positively correlated in order to lower portfolio risk without sacrificing return. But be warned that crypto is not yet a mature asset class and hugely volatile therefore correlation and patterns are difficult to predict.

County administration IT officer Vyacheslav Kovalenko reported that since the end of May, users who opened any page of the website were redirected to another malicious website that secretly launched mining software on their computers.  The malware had been active for 10 days before being removed Thursday, local news agency Gubernia.com reported. In addition to securing the vulnerability in their website, officials published a report recommending that users block pop-up windows in order to avoid similar risks in the future.  The website posts information about the county administration's work and official events and has a visitorship of about 600 visitors per day.  The incident represents one of the more notable – and local – occurrences of what has become known as ""cryptojacking,"" the act of clandestine mining that has been in the news numerous times in recent months.  In February, several employees at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for Experimental Physics (the main nuclear research body in Russia) were arrested at their workplace for mining on the institute's supercomputer.
