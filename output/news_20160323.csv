42398941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjK6,1458770322,Why Chronicled Believes Sneakers Could Be Blockchain’s Big Market,"Entering 2016, provenance – or the ability to ensure ownership and chain of custody – was named as a potential breakout use case for blockchain technology, and while this prediction has yet to come to pass, new startups are entering the market.  The latest to emerge on the scene is Chronicled, which has raised $3.4m to explore whether blockchain tech can be a value-add for the purchasers of collectible sneakers.  As described by The New York Times, the scene is one where ""mostly male, mostly teenage"" buyers quickly amass thousand-dollar collections. According to informal estimates, the secondary market for collectible shoes is valued at $1.2bn in the US alone.  But Chronicled is banking on the fact that this state of affairs will provide the best luxury goods market for its blockchain applications. Competitors have so far chosen to apply similar concepts in digital media and precious stones.  Chronicled CEO Ryan Orr told CoinDesk:  ""The challenge with an authenticity platform lies in getting to scale. Clearly customers could scan collectible items, men’s fashion, women’s fashion, with their smartphone, and know they would be getting a legit item. But how do you build a niche? We reviewed about 30 different market verticals when we launched the company.""  Orr said that, unlike other luxury goods marketplaces, the collectible sneakers market was appealing because it isn’t dominated by ""old white males"" or a market cycle that takes years to complete.  ""It’s a very fast flip, where you also have a mobile first market. It’s not a market like fine art where you have a five-year lag between the resale and you have to wait five years every time [a product] sells,"" he continued.  Orr also noted that the luxury sneaker market has a vibrant and fragmented sub-industry of buyers and sellers, with collectors often seeking to resell their purchases quickly after an initial sale. Forbes suggests that the going market rate on certain pairs of coveted sneakers can rise as much as 600% on top of already high retail prices.  ""It’s very vibrant secondary market, which allows you to prove out the value of the verification and provenance platform,"" he said.  Three-tier strategy  According to Orr, Chronicled is now rolling out a three-tier strategy to gain a foothold in the market, seeking to appeal to independent buyers and sellers, physical retailers, and also, major brands.  The cornerstone of the company’s offering is a custom chip, which holds a private key that creates a blockchain-based record.  ""With the encrypted chips we put into the luxury items, we have an unhackable link between the blockchain and the physical item. Whereas as if you just have a digital record of an item without a unique ID, without encrypting a link between the item and the record, you really haven’t solved the problem,"" Orr said.  At scale, Chronicled’s main product will be selling the chips as well as an accompanying data and analytics suite so that retailers and brands can see data on product and consumer patterns. However, to begin, it is taking a more boots-on-ground approach to the market.  For example, Orr said that the startup is authenticating sneakers at sneaker conventions, where it will have a team of authenticators that can tag legitimate shoes and help users learn to transfer their authentic sneakers via the Chronicled app.  ""We have to do it in person, one of our authenticators has to physically inspect the sneaker, the information on the tag, the box, the receipt, and if there’s any question about the authenticity, we won’t provide an authenticity tag,"" Orr explained.  In later stages, Chronicled will seek to have retailers affix its tags to collectible shoes at the point of sale, and or have manufacturers install the chips directly in the items.  No chosen blockchain  Perhaps surprisingly, Orr indicated that Chronicled has not yet chosen the blockchain platform it will use to support the service.  ""As an executive team, we've made the decision to wait until we have enough convergence to announce a particular blockchain layer,"" he explained.  Orr said that Chronicled has so far built prototypes for its technology using the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, and that it has also explored using more permissioned distributed ledger-based systems.  Notably, Orr’s background is in the Ripple community, where he launched CrossCoin Ventures, a startup incubator focused on blockchain technology in 2014.  Still, Orr isn’t worried as he said that Chronicled currently has a ""logic layer"" it can apply to any blockchain.  ""We feel like this moment is a lot like the period in the early 2000s in search, it wasn’t clear who was going to win,"" he remarked, adding:  ""We want to wait longer from a convergence standpoint so we can make a logical decision on behalf of our partners.""  Consortia strategy  Going forward, Orr said that Chronicled is looking for additional ways to reach a critical mass with its core product offering, and that the consortia model is one such idea it investigating.  Orr said that Chronicled could seek to gather a collective of major retail brands, chip companies and payments companies together to explore blockchain applications, similar to the path to market R3CEV has explored with major banks.  “We’re open to partnerships with brands, chip companies and other players in the blockchain space around luxury,” Orr said.  Such an approach, Orr suggested, could lead Chronicled to position its technology as an open registry for authentic products, one that would have the value of boosting engagement and reaching customers digitally.

42398944,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjN3,1458768153,9 Myths Surrounding Blockchain Smart Contracts,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based entrepreneur, Ethereum Foundation advisor and advisor to Consensus 2016, CoinDesk's flagship conference. He is also the author of the upcoming book, The Business Blockchain.  In this feature, Mougayar explores and attempts to debunk some of the biggest misconceptions related to blockchain-based smart contracts.  Smart contracts are a key underpinning of blockchain technology, yet they are still misunderstood in many ways.  In the fullness of their deployment, they will be no less revolutionary than the invention of the HTML markup language that allowed information to be openly published and linked on the Web. Smart contracts promise to program our world on the head of blockchains, and potentially replace many functions currently executed by expensive or slow intermediaries.  Historically, the concept was first introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994. Smart contracts then had a long gestation period of inactivity and disinterest, because there was no platform that could enforce them, until the advent of blockchain technology in 2009. Now, smart contracts are entering their prime, especially since Ethereum has popularized them further by making their programming a basic tenet of their blockchain's power.  Like any new buzzword, the more a term gets popular, the more it spreads around. The more it will get used, but also misused and abused. It will mean a lot of different things to different people.  Here’s a list of 9 misconceptions about smart contracts, and my efforts to debunk and explain away those misconceptions:  1. Smart contracts are the same as a contractual agreement  No. If we stick to Nick Szabo’s original idea, smart contracts help make the breach of an agreement expensive because they control a real-world valuable property via ""digital means"".  So, a smart contract can enforce a functional implementation of a particular requirement, and can show proof that certain conditions were met or not met.  These can be fairly strict implementations, eg if a car payment is not made on-time, the car gets digital locked until the payment is received.  2. Smart contracts are like Ricardian contracts  No. Ricardian contracts, popularized by Ian Grigg, are semantic representations that can track the liability of an actual agreement between parties.  These can also be implemented on a blockchain, with or without a smart contract. Typically, multiple signatures are part of a Ricardian contract's execution.  3. Smart contracts are legally enforceable  Smart contracts are not law (yet), but they could represent pieces of a legal agreement. The legalities around smart contracts are a work in progress.  A smart contract outcome could be used as an audit trail to prove that terms of legal agreement were followed or not.  4. Smart contracts include Artificial Intelligence  Smart contracts aren’t really that smart on their own.  Smart contracts are really software code that runs on a blockchain, and they are triggered by some external data, that lets them modify some other data.  So, they are closer to an event-driven construct, more than artificial intelligence.  5. Smart contracts are blockchain applications  Smart contracts are usually part of a decentralized (blockchain) application. There could be several contracts to a specific application.  For example, if certain conditions in a smart contract are met, then the program is allowed to update a database.  6. Smart contracts are easy to program.  Yes and no. Writing a simple contract is fairly easy, especially if you are using a specific smart contract language (eg Ethereum’s Solidity), which lets you write complex processes in a few lines of code.  But there are more advanced implementations of smart contracts that use ""oracles"". Oracles are data sources that send actionable information to smart contracts.  7. Smart contracts are for developers only  True today, but we will soon see more user-friendly entry points that will allow any business user to configure them via a graphical user interface, or perhaps a text-based language input.  Ethereum's Mist browser is a step in that direction.  8. Smart contracts are not safe.  Not true. Even in the Ethereum implementation, smart contracts run as quasi-Turing complete programs, which means there is finality in their execution, and they don’t risk looping infinitely.  9. Smart contracts have limited applications.  Not true. Like HTML, the applications are limited by whoever writes them. Smart contracts are ideal for interacting with real-world assets, smart property, IoT, and financial services instruments.  They apply to almost anything that changes its state over time, and could have a value attached to it.  These issues and subjects will be discussed during an upcoming panel session at Consensus 2016.

42398939,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjI8,1458760690,Commerzbank: Future of Bitcoin is an 'Open Question',"Blockchain technology constitutes a ""genuine revolution"" in how decentralized systems are run, Commerzbank said in a March report.  Authored by global equities economist Peter Dixon, the report touches on both bitcoin as well as its underlying blockchain technology.  Exploring both the benefits and risks of the emerging technology, Dixon writes:  ""From a systems perspective, the blockchain is a genuine revolution. In theory, therefore, it offers the possibility of eliminating many of the risks associated with the conventional ledger system.""  Because one of the market's biggest risk factors – third parties – are removed due to the blockchain's decentralized nature, ""there are no intermediaries to introduce credit and liquidity risk which are thus virtually eliminated"", Dixon writes.  The report walks through the major aspects of bitcoin, including its distributed network of transaction verifiers, or miners. At the end, Dixon concludes that the question of bitcoin's future success remains unanswered.  ""The extent to which bitcoin will displace other currencies is open to question,"" Dixon wrote. ""Although it has become more widely accepted as a medium of exchange, its use as a store of value depends very heavily on its stability.""  He later goes on to write that the limited supply of bitcoins, as well as the speculative nature of the bitcoin trading market, could hurt the digital currency in the long term – but that the underlying blockchain tech could still see usage.  ""But the bitcoin debate has sparked a genuine revolution with the introduction of the blockchain,"" Dixon concludes, adding:  ""In the years to come, even if bitcoin is relegated to a footnote in monetary history, blockchain technology is likely to still be with us, even if some of the claims currently made for it prove to be exaggerated.""  The bank is one of more than 40 institutions involved in the R3CEV blockchain consortium.

42398951,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjRy,1458752317,ASX Affirms Blockchain Support Following CEO Departure,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) says it remains committed to its plans for potential blockchain integration after the CEO who helped lead the project abruptly resigned.  ASX's acting boss, chairman Rick Holliday-Smith, told Bloomberg that he views distributed ledger technology as a ""unique opportunity"" for Australia to become a leader in the financial technology space.  ""The ASX board is committed to the development of distributed ledger technology,"" Holliday-Smith wrote in an email to Bloomberg, according to a report today. A letter signed by the chairman, also dated today, revealed that the exchange expects to make a decision regarding blockchain's ""suitability"" by the middle of next year.  Yesterday, ASX announced in a statement that the company's previous CEO, Elmer Funke Kuppar, had resigned after four-and-a-half years on the job.  News of Funke Kupper’s resignation prompted multiple local reports to speculate that, without the person who had spear-headed the exchange's exploration to move some of its post-trade services to the blockchain, the technology’s role might be reevaluated.  As part of ASX's push into the blockchain industry, the exchange invested $10m for a 5% stake in Digital Asset Holdings in January. In total, Digital Asset eventually raised $60m as part of its bid to build blockchain services for securities settlement  The Australian exchange is part of a larger push by established and startup companies to embrace blockchain as part of post-trade services.  In January 2015, the New York Stock Exchange joined a $75m investment in Coinbase. By December, Nasdaq had issued its first private securities using Linq, a blockchain-based service, and Overstock's tØ platform received permission from the SEC to issue its own stock on the blockchain.

42398945,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjP1,1458744180,BitGo Engineers Launch Ethereum Wallet Side Project,"Amid escalating interest in the Ethereum blockchain platform, a group of software engineers at bitcoin security specialist BitGo have created a multi-signature wallet offering  The news follows the release of the first production version of the Ethereum platform, Homestead, last week. At the time, Ethereum's developers also released Mist, a more user-friendly wallet that would allow users to deploy smart contracts and store ethers, the digital currency that powers its applications.  Despite this progress, however, wallet development on Ethereum has perhaps lagged behind, an issue creator Vitalik Buterin recently told CoinDesk that he hopes the wider open-source blockchain community will help it address.  Signs are emerging that this is already happening organically.  Ben Chan, Mason Borda and Barath Chandrashekar, software engineers at BitGo, have released Ether.li, a multisig, two-factor authentication wallet for storing and transmitting ethers, the native token on the Ethereum network, in part to apply their expertise to this challenge.  ""There has been a lot more interest in ether recently,"" Chan explained. ""I, myself, got into ether pretty early on during the early stages of the project and I was looking to find a model to store ether. At the time, I could only find two kinds of wallets.""  The problem, Borda and Chan explained in interview, was that there were technical tradeoffs to running a wallet.  Borda said:  ""The desktop wallets that are available today look great and aren’t challenging to use, but there is a huge technological limitation, which is the requirement of the running node in the background. If you wanted a wallet accessible from any device or computer, there were single-signature wallets.""  Borda went on to argue that a user would be making a significant technological compromise by going with the convenient route of using an accessible wallet.  While Borda and Chan both work for BitGo, they were quick to comment that this product is not being released officially under the BitGo banner. However, Borda explained that the launch has the blessing of the startup.  ""[CEO] Mike [Belshe] encouraged us to launch this,"" he said.  Multi-sig and Ether.li  Creating a wallet on Ether.li takes only about one minute, a speed that's faster than bitcoin wallet users may be used to. With shorter block times, syncing the blockchain's full history with the wallet is therefore shorter.  ""When you sign up and create a wallet, it actually deploys a multisig contract onto the Ethereum blockchain,"" Chan said. ""This is a 2-of-3 multisig contract. This kind of model is standard in bitcoin.”  Unlike a single-signature wallet, a multi-sig, 2FA wallet requires that there be more than one signature approving a transaction. In the example of a 2-of-3 multisig contract, the first signature would be the user on the wallet, but the second might be a SMS text sent from BitGo.  ""When you want to make a withdrawal or send your funds, one of the signers for that contract, one signature would be the web client and then BitGo,"" Borda said. ""[BitGo] only applies that signature when we get a SMS from the user confirming that they want to send it.""  For example, if a user wanted to send Ether to someone else, they would initiate the transaction on Ether.li. They would then wait for a text message that asked for a code, which is the second signature. The user would put that code in and this would send the ether to its destination.  In the event that individuals lose their private keys he said: ""Multi-sig lets you get around that problem.""  Both developers did caution that this wallet was still in its early stages. In the FAQ, the team said:  ""Our decision to release this product was based on demand and out of a personal need for better security. However, we caution that this wallet has not undergone a security audit.""  BitGo and Ethereum  Ether.li is being released, the team says, out of a desire to get something out to the market in a relatively short timeframe.  Despite this, he said BitGo intends to apply its technology for use in the Ethereum space, provided a market continues to develop.  ""We consider ourselves a security company,"" Belshe told CoinDesk. ""Our work has been entirely in keeping the bitcoin currency safe and the same problems you have protecting bitcoin in an online world you have in protecting any cryptocurrency. We think we can provide value in the Ethereum space.""  While BitGo did not have anything official to announce at the time of the interview, Belshe did say that his firm would be launching an industry-grade Ethereum wallet ""very soon.""  He concluded:  ""We actually haven’t really planned to announce anything yet, but we’re going to be in the Ethereum space.""

42398952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjUv,1458739580,Dubai Government Looks to Blockchain Amid 'Smart Cities' Drive,"Autonomous construction workers, panoramic teaching environments, high-end spas with pharmaceutical capabilities – as envisioned by the Dubai government, all could be part of everyday life in so-called ‘smart cities’ by 2035.  Among the groups working toward this tomorrow today is the Museum of the Future, an ambitious project backed by the government of Dubai with the mandate to highlight how new tech breakthroughs are making these innovations possible. And if recent efforts progress as expected, bitcoin and blockchain could come to play a key role in driving the group’s work.  According to Museum of the Future Foundation chief operating officer Noah Raford, blockchain is now benefiting from a broader emphasis in Dubai and the UAE on how the delivery of government services could be revolutionized by new technologies.  Under the oversight of CEO Saif Al Aleeli, Museum of the Future recently unveiled the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a 32-member initiative designed to test and accelerate blockchain tech that he described as one of the most ambitious private-public sector collaborations.  In an interview, he sought to stress the scale of the group, which includes participation from Smart Dubai Office and Dubai Smart Government, similar efforts designed to pursue strategies for smart government.  Raford told CoinDesk:  ""Dubai has a massive investment in the smart city, to find out what does it take to run a 21st century government. There’s a larger story around this in the medium term, around just the digital transfer of assets. The potential is quite profound for [applications like] smart contracts. That’s where we see the longer-term impact.""  Among the GBC’s goals, Raford said, is to build a series of case studies that look at how blockchain tech can be applied to different industries from real estate to remittances.  To date, one case study has already been completed by local bitcoin startup BitOasis and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a regional commodities marketplace technology provider, that focused on blockchain identity.  Working ahead  While Raford sees potential for the tech, he framed recent news from the GBC as the first baby steps toward what could come to be a more developed effort.  The group just completed its second meeting, and Raford noted that its emphasis remains mainly introductory.  ""[The GBC] is about helping to educate the main stakeholders through private projects. I feel that digital currencies aren't futuristic, they're here right now, but that's not to say the council feels the same way,"" he said.  For example, he said some of the region’s largest payment processors and banks are on the council, and that they may view digital currencies as a potential threat to their business models.  Executives from the GBC, he said, will now meet quarterly, with individual working groups convening on a monthly basis to discuss subjects including regulation, pilot projects, conferences, workshops and other educational efforts.  He noted that the group has yet to set key performance indicators (KPIs) or other benchmarks by which to measure its efforts.  Perception challenges  Elsewhere, Raford acknowledged that the talks are influenced by the lack of awareness and misinformation surrounding the technology.  For example, Raford noted that the group is primarily focused on blockchains and distributed ledgers, at least in its outward branding, to alleviate concerns about know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).  Though he noted the digital currency may not be a direct part of its communications strategy, that does not mean [bitcoin] won't be discussed.  ""We're not shying away from the bitcoin aspect of it,"" he said.  Raford noted that the GBC has its roots in work conducted by the bitcoin community, adding that his own interest was sparked around the launch of auroracoin, which served as an interesting case study in how digital currencies could be disseminated in local jurisdictions.  At the time, Raford said he reached out to start discussions about the technology, but that these were ultimately shelved due to a lack of interest.  It wasn’t until one year later, he said, when future Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton would host the Dubai Bitcoin Conference, that he was compelled to seek out how the government may be able to support blockchain tech.  Raford noted that he was particularly interested in the non-financial applications that were beginning to emerge around the technology, noting that it ""wasn’t just financial assets"" being discussed by the industry anymore.  ""It shocked me how much the idea had evolved,"" he recalled.  Jumpstarting development  Ultimately, Raford voiced his optimism that the GBC would kickstart innovation in the region, even if it rendered the organization's future involvement unnecessary.  When asked about his long-term goals, he emphasized that the Museum of the Future is mainly focused on supporting initiatives and raising awareness.  ""Hopefully in five years [the GBC] will be out of business and [the technology] just goes forward,"" he said.  Still, he remains optimistic about what could be accomplished by the group given that he said Dubai has the advantage of moving fast in such explorations.  ""From a business model perspective, regulatory and social, all the people are exploring this from their different mandates,"" he said. ""Over time we hope Dubai and the UAE can become one of the leading regulatory examples in the region.""  He concluded:  ""We have heavy hitters in the room.""
