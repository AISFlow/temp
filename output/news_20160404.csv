42426759,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUnh,1459805539,The DTCC Blockchain Symposium in 12 Quotes,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) held a private blockchain event in New York last week, a move that coincided with the announcement it would embark on its first test of the technology with partner Digital Asset Holdings.  The all-day affair saw a number of new names debut at a blockchain industry conference, with marquee representatives from Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, the SWIFT Institute and the White House joining a cast of more experienced blockchain innovators from Chain, R3 and tØ.  Overall, while the event showcased the growing enthusiasm for blockchain technology among large financial incumbents, most conversations sought to temper this enthusiasm by underscoring the need for checks and balances as part of a transition to blockchain-based systems.  Though discussion of the technology and its impact was expansive, it was perhaps notable for a lack of discussion of specific technologies.  Conversations about blockchain protocols offered by Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple or Hyperledger were notably scarce, with the second half of the day seeing a more inclusive dialogue that touched on digital currencies and the bitcoin blockchain.  CoinDesk recaps the day’s major moments with the 12 most notable quotes:  1. “When the pressures of the financial crisis repeat [themselves], which at some point they will, a processing structure that operates on automatic would drive the financial system off a cliff. Preserving central command has to be part of an implementation scheme.”    With these words of warning, Donald Donahue, president and CEO of Miranda Partners, opened the day’s event with a focus on the ""big questions"" about the future of blockchain. In prepared remarks, Donahue cautioned that just because the blockchain could enable an automated economy, this doesn’t mean that the financial system should or must function this way.      His remarks showcased the long time horizons on which financial incumbents are beginning to consider the impact of blockchain, and foreshadowed widely voiced concerns about whether the tech would be implemented in a manner consistent with traditional financial values.    2. ""2015 [is] the year we elaborate on challenges. [In] 2016 we look for the solutions to come back.""    Lee Braine, investment bank CTO Office at Barclays, was vocal, if non-specific about his UK bank’s blockchain work during Donahue’s panel session. In the midst of what he called a ""perfect hype storm"", he said Barclays has been attempting to discern the best strategy through a number of investigations.      With this quote, however, he gave some insight as to why details about these efforts have been scarce, noting that due to the length of some of the studies, its research may begin to bear fruit in 2016.    3. ""We receive hundreds of millions of transactions every day, they go into the same exact systems, they validate within a second, it costs much less than a penny, and as [DTCC CEO] Mike [Bodson] indicated in his keynote, it runs in real-time as well. I’m not sure that is really the problem that needs addressing.""    As with many of the day’s speakers from host DTCC, managing director Robert Palatnick sought to stress that settlement, the company’s main line of business, perhaps isn’t the best use case for blockchain technology.      In this quote, he evoked the perceived issues related to the bitcoin blockchain, holding them up as a potential sign that the tech might not work as a replacement for major clearinghouses.      He continued by talking about the ""structural and regulatory challenges"" he believes are really slowing down the settlement process, suggesting that the firm may be equally willing to embrace non-blockchain solutions to settlement concerns.    4. ""If you came to me and said, 'Are you interested in tech that can solve back-office problems and requires a consortium approach?' I’m not interested in that as an investor.""    Matt Harris, managing director at Bain Capital Ventures, was mixed about his outlook on the industry as it shifts focus to ""blockchain"", noting that its preferred use cases aren’t the kinds of things that attract high-return investors.      Nonetheless, Harris said he has become convinced that the financial industry’s pain is acute enough for real change to happen. Further, he said he has been encouraged by the industry’s innovators to go against what might be his gut instinct.      ""Talent is being drawn to this space. You have the Ethereum team, the Eris team, these are not teams generally drawn to back-office tech problems,"" he said.    5. ""There are going to be pockets of adoption. There are some firms that are going to see this as more of a priority.""    The comment above was from Murray Pozmanter, managing director and general manager of DTCC’s systemically important financial market utility (SIFMU) businesses, who defined his thinking on blockchain tech.      While others predicted production pilots would go live in as soon as one to two years, Pozmanter said that innovations were likely to occur in “white spaces” where specific solutions could be crafted for niche markets.      Pozmanter held up DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset Holdings as a template he believes other market participants will follow.    6. ""I think Ethereum very much is bitcoin 2.0.""    IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo may have said it first, but the idea that Ethereum either is or isn’t an improvement or replacement for bitcoin became a notable side debate held over the course of the day.      Cuomo’s comments came amid a keynote address in which he discussed the explorations IBM undertook prior to its decision to embark on the open-source Hyperledger blockchain project. Also discussed was its use of ‘shadowchains’ or blockchains meant to run alongside existing legacy technologies.      Notably, Cuomo suggested the use of a shadowchain helped IBM reduce the amount of capital held up in dispute resolutions by 40%.    7. ""Certainly, if you have a business model that is dependent on you being the one updating the ledger, it asks some questions.""    The idea that incumbents would be safe from the impact of blockchain or could perhaps emerge from it unscathed was questioned most directly in a “lunch debate” featuring Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne and Nasdaq head of blockchain strategy Fredrik Voss.      Though there was disagreement between the large US stock market operator and the upstart CEO seeking to reimagine capital markets, Voss agreed with Byrne that the tenor of the conversation thus far had perhaps been misleading.      Still, he was coy in his remarks about Nasdaq’s trials, indicating his company ""doesn’t have enough evidence"" to suggest blockchain won’t fulfill its promise, which in turn has lead it to continue its activities in the space.    8. ""The way we have our system, regulators can see down to the lowest level.""    Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has historically been reticent to discuss tØ’s tech, preferring to use the blanket term ""blockchain agnostic"" when asked, but he opened up when pressed on the day's panel.      tØ, Byrne said, has built a top-layer blockchain system that can interface with any blockchain, but that today uses the bitcoin blockchain as a way to ensure the veracity of its data.      Notable, however, was this quote, which gave insight into how the platform is being built in a way to ensure the requirements of regulators are respected as these innovations roll out.    9. ""Not everyone gets to win. This is not a faster email server, this is a technology where people will go away.""    Normally a favorite of financial incumbents, Chain CEO Adam Ludwin stirred the room with this quote, which found him hammering home an earlier point raised by Nasdaq’s Voss.      On the panel, Ludwin discussed why he believes blockchain pilots will launch this year, but that the full ramifications won’t be felt for a while. He said he expects the first blockchain networks to “appear modest” but warned incumbents not dismiss trials by ""a few banks or institutions"".      Those who fail to get involved, he forecasted, could come to regret this delayed action.    10. ""We have to not dismiss the idea that the world is ready for a decentralized digital form of money.""    SecondMarket founder and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert is known for his unabashed pro-bitcoin approach, one that derives from what he has long heralded as its ability to serve as a unique asset class.      As with many recent events, Silbert has found himself increasingly at odds with panelists who he inferred have been all too eager to write off bitcoin, the oldest and longest-running implementation of blockchain technology.      Silbert stressed he believes that the killer app of decentralized ledgers is the ability to “move money around the world”, and to change how global finance works fundamentally.    11. ""The idea that the industry as a whole is trusted by the public is not that strong. Bernie Sanders has raised millions on one particular story, and that is that Wall Street is stealing from it.""    Author and Australia native Michael J Casey didn’t shy away from talking US politics in his one-on-one conversation with DTCC CIO Robert Garrison.      Onstage, he noted that while the day’s discussion was perhaps respectful of the achievements of the financial industry, the general public may be willing to side with innovators seeking to disrupt it.    12. ""Please say I’ll have a job.""    If all jokes are based on some truth, then there may have been no more telling moment than DTCC president and CEO Michael Bodson’s quip about his first conversation with Digital Asset’s Blythe Masters.      During a fireside chat, Bodson perhaps stole the show with the candidness of his remarks. In another notable anecdote, he recalled a sleep-deprived encounter with a representative of Australian regulator ASIC, who had asked him “What the hell is a blockchain?” six months earlier.      While humorous, the remark underscored the speed at which financial regulators, and financial incumbents, have needed to get up to speed with the technology.

42426764,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUth,1459798546,Decentralized Bitcoin Market OpenBazaar is Now Live,"The developers of OpenBazaar, the decentralized e-commerce protocol, have released the first live version of the software.  Now available for download  , OpenBazaar enables peer-to-peer digital commerce, with bitcoin used as a payment method – akin to a distributed eBay-style marketplace that uses the digital currency. OpenBazaar grew out of an earlier project called DarkMarket which aimed to facilitate decentralized online commerce.  The release comes after a public testing period that saw a variety of storefronts created using the experiment-focused bitcoin testnet for transactions. The developers said today that this test period resulted in more than 25,000 downloads worldwide (across 126 countries) and more than 3,000 vendors created.  ""Starting today, anyone in the world with access to an Internet connection can use bitcoin and OpenBazaar to exchange goods and services freely. We can’t wait to see how people will use this tool,"" project lead Brian Hoffman said in a statement.  The developers behind the OpenBazaar raised $1m in capital last year from venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures as well as angel investor William Mougayar, forming a startup called OB1 to oversee development and create services aimed at OpenBazaar users.

42426746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUVh,1459796940,Court Takes Control of Digital Currency Exchange Cryptsy,"A Florida court has frozen the assets of the digital currency exchange Cryptsy and placed it under receivership, months after it collapsed amid claims that it had been the target of a hack.  The court-appointed monitor, James Sallah, was selected after a request by the plaintiffs in a class action law suit filed against the exchange in January.  That lawsuit stemmed from problems with customer fund withdrawals that had worsened for months before withdrawals and trading activities were suspended entirely. Prior to its shutdown, Cryptsy said that it had outstanding customer liabilities of nearly $10m in bitcoin.  According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, Sallah was given administrative control over the assets and management of Project Investors, the operator of Cryptsy.  Approval of the receivership request followed a 28th March hearing at which the legal representatives of Lorie Ann Nettles, the wife of CEO Paul Vernon and one of the defendants named in the case, did not object to the receivership request.  The order states:  “The powers of the officers, directors, employees, and agents of Cryptsy are hereby suspended. Such persons and entities shall have no authority with respect to Cryptsy’s operations or assets, except to the extent as may hereafter be expressly granted by the Receiver. The Receiver shall assume and control the operations of Cryptsy and shall pursue and preserve all of its claims.”  Notably, Vernon has not been served in the case nor has he responded to it in court. Vernon, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, told CoinDesk in January that he was traveling in China.  The exchange is currently offline, with a notice stating that it is in under maintenance.  Under receivership  The order grants the receiver power to take control of “all cryptocurrencies, monies, funds, property, and other assets” and to oversee any claims against the exchange. The order prohibits anyone with control of Cryptsy assets from selling or transferring them.  Sallah is also empowered to subpoena information related to the company, and the defendants named in the case are ordered to provide accounting details dating back to January 2013.  Further, Sallah will submit a report on the company’s viability and his recommendations for its future within thirty days. In December, CEO Vernon told a Florida divorce court that he expected Project Investors to fail as a result of “a downturn in profits”.  Sallah also has the power to direct the business activities – or closure – of Cryptsy, depending what happens in the weeks ahead. Past examples of corporate receivership in the bitcoin space include Butterfly Labs, which was placed in temporary receivership in late 2014 following a request by the Federal Trade Commission. Butterfly Labs settled claims against it earlier this year.  Attorney David Silver, representing one of the two law firms involved with the suit, told CoinDesk that the court approval starts a new phase in which an accounting of the exchange will be performed.  “This is just a slow moving process that unfortunately our clients were involved with, and like any investigation we have to get all our facts in a row, we have to cross our T’s and dot our I’s to make sure we’re doing this in a process that’s court approved,” he said. “This is one step in that approval process.”  The full court order can be found below:    2016-4-4 -- De 33 - Order Appointing James Sallah as Receiver-Corporate Monitor for Cryptsy    Image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/04/court-takes-control-of-digital-currency-exchange-cryptsy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46c28bfd8edac4cb130fc6efd3e16474342ca532-2560x1810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUbh,1459792849,Why Bitcoin is Better for Crime Fighters Than Criminals,"Jason Weinstein is a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice in charge of cybercrime and organized crime. He is the Director of the Blockchain Alliance and a member of the advisory boards of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center and BitFury  In this opinion piece, Weinstein discusses why he believes the misconception that bitcoin is ""anonymous"" has hidden the fact that the technology actually better meets the needs of law enforcement.  Here’s a newsflash: Bitcoin has an image problem.  If you ask the average person what words come to mind when they think of bitcoin, three of the most common responses will likely be ""anonymous"", ""untraceable"" and ""a currency for criminals."" But all of these common ideas about bitcoin are actually misconceptions.  In fact, every single one of them is wrong.  This may just be a problem of perception, but it can have very real consequences, as it can impact the attitudes of investors, lawmakers, regulators, enforcement agencies and the public toward this technology.  We need to deal with these perception issues head-on.  New twist, old problem  Any technology worth adopting is adopted early by criminals. But, law enforcement has a long history of adapting in order to pursue criminals or terrorists who use ""new school"" technology to commit ""old school"" crimes.  They’ve done it over and over again.  From pagers to burner cellphones to email to online chat to mobile devices to PayPal, just to name a few examples, law enforcement consistently has had to evolve as new technology designed for legitimate purposes is used to facilitate criminal activity.  There are many examples of this phenomenon, but perhaps none greater than the Internet itself. And perhaps the greatest challenge for law enforcement in investigating crimes involving the Internet is – wait for it – anonymity. Indeed, the problem of attribution – often referred to as ""putting fingers at the keyboard"" – is the most difficult part of any investigation of crime facilitated using online means.  Every day, agents and prosecutors have to figure out ways to tie a string of numbers and characters – whether that’s an ICQ chat name, IP address, MAC address or even an email address – to a particular human being. That process is made harder when that human being uses multiple IP addresses or chat names or adopts anonymizing techniques such as proxies or TOR.  It also doesn’t help law enforcement with attribution that Web-based communications providers don’t have 'know-your-customer' requirements, so agents can’t necessarily have confidence in the accuracy of whatever user information is on file.  Yet, agents and prosecutors work to overcome those challenges with great success, and the solution often lies in analyzing data from multiple sources to try to zero in on the particular bad actor.  Bitcoin presents just the newest twist on that old problem.  It’s ironic that even though criminal and terrorist use of the Internet is rampant – and was from the very beginning – nobody thinks of the Internet as the ""network of criminals"".  Instead, people think of the Internet as a place where we all work, shop, socialize, communicate, consume entertainment and learn. But it’s a measure of the extent of bitcoin’s image problem that every time a cybercriminal commits a ransomware or other cyberattack and happens to use bitcoins as a medium of payment, the case is characterized by the press and policymakers as a bitcoin problem and not an Internet or cybercrime problem. (For more on this issue, see Peter Van Valkenburgh’s excellent post at Coin Center).  The attribution challenge presented by bitcoin is far from unique. What is unique is that bitcoin actually provides some attribution advantages.  So wait, it’s not anonymous?  It’s often said that bitcoin is not really anonymous, but rather pseudonymous.  What that essentially means is that a user’s bitcoin address is like an account number that stays with the user; if you can connect that address to a user, you can identify and trace all of the transactions in which that individual has participated using that address.  Indeed, if the individual uses an exchange or wallet service to access the blockchain, then the bitcoin address is essentially like a bank account number, because the exchange or wallet service will maintain records linking the address to a particular individual, much like a bank maintains records establishing the owner of a bank account.  That’s not a perfect analogy, because one individual could have any number of bitcoin addresses, but is likely to have a limited number of bank accounts.  But as with banks, law enforcement would be able to obtain information about the address user by serving a subpoena or other lawful process. That’s one of the reasons we have seen, and will continue to see, enforcement actions taken at the ""on ramps"" and ""off ramps"" of the blockchain – to incentivize exchanges and wallet services to maintain compliance, so data will be there when law enforcement serves the subpoena.  But what if someone obtains bitcoins through a source other than a licensed exchange? What if the individual uses techniques for enhancing anonymity – like multiple addresses, or mixing services? Even then, the individual is not truly anonymous.  Of course, the individual may leave a trail when exchanging bitcoins (however obtained) into fiat currency. But the individual may also leave a trail while engaging in transactions on the blockchain.  There are existing and rapidly improving techniques to help link those users to their bitcoin addresses and transactions using, among other things, analysis of transaction patterns to make connections among multiple addresses used by the same individual; mining (no pun intended) of data from social media and public sources; and analysis of IP addresses used to conduct transactions.  As for mixing services, individuals who rely on them are making a leap of faith, trusting that the service won’t cheat them and that the service isn’t keeping records that could be obtained by law enforcement. And of course, the bitcoins you get back from the service could themselves be dirty and be on law enforcement’s radar.  And here’s the real attribution advantage: the traceability, searchability, and permanence of the blockchain.  Whether a law enforcement agent identifies the owner of an address tomorrow or two years from tomorrow, the agent will then be able to trace back every transaction involving that address, all the way back to the beginning.  Moreover, because the ledger is publicly accessible, law enforcement does not have to worry about what type of legal process is required to access the data. And because the ledger is borderless, law enforcement can get the data without having to go through a foreign government. That gives law enforcement the data it needs to ""follow the money"" in a way that would never be possible with cash.  Law enforcement is still getting up the learning curve on bitcoin, although the case against Carl Force IV, the former DEA agent convicted of stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation, demonstrates that even at this early stage, law enforcement has already developed an impressive capacity to follow the money using the blockchain.  And law enforcement’s capabilities in this area will only improve over time, particularly as new analytics tools are developed.  Of course, innovators are coming up with new ways to increase privacy, whether on the bitcoin blockchain or through other types of cryptocurrencies, so law enforcement will continue to have to evolve and adapt to meet the challenges of new technology.  In the early days of commercial use of the Internet, law enforcement agencies got help from Internet companies to help them learn how the technology worked, so they could improve their capacity to go after criminals who misused that technology to facilitate their crimes. That effort went a long way toward dialing down concerns about the Internet. And through the Blockchain Alliance, we are trying to do the same thing for the blockchain.  The more people learn about bitcoin, the more they will realize that it’s friendlier to cops than it is to criminals. So if we put concerns about bitcoin in historical perspective, and if we confront fiction with facts, we can change these common misperceptions.  That’s an important step on the road to ""making blockchain real"".  Jason Weinstein is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join him at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May.

42426743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUJh,1459787559,R3 Blockchain Consortium Partners With Microsoft,"The blockchain consortium led by R3CEV, a group of 42 global banks working on blockchain applications that includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and more, is now working with tech giant Microsoft.  The full partnership, which was first tested back in January with a smaller group of R3’s members, gives the consortium access to more than just Microsoft's platform of Blockchain-as-a-Service tools.  Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, told CoinDesk that the formal partnership came after a series of tests with other potential partners, including Amazon and IBM. A dedicated team of five Microsoft employees is now working directly with consortium members.  Cooper told CoinDesk:  “Throughout the experiments we started to realize that the level of expertise they gave us in terms of the man-power and the technology actually made them the ideal partner.”  Under the terms of the non-exclusive deal, Microsoft will provide access to 45 cloud-based tools on its Azure platform, including those created by ConsenSys, Ripple, Eris Industries, Factom, BitPay, and other startups working with the technology.  In addition to the software, Microsoft has set aside a team of “dedicated technical architects, project managers, lab assistants and support services” to work with consortium members around the world.  The partnership comes after 11 of R3’s consortium members, including Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Well Fargo, completed a test of private version of the Ethereum network using Microsoft’s Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform in January.  “R3 and member banks will experiment and learn faster, accelerating distributed ledger technology deployment,” said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of global business development at Microsoft, in a statement. “What’s more, our collaboration brings to light tremendous opportunities to rethink business processes and transform entire industries.”  In a separate blog post written by Johnson as part of the Microsoft Envision conference in New Orleans, she wrote that the partnership will help streamline back-office operations, “potentially saving billions of dollars.”  Over the coming weeks and months Cooper says he expect the full scope of the partnership with Microsoft will expand, depending on how the software company and the banking consortium work together.  Cooper said:  “Where this raises the stakes is rather than just a couple experiments we view this as a long term partnership that will expand.”  Image via R3",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/04/r3-blockchain-consortium-partners-with-microsoft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed984d19dbdc6a94d1d5d76d4deeb100893d7ccd-1259x594.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a new interview, Slater said that Hedgy has pivoted away from its original positioning as a bitcoin derivatives and smart contracts startup, aiming to recast itself as a blockchain applications development platform similar to Chain or Gem.  Hedgy raised $1.2m last April from a list of notable VCs including Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Tim Draper, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and Sand Hill Ventures.  At the time, the startup had sought bitcoin miners and merchants to use its tools, enabling them to lock in the price of bitcoin and shield holdings from volatility.  However, Slater said that demand for the product proved weaker than expected, and as such, the startup set its sights on new markets.  Slater told CoinDesk:  ""We found that there’s a lot more interest there and a lot less interest in the bitcoin product. For us, we see bigger opportunities in building general purpose blockchain applications.""  Slater declined to name the company’s clients, but said the startup is now 'blockchain agnostic', offering services for bitcoin, Ethereum and the still in-development Hyperledger blockchain project.  Hedgy, Slater said, has been increasingly looking into Ethereum due to what he called the ""inertia behind the platform as well as its technical advantages.  “The demand is there, at least the developer mindshare is in Ethereum,” he said.  Slater said further announcements on the future of the startup would be forthcoming.
