42402139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3XPp,1541624770,"As Plasma Stalls, Snarks Become New Hope for Scaling Ethereum Now","Efforts to scale ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, are growing more varied as one much-anticipated solution encounters pitfalls amid its continued development.  At the forefront of this transition has been plasma, a concept widely heralded as ethereum's best bet for short-term scaling. Already, researchers behind the tech have built five distinct versions of the protocol – but within these multiple iterations, there's evidence that work isn't proceeding as originally hoped, with little actionable code being put together well over a year since its inception.  As plasma slows, however, attention is being drawn to zk-snarks – a form of cryptography pioneered by privacy-centric cryptocurrency zcash – as another path forward. In fact, startups are already embracing the tech, which allows developers to aggregate transactions into batches, as they look to scale the network amid other efforts to expand, upgrade and grow ethereum.  For example, prediction market platform Gnosis is exploring the use of zk-snarks to underpin a decentralized exchange, in what is known as a ""snapp"" (snark dapp). Pseudonymous developer ""barrywhitehat"" has also used the technology to create ""roll-up,"" another snapp that can potentially be applied to ethereum scaling more broadly.  Vitalik Buterin, ethereum's creator, has even written about the potential of such an approach, stating that it could be applied to achieve 500 transactions a second in the short-term.  That's notable because, while progress toward ethereum's longer term, high-performance rewrite – Serenity (sometimes called Shasper and ethereum 2.0) – is continuing to proceed, developers are hinting the switch is still two years away. As such, developers are looking to more immediate options to cope with an increase in the number of users on the network.  Indeed, at Devcon4 – ethereum's annual developer conference – there was a palpable sense of excitement around zk-snarks and their applications. The event featured seven tracks dedicated to the tech and related systems, and Kelvin Fichter, plasma researcher at decentralized exchange OmiseGo, referred to the growing hype as a ""snark-nado.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Gnosis CTO Stefan George explained that what's compelling about the approach is not only does it have the potential to be more decentralized than plasma, but that it is ready for deployment in the near-term.  He told CoinDesk:  ""More and more people understand what the possibilities are. Even beyond zero-knowledge, it's also a great scalability tool that ethereum is missing, and we can use it without waiting.""  Plasma pitfalls  So, what's happening with plasma, exactly? Speaking at Devcon4, researchers gave their take on what's being built – and what's impeding progress.  Plasma was first conceived by Buterin and Joseph Poon, co-author of bitcoin's Lightning Network white paper, in April 2017, the idea being that scaling can be achieved by pushing the actual computation of smart contracts off of the main ethereum blockchain.  Since its release, various iterations of the scaling method have emerged, with a growing number of research teams and capital devoted to it. Still, each new plasma iteration reveals a new research problem that needs to be addressed, leading to multiple plasma variants that navigate deployment trade-offs in different ways.  For example, an implementation dubbed minimal viable plasma ""has time constraints, is horrible for UI, and is vulnerable to network congestion,"" David Knott, plasma researcher for OmiseGo, told the audience at Devcon4.  While one iteration of plasma – the so-called plasma cash – is usable today, it's difficult for users and developers to interact with. Similarly, because it relies on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to function, the design requires heavy transaction histories.  ""You still have to keep track of the value and have to be constantly collecting proofs of non-inclusion, and so when you transfer ownership of the NFT you have to transfer its history as well,"" Knott said.  With an endlessly growing body of research surrounding the idea, confusion about what the underlying technology actually is has pushed companies and research teams to behave asynchronously.  ""Plasma is a confusing term,"" Fichter said during his Devcon presentation last week. ""No one really knows what plasma is. The paper defines it as one thing, researchers define it as something else.""  As such, there's a push toward what Fichter called the ""holy grail"" of plasma research: a generalized plasma that seeks to combine elements – as well as the lessons learned – from all techniques.  ""We are really not close to generalized Plasma. I think a ton of time and money is going to be spent on this in the next months or years,"" Fichter said.  Snarks for scaling  And that's because, in order to function, plasma relies on what is known as an ""exit,"" which is how users extract funds from plasma and place them back on the blockchain itself.  Requiring complex game theory to function, this process can be unwieldy and complicated, whereas zk-snarks stand out for their elegant design. While plasma ""can become super complex,"" George told CoinDesk, ""with snapps we have a super simple architecture.""  Plasma also requires a centralized component in order to operate, George continued, as the off-chain component is managed by authorities in order to achieve higher transaction volume.  While on plasma, this is achieved in a way that is trustless – meaning that there's no risk that transactions can be faked – George said that this comes with another downside, as its centralization means it could be a potential shut down by regulators.  ""You have this operator, it is trustless not decentralized. It's pretty centralized, it is prone to regulation and so on,"" he told CoinDesk.  George plans to use the method as part of a decentralized exchange, or DEX, that could even have zero-knowledge properties. Named dFusion, the new DEX is expected to reach a proof-of-concept phase within the next three to four months.  Feedback loop?  Still, there's evidence that the two research streams – focusing separately on plasma and snarks – can actually loop back into each other as well.  For example, speaking to CoinDesk, Fichter said one of the most challenging aspects of plasma could be solved using the right application of snark technology.  Fichter introduced a new term – ""plapps"" – meaning that decentralized applications that run on plasma. These apps could rely on snarks in terms of how they verify transactions on the blockchain itself.  ""[Snarks] solve what we were solving with crypto-economic assumptions with just straight up with cryptographic assumptions. It means we have to worry about a lot less,"" Fichter said.  Additionally, in the future, zk-snarks could be used to make the plasma layer more private.  That said, solutions like barrywhitehat's roll-up and Gnosis' dFusion currently struggle with the anonymity aspect, due to the resources required to add a privacy layer. Currently, the scaling solutions are used for verification purposes only and don't come with additional anonymity benefits.  ""Purely zero-knowledge systems and making use of zero-knowledge systems in plasma it is still a little bit far away,"" Fichter told CoinDesk, adding:  ""There's work that remains on 'Do we make hash functions cheaper?' and once we get to that point, we are going to see an explosion of zero-knowledge applications.""

Christopher Giancarlo said Wednesday.  Speaking at the D.C. Fintech Week Conference at Georgetown University, Giancarlo highlighted distributed ledger technology (DLT) and how it could be leveraged to automate certain regulatory processes in particular, which he described as ""quantitative regulation.""  This automation, in turn, would allow the regulator to more efficiently oversee markets while reducing costs.  ""As we think about the application of [financial] technologies to trading markets, it is no leap of the imagination to consider how automation could help reduce cost and bring efficiencies to trade matching, processing, and clearing and settlement,"" he said. ""Indeed, when paired with systems inspired by DLT that standardize and distribute data to market actors – and even regulators – we begin to see a world where the majority of standard tasks are managed by machines.""  Giancarlo added:  ""We can also envision the day where rulebooks are digitized, compliance is increasingly automated or built into business operations through smart contracts, and regulatory reporting is satisfied through real-time DLT networks. The machines here at the CFTC would have the ability to communicate regulatory requirements and consume and analyze the data that comes in through such systems.""  Moving the CFTC to such a position would enable it to more quickly analyze data in real-time, which can then make it easier for the regulator to measure the impact of certain rules or actions that are taken.  Rules can then be modified as necessary to ensure an optimal outcome, he added, and cited speed limits as an example, saying speed limits are static.  ""The two regulatory objectives you're trying to solve for with a speed limit are safety and the efficient flow of traffic. If you actually had a dynamic speed limit that measured road and weather conditions (imagine a digital display), you might be able to slow the speed limit down if it's raining in order to better satisfy the safety objective or increase the speed limit on a sunny weekday afternoon when traffic is light to achieve a safe, but more efficient, flow of traffic,"" he explained.

42402111,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3V7A,1541612710,US Election Sees Crypto-Friendly Politicians Win Governor Races,"The U.S. 2018 midterm elections saw crypto-friendly lawmakers securing governorships in three states, while maintaining two others.  Three new governors and two incumbent are ranked as very crypto-friendly, according to data compiled by the Digital Asset Trade Association (DATA), a blockchain advocacy group. The organization sent surveys to most gubernatorial candidates, rating their blockchain-friendliness based on their responses.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, these new governors include Jared Polis (of Colorado) and Gavin Newsom (of California), both have whom been vocal supporters of both cryptocurrencies and blockchain more broadly.  Mark Gordon won his election in Wyoming, already an increasingly blockchain-friendly state, while Gina Raimondo and Greg Abbott won re-election in Rhode Island and Texas, respectively.  Polis, in particular, was a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives and has vocally called for the U.S. to take a leadership role in integrating and regulating the space.  His platform  even included a number of initiatives he intends to push for revolving around the technology, including improving digital voter protection and using blockchain to digitize government records and make them more transparent.  In a statement, Coin Center spokesperson Neeraj Agrawal said the advocacy group was happy to see Polis elected, noting his work on the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act in particular.  ""We are ... excited to continue our work with him and the Colorado Blockchain Council to promote sound cryptocurrency policy in the state,"" Agrawal said.  Similarly, former California Lieutenant Governor and now Governor-elect Gavin Newsom has been a longtime proponent of the technology, saying he was ""fascinated"" by it as far back as 2014. According to Digital Asset, he is in favor of blockchain-friendly policies to attract developers to the state, and supports creating a blockchain working group (although the state legislature has already passed a bill for one to be created).  Newsom is also in favor of formally allowing data stored on a blockchain to be admissible in court.  Texas Governor Abbott, who secure re-election on Tuesday, previously accepted bitcoin donations as well.  While maintaining less of a national profile, current Rhode Island Governor Raimondo similarly supports each of the above measures, according to DATA's research. She also supports legally recognizing cryptocurrency-related business transactions.  Perhaps more notably, she supports the idea of using a blockchain-based platform to administer public programs, such as issuing food stamps and organizing Medicaid, according to DATA.  However, incoming Wyoming Governor Gordon is perhaps the most blockchain-friendly lawmaker to take the reins of a state next year. According to DATA, he has stated that he is in support of exempting cryptocurrency-related business from state money transmitter regulations and exempting the purchase of cryptocurrencies from state sales taxes.  Likewise, Gordin has taken a stance against the idea of a state license for cryptocurrency transmission – such as the New York BitLicense – and is opposed to legislation that would require data to be deleted from databases such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforced by the European Union.

42402110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3V5C,1541605874,Crypto Exchanges Line Up to Support Bitcoin Cash's Hard Fork,"Six of the top 10 crypto exchanges by bitcoin cash (BCH) trading volume have announced plans to support the cryptocurrency's upcoming hard fork on Nov. 15.  Bitcoin cash's roadmap includes upgrades to its core code every six months, but disagreement over some changes to the network have raised the specter that two distinct branches of the cryptocurrency could take shape, given that two implementations – Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV – are being put forward by competing teams. While the outcome isn't clear, one scenario would see two separate cryptocurrencies arise from the fork.  As users will automatically receive an equal amount of the new coin to the amount held in BCH, it is important that their exchange is prepared for the event and will later allocate the new tokens.  A number of exchanges have now made clear their positions should a split occur, with OKEx, Binance, Bitforex and Huobi having all stated that they will ""support the hard fork."" Poloniex, a rank 51 exchange for BCH, stated more explicitly that it is ""prepared to support trading markets for both tokens.""  Coinbase was more reserved, saying it will support the current roadmap, but it added:  ""In the unlikely event that multiple viable chains persist after the fork, Coinbase will ensure that customers have access to their funds on each chain.""  In preparation for the event, most exchanges have said they will suspend bitcoin cash withdrawals and deposits soon before the fork to ensure customer funds are not at risk due to instability of the post-fork network(s). Users should take care not to deposit BCH during this period in such cases.  And it's not only exchanges that are having to take decisions over the potential creation of a new coin. France-based hardware wallet maker Ledger has said that, if the fork results in separate bitcoin cash blockchains, ""eventually, one of these would be the dominant chain, which we will evaluate to support again then.""  It's worth noting that Bitmex recently launched a fork monitor for bitcoin and bitcoin cash. The BCH hard fork is set to go occur on Nov. 15 at around 17:00 UTC.  Here's the current status of the top 12 BCH markets on CoinMarketCap regarding the hard fork at press time:  OKEx – support confirmed  BitForex – support confirmed  Binance – support confirmed  Digifinex – no statement  Huobi – support confirmed  Bitfinex – no statement  Upbit – support confirmed  HitBTC – no statement  Coinbase Pro – support confirmed  Bitbank – not confirmed  Coinsuper – support confirmed  GDAC – no statement  Wallets  Ledger – review confirmed  Forks image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/07/crypto-exchanges-line-up-to-support-bitcoin-cashs-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c160f5ad2cd3549d8d9cd2dba8944e751432bb28-1500x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402105,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3V0H,1541595944,Hackers Breach Popular Web Analytics Site to Target Crypto Exchange,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io was apparently the target of hackers who compromised a widely used web analytics platform this week.  According to a report from internet security firm ESET on Tuesday, bad actors compromised Ireland-based web analytics site StatCounter, in an attempt to steal bitcoin from the exchange's customers.  The attackers managed to inject malicious code into the script of StatCounter webpage, having also registered a domain very similar to the official one. The fake domain swapped two letters from the original to form ""StatConuter"", which can be difficult to spot while scanning for unusual activity, says ESET, adding that the domain had previously been suspended in 2010 for association with abusive behaviour.  StatCounter is used by more than two million websites, according to its own figures, and it provides statistics on billions of web hits daily. The fake account managed to get picked up by a number of sites, although Gate.io seems to have been the only target.  The report states that the script targets a specific uniform resource identifier (URI): ""myaccount/withdraw/BTC.""  ""It turns out that among the different cryptocurrency exchanges live at time of writing, only Gate.io has a valid page with this URI. Thus, this exchange seems to be the main target of this attack,"" it concludes.  The URI is notably used by Gate.io to transfer bitcoin from its own account to an external bitcoin address, according to the report. The hackers' script automatically replaces a user's bitcoin address with one belonging to the attackers.  As the malicious server generates a new bitcoin address each time a visitor loads the StatConuter script, ""it is hard to see how many bitcoins have been transferred to the attackers,"" the researchers say.  After being notified by ESET about the breach, Gate.io announced Wednesday that it ""immediately removed"" the StatCounter service from its site, and stressed that the users' funds are ""safe.""  CoinMarketCap data indicates that Gate.io is the 38th largest crypto exchange globally by adjusted trading volume. The firm's website indicates it is based in the Cayman Islands.

42402116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VD4,1541592056,Salesforce Wins Patent Tackling Email Spam With Blockchain,"Software giant Salesforce has won a patent outlining how a blockchain-based platform can be used to prevent spam or other unwanted emails from plaguing people's inboxes.  According to a document published Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a blockchain-based platform can be leveraged to check whether emails are changed or otherwise tampered with after being sent through a custom matching system. Moreover, this system can more efficiently filter spam than existing protocols, according to the document.  The proposed platform would use a matching system to determine whether an email being sent is legitimate or not. Essentially, when a user sends an email, a portion will be recorded onto a blockchain platform. When a second email server receives the message, it will compare a component to determine whether it matches the section recorded onto the blockchain.  If the components match, the email will continue to the inbox, whereas if there is a discrepancy, the email will be marked as spam.  This system ""can help ensure that messages and attachments to those messages have not been modified during transit over a network,"" according to the filing.  It explains that ""messaging systems are often abused and used to distribute unwanted or undesirable messages (or other network traffic), which are commonly referred to as spam."" Further, spammers have a low barrier to entry, which makes it worth while continuing to send such emails.  Additionally, while spam filters are currently commonplace, they sometimes result in false positives. Using a blockchain platform can reduce the number of false positives through the proposed matching system, the document says.  The patent explains:  ""The [system] can also better identify legitimate (wanted) messages and distinguish them from illegitimate (unsolicited) messages. Used properly, the immutability and distributed nature of the blockchain can make it impossible to modify information once it has been committed to the blockchain.""  Using an immutable ledger similarly applies to ""all information, which can include things like sender and recipient information,"" it adds.  Other uses for the concept could also help guarantee the authenticity of medical records, educational transcripts, deeds, property rights, legal documents, and more, the authors say.  Salesforce, which runs a cloud-based email distribution platform, among other products, has expressed interest in leveraging blockchain before. In March, its CEO, Mark Benioff, said the company was looking into building a product using blockchain for sometime in 2018, though he did not provide details on the project.

42402123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VF2,1541588416,Up $100: Bitcoin Price Indicators Grow Increasingly Bullish,"Bitcoin (BTC) looks likely to inch higher toward $6,800 in the near-term, as the technical indicators have grown increasingly bullish in the last 24 hours.  Notably, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements, has jumped to 59.04 – the highest level since Sept. 4.  A reading above 50 indicates that bullish forces are acting on the asset. So, it seems safe to say that the leading cryptocurrency is looking its most bullish for two months.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,510 on Coinbase, representing a $100 or 1.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  While the strong RSI is encouraging for the bulls, technical analysts may argue that calling a bullish move on the basis of that alone is somewhat risky, as the indicator occasionally produces fake signals.  Even so, in this case, other BTC indicators are also biased toward the bulls, giving the RSI greater reliability.  Daily chart  As can be seen above, BTC has cleared the stiff 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle today, having witnessed a bullish symmetrical triangle breakout over the weekend.  The 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  Further, BTC is trading above the upper Bollinger band of $6,500 at press time, and a breakout would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close today above that level.  What's more, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is rising, indicating scope for further gains.  To sum up, both price action and the technical indicators are validating the bullish signals given by the RSI.  View  The odds are stacked in favor of a rally to $6,800 in the near-term.  A break above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $6,642 on the 3-day chart would mark the beginning of the long-awaited bullish reversal, as discussed yesterday.  A UTC close below the ascending (bullish) 10-day EMA of $6,400 would weaken the bullish pressure.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402117,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VB6,1541584834,"It's Hard to Short Crypto – And That's Propping Up Prices, Study Finds","The contentious nature of the ecosystem around cryptocurrencies is partly what gives them value – academics call it ""belief heterogenity.""  But discord and personal sentiment alone isn't enough to keep prices above zero, according to research from Wang Chun Wei, Ph.D., a finance lecturer at the University of Queensland in Australia. According to Wei, if it was easier to bet against cryptocurrency prices through short positions – when someone borrows, then sells an asset with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price in an effort to make a profit on the difference – more of those assets would go to zero.  ""Daily volatility of bitcoin is around four percent. This is too high to be simply based on informational changes in fundamental value,"" Wei, who previously studied whether Tether's controversial stablecoin, USDT, could be used to prop up the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk.  As such, to investigate a better explanation for this observation, Wei looked at coins that most people would agree should be worth zero: cryptocurrencies believed to be either jokes or scams.  His latest investigation into crypto values, first published in October, confirmed a longstanding theory of finance – something called the resale option hypothesis – at least partly explains why cryptocurrencies are valued the way they are today.  The resale option hypothesis, which originated in 2003 from Princeton researchers Jose Scheinkman and Wei Xiong, argues that an asset tends to favor the most optimistic participants in a market (those with long bets) when two conditions persist: lots of disagreement about price and impediments to shorting the asset.  ""Both conditions exist in the crypto market,"" Wei said.  Without easy ways for people to short then, the market favors the long position.  Wei told CoinDesk:  ""The hope that you can sell it to someone for more than what you paid for is an important factor driving cryptocurrency prices.""  What moves markets?  While Wei conducted his study on altcoins – particularly those with shady reputations – he reasoned that what he found should also explain some of the strangeness behind bitcoin's price movements.  For much of its history, the exact reasons for bitcoin's price moves haven't been readily apparent – these fundamentals mysterious even to the most devout maximalist.  Wei studied three baskets of cryptocurrencies: mainstream coins, alleged scams and outright jokes.  The mainstream basket included seven cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and XRP.  The list of less-than-savory coins included the Ponzi scheme-tied Bitconnect, Urocoin (originally pitched as a coin for farmers) and ParagonCoin (a cannabis industry everything-coin).  The joke-coin list featured dogecoin, RonPaulCoin and Useless Ethereum Token (UET) – the latter which wasn't a true ""scam"" because its creator was forthright about his intention to take investor funds and run.  According to Wei, differences of opinion help illuminate why joke coins tend to hold on to their price a bit longer than cryptocurrencies identified as fraudulent. While fraudulent tokens might hold onto their value even as suspicions mount, that eventually changes as the hustle is definitively revealed.  ""Once it becomes crystal clear that there's no fundamental value, then you lose belief dispersion and the resale option value plummets,"" Wei wrote in the paper.  But if a coin was made in jest – without maliciousness – who's to say it couldn't be viewed as valuable regardless? he reasoned.  Testing the value  So, how can this price effect be seen for the cryptocurrencies with bigger market capitalizations and wider network effects?  Resale option value is, in itself, difficult to pin down.  ""There's no precise way of calculating resale option value,"" Wei wrote.  In his paper, he tested ""the statistical significance of the interactions between turnover, traded price and realized volatility"" to infer a value.  And based on that analysis, the hypothesis does apply to more mainstream coins.  ""We find mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum and [XRP], test positive to the resale option test,"" Weid said. ""This suggests that the price-volume relationship for mainstream cryptocurrencies exhibit speculative behavior, and thus it is unlikely that traded price for these cryptocurrencies reflect only fundamental value.""  Indeed, according to Wei, the market got something of a real-world test of this idea recently as bitcoin futures began to trade on major markets starting at the end of last year.  Wei told CoinDesk:  ""Theoretically, the introduction of shorting instruments should reduce the resale option value, and consequently reduce bitcoin price (the latter which we can see clearly).""  Shorting options will soon expand for other cryptocurrencies as well. For example, Dydx is offering tokens for shorting, and crypto startup Compound has created a borrowing market that can be used for shorting coins.  If Wei's analysis proves accurate, that could increase pressure on more of the tokens that have been able to maintain higher prices.  As Wei wrote in the paper, ""Overall, we provide ample empirical evidence in support of anecdotal claims that cryptocurrency prices are supported by the hope of selling it to somebody else at a higher price.""

According to a report from the Financial Times on Wednesday, the bank arranged the loan for Red Electrica, Spain's national electrical grid operator.  A syndicated loan is one, where a group of banks lends together to a single borrower. In this case, the BBVA's co-lenders were Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and France's BNP Paribas.  The data for the loan was time-stamped at each stage of the process. The loan agreement was finally signed between the three banks and recorded on the ethereum blockchain, preserving its ""authenticity,"" says the FT.  In a traditional syndicated loan process, banks rely on faxes to share complex information, which not only delays the process, but is also expensive. Blockchain is seen as a means to help banks exchange information at near real-time, reducing the loan process from a couple of weeks to a day or two. Cutting out manual processes also slashes operational costs.  The BBVA reportedly plans to conduct more blockchain pilots for syndicated loans in the future. The bank has, in fact, explored blockchain tech in the past, as well.  Back in April, it completed a pilot that issued a $91 million corporate loan, using both a private digital ledger and the public ethereum blockchain.

Since March 2018, Coinbase has quietly offered to cover up to $5,000 a year for treatments like egg-freezing through the fertility benefits startup Carrot. This employee perk, which helps women conceive children later in life, is provided in addition to Coinbase's health insurance options.  One Coinbase employee, who preferred to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk:  ""It's definitely a luxury, which is why I feel fortunate that Coinbase and Carrot help make family planning more simple and affordable. It's frankly a relief not to have to worry about family planning on a day-to-day basis.""  The benefit puts Coinbase in an elite category of employers with Google, Apple, and Facebook, which also offer egg-freezing benefits.  But human resources veteran John Paller, co-founder of the benefits and payroll startup Opolis, told CoinDesk such fertility treatment coverage is extremely rare among companies in general, let alone blockchain startups. He said:  ""Only high paying, wealthy companies would even consider adding a benefit like this. Regarding crypto companies, many of them are just figuring out how to provide basic benefits to their employees.""  In this way, the perk signals how Coinbase, which recently raised $300 million in a funding round that valued the company at a record $8 billion, is leveraging its ample resources in a fierce competition for blockchain talent.  ""With possibilities for egg freezing, IVF [in vitro fertilization], fertility preservation, surrogacy, and more, our fertility benefits can serve a wide range of use cases for our diverse group of employees,"" Nat McGrath, Coinbase's VP of people, told CoinDesk.  Coinbase would not disclose how many employees have taken advantage of these treatments, citing privacy concerns. But McGrath emphasized that such benefits are available to all employees and their partners, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Queer employees can use these benefits to help them conceive, while all others can also apply the same benefits to their partners.  On the other hand, Carrot CEO Tammy Sun told CoinDesk that several other cryptocurrency companies have reached out over the past year to start exploring the same benefits. Overall, Carrot works with ""dozens"" of employers, Sun said.  Crypto's benefits rush  Some smaller crypto companies, like the ethereum-centric wallet startup MyCrypto with around 20 employees, already offer paid paternity and maternity leave, a benefit roughly a third of American finance and tech jobs offer.  MyCrypto CMO Jordan Spence told CoinDesk the company's policy on family-planning benefits will ""evolve"" as more employees decide to have kids.  However, most women who freeze their eggs do it while they are single, years before they are ready to start families, giving Coinbase a distinct edge in recruiting younger talent.  To be fair, egg-freezing is still a niche procedure undergone by just 9,000 U.S.-based women a year, according to a 2016 report by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.  And given that egg-freezing often costs up to $22,000 from extraction to implantation several years later, even Coinbase employees who take advantage of this annual benefit may find the out-of-pocket costs to be steep.  Yet McGrath said the topic has repeatedly come up while recruiting.  ""We want employees to feel confident that as they build their careers in crypto, they can also nurture and grow their families,"" McGrath said, concluding:  ""Offering these types of benefits helps us attract a wider and more diverse talent pool.""
