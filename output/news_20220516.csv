This is due to the decisions and indecisions that led to the market implosion in the price of Terra (LUNA) and its algorithm Stablecoin (TerraUSD). The impact of LUNA decline had made some centralized exchanges suspend the withdrawal and trading in LUNA and UST on their platform. However, some of the exchanges have reopened withdrawal since the network is now accepting transactions. Among the top exchanges that suspended Terra LUNA and UST trades during the market implosion include: Binance Crypto.com OKX Binance Binance is the largest cryptocurrency for spot trading at the time of writing, in the past 24 hours. It is ranked in the second position for derivative trading after Kraken. It has over $14.85 billion in spot trading transactions.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and most other cryptos return to the red.  Insights: Metaverse ETFs are struggling to keep pace with gaming ETFs.  Technician's take: BTC's upside appears limited despite short-term support.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,982 -3.4%  Ether (ETH): $2,030 -4.7%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Internet Computer ICP −9.4% Computing Filecoin FIL −8.3% Computing Cosmos ATOM −7.7% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin and other cryptos falter  That didn't last long.  A day after bitcoin broke a week-long losing streak, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and other major cryptos were in the red again on Monday.  Bitcoin was recently down over 3% over the previous 24 hours and has fallen seven consecutive weeks. Still, it spent much of the day near or above the psychologically important $30,000 level. ""As far as the last 24 hours, we've seen a consolidation from six to eight weeks of sell-off,"" 3iQ Digital Asset's Head of Research Mark Connors told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin and other cryptos' performances dovetailed with equity markets, which dropped slightly on Monday and have been tumbling since last fall as inflation and supply chain issues continued to surge and investors became more risk averse. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped more than a percentage point on Monday.  Such growing cautiousness fanned last week by the collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin (UST), and the luna token that supports it, rocked altcoins particularly hard over the past week. On Monday, AXS and AVAX were recently down 12% and 8%, respectively. SOL declined more than 6%.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, fell over 4.6%, although it held fast above $2,000.  ""In equities, you've taken almost a year of returns off so [there was] a rapid resetting as the Fed hiked [interest rates] in the first week of May,"" Connors said. ""You've seen digital assets, bitcoin, ether and the rest of the altcoins fall. What's happened is there's been a stabilization. What people are assessing is whether the interest rate hike has been taken out. In our opinion, it hasn't.  Trading volume rose from the lower levels to which it hewed for the first few months of the year, a sign of a potential, and at least temporary upswing. But few analysts are predicting a more permanent departure from the the current bear market. The coming weeks may be particularly hard on stablecoins even as Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon released a “revival plan” to save the Terra network. Kwon proposed forking Terra into a new chain without UST.  Connors said that investors would likely see three to nine months of ""choppy markets,"" and that prices would likely drop, possibly with support in the $20,000 to $24,000 range. In this environment, he sees investors focusing more on Bitcoin and Ethereum. ""Bitcoin dominance should and will happen when markets sell off,"" Connors said. ""People go to quality, but it seems that Ethereium is now building up as a number two quality asset in the ecosystem.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,008 -0.3%  DJIA: 32,223 +0.08%  Nasdaq: 11,662 -1.2%  Gold: $1,824 +0.6%  Insights  Metaverse ETFs are struggling to keep pace with gaming ETFs  Sometimes a fancy new investment vehicle, most recently the metaverse, doesn’t perform as well on the market as last year’s model.  Metaverse exchange-traded funds (ETF) arrived last year shortly after the term entered our lexicon and became a favorite of venture capitalists. Because the metaverse is simply a mashup of gaming and crypto, these metaverse ETFs look a lot like gaming or eSports ETFs (the two terms are synonymous), which launched a few years ago.  They look like them because the metaverse is an ambiguous term; the shared online experience that is envisioned in Neil Stephenson's science fiction novel ""Snow Crash"" already exists on many multiplayer gaming platforms. Metaverse tokens don’t yet have listed proxies, so metaverse ETFs compensate for that by putting in publicly listed crypto companies like Galaxy (GLX.TO) or Block (SQ), the former Square. And that’s where the problem starts.  That association with crypto means that METV, a metaverse ETF from Roundhill, is significantly underperforming ESPO, a gaming/eSports ETF from VanEck.  Gaming tech heavyweights, like GPU designer Nvidia (NVDS) or game engine developer Unity, are in both baskets and haven’t performed well on-year but the inclusion of the likes of Galaxy Digital – down over 60% year-to-date and planning a stock buyback – really sinks the metaverse ETF.  Of course, this metaverse ETF is outperforming the metaverse tokens themselves: The Sandbox’s eponymous token (SAND) is down nearly 77% and Decentraland’s MANA is at 68%, mainly because both have struggled to attract a player base that reflects their valuation.  There’s an irony here. The metaverse, which is a way to sell crypto-plus-gaming as a rebranded product, is doing better on the market than plain vanilla gaming itself.  Maybe crypto doesn’t belong in everything?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Struggles at $27K-$30K Support Zone; Resistance at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around the $30,000 price level after last week's sell-off. The cryptocurrency must remain above the $27,000-$30,000 support zone this week in order to generate a positive short-term momentum signal.  BTC was down by as much as 3% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels, which could keep buyers active at support. The RSI is also oversold on the weekly chart, although negative momentum could cap upside moves in price.  Immediate resistance is seen at $33,000 and $35,000, which is where a breakdown in price occurred earlier this month. That suggests a large number of sell orders could limit a relief rally over the next two weeks.  Further, the recent underperformance of alternative cryptos (altcoins) relative to bitcoin suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. Typically, alts decline by more than bitcoin during down markets because of their higher risk profile. The broader risk-off environment could keep BTC's short-term downtrend intact.

(The Wall Street Journal) ... ""Terraform Labs, the organization that built the system, supposedly deployed about $3 billion worth of bitcoin, paused the blockchain, flooded the market with UST’s sister token LUNA and tried to pay out arbitrageurs taking advantage of the volatile situation in an effort to rescue its network. Those expensive gambles failed, and even Do Kwon, UST’s principal architect, said the network as it once was can’t be salvaged. Terra is working on something of a repayment plan for “small” token holders. All of this raises two very important questions for the industry: Are all “algos,” or algorithmic stablecoins, dead on arrival? And should there be regulation in place to prevent a similar disaster?"" (CoinDesk columnist Daniel Kuhn) ... Soaring valuations and booming [initial public offerings] made startups seem like a safe bet, inspiring hundreds of new venture funds. Now, the party seems to be suddenly ending – and downsizing may signal even worse times ahead. Since January, nearly 50 startups have made significant layoffs, according to data collected by Layoffs.fyi.

There is a possibility that IOTA trades below $0.15 in the near future. However, for IOTA (MIOTA), it could go either way after it has surged to $0.335 and gained 34.44% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the 24 hours low and high prices of MIOTA were $0.237 and $0.3403. It holds the possibility of reaching a new bottom after attaining a 90-days low price of $0.2759 on May 12th, 2022. Next, let&apos;s explore the possible consequences if IOTA trades below $0.15 or nears that level. Here are a few: A high re-bounce to trade around $0.45 A consolidation to determine the next move A dip breakout to trade below $0.1. A High Re-Bounce to Trade Around $0.45 A price-dip of IOTA trades below $0.15 is likely to occur soon. If this happens, the present re-bounce that had made it surge by over 34% in the past 24 hours would be a minimum pullback. The extreme buyers&apos; continuous pressure would give it a high uptrend to regain the recent losses. A Consolidation to Determine the Next Move At about $0.15, IOTA might experience consolidating prices for some days. The reason for this is that most investors and traders want a clear signal before deciding on their next move.

The native token of the NEM blockchain is XEM. It was launched in March 2015. NEM just like Bitcoin facilities peer to peer transactions but uses the Proof of Importance consensus mechanism. In the past 7 days, the price of XEM attained a 7 days low price of $0.03739 and is presently trading at $0.06173 at the time of writing. This is representing a 65.1% increase within 7 days. This gives a good return in short duration to investors who bought at such a low price. It is ranked in the 88th position in the CoinMarketCap ranking of cryptocurrencies. Some of the factors that are responsible for this recent surge in the price of NEM (XEM) are: Increased interest in peer to peer transactions One of the reasons for the creation of the NEM blockchain is to facilitate peer to peer cryptocurrency transactions. With the unstable positions of government on cryptocurrency and the very low transaction fees on XEM transactions, traders are inclined to trade with XEM instead of Bitcoin so as to save cost. This has led to its recent increase in price. Increased trading volume The trading volume of NEM native token XEM increased in the past 7 days. It moved from about $16.08 million on May 7th, 2022 to $51.66 million on May 14th, 2022. This represents over 221% increase in the volume of trade in the past 7 days.

42411809,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6Ja,1652734657,What Is a Consensus Mechanism?,"The blockchain is a distributed database that records data and allows users to exchange and store value in the form of cryptocurrency. To coordinate and maintain such a decentralized system, the participants must agree on the correct condition of the system and who owns what at any time.  A consensus mechanism is the standardized way of how the blockchain’s nodes – the computers that run the blockchain and keep the records of all transactions – reliably reach this agreement.  Read more: What Is a Node?  Why consensus is important  The goal of a consensus mechanism in the world of crypto is to prevent bad actors from deliberately cheating. The classic example of cheating in the world of crypto is “double-spending.”  Suppose Anthony, the bad guy in this scenario, tries to cheat by transferring 10 tokens to Bethany and then trying to transfer the exact same 10 tokens to Chris. The challenge is to make sure everyone can always know and agree on who owns which tokens. With that agreement, or consensus, Chris would already know that Anthony no longer owns the tokens he is proposing to send.  To “double-spend,” a bad actor would need to get the nodes to adopt a false history of the transactions, a narrative where the bad actor has not spent the tokens and given them to Bethany.  Consensus mechanisms solve the double-spending problem by making it expensive and difficult to propose a new block of validated transactions, discouraging bad actors from trying.  Simultaneously, the mechanisms incentivize the ""good"" nodes to propose blocks they genuinely believe will be accepted in order to receive valuable rewards. As long as there are more good actors than bad actors, Anthony will not be able to change the records on the blockchain to falsify his transaction with Bethany.  Read more: What Is a 51% Attack?  Types of consensus mechanisms  The huge number of crypto projects out there have explored a variety of different consensus mechanisms.  The two most widespread consensus mechanism are:  Proof-of-Work, which Bitcoin and Dogecoin, among others, use for their BTC and DOGE currencies  Proof-of-Stake, which Cardano, Solana and Avalanche, for example, use for ADA, SOL and AVAX, respectively  An underlying factor to the design of both is to make it extremely expensive to undermine the consensus mechanism in place. The difference between them is how they achieve it.  How consensus works  In the case of Proof-of-Work blockchains such as Bitcoin, consensus requires a significant amount of energy, hardware and computing power to propose a new group of transactions – called a block – to the ledger.  The nodes that validate transactions and propose new blocks are called miners. Miners compete to generate a random number to unlock the next block on the chain. The quickest miner to reach that number adds the next block and in exchange for the effort it receives a block reward. The only way to win is to generate random numbers as quickly as possible (the ""work"" in the name) and get lucky. That is a contest of computing power, which in turn requires hardware and electricity.  When it comes to Proof-of-Stake blockchains, the nodes – often referred to as validators – that verify transactions and propose new blocks are required to lock up a certain amount of value in the form of the blockchain’s native token – that’s their stake in the system. The more value a validator deposits, the bigger chance they have to propose a new block and earn the block reward. If a validator commits an error, it has to pay a fee or can be excluded from the validation.

LUNA, Terra's governance token, declined by 18% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 6% drop in GALA and a 5% decline in AVAX and DOT over the same period. Typically, alts decline more than bitcoin in down markets because of their higher risk profile.  Still, the uptick in trading volume during last week's sell-off coupled with fading volatility could point to a brief upswing in crypto prices.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Technical indicators suggests a weak price recovery for bitcoin, which requires another weekly close above $30,000 to encourage buying activity. Still, the recovery could fade at around $33,000-$35,000 because of negative momentum signals on the charts.  Meanwhile, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon released a “revival plan” to save the Terra network after last week’s meltdown. Kwon proposed forking Terra into a new chain without terraUSD (UST). The plan could go into effect if token holders approve it. Read more here.  During last week's UST de-peg, ""other major stablecoins such as USDC, BUSD and DAI experienced a 1% to 2% premium as investors moved toward assets they perceived were less at risk of contagion,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Uptick in trading activity  Bitcoin's average trading volume last week rose toward its highest level since January. That happened during a time of extreme bearish sentiment.  Trading volume declined over the past weekend, but remains elevated – almost twice as high the average volume levels recorded in April, according to Arcane Research.  Still, in the futures market, bitcoin's open interest, or the total number of derivatives contracts outstanding on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, continues to decline from its recent peak on March 28. That suggests the recent sell-off emanated from trading activity in the spot market rather than from leveraged traders in the futures market, although liquidations have accelerated the downward price moves.  Bitcoin's implied volatility also remains elevated following last week's sell-off. Further, intraday volatility reached its highest level since May of last year, according to Arcane Research.  ""The key contributor to surging intraday volatility tends to be massive destabilizing effects in derivatives with leveraged positions unwinding, causing knock-off effects in all associated markets,"" Arcane wrote.  Typically, volatility spikes are short-lived, especially if price declines stabilize. Some traders remain cautious because of the weak recovery in crypto and equity prices following last week's sell-off.  QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, stated that it intends to keep long volatility positions open in anticipation of choppy markets, according to a recent Telegram announcement. The firm is watching for news on the fallout from the Terra stablecoin debacle, which could be a source of additional volatility in the future.  Still, others are looking for opportunities to fade the spike in volatility. ""In the short term, spot prices have likely bottomed out while option volatility likely peaked,"" Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, wrote in a blog post on Sunday.  ""Should prices find stability and bounce violently higher, fading the skew is a prime volatility trade,"" Magadini wrote, referring to the anticipated decline in the relative volatility of put options versus call options.

42374728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2765,1652733370,Big-Money Investors Who Boosted Bitcoin’s Price Might Now Crash It,"A key narrative in the crypto world in 2021 was the arrival of institutional investors to the space. Tesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) and Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as hedge funds, started allocating client assets to bitcoin that year.  Not only were these institutional investors a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, they also appeared to drive up prices. Crypto boomed with the sector’s market capitalization growing 185% that year.  Now, as the crypto market's latest swoon wipes off $1.25 trillion from the industry's all-time high market capitalization reached late last year, the question has risen: What role is institutional money playing in the crash? Or to put it more bluntly, are institutional investors making things worse?  One thing we know: The crypto market is increasingly correlated to the stock market, and institutional investors appear to have heightened that correlation. And when the stock market goes down, it takes crypto with it.  “The influx of institutional interest in BTC, which started to pick up in early 2020 with public declarations of interest from stalwarts of traditional investing, such as Paul Tudor Jones and Renaissance Technologies, coincides with a sustained jump in the 60-day correlation between BTC and the S&P 500,” according to an April 2022 report by Genesis Trading. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The three-month correlation between bitcoin and ether (ETH) and the major U.S. stock indexes reached a record high last week, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  For bitcoin bulls, the nettlesome takeaway is that the recent crypto crash can't be delinked from the downturn in traditional markets.  Stocks are now in a bear market after the Federal Reserve’s latest rate hike of 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, at its latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in May.  Both crypto and traditional markets briefly skyrocketed after Fed Chair Jerome Powell ruled out a larger increase than that at upcoming meetings, but they quickly reversed course after what Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Market Intelligence, called a “reality check.”  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped nearly 5% the day after the meeting on May 4. Bitcoin fell over 10%, now down over 35% year to date. For market watchers, the upshot was how closely they're traveling in tandem.  A recent report from Morgan Stanley found that institutional investors dominated trades in crypto in 2021, and that retail investors accounted for only a third of all trades on crypto exchange Coinbase, reported the Financial Times.  “Client interest [is] concentrated more heavily onto the two main crypto assets, BTC and ETH,” analysts at data provider VandaTrack wrote, according to the newspaper. ETH stands for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. ”This matters because, as more institutions await the first results of the White House executive order on crypto regulation and the ETH merge to ETH 2.0, current price behavior will continue to be driven by TradFi assets.” (ETH 2.0 is shorthand for a planned upgrade of the Ethereum network, and ""TradFi"" is crypto-industry jargon for ""traditional finance."" The old world, as it were.)  “We think the increased involvement of institutions, which are sensitive to availability of capital and therefore interest rates, has contributed in part to the high correlation between bitcoin and equities,” the report stated.  So does that mean that those institutional investors who helped crypto to flourish a year ago are now a factor in the crash?  “Absolutely,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank.  “We could make such an assumption, since the market has matured and a larger portion of participants are institutions, exposed to both crypto and traditional assets,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital. “With time, it is plausible that we see faster tops and bottoms in the crypto space compared to the prolonged periods in the past.”  “This is the nature of tradable assets,” he said. “When assets are sold, all assets are sold. Bitcoin has correlated with the Nasdaq for quite a while now. This is no exception.”  It isn't easy to separate institutional and retail inflows and outflows. But sometimes you hear from the investors themselves. Miller Value Partners Chairman Bill Miller, known for beating the S&P 500 Index for 15 consecutive years, sold some of his bitcoin to meet margin calls, noting that when things get tough you want to sell very liquid assets – in this case bitcoin.  The 'Coinbase premium'  Take a look at the “Coinbase premium,” which is the difference between the price of buying bitcoin with dollars on Coinbase and the cost of buying bitcoin on Binance using the stablecoin USDT.  Crypto-market analysts look at this figure to evaluate who is the bigger force in the market at any given moment – institutional investors or retail investors. The thinking is that Coinbase's user base skews more institutional than Binance's. So if there's a premium, it usually means that institutional investors are leading the market higher.  But recently, the premium flipped negative and fell to a 12-month low, according to data from CryptoQuant.  “Usually, there is a Coinbase premium. This means that the bitcoin price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance. This was/is very important, because American institutions and HNW (High Net Worth) were trading mostly on Coinbase. However... in the latest few days it’s negative. This indicates heavy selling on Coinbase Pro!” CryptoQuant said in a blog post.  “The crypto investor from retail to institutional tend to also be the investor in tech stocks,” said Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy. ""They tend to be those bullish on technology as a disrupter to current industries, and this crossover and correlation is playing out currently.""  The connection apparently holds fast when the market goes into reverse, he said.  “For Institutions it is also easier to liquidate their crypto positions especially with the 24/7 access to their capital than some other positions, so they tend to be the first positions closed out,” he said.  “In the past year-and-a-half, we’ve had new entrants to the digital assets market from the macro hedge fund world,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca wrote in a report. “It’s the players, not the assets, that are correlated.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/big-money-investors-who-boosted-bitcoins-price-might-now-crash-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fee21a4c4412f6935855f62a1008c83696aa67f-742x494.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, despite all the fear the drop has caused, it could be the last low before the top cryptocurrency continues its bull run. Here is why an extremely rare Elliott Wave expanding triangle pattern could be the last hope Bitcoin bulls have for new highs before a bear market. Ralph Nelson Elliott And His Theory On How Markets Move Ask most crypto investors and they would probably agree: we are in a bear market.

6873,https://blokt.com/?p=56042,1652730907,Bitcoin Bear Market: Almost Over or More Pain Ahead?,"To help answer these questions, we’ve looked at the last three major pullbacks and corrections in Bitcoin to see how they compare to the current one. We analyze various technical and fundamental factors, such as how severe the corrections were, how long BTC took to recover and make a new all-time high, and the main news narratives influencing price action. Quick Look at the Last 3 Bear Markets & Corrections Here are the last three major corrections, starting with the oldest up until the most recent. #1: The 2014-2015 Bear Market Quick Stats: Price Decline : -86.9% Bear Market Duration : 413 days (59 weeks) Subsequent Bull : +12,800% This bear market began as soon as the parabolic 2013-2014 bull market ended. Bitcoin increased 51,000% during this time, so it was due to have a correction. The 2014-2015 bear market that followed took BTC from its all-time high at $1163 down to $152, a decrease of -86.9%, where it finally ended just over a year after it began. It then took BTC a further two years (771 days) to recover from this low and make a fresh new all-time high above $1163 in Feb 2017. BTC continued soaring higher from here, continuously making new ATHs until it peaked at around $19,700 in Dec 2017. #2: The 2018-2019 Bear Market Quick Stats: Price Decline : -84% Bear Market Duration : 364 days (52 weeks) Subsequent Bull : +2,105% This bear market was comparable to the previous 2014-2015 bear market, as it declined by a similar percentage and lasted for close to a year. It also came after an explosive bull market that saw BTC make an ATH around $19,700. BTC fell from this ATH to a low of $3122 during the 2018-2019 bear market. After the 2018-2019 bear market ended, it took BTC 716 days (just under two years) to recover and make a fresh new all-time high above $19,700. Once BTC made a new all-time high, it continued rising until it peaked at $69,000 in Nov 2021, which is where the bearish period we’re in today began. While the subsequent bull market that came after the 2018-2019 bear market was impressive (a 2,105% rise), there was some turbulence along the way. In Feb and Mar of 2020, global financial markets were spooked by the emergence of the covid pandemic. #3: The Covid Pandemic Crash in March 2020 Quick Stats: Price Decline: -63.34% Crash Duration: 29 days (4 weeks) Subsequent Bull: +1688.5% This correction in BTC was different from the previous two bear markets we’ve covered. It did not come after a protracted bull market and was driven primarily by negative news. Therefore the characteristics of this pullback were also much different. Bitcoin’s price declined by a lesser amount (-63.34%), and the crash lasted only four weeks. BTC was also much quicker to recover this time, rising from the crash lows at $3850 back up to pre-crash levels in around 80 days. Current 2022 BTC Correction Quick Stats: Price Decline So Far : -63.2% Bear Market Duration So Far : 183 days (26 weeks) Subsequent Bull : Unknown The current 2022 bear market is still in progress, and we don’t exactly know how it will play out. However, BTC’s price has already declined by -63.2% over the last 26 weeks from its ATH at $69,000 in Nov 2021. What Can We Expect Going Forward? Well, as BTC has not recovered rapidly like during the covid pandemic crash, we look set for a longer-term move down or sideways here. Also, this theory is supported further by the fact that this bear market has come after a strong bull market in 2020-2021 which saw BTC increase by 2,105%. Based on the previous two bear markets we’ve looked at, it seems we could only be about halfway through this bearish phase. Also, considering BTC’s price has only dropped -63.2% from its ATH, there is room for a further decrease to get us down around -80% from the ATH, in line with previous bear markets. Of course, these are only estimates based on previous BTC bear markets, and this time it could go down much less or more than it did previously. Is Now a Good Time to Invest in BTC? It’s impossible to say whether now is a good time to invest or not. However, if BTC were to decline 70-80% from its ATH, which would take its price down to $13,700-$20,000, the odds of making a profit on your investment if you were to buy Bitcoin at this point would be in your favor based on previous bear markets. That’s not to say it’s a good idea to short Bitcoin ; the market is too unpredictable to say what will happen with any certainty. How Long Till BTC Makes a New ATH Again? There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will make a new all-time high again in the future. However, if it does, it wouldn’t be unusual if it takes a couple of years from now based on the previous bear markets we looked at. What Else Could Affect the Price? Other factors may also come into play aside from the fact that Bitcoin may just be in a bearish phase, which is a normal part of the cycle in any financial market. As was seen during the covid pandemic crash, significant macro events can also affect how BTC’s price behaves. Right now, here are some of the main news narratives circulating: The collapse of UST and Luna undermining confidence in crypto The Ukraine war and the risk of it spilling over to other nations The covid pandemic and the risk of new variants and further disruption The risk of recession in the US and other nations Inflation and higher costs of living A stock market crash could create fear in the crypto market An escalation of any of these events could create more fear in the crypto market, leading to more severe price declines and volatility. Likewise, if any of these problems improve, are resolved, or are averted, this could increase optimism and help stabilize the market. Final Thoughts At the end of the day, Bitcoin has bull and bear markets just like any other publicly traded financial asset. This probably won’t be the last bear market, and fortunately, there should be plenty more bull markets to come too. While bear markets can be extremely frustrating and painful for those already invested and holding throughout, they can also provide excellent opportunities for those who want to invest fresh new capital.

When people hear about cryptocurrency, they immediately go to ‘stranger danger.’”  This was particularly true back in crypto’s earlier days, when the main associations with the nascent financial technology were illegal drug sales on the Silk Road and massive hacks like the one of the early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. The science-minded Forde had to acknowledge these realities while helping President Obama come to grips with the “opportunities” associated with trustless, digital currencies.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  After Forde’s briefing, Obama saw Bitcoin “in a different light,” Forde says. “He's a science and technology president, so he can more quickly grasp that than other world leaders.”  Forde went on to advise many other world leaders on cryptocurrency as the director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Digital Currency Initiative, getting in at the ground level there in 2015. From MIT, he ran for Congress in California’s 45th District in 2018 on a tech-focused platform, raising about $300,000 of his campaign funds in cryptocurrency.  Learning the ins and outs of that process led to the founding of his current company, Numero, where he seeks to simplify the complicated campaign fundraising process for U.S. political candidates running at anywhere from the local to federal level. He says at least 250 campaigns are using Numero’s software right now.  Bringing both simplicity and cryptocurrency to the campaign financing world is no small feat, according to Forde. “It’s bigger than professional sports. Campaigns raise about $15 billion in a campaign season. ... The NFL does like $12 billion a season. The NBA does like $8 billion a season. Major League Baseball does $3.6 billion,” he rattles off. “So campaign donations are four times bigger than Major League Baseball.”  Forde spoke with CoinDesk about his future plans for Numero (yes, they include an NFT platform), his experience briefing world leaders on Bitcoin and why Congress needs a crypto “truth teller.”  Of all the world leaders that you've spoken with about bitcoin and blockchain, who has been the most receptive?  I'm not going to name names, because our conversations were private. But looking at all the conversations that I've had with leaders, once they're educated, they're much more receptive than you’d think. In some countries, it's actually changed policy, from one of absolutely banning bitcoin to reversing that policy and not ultimately implementing it.  What I saw in talking to other world leaders is they didn't have that staff that [Obama] had with technical backgrounds that could explain [digital currency] to them. Once it was explained to them, they saw the opportunity. They saw this is the second coming of the internet, and they were able to then make their own decisions.  What made you decide to leave the White House for the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT?  When I learned more about bitcoin, I was just blown away. To me, it was like when I was 12 or 13 and learning about the technical underpinnings of the internet. It captured my imagination, for the first time since I was a young kid.  When I got an offer to start the research lab at MIT, what I consider to be a relatively neutral place, that was a huge opportunity for me to have an impact – because if I went to go work for a company, when I talked to a world leader, they'd assume I'm biased, as they should. But if I go there from an academic institution, I can maintain the neutrality that was needed at that time, when you had governments looking to create regulation that would not allow for businesses and people to benefit from cryptocurrency.  Also at the time, the Bitcoin Foundation, which funded the original core developers of Bitcoin, went under. I had the opportunity to raise a million dollars and fund the salaries of Bitcoin core developers. It was an important place to be. The director of the MIT Media Lab at that time thought there needed to be more academic research on Bitcoin. There weren’t really any other academic institutions creating an actual research center – there were a couple of professors here and there, at Princeton, for example, and Cornell, who did a class [on Bitcoin], but there was no proper research center.  What made you decide to go from your work at MIT to running for Congress in California's 45th district?  It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to run for Congress. You had folks like Mark Zuckerberg going in front of Congress, and members of Congress and Senate asking him how Facebook pays for itself. You had that level of lack of understanding of technology and its business models. It’s so important to have technologists at the policy table. I realized quickly that we didn't have many scientists or technologists in Congress.  You needed someone like me to be able to explain to other members, what this [technology] is and its real impact, versus fear, uncertainty and doubt. You need a truth teller in there. And you also need to hold tech executives to greater account. I would argue that Congress is getting better at it, but they're not where they should be. If you look at the number of people who have a science and technology background in Congress, it's near zero.  When you were running, what was your strategy for framing how cryptocurrency played into your platform? How did you do that in a way that didn't necessarily scare off skeptics?  It’s about education. Mind you, this district is home to some of the top technical companies. It’s one of the most highly educated districts in the country, with top universities. This district understands technology.  They understood that it wasn't about being pro-cryptocurrency. It was about being pro-common sense in understanding the impact of technology and sharing my stories of the impact one can have in the White House, for example. If you don't have that person like me in the White House, Barack Obama does not get a briefing on Bitcoin that explains the opportunity. He’s getting a briefing that explains the fear.  When you were running, how much did you raise in cryptocurrency for your campaign?  In total, I raised like one and a quarter, one and a half million [about $300,000 of which was in crypto]. We were revolutionizing this process. No one had raised crypto at scale. Once we did it, I had a ton of members of Congress calling me saying, ‘How on earth did you do that?’ Like, technically, how did you do that? How did you make it SEC compliant?  What were some of the biggest hurdles to raising cryptocurrency for your campaign at the time?  Honestly, the biggest hurdle was the Stripe API that we originally used. Not many people remember this, but Stripe used to allow you to take bitcoin. Their technology was not very good because it would put up a QR code, then someone tried to make a contribution, and then because the price changed, Stripe wasn't able to adjust, and then the contribution wouldn't go through.  Then we used Coinbase’s API. That went a lot better. Then when we went to help out a few other folks who wanted to accept cryptocurrency, Coinbase deprecated that API. Now Stripe is rolling out a full cryptocurrency team, but people forget that they had a cryptocurrency team, and they turned it off, because they weren't very good at it.  Those are some of the challenges, but you really need to be able to raise a decent amount of money to make it worth your time. It's going to take extra time to have your compliance team look at [crypto donations] because it's not something that they've done before. It's going to be extra legal time, extra technology time. I usually tell candidates, if they can't raise at least $20,000 to $50,000 in crypto, it's not worth doing.  I hear this argument that if you accept crypto, you're going to expand your donor base. Baloney. If you do not understand crypto policy, why is someone who would donate in cryptocurrency going to donate to you?  How did your run for Congress influence the founding of Numero?  I had this idea in my head that campaign technology was a solved problem. We all saw Barack Obama leverage Facebook at a much more innocent time. He had all these young tech folks helping his campaign.  Then I remember one of my first days opening up our campaign, and [I was] handed this software, which was my donor CRM. I was like, ‘What is this?’ And [my staff] said, ‘Honestly, the software just upgraded, and we can't even use it.’ I called the company and said, ‘Look, my staff who's trained in your software doesn't even know how to use your software. Quite frankly, I’m a pretty technical person, and I can't figure out how to use your software.’ And they said, ‘Well, you can pay us $1,000, and we'll teach you.’ I said, ‘Forget that company. We're going to build our own CRM.’  You said you’ve seen about five to 10 politicians using NFTs to try to fundraise for their campaigns. How are they doing it? Are they hiring people to write their smart contracts? Are they going to OpenSea?  It's very artisanal. Kind of like how I did it when I accepted crypto, where we built our own thing. [At Numero,] we're building an NFT grassroots fundraising platform for donors who want to know more about their contributions. This is not just about campaigns accepting funds in an innovative way – it's about unlocking the ability for grassroots donors to be able to donate to a campaign in an interesting way.  Right now, if you donate to a campaign, it’s this incredibly solitary experience. You sit on your phone or computer by yourself, you enter your credit card information, and then the reward you get is probably another 100 hyperbolic emails begging you to donate. That is not an experience donors want. They want to be thanked, and they want to be more engaged in the campaign.  We’re building tools that allow you to say there’s this NFT, we're going to raise $10,000 in total. That's going to allow us get a new ad on air. If you donate to this you get this NFT, and get some of your friends to help donate, as well. It’s more like a team sport, rather than a solitary sport. Then you're able to help raise that $10,000, and you get gated access to see that ad before anyone else. And you get to see it with the candidate.  There was one quote from a grassroots donor who I talked to that really stuck out. He said, ‘Politics is my sport. I research candidates like my friends research their fantasy football teams.’ The difference between his hobby and fantasy football, he said, is that the outcome of my sport changes the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans. Right now, the experience [of donating] is like playing fantasy football by yourself versus with your group of friends. We're moving to make contributions more like playing fantasy football with your friends. And the end result is democracy.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/16/brian-forde-why-congress-needs-a-crypto-truth-teller,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c13e514296b0328bbc0f895fbc4bdc2d054c9572-683x512.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, it is within a bear breakout formation with support at $500 on the lower end. Past Performance of the BIFI Coin BIFI crypto prices are recovering from all-time lows posted last week. BIFI prices lead the charts at spot rates, adding an impressive 85 percent versus the USDT in the previous 24 hours. Technically, sellers have the upper hand in the medium term from an effort versus results perspective. Prices remain within a bear breakout formation. BIFI Technical Analysis The immediate resistance level lies at around $1.2k. When writing, BIFIUSDT prices are within last week&apos;s trade range. However, the bullish engulfing bar of May 15 coupled with sharp spikes in trading volumes suggest strength. Accordingly, traders may look to load on pullbacks towards the $600 and $700 zone. Notably, there is confirmation of the bullish engulfing bar with a high likelihood of further gains above the middle BB. A close above this line could see the coin rally to retest $1.2k. On a more cautious outlook, a price plunge below $500 may slow down optimistic buyers. What to Expect from the BIFI token? From a top-down analysis, the coin is within a bear breakout formation.

A close above $0.37 would likely propel the token to April 2022 peaks. Past Performance of the HARD Crypto HARD is up a massive 35 percent in the last 24 hours versus the USDT. As per the arrangement in the daily chart, the coin appears to be bottoming up, shaking off the bears of last week. Given the spike in price and trading volumes, buyers are in control. The coin could continue outperforming the USDT, BTC, and ETH in subsequent sessions. HARD Technical Analysis The HARD token is bottoming up, reversing from all-time lows when writing. Of note, there is a wide-ranging bull bar of May 15 that completely reversed the losses of May 11. Therefore, in a three-bar reversal pattern, buyers can load on dips within the May 15 bull bar and above $0.16. The immediate target will be $0.63, marking April 2022 highs. Conversely, unexpected contractions below last week&apos;s low will nullify the bullish outlook in a continuation of early May 2022 bears. What to Expect from HARD?

There are reputational as well as legal risks involved in hiring North Korean workers, according to the State Department, the Department of Treasury and the FBI. Both the U.S. and the United Nations have sanctions in place against North Korea, and the agencies said that many of these workers generated revenue that contributes to the country's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs, in violation of those sanctions.  The warning noted in particular that IT workers from North Korea often take on projects that involve virtual currency. “Some DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) IT workers have designed virtual currency exchanges or created analytic tools and applications for virtual currency traders and marketed their products themselves,” the document said.  The agencies added that while these workers often engage in normal IT work, “they have used the privileged access gained as contractors to enable the DPRK’s malicious cyber intrusions.”  The latest warning comes after several U.S. government organizations jointly highlighted last month the threat posed by cryptocurrency thefts and tactics used by the North Korean state-sponsored group known as Lazarus Group.  The Treasury Department has tied Lazarus to the high-profile theft of $625 million worth of cryptocurrency from the Ronin bridge linked to the popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity.

LedgerPrime, Redwood Trust, John Wu’s Avalanche-focused Blizzard fund and other venture backers joined the Series A, CEO Pat LaVecchia, a former MakerDAO adviser, told CoinDesk.  He described the strategic backers as “important” in Oasis’ bid to bridge crypto infrastructure with traditional capital markets.  Oasis Pro Markets LLC, the ATS, wants to support everything from the issuance to secondary trading of all forms of digital securities, the company said. It also lets subscribers take the unusual step of paying in crypto for their digital securities, which are traditional investment assets (like shares in a company) that trade as tokens atop blockchain tech.  Oasis is in the “early stages” of integrating its ATS directly with DeFi applications, LaVecchia told CoinDesk. He said automated market makers (AMMs), staking and yield farming can provide investor upside, and also help DeFi dollars gain access to securities.  LaVecchia offered MakerDAO as an example.  “The MakerDAO collateralization platform could fund an issuer with a collateralized note. Then if it meets proper regulatory security requirements, that note could trade on an ATS such as Oasis Pro. So DeFi funding into a security that can trade on an ATS for the issuer,” he said in a text.  Such close integrations of DeFi and traditional finance (TradFi) require regulatory approval. LaVecchia said Oasis isn’t there yet.  “I believe we are unique and we have the registration for digital cash (stablecoins, CBDCs, etc.) for digital securities transactions which to date we understand no other group has secured,” LaVecchia said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/16/oasis-pro-raises-27m-for-crypto-securities-trading-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c450bbf41bd6c34aa53dc5a7c8f34410a7758e13-3644x2733.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Of course, given the closing of the 9 May weekly candle, the $0.02 test question is questionable. https://www.tradingview.com/x/R7VoWr5M/ After all, the week closed with a big pin-up. However, the sharp price jump could be an emotional decision of short-term traders, who could already leave the market and forget about this trading situation. Trading volumes increased only during the last trading week. The local rebound of the price is the beginning of the slowdown in the downward trend. Therefore, at the moment we do not believe that the price without a global upward correction will be able to break and consolidate below $0.02. This mark is a great chance to buy VET with low risks in the long run.

42411451,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4Pk,1652724891,UST Won't Be the End of Algorithmic Stablecoins,"Is this the end of the algorithmic stablecoin?  Last week, UST, the digital asset that was supposed to represent the value of $1, exploded in a spectacular fashion. The stablecoin, which once had an $18 billion market cap, is now trading for less than 60 cents – well off its peg to the greenback. Terraform Labs, the organization that built the system, supposedly deployed about $3 billion worth of bitcoin, paused the blockchain, flooded the market with UST’s sister token LUNA and tried to pay out arbitrageurs taking advantage of the volatile situation in an effort to rescue its network.  Those expensive gambles failed, and even Do Kwon’s, UST’s principal architect, said the network as it once was can’t be salvaged. Terra is working on something of a repayment plan for “small” token holders.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  All of this raises two very important questions for the industry: Are all “algos,” or algorithmic stablecoins, dead on arrival? And should there be regulation in place to prevent a similar disaster?  At least one person thinks this isn’t the end for algos. Jonathan Wu, who’s the head of growth at the Aztec Network, a layer 2 network, told cryptocurrency podcaster Laura Shin just that.  “The algorithmic stablecoin is a holy grail. If you think about what an undercollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin is, it is printing money out of thin air. There will always be capital chasing that dream in my opinion,” Wu said on an “Unchained” podcast episode last week.  If one person thinks that, others likely do, too. And with somewhat understandable reasons. Wu painted with broad strokes: Stablecoins are necessary to smooth out crypto’s volatility, and if there’s a cheaper way to do that, people will attempt it.  There are essentially two stablecoin models: collateralized and uncollateralized. Collateralized stablecoins like USDC or tether maintain financial reserves like currencies or bonds in things like bank accounts to ensure that holders of these synthetic dollars can redeem them for actual money, at some point.  Algos forgo this failsafe and attempt to maintain their pegs through other financial means. UST used an on-chain redemption tool and a related token, LUNA, that was supposed to prop up UST’s value based on changing supply and demand. LUNA was burned or minted as UST rose or fell against the dollar.  The purpose was to create a “crypto-native” dollar – with all of the supposed benefits of blockchains, like censorship resistance – that would be cheaper to use than a fully or partially collateralized option.  Wu’s back-of-the-napkin math had it that UST users could print a synthetic dollar on Terra for about 20 cents. He compared that with dai, a blockchain-based stablecoin maintained by MakerDAO that holds overcollateralized crypto reserves, which costs $2 to use, Wu said.  See also: '$DAI Will Die' Tweet Twisted Back on Terra's Kwon as UST Loses $1 Peg  “Now if I'm a venture capitalist or any capital provider, I'm looking at this and I'm saying I can create a monetary system that's 10 times more capital efficient than the alternative. I'm willing to chase that dream over and over and over again,” Wu said.  Moreover, Wu said that “collectively, as an ecosystem, we've shown that we're willing to chase that dream over and over again and risk systemic toxicity in DeFi (decentralized finance) markets.”  Just think of the value creation.  But what of the value that’s been destroyed?  Widespread risks  Before it imploded last week, UST substantially deviated from its peg only twice, including once in December 2020, when it fell to about 85 cents, and again in May 2021, when it dropped to 94 cents. In other words, Terra functioned more or less as promised until it didn’t.  Along the way, however, figures like University of Calgary professor Ryan Clements were sounding the alarm bell. In October’s Wake Forest University Law Review, Clements wrote a considered piece claiming that all algos are doomed.  These are assets that, like fiat, have value because a committed group of people say they do. The issue is, Terra’s user base is necessarily smaller than the U.S. economy, and although it had “lunatic” fans, the blockchain lacked an army.  Apart from the demand issue, Clements noted that Terra relied on “self-interested” investors who could profit from its algorithm as it began to fail. That problem, as we saw last week, is compounded by a “herd-like” sell pressure that accelerates a sell-off.  Other algos – like magic internet money (MIM), frax (FRAX) and neutrino usd (USDN) – are far from immune, Clements argued. Because they are backed by volatile assets and prone to herd behavior, algos “exist in a state of perpetual vulnerability,” he wrote.  Just today, Deus Finance's algo called dei (DEI) fell to as low as 54 cents during European trading hours, a drop that was in part precipitated by volatility across stablecoin trading. Kwon’s previous project Basis Cash similarly exploded, as did the algorithmic stablecoin IRON – which prompted investor Mark Cuban to call for stablecoin regulation.  “What is an algorithmic stablecoin? Is it stable? Do buyers understand what the risks are? It needs standards,” Cuban tweeted in September.  Cuban was mocked at the time for his hypocrisy and aversion to risk, but that – regulation – is certainly where all of this points. If it’s not possible for on-chain mechanisms to maintain their own price controls, then some other entity will come in to set standards.  CoinDesk’s own Nikhilesh De wrote about the need for proper oversight, and he is far from alone. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen commented last week on the UST crisis. The question remains, what will regulations look like?  Writing the rules  Unfortunately, for the crypto industry, they won’t necessarily get to write their own rules – even if they can participate in the drafting process.  “​​I expect the regulation will look like more and more governance tokens being considered securities,” notable industry skeptic Bennett Tomlin told The Node in a private message. “[Governance tokens] have claims against assets, claims against cash flows often and are the easiest target for regulators.”  Unfortunately for regulators, anyone can create a crypto system – a process that means financial cops have been and will likely continue playing whack-a-mole with issuers. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has begun to crack down on the industry, issuing broad warnings and doubling the size of its crypto enforcement wing – even with clear rules, there will still be some anarchists like Kwon willing to buck the system.  Nic Carter, a venture capitalist and CoinDesk columnist, doesn’t see official guidance as helping either, for similar reasons. But the industry, which was already highly skeptical of stablecoins, could enforce its own rules.  “I don’t think you can proactively regulate stuff like UST out of existence, any more than you can regulate plustoken or paycoin or onecoin or other similar schemes,” Carter told me. He added that UST was never “befitting of the word stablecoin” because its “true objective was to pump LUNA.”  “So the questions of ‘how do we regulate USDC’ and ‘what do we do about UST/Luna’ are totally distinct,” he said. “The latter is more about how do you stop large-scale financial fraud from happening.”  See also: Top US Lawmaker Proposes Sweeping Stablecoin Regulation  Rules are coming for stablecoins to make them look and function more like banks. Similar rules can be self-enforced in the crypto industry. Users could demand robust reserves even for algos, or something like “an orthodox currency board,” Carter said, referring to the monetary authorities that maintain exchange rates for foreign currencies.  Whether a system like that is possible and whether those authorities will use tokens that increasingly look like securities are open questions. But it does seem like one lesson for many investors is to choose collateralized stablecoins in the future.  How long that preference will remain or how long the memory of UST’s implosion can stay in mind is another can of worms.  As Wu said, algorithmic stablecoins are the “holy grail.” Or, as Tomlin put it, “The main reason I think people will keep trying is the appearance of free money.”",NEUTRAL,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/16/ust-wont-be-the-end-of-algorithmic-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94ae7dec658f09ade136f8486893ee8aeacc68cc-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His new slogan: “Terra is more than UST.”  Calling the $40 billion implosion “a chance to rise up anew from the ashes,” Kwon said that “the ecosystem and its community are worth preserving” as he pitched the second take revival plan as a “living document.”  In Monday’s post and an accompanying Twitter thread, Kwon proposed forking Terra into a new chain sans terraUSD (UST), the algorithmic stablecoin whose depegging crushed the entire ecosystem, the LUNA token included. Holders of LUNA on the “Classic” chain (the existing chain) would receive an airdrop of the new chain’s token under the plan. The old chain will continue to operate using the newly renamed luna classic (LUNC) token.  Kwon said the new chain will be “fully community owned,” and Terraform Labs – Kwon’s company and the creators of Terra – will not be eligible to receive funds in the initial token disbursement.  The plan will go into effect if it’s voted through by token holders. Kwon promised voting would begin on May 18. According to his proposed timeline, the new network launch could come as soon as May 27.  What happened  In what may have marked the largest token collapse in crypto history, Terra’s $40 billion stablecoin juggernaut crashed last week. Terra’s UST stablecoin, which is supposed to stay “pegged” to the price of the dollar, plummeted below 10 cents. LUNA, which UST’s “algorithm” uses to help prop up the stablecoin’s dollar peg, dropped from $80 to below 1 cent amid the turmoil.  In a tweet Monday, the Luna Foundation Guard, stewards of Terra’s vast bitcoin (BTC) reserves, explained that it sold off virtually all of its over-2 billion dollars worth of bitcoin in an ultimately failed attempt to defend UST’s peg. The announcement dashed any hope that Terra might be able to use the reserves to substantially compensate investors.  Monday’s announcement from Kwon followed an original “Revival Plan” he proposed last week. The earlier plan, while light on specifics, also proposed handing ownership of Terra over to its community.  Compared to the earlier plan, the newer one places a larger percentage of the forked chain’s initial token distribution (25% versus 10%) into a “Community Pool” responsible for funding future development. The new plan also gives 5% of the tokens to “essential developers” – a group not mentioned in the original proposal.  The vast majority of new LUNA tokens would go to those who lost billions of dollars from last week’s collapse. Following a vesting schedule, smaller holders would get their full allocations faster than whales, or large holders, who might have to wait up to five years. Terraform Labs would get nothing under the deal.

The coin&apos;s supply and demand are balanced by an algorithm. Because of their non-volatile character, stablecoins are ideal for borrowing and lending. However, the current UST-LUNA crash opened the eyes of investors to understand the fundamentals of algorithm stablecoins. For instance, the Luna supply pool adds and subtracts from Terra&apos;s supply to keep the price stable. Users can then use an algorithmic module created by the blockchain developers to burn Luna to mint Terra and even Terra to mint Luna. Let&apos;s understand what happened to UST and LUNA in this article. Massive sell-off curve It all started with a major Curve sell-off and the 3-pool was somewhat out of balance due to an $85 million UST-to-USDC swap. To restore equilibrium to the Curve pool, 50,000 $ETH was sold and 20,000 $ETH was sent to Binance. Heavy withdrawal This results in a $2 billion $UST withdrawal from Anchor.

The cryptocurrency which has held up quite nicely through all of the market scandals is seeing even more bad news ahead. Previously, it has seen a good number of consecutively red closes that have solidified its entrance into a bear market. However, this time around, it seems that the digital asset is ready to set another record, but this time for the worse. Seven Red Candles Anyone that has been following the market recently knows that Bitcoin has been seeing multiple consecutive red closes. This has not been a cause for alarm though since the digital asset has a history of marking bearish trends like these and still coming out on top. But this would prove to be a trend like no other after the cryptocurrency had seen its 7th consecutive red close. Related Reading | Bitcoin Recovers Above $30,000, Has The Bottom Been Marked? This would make it the first time in history that bitcoin is marking such a trend. However, what is even more important is what seven consecutive red candles mean for the cryptocurrency. With the digital asset still being a seller&apos;s market, a close like this could trigger even more sell-offs as investors worry about the future of the coin in the short term.

42374720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw26xH,1652720279,Crypto Funds Saw Year's Highest Inflows as Terra Crisis Crashed Markets,"Digital-asset funds last week netted their highest inflows since late 2021 as investors bought into market panic caused by Terra's implosion.  Crypto funds racked up $274 million in inflows in the week through May 13, when the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) – a cryptocurrency that's supposed to trade at a fixed price of $1 – dropped to a few cents, wiping out most of its $18 billion market capitalization and also making the blockchain's native token LUNA, once a top-10 cryptocurrency, virtually worthless.  James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said it was a ""strong signal that investors saw the recent UST stablecoin depeg and its associated broad sell-off as a buying opportunity.""  Bitcoin-focused funds were the clear winners, netting $299 million in inflows, the highest weekly inflow since the last week of October 2021. The data suggests that ""investors were flocking to the relative safety of the largest digital asset,"" Butterfill said.  The flurry of investment came as bitcoin (BTC) dipped to as low as $25,892 on Thursday amid fears Luna Foundation Guard, the organization that was supposed to support UST in a crisis, might panic-sell its reserve of roughly 80,000 bitcoin. The price of bitcoin recovered most if its losses late last week to change hands around $30,000, a significant psychological level.  Investors were polarized geographically because funds listed in North American saw $312 million of inflows, while $32 million flowed out of European funds.  Bitcoin ETF  Purpose, the provider of the largest bitcoin exchange-traded fund listed in Canada, booked $284 million in inflows, dwarfing flows of competitors.  Non-bitcoin funds struggled in the market sell-off, as some $26.7 million flowed out of funds managing ether (ETH), while vehicles focused on solana (SOL) recorded $5 million of outflows.  Investors in blockchain-related stocks apparently panicked, with some $51 million leaving funds that manage blockchain and crypto-focused equities.  In contrast, multi-asset funds, which manage more than one cryptocurrency, recorded $8.6 million in inflows, suggesting that some investors preferred a diversified approach.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/crypto-funds-saw-years-highest-inflows-as-terra-crisis-crashed-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b2e0830242cfeffc055341c4d48807a14a4a76-1400x988.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That is to say, their artwork only goes up in value once they pass away. Pablo Picasso was famously broke for nearly his whole career as a living artist.

India's Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had suggested that no prominent public figures, including celebrities and famous athletes, should endorse crypto products and that an ad disclosure should also talk about possible violations of existing laws, according to a report by the Hindu Business Line.  SEBI submitted a written report of its views to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, the newspaper's report said.  ""This appears to be the view of SEBI in ongoing discussions within the government,"" said Manisha Kapoor, the ad council's CEO.  ""ASCI has a specific guideline on celebrities. Plus, there is a clause in the crypto guidelines as well. We have always maintained that celebrities need to do their due diligence on the claims they endorse. And the Consumer Protection Act, too, lays down penalties for endorsers in case the [ad] they feature in is found misleading, and if they have done no due diligence. Endorsers may not have domain expertise, but they must take the effort to do due diligence as part of their responsibilities,"" Kapoor said.  ASCI's role  ASCI doesn't have the authority to ban celebrities from endorsing any products. That authority rests with the government alone. The group's guidelines, however, are considered a blueprint to follow to protect Indian consumers' interests in the interest of self-regulation in advertising.  ""ASCI needs celebrities to be careful. Since banning or not is not in our preview, it’s not a stance ASCI can take or has taken,"" Kapoor said.  While the government may be evaluating the possibility of imposing a ban, it may not be realistic and could potentially be challenged, a source familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Late last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led a meeting to consider regulations for cryptocurrencies. According to reports, a strong consensus was reached to stop ""attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising.""  In February, ASCI released fresh guidelines to require crypto ads to carry disclaimers. The guidelines became effective on April 1.  Under India's Consumer Protection Act, celebrities can be fined up to $13,000 for a false or misleading ad in the first instance and $65,000 for additional violations, with the possibility of a complete ban on endorsing any product for up to three years.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/16/regulators-proposal-to-ban-indian-celebrities-from-endorsing-crypto-has-not-been-discussed-by-ad-policy-body,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4647ae58510486202cad368dec43530dca92919c-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The government has said that [it] will move forward with the taxation of crypto,"" Susana Duarte, an associated partner at Abreu Advogados law firm in Lisbon, told CoinDesk. While she confirmed the new policy will include a capital gains tax, the government, she said, has not yet explained how staking or yield farming might be affected.  Portugal was previously considered a tax haven for cryptocurrency investors, in part due to an effective capital gains rate of zero.  ""There is no specific law, it is just a lack of regulation that led to the zero taxation in Portugal,"" said Duarte. ""This together with an understanding published by the Portuguese tax authority in 2016 meant that only crypto-related businesses can be taxed.""  As for her local clients, Duarte said there's concern, with both individual and corporate entities seeking clarification and certainty on the government's proposal.  The current capital gains tax rate for financial investment in Portugal is 28%.  Portugal's changed stance on taxes brings the country in line with many other nations around the globe.

42411798,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5jD,1652714943,What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?,"As a celebration, Bitcoin Pizza Day is appropriately named. The occasion commemorates an early cryptocurrency adopter who bought two pizzas using bitcoin on May 22, 2010. This was the first time anyone was reported to have to used bitcoin to buy physical goods (that we know of).  The person in question was a Floridian programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz, who was also an early bitcoin miner.  Prior to the first bitcoin halving in 2012, each successful miner was rewarded with 50 BTC for discovering a new block. This meant one only needed to mine 200 blocks to earn 10,000 BTC, which wasn’t particularly difficult considering there weren’t that many people competing to mine them at that time.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  On May 18, Hanyecz announced on a forum called Bitcointalk.org that he was looking to buy pizza – preferably two large ones – using bitcoin. He offered 10,000 BTC to anyone who would be willing to order, collect and bring them to him. Someone pointed out that he could get $41 for those bitcoins on a certain exchange website, which priced BTC at less than half a cent per coin.  In an interview with CBS in 2019, Hanyecz told Anderson Cooper he thought the transaction “made [bitcoin] real for some people. It certainly did for me”.  By May 21, he still hadn’t managed to find anyone to complete his bitcoin pizza transaction with. Then, finally, the next day someone took him up on the offer. A move that would later go down in history.  Read more: What Can You Buy With Bitcoin?  “I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.” The pizzas were made by Papa John’s, but Hanyecz had bought them secondhand from an 19-year-old named Jeremy Sturdivant (username ""jercos"").  Needless to say, those same bitcoins appreciated in value fairly steeply over the following decade. In fact, if Hanyecz had hypothetically sold his entire stash at bitcoin’s all-time high of $68,990, he could have made around $690 million – enough to buy 46 million large Papa John’s pizzas at $15 a piece.  In light of this historic event, the global crypto community comes together every year on May 22 to celebrate the first physical bitcoin transaction and to remind Hanyecz how he could’ve been one-tenth as wealthy as Melinda Gates.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-pizza-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1cfcbb83fcfcfae1a1e637054d331a8ba918c70-1498x1123.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filing comes at a time when crypto-linked stocks have been tumbling along with broader equity markets. Investors have hit the sell button on almost all asset classes amid surging inflation, recessionary fears and geopolitical unrest.  Celsius Mining has been active in the mining industry via investing and lending as well as helping host the miners to which it lends.

42423330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRdh,1652714762,Mawson to Develop New Bitcoin Mining Site in Texas,"Bitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) said it plans to develop a new 120 megawatt (MW) facility in Texas and expects it to be fully operational by the fourth quarter.  Site development is expected to start this quarter.  The facility could potentially accommodate up to 4 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity, the miner said in a statement.  Mawson is working to secure the power purchase agreements required to start the facility and will utilize both carbon credits and renewable energy credits as well as participate in curtailment programs to ensure grid load management.  The miner is working with a bitcoin miner that uses wasted natural gas, JAI Energy, and one of the largest landowners in the state, Texas Pacific Land (TPL), both of which will share in the revenue streams. They will also have an option to acquire an equity interest in Mawson’s Texas unit, Luna Squares Texas LLC.  The decision to start a new site comes as Texas requires new large scale miners to seek permission before connecting to the grid because the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) expects a pickup in demand resulting from more miners coming into the state.  In fact, Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, said during a conference call that it's looking to potentially diversify out of Texas, as there might be a time when there is too much load on the grid because of miners flocking into the state.  Mawson also reported first quarter earnings on Monday, saying revenue rose 178% from the year before while falling about 1% from the previous quarter.  The shares of the miner were down about 4% on Monday.

42423342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRxh,1652714476,German Regulator Calls for New DeFi Laws,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) needs to be subject to new regulations, a senior German financial regulator said, citing the risk of hacks and fraud.  The comments come as European Union regulators consider whether a flagship crypto law known as MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) should extend beyond currencies like bitcoin to cover other Web 3 innovations in the financial sector.  “If DeFi is to be a genuine competitor to traditional financial markets, then this won’t work without specific new regulations,” said Birgit Rodolphe, an anti-money laundering official at German financial regulator BaFin.  “Experience shows that DeFi is not quite as grassroots and selfless as fans of the space depict,” she said, citing abundant technical problems, hacks and dubious activity that cost hundreds of millions.  “Ideally such provisions would of course be consistent EU-wide, to prevent a fragmented market and to boost Europe’s collective innovation potential,” she added, noting DeFi applications such as insurance, lending and securities.  Germany recently topped a CoinCub survey of the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions, in part because of its favorable tax treatment for the assets.  The European Commission originally proposed the MiCA rule to regulate stablecoins, but lawmakers and governments are now wrangling over whether crypto rules should cover DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  To the relief of some in the sector, lawmakers appear to be moving away from imposing new DeFi regulations for now. Rather, they are asking the Commission to study the issue.  But some in the industry have warned that regulation could generate uncertainty in a nascent industry. Responding to Rodolphe's comments, Sakhib Waseem, Chief Innovation Officer at Switzerland's Astra Protocol, also told CoinDesk it could undermine the whole philosophy of DeFi, as supervisors in the U.S, EU and globally will tend to look for entities that can take responsibility for finance projects.  ""Unless we take action to meet with regulators ... to strike the balance, we could see centralization for all customers going forward and rapid action from an enforcement perspective which would stifle the growth of this innovative industry,"" Waseem said.

Due to its similarity to TerraUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar; Luna experienced a price drop. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real currencies, and prices plummeted when the US dollar decoupled from it earlier this week. When UST lost its peg, it was evident that algorithmic stablecoins are inherently faulted assets. Its value plummeted as a result of this. On Wednesday, Binance briefly banned withdrawals on Luna, and the Terra blockchain was fully terminated on Thursday night as a result of the Terra ecosystem meltdown. Let&apos;s understand various lessons from this crash in this article. Crisis management requires more than on-chain oversight The best option was to put the mint/burn gauge on hold. This would freeze UST liquidation into a tiny LUNA order book, however removing the gauge would necessitate a 7-day vote per protocol design. Delays in governance resulted in inferior choices. Rapid decision-making is required for crisis management The buffet offered to invest in Lehman Brothers at a price that angered the CEO in 2008. However, Lehman pushed Buffet to invest months later, but he declined. Therefore, it is not about the money, but about trust and reputation. Lehman did not listen to Buffet and crashed later.

42423344,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YS1h,1652710694,First Mover Americas: May Brings Showers Not Flowers as Bitcoin Languishes in Terra Aftermath,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Brad Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off this week.)  Market Moves: May was supposed to be a strong market for bitcoin. Instead crypto markets have been pummeled by the Terra blockchain crisis and ever-tighter Federal Reserve monetary policies.  Feature: Where did all that bitcoin go? The Luna Foundation Guard behind the ""reserve"" for Terra's UST stablecoin provides an update, but skeptics abound.  Price Point  The month of May is typically one of the strongest times of the year for bitcoin's performance, with an average 18% return over the past nine years.  But as crypto markets head into the back half of May, bitcoin is down 21% so far this month, currently around $30,000, and few analysts are predicting a quick rebound. CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa reported Monday that bitcoin (BTC) has now fallen for a record seven straight weeks – a dismal stretch that's unparalleled in nearly a decade of pricing history on the largest cryptocurrency.  Aside from the epic collapse last week of the Terra blockchain's LUNA token and its UST stablecoin (more on that below), there appears to be little relief ahead from the direction of traditional markets. The Federal Reserve shows little inclination to ease back from tightening monetary policy aggressively to tamp down the hottest inflation in four decades.  Bitcoin has become increasingly correlated with U.S. technology stocks lately, so a hawkish Fed just puts more pressure on the cryptocurrency's price. (Economic data is expected this week on the state of U.S. manufacturing, retail sales and the housing market.)  ""Adding to the downside is the bleak outlook for U.S. monetary policy, where no light at the end of the tunnel with rate hikes can be seen yet,"" FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told Malwa in an email. ""We expect the bears not to loosen their grip in the coming weeks.""  U.S. stock futures were lower on Monday, along with European equity indexes.  Market Moves  Goldman Sachs Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein over the weekend offered an example of just how bearish the sentiment has become, stating the U.S. economy was at a “very, very high risk.” Such an environment could cause a drawdown in U.S. equities, which may spread to bitcoin and cause further sell-offs in the coming weeks if the current correlation continues.  ""Multiple headwinds have given market players almost nowhere to hide in any asset class,"" David Duong, head of research for Coinbase Institutional, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The downside scenarios are certainly still in play.""  Duong says that from a price-chart perspective, bitcoin is in a “no-man’s land” with the next major technical support at the 200-week moving price average around the $22,000-23,000 area. ""If things were to deteriorate further, the next line of support would come at around $20,000, which was the all-time high in the previous 2017/2018 cycle,"" according to Duong.  The debacle that was last week's destruction of more than $40 billion of value from the Terra collapse has left crypto traders rattled. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index from the website Alternative.me is registering ""extreme fear."" BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes described the Terra episode as ""Luna Brothers Inc.,"" recalling the swift collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 that nearly brought down the global financial system. ""With the so-called death spiral now halted, investors will be keen to see if tokens can maintain their price levels for the next few days at least,"" Simon Peters, a market analyst for the crypto trading platform eToro, wrote Monday.  That said, there may be more signs of contagion from the Terra fallout. Deus Finance's stablecoin dei (DEI) lost its peg with U.S. dollar and fell to as low as 54 cents in European hours on Monday, data shows. And the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley wrote in a report last week that high-flying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) might be due for a reevaluation, arguing that the most speculative and leveraged areas of crypto markets are now in focus.  To be sure, the biggest hope for the bulls might come from reports of continuing interest in cryptocurrencies from Wall Street and institutional investors. Elwood Technologies, the cryptocurrency company backed by billionaire fund manager Alan Howard, raised $70 million in a funding round co-led by Goldman Sachs and Dawn Capital, CoinDesk's Ian Allison reported Monday.  ""Retail investors are no longer alone in seeing the value of the sector, and in the background long-term investor plans are still being built,"" Peters wrote.  Latest Headlines  Bitcoin Sees 7 Straight Weeks of Losses for First Time Fears of inflation and poor macroeconomic sentiment have caused bitcoin to fail as an inflation hedge in recent weeks.

Nigeria’s SEC Affirms All Digital Assets Are Securities in New Rule Book Rules look to clarify crypto’s role in the economy by providing a regulatory framework.  Luna Foundation Guard Left With 313 Bitcoin After UST Crash  By Sam Kessler  The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), official stewards of Terra’s bitcoin reserves, released a statement on Monday documenting how it disbursed millions of dollars worth of crypto in its failed attempt to maintain the peg of stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  In the statement, LFG notes that its BTC reserves have depleted almost entirely – from around 80,000 BTC to about 300. The remaining assets, which are mostly comprised of the crashed UST and LUNA tokens, will apparently be used to compensate investors.  Monday’s statement from LFG comes amid criticism that Terra’s reserve funds – which were supposed to belong to the “decentralized” Terra community – were handled with a lack of transparency by Terra’s centralized leaders and investors.  It also comes after leading figures in the blockchain space, including Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin, have called for Terra to compensate smaller holders of UST and LUNA before its largest investors.  ""There seems to be little hope for those hoping that some of the reserves could be used to compensate users of the stablecoin – since so little of it remains,"" Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder at the blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, wrote in an email. ""Of course we will wait to see whether LFG can provide proof to back up their statements.""

42423337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRrh,1652709947,Bitcoin Miner Bitfarms Lowers Hashrate Outlook to 6 EH/s This Year,"Canadian bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF) lowered its 2022 hashrate guidance to 6 exashash per second (EH/s) from 7.2 EH/s previously, citing adjustments to its ongoing expansion projects.  The company’s existing infrastructure construction contracts are projected to provide capacity for 6 EH/s of miners by year-end 2022, reflecting adjustments to its Argentina construction plan and expansion opportunities in Canada and Paraguay, the miner said in a statement.  Previously, the miner said its existing miner orders and contracted infrastructure expansion should allow a hashrate of about 7.2 EH/s, with potential to expand to 8 EH/s by year end.  However, Bitfarms is still evaluating opportunities to reach the 8 EH/s expansion goal by 2022, according to the statement.  “Our updated development activities in Argentina, Washington, and Quebec continue on track in support of our 2022 quarterly EH/s goals,” said President and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Morphy. “Our business development for 2022 and into 2023 are focused on a broad portfolio of opportunities, with a diversified mix in various regions where we are currently operating as well as new geographies,” he added.  The miner’s first-quarter revenue was $40 million which was up 40% from the previous year’s quarter but was down about 33% from the previous quarter due to a decline in the market price of bitcoin in Q1.  “We have grown faster than the BTC network, as our hashrate at quarter end was 2.7 Exahash per second (EH/s), up 22% from December 31, 2021,” Morphy said in the statement. “As of today, our hashrate is 3.4 EH/s, representing about 1.5% market share,” he noted.  The shares of the miners were down about 1.5% in early trading on Monday, while the price of bitcoin hovered around $30,000, down slightly over the last 24 hours.

42423339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRvh,1652703499,Fantom Stablecoin DEI Becomes Latest to Lose Dollar Peg,"Deus Finance's stablecoin dei (DEI) lost its peg with U.S. dollar and fell to as low as 54 cents in European hours on Monday, data shows. The drop came amid several algorithmic stablecoins losing their peg last week.  Algorithmic stablecoins are supposed to be automatically pegged to the price of another currency. These are unlike centralized alternatives like tether (USDT) or USD coin (USDC), which are backed by actual dollars or equivalent assets stored in a bank.  DEI, valued at over $62 million by market capitalization, operates within Deus, a Fantom-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project. It comprises 10% DEUS tokens and 90% in other stablecoins.  The collateral ratio of DEI is constantly monitored and adjusted via arbitrage bots, which continually trade $1 worth of the underlying tokens for 1 DEI, or vice versa, to ensure a peg.  DEI – which traded 3 cents below its peg on Sunday – lost 20 cents on Sunday night as traders likely exchanged DEI tokens for USDC amid a small amount of liquidity on decentralized exchanges, which caused price fluctuations. Lower prices led to more traders selling DEI for other tokens, presumably to protect against risks, which further contributed to a price drop.  Separately, Deus developers had earlier paused a redemption mechanism for DEI – which allows investors to redeem DEI for other tokens – that may have contributed to the decline.  As such, developers on Deus’ Telegram channel explained the lower liquidity was partly due to traders exiting stablecoin pools after UST’s collapse last week and a lower-than-usual backing for DEI tokens after a $13.4 million exploit on the Deus protocol in late April.  Meanwhile, DEI has regained the 72 cents level at writing time, with Deus developers stating a repegging plan using debt tokens was in place that would prevent a collapse of the peg in the future.  The slump follows Terra ecosystem project UST costing its investors billions of dollars as it lost its peg and fell to as low as 22 cents. Associated token luna (LUNA) dropped to pennies from trading over $100 earlier this month, losing as much as 99.7% of its value in under a week.  Panic around UST last week led to a similar sell-off in other stablecoins, such as Waves’ stablecoin USDN which lost 15%.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/fantom-stablecoin-dei-becomes-latest-to-lose-dollar-peg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09b0852aebc48f5c11d4d4a0974ba7ba1bbfd7f2-1500x1043.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital land have been subject to much speculation and inflows, the report says, adding that the reason most people bought these assets was based on the expectation that another buyer would want to purchase them for a higher price in dollars.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded.  The bank notes that while crypto markets have been trading badly since November, they have been shocked by the collapse of the third largest stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in recent days.  Crypto-backed stablecoins have become an important part of the leverage built within the DeFi ecosystem, the note says, adding that this one event has led to increased uncertainty and instability that has resulted in a “broader re-evaluation of where many crypto prices should be trading at.”  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries.  The most speculative and leveraged areas of crypto markets are now in focus as interest rates rise globally and the U.S. Federal Reserve removes liquidity, the note adds.  The massive increase in stablecoin market capitalization – a thirtyfold rise since early 2020 – has had an influence on crypto pricing as well, as stablecoins were responsible for providing much liquidity and leverage, the bank says in the note.

42423340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRth,1652699675,Bitcoin Sees 7 Straight Weeks of Losses for First Time,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had seven straight weeks of losses for the time first in its history amid a downturn in broader markets, stricter crypto regulations, waning retail interest and systemic risks in the crypto sector, data shows.  Bitcoin neared the $47,000 level in mid-March in a run that lasted a couple of weeks after a fall to $37,000 from November’s lifetime highs of nearly $69,000. The asset has since slid every week and could fall to as low as $20,000 if current market conditions continue.  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been long positioned as a hedge against inflation, or an investment that is supposed to protect against the decreased purchasing power of currencies or other assets.  That has failed to happen so far, however, as bitcoin is highly correlated with global markets and has traded similar to a risky technology stocks in the past few months. Meanwhile, some analysts say investors are selling bitcoin as it advances.  ""In our view, the trend of selling cryptocurrency on upside movements remains. Adding to the downside is the bleak outlook for U.S. monetary policy, where no light at the end of the tunnel with rate hikes can be seen yet,"" FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote in an email.  ""We expect the bears not to loosen their grip in the coming weeks. In our opinion, a turnaround in sentiment may not come until the approach of the 2018 highs area near $19,600,"" Kuptsikevich added.  Bitcoin fell to as low as $24,000 last week as stablecoin tether (USDT) briefly lost its peg to the U.S. dollar. Sentiment among investors was already reeling from the implosion of Terra’s LUNA and its stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  Inflation concerns affect bitcoin prices  Inflation concerns have contributed to bitcoin’s fall in the past several weeks. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates by the largest amount since 2000 as it seeks to tighten monetary policy following $2 trillion in stimulus in the past few years.  In April, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note that the Fed's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession. The investment bank put the odds of an economic contraction – a phase of the business cycle in which the economy as a whole is in decline – at about 35% over the next two years.  Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein reiterated that sentiment over the weekend, stating the U.S. economy was at a “very, very high risk.” Such an environment could cause a drawdown in U.S. equities, which may spread to bitcoin and cause further sell-offs in the coming weeks if the current correlation continues.  The risks of a sell-off could already be starting to show. Last week, the $18.3 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world's largest bitcoin fund, saw its market discount widen to an all-time low of 30.79%, as reported. The discount could be taken as a bearish indicator because it might mean a waning interest in bitcoin among traders. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  GBTC is one of the only ways for traders in the U.S. to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin without the need to purchase the actual cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin was hovering under the pivotal support level of $30,000 at the time of this writing, CoinGecko data shows.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/bitcoin-sees-seven-straight-weeks-of-losses-for-the-first-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b336dc021a9bb78e254d812a508acf623eb9569f-1794x896.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The timeline for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) has been pushed back and forward because of concerns over Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rise of private stablecoins like Facebook’s now-abandoned libra.  “The idea would be that, let’s say, four years from now, we will be ideally ready to issue the digital euro,” Fabio Panetta, a member of the European Central Bank’s executive board, said at an event at the National College of Ireland. “It’s a very complex project, never done before … I’m a bit optimistic that in four years’ time we will be prepared.”  Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, allowing transactions among friends, could be the first testing ground for the new technology before it spreads to other areas like payments in stores or online, Panetta suggested.  “A P2P payment solution that covers a broad set of users across the entire euro area could provide fertile ground for the adoption of a digital euro,” he said, citing research that showed the application would have widest use early on.  Read more: ECB's Panetta Blasts Crypto as ‘Ponzi Scheme’ Fueled by Greed  In October, the ECB started a two-year investigation phase to look at issues like what use cases to prioritize, although the ECB hasn't decided yet on whether to issue a digital euro in the first place. Panetta has previously said that a realization phase due to start late next year could last three years.  In March, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the sanctions following the war in Ukraine offered a reason to speed up the plans, but other EU officials Monday suggested they were taking their foot off the gas pedal.  “There was some time back a sense of more urgency, because of the concerns of what might happen from private providers,” Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial-services commissioner, said at the same event. “Nobody is rushing … we need to move swiftly but not hastily.”  The idea of the EU issuing its own CBDC first emerged after an industry consortium led by Facebook proposed its own crypto currency, libra, subsequently renamed diem before being abandoned.  But recent collapses in the private crypto market may add yet one more reason to pursue the project, Panetta said.  Stablecoins don’t have the regulatory safety net offered to banks and “are therefore vulnerable to runs,” he said, citing the crash last week of terraUSD (UST), which is supported by the nonprofit Luna Foundation Guard.  “Just last week the world’s biggest stablecoin temporarily lost its peg to the dollar,” he added, referring to the Tether asset (USDT).

42423322,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YRTh,1652695183,LFG Reserves Dwindle to Just 313 Bitcoins From 80K After UST Crash,"The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), official stewards of Terra’s bitcoin (BTC) reserves, released a statement on Monday documenting how it disbursed millions of dollars' worth of crypto in its failed attempt to maintain the peg of stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  In the statement, LFG notes that it has almost entirely depleted its BTC reserves from around 80,000 bitcoins to 313. The remaining assets, which mostly comprise the crashed UST and LUNA tokens, will apparently be used to compensate investors.  In a subsequent tweet, LFG denied accusations that it bailed out whales with the bitcoin trove: “there was never any deal for ‘insiders’ to exit. LFG funds were merely used squarely within its mandate to help protect UST peg.”  In one of the most calamitous events in crypto memory, the $40 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed last week when the UST stablecoin, which is supposed to be worth $1, dropped to below 20 cents. The LUNA token, which is designed to serve as a sort of shock absorber for UST’s “algorithmic” dollar-pegging mechanism, crashed from $80 to below 2 cents.  In a tweet on Monday, LFG said it sold off most of the BTC in its reserves for UST as Terra’s ecosystem was beginning to collapse early last week.  LFG said it transferred more than 50,000 bitcoins “to trade with a counterparty” on May 8, as the UST price was originally starting to slump.  It said the funds were used for “directly executing on-chain swaps and transferring $BTC to a counterparty to enable them to enter trades with the Foundation in large size and on short notice.”  On May 12, LFG said another 30,000 BTC from its reserves were sold off by Terraform Labs, the original company behind Terra, “in a last ditch effort to defend the peg.”  That, however, failed to restore UST’s peg to the U.S. dollar as traders continued to sell the token for other stablecoins, leading to an exodus of capital away from UST and thus lower prices.  LFG confirmed the remainder of its reserves, which once totaled over $3 billion, have sunk almost completely as a result of the unsuccessful effort to defend UST.  LFG says these funds will be used “to compensate remaining users of UST, smallest holders first.”  Monday’s statement from LFG comes amid criticism that Terra’s reserve funds, which were supposed to belong to the “decentralized” Terra community, were handled with a lack of transparency by Terra’s centralized leaders and investors.  It also comes after leading figures in the blockchain sector, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have called for Terra to compensate smaller holders of UST and LUNA before its largest investors.  UST’s price plummeted further in response to Monday’s announcement – from 15 cents to 7 cents.  Meanwhile, only about $80 million worth of other cryptocurrencies – apart from UST and LUNA – remain in LFG’s reserves at current prices, a tiny figure compared with its $10 billion target reserve at the start of this month.

Considering that Ape #6462 has some of the rarest attributes, which include a bone necklace, police motorcycle helmet, and a bored pizza, it is possible that the NFT sale was yet another costly mistake.

The Grayscale Future of Finance UCITS ETF (GFOF) will list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana and will be available to investors across Europe. Trading in the ETF is set to start Tuesday, a company representative said.  The ETF will track the Bloomberg Grayscale Future of Finance Index, which was launched in January to track the performance of financial services and technology companies in the digital economy. They include PayPal (PYPL), Coinbase Global (COIN), Block (SQ), Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and Argo Blockchain (ARB).  CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in April that the digital asset manager wanted to enter the European crypto fund market, where there are already over 70 exchange-traded products with a total of $7 billion in crypto and related assets. The new company-focused ETF will join incumbents such as the VanEck Vectors Digital Assets Equity ETF (DAPP) and Melanion Capital's BTC Equities Universe ETF (BTC).  A similar ETF, which has been listed in the U.S. since February on the NYSE Arca, was designed to broaden Grayscale's offering away from direct investment in digital assets, offering investors exposure to companies whose performance is indirectly linked to the crypto market.  Grayscale is currently seeking to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve such a product despite having received dozens of applications in recent years.
