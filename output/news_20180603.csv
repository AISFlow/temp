42401584,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0C4Z,1528034453,An Upcoming Cryptocurrency Is Trialling a Trio of Bitcoin Tech Advances,"""[I'm] very much waiting for you guys to finish in a sea of shitcoins.""  With that, pseudonymous forum user 'Monkeyyy' just might have summed up the sentiment surrounding a forthcoming cryptocurrency called ""grin."" Rising to renown last year as the first software implementation for a code proposal known as MimbleWimble, the idea is to start a new blockchain that has better scale and privacy than bitcoin.  That concept has won praise from developers who are normally wary of new ideas, namely because many of them don't turn out as great as promised (or otherwise devolve into get-rich-quick-schemes). But rather than coding their own solutions, grin's contributors are all about adopting technology that's been reviewed and approved by a circle of experts.  As the team wades into their second test stage, preparing to launch a working payment system, they've been among the first to implement Schnorr, Bulletproofs and Dandelion, all promising technologies originally intended to improve bitcoin's scale and privacy, but that just haven't made it into the hard-to-change cryptocurrency just yet.  Lead grin developer Igno Peverell, named after an obscure Harry Potter character, told CoinDesk:  ""Testnet 2 was and is likely to stay our largest release in terms of new technology.""  It's also ambitious. In turning MimbleWimble into a real, working software for payments, the developer team behind grin has added features that have been years in the making.  ""Signature aggregation,"" for instance, has been in the works for bitcoin since 2014 and is one of its most highly anticipated code changes. Pioneered by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, the project ""MuSig"" has the potential to lump signature data together and free up space in the blockchain.  A working prototype has already been implemented, though it's unclear when it will be added to bitcoin and if the community will ultimately embrace the change.  Scalability boost  Therein lies one advantage of grin, which is more quickly putting such ideas to the test with real value.  Bitcoin is a living payment system, so developers and the community are particularly cautious when making changes that could be dangerous to its users.  ""Bitcoin developers have working implementations of MuSig, but deploying it on the mainnet will take time. Actually, it must absolutely not be rushed,"" said cryptography expert Yannick Seurin, who's been helping with the cryptography behind MuSig at cybersecurity agency ANSSI.  But grin is launching a blockchain from scratch, so it's easier for the developer team to adopt sweeping changes - at least while the blockchain is still small.  ""Since Grin is more experimental, they can afford testing newer primitives such as MuSig,"" Seurin continued.  It's worth noting though that in grin, signature aggregation plays a much more fundamental role. Unlike bitcoin, grin uses signature aggregation by default in transactions to remove data bitcoin normally has to keep to preserve the security of transactions.  Privacy boost  Then there's bulletproofs, a breakthrough privacy technology unveiled by bitcoin developers late last year.  Though bitcoin developers are worried about cryptocurrency privacy, and bulletproofs could help significantly with that, there are still major drawbacks. Bulletproof transactions are still too big. Even though the tech is more scalable, bulletproofs require a lot more room on the blockchain than normal transactions. And with users already very concerned about how big existing blockchains are getting, it would probably be pretty difficult to get agreement from everyone to make the change.  Other blockchains  might not care about these downsides though. Privacy-minded monero and litecoin both plan to add this technology soon. And so does grin. Its developers are testing bulletproofs to help with its other main feature: enhancing privacy.  And while bulletproofs might be contentious in bitcoin, grin is a different story. For one, because of the above reliance on signature aggregation, grin is more scalable. So, bulletproofs increasing the size of transactions is not as big of a deal.  In fact, MimbleWimble was one use case that drove the innovation.  ""Confidential transactions and Mimblewimble were one of the motivating applications for bulletproofs,"" Stanford University PhD student Benedikt Bunz, who pioneered bulletproofs, told CoinDesk.  That's not the only privacy technology they're adding, however. Peverell contends grin is the first cryptocurrency to adopt Dandelion, a long-proposed privacy addition to bitcoin.  Once someone sends cryptocurrency to someone using most blockchains, the transaction is sent to all nodes, without trying to hide where it came from. Because of this, it's easy to glean the IP address of whoever sent the transaction.  Dandelion introduces a second phase here called ""fluffing"" the transactions, which ""makes it a lot harder to identify where transactions originate from,"" Peverell said.  Though, Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli told CoinDesk he's optimistic bitcoin will eventually adopt the change, calling it a ""pretty important"" privacy feature. The reason it hasn't been implemented in bitcoin is no developers have had time to pick up the task just yet, he argued.  Toward reality  That's not to say there won't be significant hurdles.  One rather huge drawback of MimbleWimble's approach is that in order to get the scalability and privacy benefits, transactions are much simpler than bitcoin's. That means, it makes it harder to do more complex types of transactions, like requiring two or three people to sign off on a transaction before it can be sent, or to build more scalable infrastructure, such as lightning network, on top of it.  There's still hope, though.  Peverell is excited about signature aggregation because it can pave the way for still other future technologies, such as scriptless scripts, a technology that could reintroduce a way for users to do these types of complex transactions using grin.  According to Peverell, most of the technical heavy lifting will be out of the way once they finish their second testnet.  But there are a number of steps left before they can be sure there aren't any problems with the payment system and they're ready to launch. Peverell noted grin is launching yet another testnet (their third) to finalize some changes and stomp out as many bugs as possible.  The loose volunteer team also wants to build out the wallet to be more ""user-friendly,"" since being easy to use is something cryptocurrencies tend to struggle with. And finally, they want a third party to audit Grin's code.  This sounds like a lot, but Peverell hopes they'll be able to launch the payment system for real by the end of the year, at which point the team can put the experimental concepts its trial to test in a live environment with real funds.  He stated:  ""I'm still optimistic for this winter.""

42401595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0CFO,1528027202,How Hodl Hodl Is Building a Real Business With Bitcoin Smart Contracts,"Bitcoin may be the original cryptocurrency, but it can still learn new tricks.  In an industry where bitcoin has taken a backseat to networks like ethereum, at least when it comes to enabling more complex and exotic transactions, both founders behind the peer-to-peer exchange platform Hodl Hodl believe people are underestimating bitcoin's potential. Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.  The exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchains by using what's known as a multi-signature smart contract.  Hodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.  Those contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller's keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company's server or database.  Because of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said:  ""Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.""  This paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.  ""It's better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,"" Snitko told CoinDesk.  This underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn't require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.  Hodl Hodl's private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.  ""No single party controls the funds on that address,"" Snitko said. ""That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we're not exactly a money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.""  By coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team's upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.  ""Because it's safer,"" Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. ""I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.""  Bitcoin's security perks  First and foremost, Hodl Hodl's interest in bitcoin derives from its security.  According to the founders, it's much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what's going on.  As such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.  Applying this exchange's smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.  Snitko said:  ""It's a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That's when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.""  The team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl's flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.  For example, according to the New York Law Journal, the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.  Even if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there's room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. ""I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,"" Snitko added, ""Because it's relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.""  On-chain advantages  Unlike the flagship exchange's pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.  Funds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.  ""You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,"" Keidun told CoinDesk.  Several American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.  In the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun's small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.  Many P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category. So Hodl Hodl allows private offers, which are only visible if the seller sends a direct link to the buyer, or vice versa. This is one advantage Hodl Hodl has over its competitors. And the users don't even need to sacrifice transparency for privacy, since the transactions are still on-chain, it's just that they aren't broadcasting the details a stranger would need to find them.  In addition, neither Hodl platform requires the user to cash out, the way incumbent P2P exchange LocalBitcoins does. Yet again, that points back to the fact that the escrow takes place on the blockchain itself.  ""That's one difference we have from LocalBitcoins, where your funds are essentially held on LocalBitcoins,"" Snitko told CoinDesk.  Come summertime, Househodl will also offer such private listings for buying or selling real estate directly with cryptocurrency.  ""The idea is that you don't need to cash out into a fiat currency to buy property,"" Snitko said, touching on the broader issue of balancing compliance with the bitcoin community's cypherpunk ethos by adding:  ""The most important challenge, I think, is to guarantee that the purchase is 100 percent legal and there are no legal loopholes to exploit.""
