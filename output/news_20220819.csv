Litecoin was one of the first altcoins. It was built from Bitcoin&apos;s source code and is similar to Bitcoin in many aspects, which has led many to call it digital silver.Litecoin remains one of the few early cryptocurrencies still widely used today. Its low transaction fees and fast transaction confirmation on its blockchain have made it maintain relevance in the cryptosphere. It is built to be a medium of day-to-day, peer-to-peer exchange.Bitcoin has significant volume, and it is a useful testing ground for Bitcoin applications. Based on this, I believe Litecoin will perform well in the coming years.Litecoin TechnologyLike many early cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, powerful computers known as miners compete to add transaction records to a block — records in a blockchain are stored in blocks. In the Bitcoin network, a block is added to the blockchain every ten minutes; after a block is added, the next block needs to wait in a queue for about ten minutes before it is added to the blockchain.Lite...",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4535868-litecoin-still-a-valuable-coin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/1501758.jpeg
1501482,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=499300,1660950033,Investor Sentiment Falls As Crypto Market Sheds $100 Billion,"The crypto market has now been put under another challenge. In the past day, bitcoin prices have dropped about $2,000, which has seen the crypto market lose a significant amount of value. As it now stands, the crypto market cap is down more than $100 billion and is now dangerously close to falling below $1 trillion once more. This has expectedly affected the market sentiment, triggering more fear in the market. Market Turns To Fear The crypto market had been seeing some recovery with the anticipation around the Ethereum Merge. But as the excitement has worn off, the market has started to see a drastic correction in price. Bitcoin had hit $25,000 at its peak this last recovery cycle. However, it has since shed the majority of those gains.

At its highest point, the Fear &amp; Greed Index has a score of 42, the highest point in four months. This put it as close to greed as it has been, but the market had other ideas. The price of bitcoin had retraced back below $22,000, and with it, the market sentiment had declined. It closed Thursday with a low score of 30, which put it firmly back in the fear territory. The retracement is reflected in the crypto market, falling from $1.1 trillion to about $1 trillion at the time of this writing.

42421121,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUWj,1660943843,"Bankrupt Lender Celsius CEO Owes Creditors Transparency, Crypto Lawyer Says","The U.S. Trustee overseeing the Celsius Network bankruptcy is right to seek an independent examiner because the crypto lender’s CEO hasn’t been forthright with information.  Sasha Hodder, founder of Hodder Law Firm, told CoinDesk TV Friday there needs to be more “transparency” from Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, including a list of what creditors are owed money. Hodder's firm, which works with bitcoin and crypto entrepreneurs, is not involved in the bankruptcy proceeding.  “If [Mashinsky] was being transparent, [the Trustee] would not have a need to pull in an independent examiner,” Hodder said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Read more: ‘Consumer Business Is Dead’ for Crypto Lender Celsius, Bankruptcy Expert Says  Creditors “are upset that [Celsius is] burning through the money very quickly,” Hodder said. The lender has been in bankruptcy proceedings since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July. On Thursday, the U.S. Trustee’s office filed with the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York seeking the appointment of an independent examiner.  Celsius said on Monday it was going to run out of money by the end of October. However, on Friday, during a hearing call with creditors, Chief Financial Officer Chris Ferraro now says Celsius has or will have enough money to fund operations at least through the end of the year. Ferraro said the company could fund operations via maturing loans and savings from its sales and taxes on its newly established Texas-based mining rigs. Mashinsky, who was also on the call, did not answer any questions.  “No one has been able to get any straight information out of Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky about how much they actually owe certain creditors,” Hodder said.  Read more: Sky-High Yields and Bright Red Flags: How Alex Mashinsky Went From Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius  In June, the crypto lender froze customer withdrawals in a bid to avoid a run on its deposits. By the end of the month, it turned to experts to help salvage and preserve its assets.  If the U.S. Trustee, which is responsible for overseeing bankruptcy matters including fraud, receives approval to assign an independent examiner, it may be likely that a list of what creditors are owed will finally be available, according to Hodder.  “We need more transparency,” she said. “[Of] the top 50 debtors, only 10 of them are known.”  Some may argue the warning signs were around even before the lender filed for bankruptcy, she said. Back in April, when the “market started to implode” and the company asked its clients to increase their bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the event it would have to use it as collateral, Hodder said, “it was disheartening for everyday investors.”  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius Tells Clients to Increase Collateral in Case of Margin Calls  Hodder added that because Trustee, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, is making the request to examine Celsius' financial operations, “it likely will go through.”  Until financial details are clear, however, Hodder said that Celsius should not only be more transparent, but should “stop spending exorbitant funds every day, fire all the staff [and] put everything on hold.” Back in July, the company spent $40 million, which it primarily used to set up its mining site.  Hodder said that if creditors are left without answers, it would be best “for [Mashinsky] to get charged criminally.”  “The probe into that criminal case may show that the creditors were lied to,” Hodder said.

42394895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWKwD,1660941862,Market Wrap: Bitcoin’s Price Plummets on Global Inflation Concerns,"Price Action  BTC Sells off Sharply in Response to Global Inflation Fears  Bitcoin (BTC) sold off sharply in Friday trading, and was recently trading below $21,500, down more than 8% over the last 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 13% for the week.  The decline started during overnight trading, coinciding with unexpectedly high inflation data in Germany. Germany’s annual producer inflation figures rose to a record high of 37% in July, versus expectations of 32%. Producer prices reflect the price of goods and services sold by manufacturers for a region. The German PPI data is analogous to U.S. PPI data. The United States’ July PPI reading was 9.8%, by comparison.  Following the announcement, the probability of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising the federal funds rate 75 basis points increased to 44.5% from 41% a day earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool.  Ether’s (ETH) price fell similarly, declining 8% on the day and 13% for the week. Altcoins recently dropped sharply, with SOL falling 10% while AVAX and MATIC declined 11% and 12%, respectively.  Traditional markets sold off to a lesser extent, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falling 0.8%, and the S&P 500 and tech heavy Nasdaq composite declining 2.1% and 1.3% respectively.  Gold, generally viewed as a safe haven against inflation, declined in price by 0.6%, while energy markets saw crude oil decrease 0.32% and natural gas increase 1.1%. Prices for copper futures rose 0.9%.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Overnight reaction to inflation data sends markets into oversold territory  Bitcoin took a significant downward turn overnight, reacting poorly to unexpectedly disappointing inflation numbers from Germany.  BTC’s hourly chart shows a 4% decline at 06:00 UTC, about the same time as the release of Germany’s PPI data. The report adds to market fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks will take aggressive measures to stem inflation, which would likely have a negative impact on asset prices.  The BTC hourly chart below illustrates the time of the German PPI announcement, in conjunction with the drop in BTC prices. The decline came along with excessive volume for the 06:00 UTC hour, when compared to BTC’s 20-hour moving average. The decline also occurred within a price range with lower volumes historically. The Volume Profile Visible Range tool (VPVR), applied to BTC’s hourly chart shows a collection of “low volume nodes” between $22,000- $21,000.  The VPVR tool measures levels of activity at specific price levels, and can show areas where price agreement occurs. Low volume nodes represent areas of lower activity, and often represent areas of increased price volatility.  BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the hourly chart plunged to oversold levels following the price decline. The RSI is a widely used technical indicator that measures price momentum. Readings of 70 and higher implies that an asset is overbought (i.e., overvalued), while readings of 30 or below imply that an asset is oversold (undervalued). BTC’s current RSI is 29.23.  Focus on put options at $21,000  The Aug. 16 Market Wrap highlighted BTC options open interest. Given today’s decline, note the concentration of put options at $21,000, which have increased to 3,300 BTC (previously below 2,000 BTC). A put option represents the option but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specific price.  Should BTC prices decline below $21,000, traders holding puts at $21,000 have motivation to exercise their right to sell BTC, which would put additional downside pressure on BTC.  Bitcoin’s daily chart shows a potential tug of war at the $21,000 mark  The VPVR tool on BTC’s daily chart shows a significant amount of price agreement at the $21,000 mark. Technical readings and open interest in derivatives markets imply that $21,000 is the mark where bullish and bearish BTC investors will face off.  Along with being a “high volume node,” $21,000 illustrates the “point of control,” illustrated by the red line in the chart below. The point of control within the VPVR tool indicates where the highest amount of price agreement occurs, and can often represent points of support and resistance.

In the aftermath of the announcement, the Santos FC fan token shot up by more than 150% from its value the day prior, to a high of about $15, while chiliz, the fansite platform’s main currency, rose by about 12%. Also up were Paris Saint-Germain, FC Barcelona and Juventus tokens, which each gained somewhere between 23% and 29% in value from Wednesday to Thursday.  By Friday, the market had cooled slightly with chiliz and Paris Saint-Germain tokens giving back around 7% and FC Barcelona’s value dropping 5.6%. But the tokens remained well above their pre-approval ranges, signaling that Thursday’s massive pumps had at least some staying power with soccer fans.  Socios.com founder and CEO, Alexandre Dreyfus says the site’s regulatory approval has bolstered faith in fan token rewards, which, in turn, has driven surging token prices.  “Regulation builds consumer confidence,” Dreyfus told CoinDesk. “Fan tokens as a very powerful digital asset class in their own right [are] growing, and with increased confidence and visibility comes increased demand.”  Socios.com received regulatory approval to offer virtual currencies and digital wallets for its fan engagement and rewards platform from Italian regulators on Aug. 5, expanding the multinational company’s presence in southern Europe. The company, which currently serves 1.5 million users, has already begun making inroads in Italy, one of Europe’s largest sports markets, by partnering with football clubs AC Milan, Inter Milan, Napoli, AS Roma and Juventus to create team-specific fan tokens.

42394885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWKiR,1660938815,#FreeAlexPertsev: Protests Planned for Amsterdam Following Tornado Cash Developer’s Arrest,"A week after the arrest of Tornado Cash software developer Alex Pertsev in the Netherlands, the outpouring of dissent from the international crypto community is about to take to the streets.  Pertsev’s wife, Xenia Malik, is encouraging supporters to demonstrate in Amsterdam’s historic Dam Square Saturday. She hopes the protest will bring publicity to the nature of Pertsev’s arrest.  “The accusations against Alex threaten to greatly harm the entire segment of open-source software,” Malik said in an email. “This is a major issue as it can affect every open-source developer and many other people in future.”  Pertsev, a 29-year old involved in developing the crypto-mixer service Tornado Cash was arrested Aug. 12 by Dutch authorities on suspicion of fraud, environmental crime and asset seizure. Days earlier, the U.S. government barred Americans from using Tornado Cash, citing North Korean hackers’ use of the tool to launder stolen cryptocurrency.  Read more: Tornado Cash Sanctions Are Spiraling Into Compliance Nightmares  While crypto mixers aren’t illegal, they provide anonymity in making transactions, which bad actors have used to launder funds gained illicitly. That raises the question of whether the developers behind these projects merit prosecution.  Opponents to the arrest are already mobilizing.  On Wednesday, Finnish product manager Daria Mironova created a Change.org petition to raise awareness around the reasons for the arrest.  “Open-source software is flexible and secure, as it can be audited, fixed and improved by anyone,” the petition says. “But a developer has no control whatsoever over how their open-source code is subsequently used.”  Mironova told CoinDesk that she was “really shocked” by the arrest and wants to help free Pertsev.  “If we don’t react now, in the future, we might see many cases where innocent developers go to prison when someone misuses their code,” she said, calling her effort a fight for free speech.  On Friday afternoon, there were 1,015 signatures. Once the petition amasses 40,000 signatures, Mironova plans to bring them to the authorities, making them aware of the public dissent.  Staging a protest  People are planning the protest in a Telegram group chat called #FreeAlex, sharing their demonstration strategy, expressing their hopes for Pertsev’s release and discussing legal protection of open-source developers.  In addition, Petr Korolev, co-founder of Blockchain audit company Oxorio, has set up a Gitcoin fund towards Pertsev’s release. Still pending approval, it will crowdsource crypto donations in Polygon and zSync.  But while protests, signatures and funds may bring attention to Pertsev’s situation, the greater question as to the freedom of open-source developers remains.  The discussion of how to protect developers’ rights predates Pertsev’s arrest. In January, former Twitter founder and Block (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey proposed a non-profit legal defense fund for Bitcoin developers, protecting them from lawsuits surrounding their work on the blockchain.  While Malik believes her husband’s case could set a harmful precedent for future open-source developers, for now she just wants him freed.  “The main goal [of the protest] is to attract the attention of the Dutch authorities and show that people care. And, of course, I hope for the speedy release of my husband from prison,” she said.

According to the guidance, OSFI categorizes cryptos as either Group 1 or Group 2 assets. Group 1 represents traditional assets that confer rights and obligations. Anything else is a Group 2 asset. Regulated entities need to notify OSFI if their total gross positions exceed 1% of their capital and if their total net short positions exceed 0.1% of their capital.  ""The scope of this advisory is limited to the capital and liquidity treatment of a FRFI’s exposures to crypto assets. The advisory does not address other issues, including whether a FRFI is permitted under the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act or Trust and Loan Companies Act to issue any particular crypto asset, or to acquire or hold a controlling or substantial investment in entities that engage in this activity,"" the guidance said. ""This advisory sets out OSFI’s expectations as to when FRFIs should notify their lead supervisor if they intend to have exposures to cryptoassets.""  If an entity does want to conduct other crypto-related activities, it needs to contact its supervisor at OSFI and share information as needed, the regulator said.  Thursday's publication marks the first major federal crypto rules for banks issued by a Canadian regulator.

42393777,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAyoP,1660937415,Many Bored Ape NFTs Are in Danger of Getting Liquidated as Borrowed Money Comes Back to Bite,"Dozens of Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens (NFT) used as collateral for loans sit perilously close to being forcibly sold, and there's worry that could trigger even more liquidations.  The problem is brewing at BendDAO, a peer-to-peer lending service that lets users borrow ether (ETH) against their NFTs. Customers can typically take out a loan equal to 30% to 40% of the NFT collection’s floor price, or the minimum price to purchase one on the open market, with the NFT pledged as collateral.  Floor prices have tumbled in recent months, so much so that 45 of the 272 Bored Apes with BendDAO loans tied to them are now in the platform's “danger zone,“ when an NFT used as collateral is close to being auctioned off. In other words, $5.3 million worth of Bored Apes are at risk of being liquidated.  BendDAO is popular among NFT collectors, so the scope of any fire sale could be massive. The 272 Bored Apes tied to BendDAO represent 2.72% of the entire collection.  A mass liquidation event could also have implications for other NFT lending services, which have risen to prominence in the past year as the NFT industry has exploded in popularity. Bored Apes are also heralded as the most important NFT collection to industry, so cascading liquidations in could have broader consequences for other collections down the ladder.  ”The short-term fluctuations in NFT floor price are normal,” BendDAO told CoinDesk in a statement. ”Consensus on blue chip NFTs wasn’t built in a day, and it will not be collapsed in a short period of time.”  Most Bored Ape holders at risk of being liquidated bought their ape pictures months ago when the floor price was 125 ETH. It's since fallen to just above 70 ETH amid a broader NFT rout. Collectors who used their Bored Apes as collateral can simply pay off the loan plus interest to withdraw the NFTs from the site.  Some of the issue lies in the mechanics of NFT trading, where floor prices will adjust as ETH’s price fluctuates against the U.S. dollar. Despite ETH’s climb from $1,000 to nearly $2,000 in the past month, lending services like BendDAO remain denominated in their originally lended token, causing some Bored Apes to be liquidated at higher dollar prices than where they were purchased.  As more high-priced NFTs go “on sale” in the form of liquidation auctions, collectors have begun window shopping for discounted prices. Bids on auctioned NFTs on BendDAO must be within 5% of the collection’s floor price, regardless of how appealing it might be.  Franklin has 60 apes  One prolific NFT collector known as Franklin quickly became a focus of concern as the largest borrower on the platform. Franklin owns 60 Bored Apes and has taken out more than 10,000 ETH (around $17.5 million) in loans from BendDAO, although Franklin tweeted that he has since paid off the loans.  Like many services in the crypto world, Franklin’s case shows how influential ""whales"" can be to smaller participants, with the moves of certain individuals having the ability to put entire ecosystems in danger.

USDC Exchange Reserve Observes Sharp Rise In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the large amount of USD Coin that flowed into exchanges recently could be deployed to act as fuel for Bitcoin. The &apos;exchange reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of USDC currently sitting in wallets of all centralized exchanges. Since stablecoins are tied to fiat (which in the case of USDC is USD), their value is as constant as the fiat currency itself. Because of this, investors often take shelter by shifting coins like Bitcoin into stablecoins during times when they want to avoid the volatility generally associated with much of the crypto market. Once these investors feel the prices are right to dive back into the volatile markets, they exchange their stables for whatever crypto they want to buy into. An especially large amount of buying from such holders can therefore help propel the prices of the major cryptos like Bitcoin.

42394916,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWNUc,1660934237,Bitcoin Retraces 3 Weeks of Gains as Analysts Blame Macroeconomic Turmoil,"Bitcoin (BTC) erased three weeks of gains after plunging 8.4%, its biggest single-digit decline in two months.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now trading at about $21,340.  Two analysts with whom CoinDesk spoke said investor concerns about inflation and the likelihood of continued monetary hawkishness by the U.S. Federal Reserve had spurred the decline in crypto prices and other riskier assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, whose fluctuations have largely correlated with bitcoin this year, recently fell over 2%. The S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, was down about 1.2%.  Paul McCaffery, co-head of equities for investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, noted the connection between plunging asset prices and Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) July meeting showing the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to be concerned about inflation and might not slow the pace of interest rate hikes soon. Bitcoin’s price rose last week after an encouraging Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggested the Fed could ratchet back its approach because of easing inflation.  McCaffery said crypto performance will depend on macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing development of regulation.

Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs co-founder, CEO and chief investment officer, also highlighted voting and non-voting Fed members’ vocal unease with inflation, which remains at near four-decade highs despite the recent improvement shown by the CPI.  “Crypto is now on that list of thoughtful, innovative, disruptive technologies and it's viewed as sort of high risk by the average retail trader,” Jablonski said. “So what happens is they get this bad news, they sort of take it in and, lo and behold, the price of bitcoin falls.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market value, had risen sharply over the past month on enthusiasm about the expected September Ethereum protocol change known as the Merge.

(FDIC) published five cease-and-desist orders Friday, including one to crypto exchange FTX US, alleging they mislead investors by suggesting their accounts are insured through the government agency.  The Cryptonews.com, Cryptosec.com, SmartAsset.com and FDICCrypto.com websites were also directed to cease these alleged misrepresentations. The FDIC said these ""companies made false representations"" that suggested their products might be insured by the agency. The FDIC covers federally regulated bank accounts, up to $250,000 per account.  The FDIC previously ordered now-bankrupt Voyager Digital to cease making claims that implied its customers' funds might have been insured by the FDIC. It later issued a broader warning to the crypto industry at large, saying FDIC protections extend to banks but not to crypto companies that have bank accounts.  Friday's letters said several other websites were making specific inaccurate claims about which crypto companies had FDIC insurance.  ""The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) prohibits any person from representing or implying that an uninsured product is FDIC-insured or from knowingly misrepresenting the extent and manner of deposit insurance. The FDI Act further prohibits companies from implying that their products are FDIC-insured by using 'FDIC' in the company’s name, advertisements or other documents,"" the agency said. ""The FDIC is authorized by the FDI Act to enforce this prohibition against any person.""  In a tweet that has since been deleted, FTX US President Brett Harrison said that any direct deposits from employers to FTX US would be stored in FDIC-insured bank accounts.  In a letter directed to Harrison and FTX US Chief Regulatory Officer Dan Friedberg, FDIC Assistant General Counsel Seth Rosebrock wrote that Harrison's tweet may ""contain false and misleading"" statements. SmartAsset and CryptoSEC also said that FTX was ""FDIC-insured,"" he wrote.  ""These statements appear to contain false and misleading representations that uninsured products are insured by the FDIC, as well as false and misleading statements about the extent and manner of protection provided by FDIC deposit insurance and misuse the FDIC's name,"" he wrote. ""These false and misleading statements represent or imply that FTX US is FDIC-insured, that funds deposited with FTX US are placed, and all times remain, in accounts at unnamed FDIC-insured banks, that brokerage accounts at FTX US are FDIC-insured, and that FDIC insurance is available for cryptocurrency or stocks.""  FTX US is not insured by the FDIC, and the regulator does not insure brokerage accounts or cover stocks and cryptocurrencies, he continued.  In response, Harrison tweeted that per the FDIC’s instruction ""I deleted the tweet. The tweet was written in response to questions raised on Twitter regarding whether direct USD deposits from employers were held at insured banks (i.e., Evolve Bank).""  In addition, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, the parent company of FTX US, tweeted: “FTX does not have FDIC insurance … banks we work with do. We never meant otherwise, and apologize if anyone misinterpreted it.”  The four other letter recipients claimed that crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), Gemini and eToro were FDIC-insured, and the letters directed at these platforms order them to clarify that this is not, in fact, accurate.

42411391,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXcH,1660932000,The Coming Privacy Wars,"Severe tensions have been unleashed in cryptoland since Ethereum-based mixing service Tornado Cash was added to the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) specially designated nationals (SDN) list last week. But this is just the beginning.  The move, which was prompted by allegations of North Korean hackers using the service, could set regulators on a collision course with privacy-seeking crypto users and with developers of the tools they use. One can imagine an intensifying clash enveloping crypto natives and mainstream users alike.  That’s because there are many reasons to expect a continued, growing demand for privacy – from an array of people far wider than the narrow subset of undesirables OFAC is aimed at. Let’s start with one that’s fundamental to currencies’ role as a medium of exchange: fungibility.  It shouldn’t matter which actual dollar you hold in your hand; it should be assigned the same value as any other dollar. A recipient can’t care which explicit unit of a currency he or she is handed. If money isn’t fungible like that, it can’t function.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Privacy makes money money  Privacy is a prerequisite for fungibility. If distinct money units have a transparent, publicly known history, then there’s a risk they will be valued differently. If a particular bitcoin or stablecoin was at some point flagged for passing through the hands of some SDN-listed person, company or software service, then people will discount its value or simply refuse to accept it. Goodbye fungibility.  Last week, entrepreneur Maya Zehavi pointed out how, following the OFAC announcement, providers of crypto services started using on-chain analysis to block not only wallets that transacted directly with Tornado Cash, but also second-hop and third-hop wallets further down the chain whose mix of tokens was “tainted” by that up-chain association. Differing histories were now making certain tokens less desirable than others as they were at risk of being blocked.  How might users protect themselves from unintended tainting? Zehavi argued they will have to obfuscate all transaction history leading to their wallet. How? With a non-banned mixing service.  So, we can see how banning one mixer can fuel even more demand for replacement services and incentivize developers to create them. We can also see how it might create an accelerating cycle of bans on mixers and new ones popping up to replace them. (It’s worth noting, as a counterpoint, my colleague Dan Kuhn’s argument that anyone seeking to clone Tornado Cash’s open-source code has the difficult task of winning the community’s trust and avoiding government crackdowns.)  Read more: What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins  Privacy for good  Beyond fungibility, there are all sorts of other social, political and strategic motivations for decent people to seek privacy.  Those living under oppression, for example.  In response to a querying tweet from Jeff Coleman last week, many people, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, said they would have used Tornado Cash to send funds to Ukraine causes to avoid having them intercepted either by Russian authorities or by Western authorities who worried that the funds might fall into Russian hands.  Similar principles were behind the Women’s Annex project, which in 2013-2014 paid young female Afghan computing students in bitcoin to avoid having their fathers, uncles, brothers or other male figures intercepting the funds.  The payments weren’t privatized through a mixer, but in those days, they didn’t need to be to fulfill their intended obfuscating function. All that changed when the New York Department of Financial Services introduced the BitLicense, whose reporting requirements made the bitcoin payments program unworkable in Afghanistan. In effect, NYDFS killed bitcoin privacy, which in turn deprived those young women of an income.  In an episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcasts, Women’s Annex founder Francesco Rulli asked us to imagine the impact of those payments on the power dynamics of Afghanistan’s patriarchal society if the BitLicense had never come into effect. What would it have meant, as the Taliban tried to regain power in 2021, if up until that time an expanding cohort of digitally educated women had continued to receive bitcoin as it massively appreciated in value?  Read more: Crypto Privacy Protocol Monero Is Getting a Major Upgrade  Privacy for profit  But it’s not just folks avoiding oppression for whom privacy is valuable. It’s a crucial element in financial trading.  In 2015, when Wall Street institutions started exploring blockchain-based settlement and clearing systems, they refused to build on Bitcoin or other decentralized crypto protocols because, at that time, the data in those blockchains was too public. Investors don’t want the rest of the market knowing their trades lest it allow their competitors to front-run them.  More broadly, as we move into the Web3 era, with awareness growing of the costs we’ve all borne in the internet’s Web2 phase by revealing data about ourselves, the demand for privacy in our online presence will grow.  Read more: A Step-by-Step Guide to Going Private  Privacy for internet hygiene  In this week’s podcast episode, pseudonymous crypto commentator Punk 6529 talked of how, over the course of just one year, he’s seen an explosion of followers presenting as an avatar and employing a pseudonymous identity. By 6529’s reckoning, the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has fueled this privacy trend because they offer a means to prove authentic control over the image and thus to avoid the threat of impersonation that often goes with anonymity.  The bottom line is that, whether governments like it or not, demand for privacy is growing – and will perhaps even accelerate the more they try to suppress it.  But don’t hold your breath on regulators pulling back on their attack on privacy. They’re motivated to go after mixers and other methods of obfuscation by the amorphous, growing presence of rogue actors. This includes the massive hacker networks that steal money and identities and that use ransomware to hold our infrastructure hostage or state terrorists such as the North Korean hackers who prompted Treasury to go after Tornado Cash.

42411399,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNY62,1660931803,How ‘the Merge’ Will Change the Weird World of Ethereum Mempools,"Next month, years of research and development will culminate in the Merge, when the Ethereum blockchain will transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. There are many reasons to be excited about the end of mining ether (ETH), an energy-intensive process.  Perhaps above all, the Merge may have effects on a perennial issue facing the Ethereum blockchain: maximal (formerly miner) extractable value. More commonly known as MEV, this process forms the basis of a secretive industry built on extracting value from block production, and has generated over half a billion dollars since 2020.  To begin, we must dive into the mysterious world of the memory pool, or “mempool” for short.  Nathan Thompson is lead tech writer at crypto exchange Bybit.  When you make a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, it will join all the other transactions in the mempool, which is like a doctor’s waiting room. They sit there until a miner includes them in the next block. When a block is full, it’s committed to the chain and you get a message saying your transaction was successful.  So far so good. Well, it turns out that the mempool isn’t what you would call “a safe space.” Because, lurking therein lie sophisticated bots looking to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities and leave you footing the bill.  Explaining MEV  One of the most devilish tactics deployed by the bots is called “the sandwich attack.” This is where a bot spots a large trade, duplicates the transaction and pays the miner a small tip to include their transaction ahead of the target.  Let’s take a hypothetical. You have 10 ETH and would like to buy 2,000 tokens of exampleCoin (EC). So you go to your favorite decentralized exchange (DEX) and make the trade.  See also: Ethereum’s Merge Will Increase Its Use Cases and Drive Its Investment Narrative  Your trade goes into the mempool and is spotted by a bot. It copies your trade exactly and pays the miner a “priority fee” (read: bribe) to get their trade processed first. So the bot buys 2,000 EC for a price of 200 EC per ETH.  Now it’s your turn. You were expecting to get 200 EC per ETH, but the bot has front-run the transaction, causing the price to shift so you only get 199 EC per ETH. So you receive 1,990 EC for your 10 ETH.  Once your transaction goes through, the price of exampleCoin will shift again. This time one ETH will buy you 198 EC. That means the bot can sell its 2,000 EC for 10.1 ETH, making 0.1 ETH profit in a matter of minutes.  This might not sound like a lot, but these bots are running constantly and over time front-running transactions can become very lucrative.  There are many other strategies mempool-roaming bots use that are even more sophisticated. Collectively these actions are called maximum extractable value, many of which are as laborious as the front-running example.  MEV has become a major problem for actual Ethereum users, with no obvious solutions. These algorithms are easy to code and very lucrative. Indeed, MEV-explore has a dashboard following this action, and it shows that these exploits have netted nearly $700 million since records began on Jan. 1, 2020.  It’s very difficult to police this situation because doing so would require a centralized agency, which is against the decentralized ethos of Ethereum. However, third parties have found ways to protect users from these shenanigans.  Flashbots Protect, for instance, offers something called a remote procedure call (RPC) that you can send transactions via a private server to avoid the public mempool. Similarly, The Eden Network allows stakers using their service access to a network where their transactions are processed privately.  Proof-of-stake  Once the Merge is complete, the nature of MEV will shift. Ethereum’s coming proof-of-stake system introduces a new actor into the mix: the block builder. It is them who order transactions and send them to the block producer for final approval.  In the proof-of-work (PoW) system, miners decided how to order transactions coming out of the memepool.  As each block is made of transactions, and each transaction will come with different fees and bribes paid, the value of each block will vary depending on the transactions included therein. Therefore, block builders are incentivized to construct the most lucrative blocks because they will be prioritized by block producers and confirmed first.  See also: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  There are already several protocols looking to claim their share of the new block building market, and this may become a very lucrative industry. Then there's MEV-Boost, which is meant to make MEV extraction more accessible and equitable.  Without going into the granular details, if a protocol can create the most lucrative blocks, then block producers will finalize their blocks first. This might attract more users to their service, which gives them a larger private pool of transactions to choose from and the ability to create even better blocks. A virtuous circle ensues.  It’s strange to think that the solution to bots exploiting Ethereum’s open and trustless system is to be found in professional teams exploiting the system better than anyone else and returning the benefits to users, Robin Hood style. It’s hardly Occam’s razor, but it just might work.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nathan Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/19/how-the-merge-will-change-the-weird-world-of-ethereum-mempools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebb5aa8a54401c4c05b4449579dd577b952aa7f9-3413x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Celsius had previously estimated that it would run out of cash by the end of October, according to court filings submitted on Monday by Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm Celsius hired to direct its restructuring plan.  Ferraro said additional funds are coming from $61 million in loans made to crypto exchange Bitfinex that are maturing over the next few weeks, as well as roughly $20 million in savings on sales and use taxes on mining rigs that Celsius purchased. Tether, the stablecoin issuer that owns Bitfinex, previously loaned $1 billion to Celsius. Celsius expects to be cash-flow positive at the beginning of 2023, according to Ferraro.  Both Ferraro and Celsius CEO Alex Mashinky were on the call with the company’s creditors, but only Ferraro answered questions from the creditor group’s lawyers, the U.S. Trustee in the case and individual creditors.  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius' Collapse Into Bankruptcy Should Be Probed, US Says  According to Ferraro, since its last filing on July 29 Celsius has spent $40 million of its cash balance primarily on building out its mining site in Texas and on payroll. This week, the federal court presiding over Celsius’ bankruptcy proceedings approved the firm’s resumption of selling its mined bitcoin (BTC) to help pay operating costs. In July, Celsius mined $8.7 million worth of bitcoin, but the company’s operational and capital costs for the month exceeded those earnings.  Ferraro also disclosed that Celsius has frozen all activity on its retail loans, including not requiring customers to make interest payments on their loans, nor liquidating them.  Celsius has remained in dire financial straits as it attempts to restructure its debts after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-July, several weeks after it paused withdrawals on its platform.  Court filings from earlier this week revealed the firm is largely cash flow negative and now only holds 15,000 BTC and 23,000 wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) of the 100,000 BTC customers deposited in the platform.  Since then, the lender has fielded cash-injection offers from several unidentified sources, according to Celsius lawyer Josh Sussberg during the firm’s second bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.

42394908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWNKm,1660929320,"It Doesn't Matter If They're Wrong, Central Bankers Set Guidance for Crypto, Too","Hi, I’m Helene Braun. If you’re not tired of reading about inflation or interest rate hikes yet, I’m worried about you. But, nevertheless, here’s more about them. Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) plunged Friday, in a record-breaking single-day free fall, and it most likely has to do with macro economics.  On Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he is leaning toward voting for a 75 basis point rate hike when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets in September. Meanwhile, Germany posted a shockingly high inflation report Friday morning. Plus, the 10-year Treasury bond yield is about to pass 3%, which is a big deal. The reason why all of this is significant will be explained.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I’ve been covering the U.S. economy for a little while now and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that market manipulation is number one on the list of U.S. Federal Reserve priorities. Central bankers call this “forward guidance.”  In reality, this guidance is nothing more than telling markets how the Fed will likely change monetary policy so that when it does that news is priced into how markets react. As BNY Mellon’s chief economist recently told me, it’s no coincidence markets flash green during most of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s TV appearances. He’s trying to send positive signals, even in uncertain times.  In reality, it’s all just talk because nobody, including (or should I say especially) the Federal Reserve knows what the future holds, as has been proven many times before (hello “inflation is transitory”).  Powell himself has said, “We now understand better how little we understand about inflation.”  Here’s one example: Inflation in November was at 6.8%, which was the biggest rise since June 1982 at the time. That should have been alarming for central bankers, but the Fed’s policy projections, or “dot plot,” in December showed the majority of FOMC members predicted that the federal funds rate at the end of 2022 would be at 0.75%. The rate is currently at 2.75% as of August, and expected to go up to 4% by year end.  Sure, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which central bankers and the Biden administration have noted to explain rising prices, wasn’t something anyone could have predicted, but that’s the point. In an economy that’s so heavily dependent on the broader, global economy, something unexpected happening is almost inevitable.  Nevertheless, markets react to any small clue from the Fed that they can get about future decisions, and right now it seems the equity market is headed in the wrong direction, with crypto following suit.  Inflation, although the rate came down slightly in July, is still running at 8.5%, which is much too high given that the Fed’s goal is to keep it steady at 2%. Nevertheless, the equity market is acting like we’re coming out of a recession rather than heading into one.  The Nasdaq 100 is up 10% over the past month and the S&P 500 is trading 9% higher for the month to date, suggesting that traders are preparing for a better macro environment. This is at a time when inflation in the U.K. just reached double-digit territory and producer prices in Germany recorded a jump of 37.2% year over year, beating expectations yet again.  The doves, or those who believe the Fed will start being less aggressive in slowing the economy, “are a little in front of themselves right now,” as venture capital fund G Squared’s Victoria Greene put it in an interview with CNBC. People seem to be reading way too positively into last month’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which showed zero inflation in the U.S. in July from the previous month, while inflation is still very much a concern.  Crypto seems to share that sentiment. Bitcoin dropped 37% in value in June, but gained back 17% in July. Ether was up 57% last month.  See also: Inflation Probably Slowed in July, but Not by Enough  “Just because inflation didn’t go up from an already bad number doesn’t mean inflation is good,” Greene said.  The bond market seems to be more realistic. The 10-year Treasury yield is about to pass 3%, while the two-year yield is at 3.2%. During normal times, long-term rates should exceed short-term rates because investors expect to be paid more if they put their money away for longer. This reversed relationship traditionally suggests the anticipation of a recession, but traders seem to be ignoring that.  There’s clearly vacillation in global markets right now, whether it’s uncertainty over a potential recession or trying to understand if the Fed is hawkish or dovish. In the end, it’s all momentum and nobody can predict the future – it’s all a gamble. I suggest we focus on the Merge because that seems to be a lot more exciting (and delightful) these days.

This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) plunged the most in two months, falling in sync with traditional markets amid renewed fears that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will become more aggressive in fighting inflation.  The move brought a decisive end to hopes in the past month that the world’s largest cryptocurrency might stage a recovery following the price crash in May and June.  The price has tumbled 9.3% over the past 24 hours to about $21,400, just days after crypto analysts had been salivating over the prospect of a push past $25,000.  According to Coinglass, crypto traders had $600 million of liquidations of leveraged bets because of margin calls.  Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, which had gained in recent weeks from ebullience ahead of an upcoming software update on the Ethereum blockchain known as the Merge, fell 9%.  “The crypto winter may not be over yet,” with a drop toward $20,000 now possible, Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.

Crypto Analysts Want to Know  By Jimmy He  How long can it last?  That's what crypto analysts are wondering about the Filecoin incentive program, the driver behind the bulk of the blockchain project's growth.  Filecoin was launched in 2020 to decentralize the data-storage business, providing an alternative to industry giants like Amazon Web Services at nearly a thousandth of the cost.  At its core, the network connects storage providers with clients looking to stow their data. By offering storage space – ranging from extra capacity on desktop computers to large racks – and then running mathematical proofs to show that clients’ data is unaltered, providers can earn the network’s native FIL token as a blockchain reward.  Recently, activity has soared. According to a Messari report, active Filecoin storage deals between providers and clients surged 128% to the second quarter from the first quarter.  That has crypto analysts calling attention to the incentive program linked to almost of that growth – Filecoin Plus (Fil+) – and wondering whether it's sustainable.  Under Fil+, storage providers can earn 10 times the block reward, or number of FIL tokens, of a typical deal by working with “trustworthy clients” such as universities and research facilities. Those clients apply to notaries, or community-elected trustees, to verify the data they are storing.  Fil+’s approval system weeds out storage providers that may negotiate deals with clients storing fake data just to reap block rewards.  Analysts say that Fil+ block rewards act as a subsidy for providers, making it feasible for them to slash storage fees (averaging $0.0000026 per gigabyte per year). Still, they wonder what might happen to Filecoin’s growth and activity once the incentive program tapers off.  “Over time, storage miners will have to start charging,” Messari research analyst Sami Kassab said. “What I think is going to be the most important thing to watch there is if the storage demand can still keep up when storing data is no longer free.”  New revenue streams  Filecoin project leaders say the network is set to roll out new functions to create additional revenue streams for data-storage providers, which would maintain growth and keep prices low even as the extra block rewards decrease.  Jonathan Victor, product lead for Protocol Labs, the open-source research and development lab that developed Filecoin, outlined five revenue sources for storage providers, including block rewards, storage fees, retrieval fees, transaction fees and additional services.  Storage fees are what clients pay storage providers for the initial storage deal. Retrieval fees are what clients pay providers to fetch stored data. Transaction fees are what crypto brokers charge traders for buying and selling FIL.  While revenue from block rewards will eventually decrease, Victor argues that storage fees will remain low as long as providers can make up the lost revenue through retrieval fees, transaction fees and additional services.  According to Filecoin’s 2022 road map, the storage network plans to add a retrieval market during the third quarter that would increase the speed of blockchain data retrieval and allow storage providers to charge clients for retrieving the data they are storing.  Filecoin also launched the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) in July, which let clients run smart contracts from other networks and unlocked the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi).  Filecoin plans to implement a programmable storage market in the fourth quarter. That would allow clients to create customized smart contracts to meet their needs.  “Things like the FVM are going to drive transaction fees,” Victor said. “It will drive demand for Filecoin block space.”  Read the full story here.

Banks in the country ""may act as a conduit for funds"" tied to crypto asset service providers and ""may play a role in customers wishing to purchase"" or ""receive payouts in fiat currency"" in their bank accounts for the sale of crypto, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said in new guidelines published this week.  The guidance was released after some local banks previously moved to shut down accounts tied to crypto exchanges, citing exposures to risk. In the published document, the SARB said it was aware that certain banks in the country have blocked clients with links to crypto. It added that although thorough risk assessment is necessary, the ""wholesale termination of client relationships"" poses a threat to financial integrity.  ""Risk assessment does not necessarily imply that institutions should seek to avoid risk entirely,"" the SARB said.  In June 2021, some banks in South Africa also blocked customers from using their credit and debit cards to purchase crypto on foreign exchanges, while the central bank warned existing regulations didn't allow ""for cross-border or foreign exchange transfers for the explicit purpose of purchasing crypto assets.""  South Africans, however, are allowed to use their annual ""single discretionary allowance"" of up to 1 million South African rand (about $59,000) or foreign capital allowance of up to 10 million rand ($580,000) to buy crypto.

In a speech on Thursday, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele described the volume and value of transactions on the platform as ""remarkable,"" noting the eNaira app has been downloaded 840,000 times and now has about 270,000 active wallets.  Nigeria has a population of about 200 million, and it is the largest economy in Africa with a gross domestic product of about $430 billion.  It is estimated, however, that around 40% of the population doesn't have a bank account, including 59 million unbanked adults, a matter that the CBN intends to tackle with the CBDC. The bank is seeking to get 8 million more people to start using the eNaira platform in its second phase.  That phase begins next week, when both banked and unbanked Nigerians will be able to open a eNaira wallet by dialing a four-digit code on their mobile phones, Emefiele said.  Nigeria was the second country to introduce a CBDC, following the Bahamas a year earlier. In the months preceding the eNaira's inception, the CBN attempted to stave off cryptocurrency use among the public, ordering banks to close any accounts that had crypto transactions.

With a market cap of $1.21 billion, the intraday trading volume of Theta Network has increased by 33.40% to reach $62.61 million. Past Performance of THETA The Theta Network (THETA) price action shows a bullish failure to rise above the $1.73 level and sustain above 100-day EMA due to the increased supply pressure. The correction phase breaks below the 50-day EMA and accounts for a 25% price drop last week, with a streak of seven bearish candles. Therefore, the analysis projects a high possibility of a price drop to $1 as the selling price increases. Source - Tradingview THETA Technical Analysis The THETA prices may soon reach the crucial psychological support of $1 as the downtrend gains momentum. Hence traders can find selling opportunities at the current market price. As the prices fall below the 50-day EMA, the possibility of a bullish crossover between the 50 and 100-day EMA nullifies. The daily RSI slope displays a tremendous upsurge in the underlying bearish sentiments as RSI falls into the nearly overbought zone.

""We've seen a strong recovery in risk assets recently and perhaps we're seeing signs of exhaustion which some may argue is long overdue,"" Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at Oanda, said in a note to clients Friday.  Crypto-exposed equities have been trading alongside tech stocks over the last year, impacting crypto names, according to Sylvia Jablonski, CIO of Defiance ETFs. ""What happens in equity markets then bleeds down lately to crypto markets,"" she said Friday morning on CoinDesk TV.  Jablonski thinks the Fed needs to do more work to lower inflation, though she said harsh recessionary fears may not transpire. ""Things are really OK for corporate America at the moment, so the fears are a little bit overblown,"" she said. Jablonski added that late summer is a tricky time for traders and market, though long-term investors can dabble in the market, whether it be owning cryptocurrencies or equities.  ""It's definitely reasonable to buy these various asset classes on the dip,"" she said, while urging investors not to overextend themselves in owning one asset class.  Institutional investment continues to enter crypto, adding to a sign of optimism for some amidst the broader market worries. ""Despite the macro economic downturn resulting in lower prices in the short term, the most adopted crypto projects won’t stay cheap for long,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock said in a note Friday.

Key Technical Points: The Basic Attention Token price dropped by 20% last week. The bearish reversal rally breaks below the 50-day EMA and warns of the $0.35 fallout. With a market cap of $549 million, the intraday trading volume of Basic Attention Token has increased by 25% to reach $65.98 million. Past Performance of BAT The BAT price action shows a bullish failure to sustain above the 100-day EMA due to the increased supply pressure at the $0.46 horizontal zone.

42394897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWNEs,1660894344,"Bitcoin Plunges Most in 2 Months, Dashing Recovery Hopes","Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $22,000 early Friday, reversing gains spurred by the softer-than-expected U.S. inflation figure released last week and leading the broader crypto market down.  The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap fell over 7% to as low as $21,500, the lowest price since July 27, CoinDesk data shows. The biggest single-day percentage decline in two months marked a continuation of the five-day downtrend that began near $25,000. Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, slid 6% to $1,730, while SOL, ADA and DOGE suffered double-digit losses, according to CoinDesk data.  In traditional markets, futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slipped over 1%, and the dollar index rose to a one-month high of 107.77, indicating risk aversion. Shares of crypto-related stocks such as miners and crypto exchange Coinbase slumped in premarket trading.  Sentiment worsened after the Federal Reserve pushed back against expectations that inflation has peaked and that the central bank would slow the pace of interest-rate increases in the U.S. and adopt looser monetary policies in 2023. The minutes of the Fed's July meeting released Wednesday showed policymakers discussed the need to keep interest rates at levels that would be likely to weigh on U.S. economic growth.  ""USD strength, especially post Fed minutes seem to be putting downward pressure on crypto, although the magnitude and velocity of today’s sell-off suggests that it might be a liquidation hunt on complacent, leveraged long positions,"" Dick Lo, CEO and founder of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said crypto, as a risk asset, is taking a hard hit. ""We are seeing a lot of macro weakness with bad [inflation] numbers from Germany. Major U.S. equity indices are off,"" he said.  Germany, Europe's biggest economy and an export powerhouse, reported a record jump in producer prices early Friday. The spike, at 37% over the past 12 months, was primarily driven by skyrocketing energy prices, according to Reuters.  Bitcoin's price recently climbed to almost $25,000 from $22,800 in hopes that the Fed would cut interest rates next year. Stocks also rallied, with the Nasdaq touching a three and a half-month high of 13,370 on Wednesday. Bond yields, however, have remained resilient since the Aug. 10 consumer price index data, a signal that traders might be wrong in making dovish assumptions. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.95% Friday, the highest since July 21, extending the rally from the post-CPI low of 2.63%.  ""Risk markets were due for a pullback after an impressive rally,"" Lo said, citing profit-taking as one reason for the drop in ether.  Laurent Kssis, managing director and head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, said long liquidations in ether since Wednesday have reached levels not seen for two months. According to coinglass.com, $117 million worth of ether long positions were liquidated on Friday, the most since July 28. Long liquidations are the unwinding of bullish futures-market positions by exchanges on account of margin shortages.  Aside from the risk reset in traditional markets, the optimism about Ethereum's long-pending software upgrade, dubbed the Merge, helped crypto markets regain poise over the past two months. Ether doubled to $2,000 in the four weeks to Aug 14.  Lo sees more pain ahead for the crypto market if bitcoin fails to hold support at $21,500.  ""A break below could see $20,700 as the next level of support,"" Lo told CoinDesk. ING analysts foresee tightening of financial conditions heading into the Fed's September meeting, implying renewed volatility in risky assets.  Stack Funds' Dibb said bitcoin could fall toward $20,000 over the weekend when liquidity is low.

Bitcoin Breaks Its Losing Streak  By James Rubin  Cryptos spent most of Thursday on the upswing before sinking late in the day.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $22,800, down about 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization which has spiraled downward after reaching a two-month high above $25,000 last weekend. Late Wednesday, BTC fell below a bullish trendline after the release of minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed U.S. central bankers unlikely to lighten their current monetary hawkishness.  The Fed Reserve has raised interest rates a hefty 75 basis points at each of its last two meetings as it aims to suppress high inflation.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market value behind BTC, was recently changing hands just above $1,800, also down more than 2% from Wednesday and far removed from the $2,000 level perch it was still flirting with late Sunday. Merge excitement has tapered off in recent days.  ""Bitcoin is range bound at the moment,"" said Nauman Sheikh, managing director at investment advisors Wave Financial, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""It's hit a $25,000, sort of resistance level. So has Ethereum hit a $2,000 resistance level. We're in a mode where the macro environment is supportive of the market, and we'll retest those resistance levels and hopefully break.""  Major altcoins that spent much of Thursday in promising territory also dove downward late in the day with YGG and OP recently plunging more than 14% and 13%. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB continued their retreat from early-week euphoria that sent their prices up double-digits with each recently sinking more than 10%.  Major equity traded sideways with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rising a fraction of a percentage point as investors continued to weigh economic indicators and earnings that has often pointed in conflicting directions. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors reported a sixth consecutive monthly decline in housing starts adding evidence of an economy cooling from the sting of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. But initial jobless claims for the week ending Aug. 13 fell short of expectations as did the four-week average, underscoring the economy's stubborn strength.  Crypto news  The HUSD stablecoin, which is issued by Stable Universal, fell to 92 cents, an 8% drop from its planned $1 peg, according to CoinMarketCap prices early Thursday. And South Korea's anti-money laundering authority has started scrutinizing 16 foreign crypto firms it says have been operating in the country without proper regulatory approval, the agency said in a statement.  Despite the price drop over the past few days, Wave Financial's Sheikh noted optimistically that crypto ""speculation"" has recently returned. ""The crypto anatomy narratives are strong at this point,"" he said, adding: ""Speculation is going on. It's not all about Bitcoin and Ethereum. But the narrative is spreading and people are beginning to take more risk.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −12.2% Entertainment Shiba Inu SHIB −11.9% Currency Terra LUNA −11.7% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  South Korea's Bumpy Crypto Path Forward  By James Rubin  Just five months ago, South Korea seemed as if it was embarking on a fresh start where crypto innovation and investment would flourish.  The two presidential candidates, Yoon Suk-Yeo and Lee Jae-myung, were vying to convince voters which one would be more crypto friendly. Their jockeying underscored the growing importance of digital assets in the country, particularly among younger voters who have been opening accounts on crypto exchanges in droves, but were frustrated by the restrictive policies of the former President Moon Jae-In.  Yoon's victory, filled with the promise of smart regulation that would nurture new projects, protect investors and rid the industry of some of its more unsavory elements now seems like a blur in a rearview mirror. In recent weeks, Korea has ratcheted up its scrutiny of crypto exchanges and other businesses as it tries to make sense of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin collapse and other debacles that continue rippling through the industry.  Terra was founded in Korea, and attendees at last week's Blockchain Week (KBW), which included many of Terra’s original builders, investors and partners, avoided discussing the issue, seemingly more image conscious than interested in addressing the root causes of the implosion.  Heightened scrutiny?  On Thursday, South Korea's anti-money laundering authority flagged 16 foreign crypto firms it says have been operating in the country without proper regulatory approval. In a statement, the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU), part of South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC), said the firms had advertised crypto and offered services to Koreans without obtaining the requisite registration.  Last month, prosecutors raided seven cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea investigating a fraud case in connection with the collapse of UST and the LUNA token that supported it. The targeted companies included Bithumb, Coinone and Upbit.  To be sure, the additional scrutiny is understandable, given the perception among many people that crypto lacks the protections and stability of more traditional assets. The current climate is fragile as projects that helped spur crypto's growth in Korea and beyond flail and fail, and bitcoin's price remains badly depressed from its high less than a year ago.  Still promising  But the country remains a hotbed of crypto interest filled with eager investors and developers who will undoubtedly have much to say about the asset's status in the Asia Pacific Rim region. Among other initiatives, Solana said it would pump up to $100 million into Korean crypto startups as it looks to penetrate a Terra-generated void in the developer market. Solana Ventures and the Solana Foundation will emphasize will seed investments and grants “across all Web 3 verticals."" Polygon, Avalanche and other smart contract platforms have also been eyeing the country's trove of orphaned crypto developers.  Earlier this week, local media outlet Edaily reported Thursday that Korea's financial watchdog wanted to fast-track the review of proposals for new crypto laws. The country's blockchain industry has bemoaned the slow pace of regulation, which it believes will help the industry mature.  Sometimes progress must overcome a few obstacles.
