42385564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2K59,1610149392,Donald Trump Banned From Twitter in Final Days of Presidency,"U.S. President Donald Trump has been permanently banned from Twitter, less than two weeks before he is set to leave office.      Twitter announced the move late Friday, saying it had conducted a ""close review"" of the President's recent tweets and how they were being received, and concluding that two tweets from his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, on Friday might lead to violence on or around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden later this month. In its statement, the company said it had seen talk of a ""proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.""      Twitter had previously suspended Trump's access for 12 hours on Wednesday, after a mob composed of the president's supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol Building, ransacked congressional offices and interrupted the joint session intended to certify the electoral college votes confirming Biden's victory in last year's presidential election. Five individuals died during the riot, including four supporters of the president and an officer with the Capitol Police.      ""In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action. Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open,"" Twitter's statement Friday said.      The company cited Trump's tweets on Friday, one which said his supporters ""will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form"" and the other that was an announcement he would not be attending Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20.      ""These two tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,"" Twitter said.      Twitter subsequently banned Trump's campaign account (@TeamTrump), his campaign digital director (@garycoby) and locked the government-use @POTUS account after Trump tried using them to circumvent his initial ban (though the campaign director of social media, Mike Hahn, disputed that Trump had used the campaign account).      In response to the ban, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called for Congress to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the legislation that protects social media platforms from being liable for what their users say.      Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) however, said that ""no private company is obligated to provide a megaphone,"" noting that Twitter and other social media companies waited until it was confirmed Democrats would control both houses of Congress this year before acting.    Team Trump banned by tech    Twitter joins Facebook (and Instagram), Snapchat and Twitch as some of the platforms to remove Trump's pages in recent days. Each of these companies initially began with indefinite or temporary suspensions on Wednesday. Twitch and Facebook have indicated that Trump may regain access after the inauguration.

On Friday, Reddit banned its r/DonaldTrump community and a moderator of its r/conspiracy community. While a specific reason wasn't given for the subreddit ban, the moderator was banned for ""inciting communities"" and violating the site's content policy, according to the Daily Dot.      Apple has likewise threatened to ban the social media app Parler if it doesn't enact some content moderation policies, while Google Play did Apple one better by suspending Parler until it addresses a lack ""robust moderation for egregious content."" Google said it took the action ""in light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat.""  Meanwhile, Discord banned its ""The Donald"" server, which is affiliated with pro-Trump communities (including the former Reddit page r/TheDonald, which was banned last year for ""harassment, hate speech and content manipulation,"" Gizmodo reported).      Read more: In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win      Earlier Friday, Twitter suspended a number of accounts that showed support for the QAnon internet conspiracy, including former National Security Advisor and retired General Michael Flynn and Trump attorney Sidney Powell.      Payment platform Stripe suspended the Proud Boys, a far-right group, on Friday.      The video streaming platform DLive likewise announced on Friday it was suspending several accounts in relation to Wednesday's riot.      Twitter's share price dropped in after-hours trading on the news, pricing in at $50.40 after closing Friday at $51.48.

42385561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2K3t,1610147213,Morgan Stanley Boosts Stake in Bitcoin-Laden MicroStrategy to 10.9%,"Morgan Stanley now owns 792,627 shares of MicroStrategy, bringing its total ownership in the company best known for holding over $2 billion in bitcoin to 10.9%, according to a filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    The financial giant boosted its stake by almost 650,000 shares since the end of Q3.  The shares of MicroStrategy, a relatively little known business intelligence firm prior to its massive investment in the leading cryptocurrency, have soared 330% since the company bought its first bitcoin on Aug. 11, 2020, rising from $123.80 to $539.57.  As illustrated in the chart below, before buying its first bitcoin, MicroStrategy's share performance left something to be desired, having fallen 13% from Jan. 2, 2020, through Aug. 10, 2020.  Given MicroStrategy's shares are largely tracking the price of bitcoin, which is up more than 40% this year following a 300% gain in 2020, it's likely Morgan Stanley views its investment as a way to benefit from bitcoin's historic run without actually being a HODLer.

Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit has added a $300,000 option to keep up with BTC's blistering price performance in recent weeks.  The $200,000 option came into being late last week after bitcoin rose from $25,000 on Dec. 25 to $32,000 on Jan. 2.  Six days later – with bitcoin currently north of $39,000 and having risen to as high as $41,962.36 earlier Friday – the maximum option followed suit.  Even with the bullishness driving bitcoin's rally, there's only so high folks are willing to climb, as you can see from the following picture of open positions on Deribit's website.  Other than one optimistic soul wagering that $200,000 this year could be a real thing, there's been no activity at any strike above $100,000.  Generally, options indicate how some of the market's more sophisticated traders are gauging current price trends.  Hope may spring eternal but apparently even hope has a ceiling.

New all-time highs are again the topic of the day on Friday, the third straight day the price of bitcoin hit a record level. Around 15:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET), the price of bitcoin changed hands at $41,962, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Price has dropped since, at $39,304 as of press time.      Read More: Over $41,000: Bitcoin Continues to Forge New Highs      ""BTC is currently in price discovery with a lot of demand and limited supply,” Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of Bitflyer USA. “Everyone that holds bitcoin thinks it will go higher, so they hold.”      According to data aggregator Glassnode, bitcoin’s current circulating supply is at 18,594,037 BTC – and investors seemingly can’t get enough of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.      “The continued relentless money flows into BTC from institutional and some retail buyers provides significant positive drift,” said Chad Steinglass, head of trading for derivatives firm CrossTower. “As more and more coins are locked away in long-term investments and are essentially removed from circulation, squeezing available inventory tighter and tighter.“      “Everyone without BTC is afraid of missing out and wants to buy,” Bitflyer's Edgerton added. “Borrowing [U.S. dollar] stablecoins to buy BTC is the crypto carry trade.""      The top three stablecoins – tether (USDT), U.S. dollar coin (USDC) and dai (DAI) – collectively have a market capitalization of $28 billion, much of which consists of tether – $22,916,992,958, according to CoinGecko.      “The doors are fully open and the buying pressure has been building up massively this whole year based on macro cycles, COVID-19, the U.S. election and a feeling of general anxiety,” said Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter bitcoin trader. “In the short term I expect a setback of perhaps 15%, but it will just be a bump in the massive bull run – $100,000 this year is totally possible!”      Read More: Why Joe Biden’s $3T Stimulus Package Could Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Rally      Action in the bitcoin derivatives market was heavy as well. Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, noted almost $1 billion in liquidations occurred there Thursday. “The majority of these liquidations were longs and it was the third-highest amount since November.”      At BitMEX alone, over $100 million in liquidations have occurred on the venue’s bitcoin market over the past three days, with $65 million buy liquidations signaling short-oriented traders got squeezed versus $42 million in the crypto equivalent of a margin call for long positions.      In the options market, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at brokerage Bequant, noted that traders are liking the $36,000 strike price for bitcoin.      “Given the outsized focus on bitcoin's $36,000 options strike for the end of January options expiry, which comes with a raft of optionality plays and risks, this disconnects bitcoin from fundamentals, so to speak,"" Vinokourov told CoinDesk. ""It will be interesting to see whether the market will be able to compartmentalize this bitcoin risk away from the rest of the market.”    Ether futures at $3.7 billion in interest    Ether (ETH) was down Friday, trading around $1,159 and slipping 6.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Binance was leading the way with $820 million in OI, over 20% of the total ether futures market.      “ETH still hasn't touched its previous all-time high of over $1,400,” noted Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “To date, there has been less access to invest in ether versus bitcoin. As we await the pending launch of the CME [ether] futures, community members who are more crypto-native and have less restrictions about how to hold ETH are likely looking to front-run the launch.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are in the red Friday.

42405672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoOx,1610139904,The Smart Way to Talk About DeFi's $22B,"Decentralized finance (DeFi), the sector of crypto that drove all the excitement this summer, isn't quite back to its old energy, but the lull is over.      ""Raw DeFi numbers are at all-time highs, and they're not fake,"" Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk in an email. ""But in relative terms to the rest of crypto, they're down from their peak but up from their nadir.""      From a casual glance, it can look like DeFi is stronger than it's ever been. Judged by the sector's favorite metric, total value locked (TVL), the sector has been adding about a billion dollars worth of additional value per day since the new year started – from $15.67 billion to $22.35 billion as of this writing. However, a lot of that growth has been driven by the simple fact of asset prices going up across the board.      ""TVL isn't the best indicator when ETH and all other crypto is green for weeks,"" Jesse Walden, founder of the venture firm Variant, told CoinDesk in an email.      ETH, the asset that powers DeFi, traded at $737 on Jan. 1, rising to $1,182, as of this writing.      In other words, ETH is up a bit over 60% and DeFi is up a bit over 40%.      DeFi will be booming again when a lot more assets get locked in there. It seems clear that most of the uptick in value can be attributed to asset price increases, but that's not the whole story.      ""Uniswap alone is settling around $1 billion daily, so I think the ecosystem is growing, no doubt,"" Walden noted.    Look to the stablecoins    A good way to baseline DeFi upticks is by checking action specifically in stablecoins because they don't tend to get skewed wildly by price volatility.      DeFi money market Compound kicked off the DeFi craze and yield farming on that application is still going strong. Its website makes it easy to check deposits over time.      Looking at the big three stablecoins – USDT, USDC and DAI – only USDT has really been inching up on Compound, but it also has by far the smallest deposits.      Tether's stablecoin has risen from a mere $91.5 million on Jan. 1 to $146 million today. Meanwhile, DAI has basically hovered a bit above $1 billion and USDC has in the area of $800 million that whole time. Nothing very exciting happening there, which probably stands as something of a bellwether for the real action in the space.      Blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi agreed with the comments above. ""My opinion is that DeFi just increased leverage in the system a bit, say 5%,"" she wrote via text message. ""The rest is just price appreciation.""      If it's not obvious for those who believe the rally is going to keep going, borrowing more of the rising asset can be a good way to lock in more gains. ""In general, during [a] bull market, more users are collateralizing to borrow to leverage their positions on ETH,"" Stani Kulechov of the money market Aave (a protocol that turned one year old today) told CoinDesk over Telegram.      Kulechov shared data with CoinDesk that showed over $1.5 billion worth of new deposits on Aave versions 1 and 2 combined. By far the biggest intake has been in ETH itself, with more than $450 million in new ETH deposited into Aave in 2021 alone.      After all, once people have reached a position they believe they can afford, they might as well deposit it somewhere that it can earn just a little more while they wait for prices to moon.    See also: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four?

42405677,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoSt,1610139772,Asia’s Retail FOMO Could Be Behind XRP’s Rally Despite SEC’s Lawsuit,"XRP’s double-digit gains could be the result of a bold bet by retail investors, especially those in Asia, that the cryptocurrency’s price could follow the broader crypto bull run. The latest rally surprised many because it is happening not long after XRP crashed on the news the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Inc., claiming the company sold the token as a security.      That said, it seems as if some market participants are undeterred by the regulator's action.      “Traders often trade products on a relative value basis,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk on Jan.7. “XRP felt cheap a few days ago. Today it feels normal again, in my opinion.”      Read More: XRP Climbs Back up Crypto Rankings With Near 50% Rise      Simons Chen, a crypto trader based in Hong Kong, told CoinDesk he bought XRP when the price went to nearly its bottom point at the end of December with the belief that it would rebound soon, following bitcoin’s trend.      Chen said that when bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) were going up, XRPs price went the opposite way because of the SEC news. That movement, to him, meant a great opportunity to “buy the dip.”      Read More: An SEC Victory in Ripple Case Would Render XRP ‘Untradeable,’ Market Pros Say      Trading volumes from major exchanges globally, particularly in Asia, also show significant traffic in the XRP/USDT (tether) and XRP/KRW (Korean won) pairings, according to data from Nomics.      CoinDesk Research collected XRP trading volume data since Dec. 1, 2020, from six exchanges that saw noticeable activity and broke down the data by quote currency. Significant volumes came from the XRP/USDT and XRP/KRW ) pairings, yet volumes on XRP/bitcoin and XRP/ether pairings were relatively small.      Tether, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, is frequently used by traders and investors in Asia, especially in China, to buy cryptocurrencies. Due to regulations in South Korea, people there often buy cryptocurrencies directly from fiat on Korea-based exchanges. The data indicates the markets in Asia have been the main driver of the price rally.      Even though multiple exchanges, especially those that have a presence in the U.S., have announced suspension or delisting of XRP on their platforms, XRP pairings are still available on many other exchanges, including the so-called “Big Three” – Binance, Huobi, and OKEx – all of which first started in China.      “Unlike Coinbase or other 'regulated' exchanges, Korean and [other] Asian exchanges do not need to care that much of what the SEC does, and investors in Asia are less sensitive about the news,” said Sinhae Lee, partner at Shanghai-based blockchain consulting firm Block72. “With the current major altcoins' price appreciation, investors bought XRP as its price went down a lot.”      The lack of institutional investors, particularly those based in the U.S., is evidence that non-U.S. retail investors are most likely the reason for XRP’s rebound, according to Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at crypto quant firm Trade Terminal. Yang said large digital asset managersincluding Grayscale have dropped XRP from their funds, “a death penalty” for XRP’s market in the U.S. [Grayscale is owned by DCG, CoinDesk's parent company.]      Read More: Grayscale Drops XRP From Large Cap Crypto Fund Following Ripple SEC Suit      If retail investors’ increasing appetite is the only driver of XRP’s price, it is hard to tell whether the price will remain healthy in the long term. A key factor will be what happens between Ripple and the SEC. Just Wednesday, the company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said his company “tried” to settle charges of conducting unregistered securities transactions with the SEC.      Read More: Ripple ‘Tried’ to Settle With SEC Ahead of XRP Suit, CEO Says      “If the SEC rejected [Ripple’s] proposal [to settle] and there seems nothing more than a court case, then the token is now over-valued, in my opinion.” Swissquote’s Thomas said. “As an 18-month court case it will weigh heavily on the asset.”      At the press time, XRP traded at $0.31, down 8.95% in the past 24 hours but up 14.2% from the December low of around $0.17.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/08/asias-retail-fomo-could-be-behind-xrps-rally-despite-secs-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05c66d94860b0f504683f9ed4b3a3879bab372cd-1500x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pseudonymous developer Fi3 (@piccioneLibero2 on Twitter, or “free pigeon”) will receive an undisclosed sum to work on an implementation of Stratum V2, the next iteration of a Bitcoin mining protocol software developed by Braiins.      ""Square Crypto is excited to support the development of a high quality open-source implementation of Stratum v2,"" Square Crypto lead Steve Lee said to CoinDesk. ""This software benefits miners by maximizing their revenue and providing more freedom and security.""    'Personal freedom' to pursue Bitcoin development    “I wanted to work on something related to Bitcoin,” Fi3 told CoinDesk. The Bitcoin developer has previous experience working with Bitcoin’s mining industry via a collaboration with Italian mining company Bitminer Factory. Fi3 is proficient in the Rust programming language, which will be used to code the upgrade, so once they saw the opportunity they “caught it.”      “I also like the personal freedom that this kind of grant gives you,” Fi3 continued.    See also: Square Crypto’s 20th Grant Will Support Bitcoin Design, User Experience    The co-author of the proposal, Jan Kvapil, will begin work on the implementation in February, Fi3 said.    Stratum V2: Giving Bitcoin mining a boost    A mining pool is a collective of miners – from big industrial players to hobbyists farming in their basements – who combine their hash power to increase their collective chance of mining a block.      The Stratum software coordinates this pooled mining. The new edition, V2, will patch a handful of security flaws present in its 2012 predecessor, while improving connection speeds between miners in the pool. It will also give individual Bitcoin miners a say in which transactions they want to include in the blocks that the pools mine, allowing individual miners a bit more freedom in the process.    See also: New Software Fix Provides Bitcoin Miners Increased Security    Fi3’s goal is to develop and create a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (or BIP, code that alters some aspect of the Bitcoin network or protocol) that paves a clear path to activating the upgrade. Stratum V2 has been in the works for some time, but the grant will fund the changes that should finally push the project to fruition.      Toward this end they will consult with Braiins co-founder Jan Čapek and former Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, who now works full-time for Square Crypto as a developer on open-source projects.      Fi3 said a Bitcoin Core pull request for implementing Stratum V2 could be ready in 6 months; this would include a BIP that outlines activation.

Miller continued to describe bitcoin as ""a supply-and-demand story"" with roughly 900 bitcoins created each day and a swarm of retail and institutional investors scooping up enormous chunks of available supply.      Some of those large investments have come from firms like MicroStrategy, which has scooped up over 70,000 BTC with plans to buy more, and London-based asset manager Ruffer Investment, which dumped $740 million into bitcoin toward the end of 2020.      Payment companies like Square and PayPal are also funneling retail capital into bitcoin. In Q3 2020, for example, Square reported a record $1 billion in bitcoin revenue via its Cash App mobile wallet. PayPal, after announcing its plan to support bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in October, promptly removed its waitlist for the service less than a month later, citing overwhelming demand.

42405679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoUr,1610130460,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin's Road to Gold,"I won’t do that again. Money Reimagined goes on break for three weeks and what happens?      Bitcoin soars 82%. More than 54,000 Americans die of COVID-19. And, oh yeah, an insurrection happens in Washington, D.C.      On the second, the numbers speak for themselves: a heartbreaking failure of human organization. On the third, I’m too gobsmacked to speak anyway. So, today we discuss the first. I want to show how bitcoin's volatility is not a problem for its long-term viability, as some critics claim.      You’ll note a new format to parts of the newsletter. More changes to come in the weeks ahead. Let us know what you think of the bullet point format and other changes.      Also, the first 2021 episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast is out. This one, featuring Matthew Davie of Kiva and Alpen Sheth of Mercy Corps, looks at the charity organizations’ efforts to drive financial inclusion through grassroots empowerment, and whether or not crypto will succeed in breaking down a U.S.-dominated “philanthropy industrial complex.”      Bitcoin’s year-end moves weren’t all in one direction. In the 24 hours between New York daybreak on Sunday, Jan. 3, and Monday, Jan. 4, it plunged 18%, from a high of $34,341 to a low of $28,154, only to recover all that within the next 36 hours and to reach $40,755 just before this newsletter went out.    Such wild swings are fodder for nocoiners like Jacob Silverman, who declared in The New Republic “that bitcoin, unlike gold, is worthless.”  Seems reasonable, right? How can something of such mercurial value act as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account – the three functions of money?  It’s a duplicitous argument. Bitcoin could never have birthed with immediate price stability. If it’s to fulfill its “digital gold” use case, it must go on a journey, from misunderstood, unappreciated concept to widespread acceptance. That takes time. Along the way, it will rise in value. But, as speculators buy and sell, it will do so in fits and starts.  How long will this process take? Well, how long did gold take to become a widely accepted store of value? This hilarious video, portraying a vendor rejecting a customer’s offer of gold, “the currency of the future,” instead of a chicken to buy five rat skins and some tepid lemonade, suggests what it was up against:  Patience please. Bitcoin is not yet digital gold. It is becoming digital gold.  This is why the recent rash of high-profile price forecasts matters: $146,000, says JPMorgan; $318,000, says Citibank; $400,000 says Guggenheim. They’re not time-fixed price targets for a stock that will later grow further in value. They are stabs at a fair value once bitcoin attains that needed establishment status.  It’s also why the second part of crypto pioneer Wences Casares’ oft-cited binary framing – that bitcoin could go to $1 million but could also go to zero – still holds. That’s looking less and less likely, but if advocates can’t get past widespread no-coiner mistrust, bitcoin will fail to achieve its potential.  Satoshi’s resolution of the Byzantine Generals’ dilemma gives bitcoin the potential to be a benchmark of digital scarcity, one that’s badly needed for a global economy that’s increasingly digitized and internet-based. But to become that universal standard it must go through a narrative-driven cultural process of awareness. Most important, people need to appreciate that the most important aspect of bitcoin’s security model is not really its tech but the growing size of its network – in other words, the self-fulfilling nature of its acceptance.  Only if and when that process reaches critical mass can we then start to apply this widely accepted, digitally scarce store of value to new forms of monetary utility – perhaps as a settlement layer for lightweight Lightning payments, perhaps as programmable collateral to replace sovereign debt as the foundation of the global bond market, or both.    We have a long way to go before we get there. For now, just enjoy the ride.    Whales vs. minnows    “This time is different” is a dangerous phrase, as Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff reminded us after the 2008 housing crisis. But when comparing the 2017 bitcoin boom with the current one, there are lots of indications this one is different.      The previous one was characterized as a FOMO event as hordes of retail investors, fearful of being left behind, rushed, not only into bitcoin but into countless ill-conceived and often illegal ICOs. It was a Main Street rally.      Sadly, in keeping with the “dumb money” depictions Wall Street traders often use of such hype-chasing investors, many bought high and sold low, losing their shirts when the market collapsed in early 2018. The winners at such times, Wall Street will tell you, are the “smart money” big guys who buy early and sell at the top.      This feels much more like a Wall Street rally. Powerful institutions and big-name investors – from BlackRock’s Larry Fink to Bill Miller of Miller Value Partners and Guggenheim Partners’ Scott Minerd – have either invested in or at least talked about bitcoin’s potential.      There’s even on-chain data to back up the thesis. Coin Metrics’ measure of “whale” bitcoin addresses, those holding more than 1,000 BTC, shows their number falling in 2017 as little guys were buying, but rising solidly as the price rose in 2020 and into the new year.      Of course, the whales of 2017 weren’t exactly Wall Streeters. Many were also retail investors. In that case, the “smart money” were those who grokked crypto and blockchain early on and knew that mania of that time was going too fast too early.      Time will tell whether the Wall Street newcomers are the new smarts or whether they, too, have been played.    The conversation: Washington’s game plan    Two other big bombshells items dropped out of Washington during the break:    On Dec. 18, the Treasury Department proposed that its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) require crypto exchanges to store customer information – KYC/AML requirements – for transfers to unhosted, or self-custodied, wallets of more than $3,000 and to file “Currency Transaction Reports” for transactions aggregating more than $10,000 per day.  On Jan.4, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it would allow banks to use public blockchain-based stablecoins to manage payments.    The first was roundly condemned by the crypto community as an attack on privacy and innovation. The second was hailed as a breakthrough for the crypto economy.      But were these seemingly contradictory initiatives uncoordinated? A look at the Twitter conversation suggests something more might be at play.    On Dec. 21, monetary economist and CoinDesk columnist JP Koning made an observation others had missed: The FinCEN proposal applies not just to regular cryptocurrency exchanges but also to any dealing in central bank digital currencies.  On Jan. 4, Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the main issuer of the USDC stablecoin, raved about the OCC ruling’s power to transform global payments.  And Policy 4.0 CEO Tanvi Ratna pointed out that bringing banks into the stablecoin business means more, not less regulation, and that regulation will have international reach.    Here’s where my mind went: The FinCEN rule is as much about putting U.S. financial surveillance capability onto exchanges of fiat-denominated digital currencies as it is about controlling bitcoin transactions. The OCC rule is perpetuating global demand for dollars because the most-sought after domination in stablecoins is USD as central bank digital currencies threaten to undermine the dollar’s dominance.      What crypto commentators view as a confounding good cop/bad cop routine against them might actually be a coordinated geopolitical play by Washington. Together these rules could help the U.S. maintain its singular power, as the world’s reserve currency issuer, to monitor and regulate global monetary movements, even as China and other countries are trying to use digital currency technology to bypass the U.S.-regulated banking system.    Relevant reads: don’t forget Ethereum    Parallel to our ongoing coverage of the wild bitcoin rally, CoinDesk had a string of stories this past week that suggested Ethereum is also in boom mode, including renewed activity in Ethereum-based decentralized finance.

The “bitcoin rich list” has more names than ever. Grayscale reports an uptick in interest from pension funds and Coinbase makes an acquisition to beef up its institutional bitcoin offerings. It has been a huge news day, so buckle up.    Top shelf    Frontrunning action Ripple tried to settle charges of conducting $1.3 billion worth of unregistered securities transactions when selling XRP to exchanges and the public, before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued in December, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Wednesday. In a Twitter thread, Garlinghouse addressed what he described as five “key questions” about the SEC’s argument, though he warned that he was limited in what he could say because the case is ongoing. Several exchanges have moved to delist or stop XRP trading.      Pensions or bust Grayscale is reporting increased “participation” in its flagship bitcoin and crypto investment products from institutions, pensions and endowments, not just hedge funds. Newly named CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg, ""The sizes of allocations they are making are growing rapidly as well,” with some $27.5 billion in total assets under management. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.)      Rich list grows The number of addresses holding over 1,000 bitcoin stands at a record high of 2,334, indicating that large bitcoin holders have been accumulating bitcoin during the market run-up. This comes after a brief depression in the total number of bitcoin “whales” in December. “The dip and renewed increase at the end of December shows relatively little interest in profit-taking on the part of these large holders, even though almost all holdings are currently in profit,” according to CoinDesk Research’s quarterly review report.      First acquisition of the year Coinbase has acquired trade execution startup Routefire to bolster the exchange’s suite of institutional products ahead of a planned IPO. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, though Routefire was a small, seven-employee firm based in San Francisco. Coinbase has experienced intermittent outages during the run-up in bitcoin’s price above $40,000.      Going public? Cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt, which is majority-owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is in advanced talks to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The deal, if it's concluded, would value the combined company at more than $2 billion, the report said. A deal could be announced as soon as next week.

Download the free report.    At stake    Yesterday, Facebook made the unprecedented decision to ban a sitting president, Donald Trump, from its services for his role in inciting the revolt that damaged the U.S. Capitol. Facebook and other social media firms have had four years to discuss how to balance publishing information in the public interest (because President Trump said it) when much of it is not factual.      Streaming service Twitch, e-commerce platform Shopify and others also banned the president, at least until he leaves office on Jan. 20. The president's Twitter feed, meanwhile, was suspended for 12 hours, Jan. 6-7.      Many opponents have long called for Trump to be booted from his online bully pulpits, where he often commands a large audience (88.7 million people follow @realDonaldTrump, his personal Twitter account). Explaining the decision, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ""current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”      Some in the crypto world see it differently.      “I think what is happening right now is absolutely ridiculous. One big circus show setting us up for the last act – total control of our thoughts and actions. Twitter and Facebook are mass scams. No matter what your political view, the amount of heavy-handed censorship is, let’s say, suspicious,” Josh Petty, founder and CEO of the alternative social media site Twetch, told Blockchain Bites over email.      It’s old hat to call crypto a libertarian insurrectionary movement, though there are some key areas where the two ideologies align – primarily in championing individualism and all the ""classically liberal"" rights associated with that. This means freedom of ownership, freedom of speech and freedom to “exit” from the crowd.      Instead of erecting laws to protect these freedoms, blockchains create cryptographic proofs to ensure certain conditions are always met. These are monetary assurances – like Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply, Ethereum’s infinite programmability or Solana’s blitzkrieg settlement speed – as well as cultural, like the idea that finance and speech should be uncensorable.      “People really value censorship resistance, both for themselves and others, to the degree where it can seem irrational to bystanders,” pseudonymous crypto researcher Hasu wrote in November, in a blog post titled, “Exploring Bitcoin’s core values and why we defend them.”      Blockchains, by connecting people directly, can assure certain freedoms that are often occluded when intermediaries get involved. If you believe that everyone has the right to a platform online, then you’d probably disagree with Facebook’s decision to ban Trump – regardless of the circumstances.      “Social media companies have no direct role in a democracy,” Petty said. “Social media companies, despite using the word ‘social’ to describe them, are private enterprises serving customers and their self-interests.”      Indeed, these bans could be seen as fatuous branding exercises. Trump has less than two weeks in office before a new president is sworn in, and many prominent figures in Congress and elsewhere are calling for his immediate removal.      While the hardline, anti-censorship approach has neat answers for complicated questions, in practice it often runs into just as many sticky situations.      Today, following news reports and a Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) investigation that found “white supremacists and neo-fascists” are using the streaming platform DLive, owned by Justin Sun’s Tron, the blockchain-based platform will take steps to suspend and ban streamers found in violation of its community rules.      ""The DLive team actively are taking actions regarding streamers who are found to be part of or participants in the incident at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., on [Jan. 6] including but not limited to account suspension, removal of past broadcasts, freezing their earnings and abilities to cash out. The donation and paid subscriptions will be refunded to the accounts from which they originated,” a DLive press release reads.      Then again, DLive’s primary selling point was not censorship resistance but its rewards program.

42405663,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoF7,1610123673,Bitcoin's Market Value Now Exceeds That of Facebook,"The explosive surge in the rise of the price of bitcoin has propelled the market value of the leading cryptocurrency past that of social media giant Facebook.    With a market value at this writing of $761.5 billion, bitcoin is now more valuable than all but six publicly traded companies, sitting between Tesla at $805.3 billion and Facebook at $752.4 billion.  After rising more than 300% in 2020, the price of bitcoin is still climbing at an astonishing rate, having gained more than 40% in the last eight days. Bitcoin is currently at $40,758.95, up about 4% in the last 24 hours. It closed 2020 at $29,111.63.  During the past several days, bitcoin has also risen up the ranks of the world's most valuable currencies, overtaking the Russian ruble and the Thai baht, to sit just above the baht and below the Swiss franc.  For one pair of identical twins at least, bitcoin's overtaking Facebook undoubtedly has a more personal significance: Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini co-founder and bitcoin billionaire Cameron Winklevoss, who unsuccessfully sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly having stolen the idea for the social networking site from him and his brother, surely felt good being able to tweet the following:  See also: Why Is Bitcoin Going Up, and Will It Crash Soon?

42376242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5gx,1610123371,Ethereum 2.0 Explained,"With the launch of every new blockchain comes a new block explorer website to understand.  Block explorer sites offer real-time updates on network activity. Normally, they feature information on blocks, transactions and fees. On Ethereum 2.0, the block explorers depict a very different array of metrics involving epochs, slots and attestations.  But even for those familiar with the usual Ethereum explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and Blockchair, the new sites for tracking Ethereum 2.0 activity may be difficult to decipher. This guide is meant to be a resource for understanding their new terminology and gleaning useful insights about the activity of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network.  For anyone unfamiliar with blockchain explorers in general, this guide will go over the basic details of reading an Ethereum 2.0 blockchain explorer. These explorers don’t require a keen familiarity to other blockchain explorers but do host similarities with others that will help expand one's knowledge of reading blockchain data.  See also: Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Goes Live  We’ll go over four basic metrics tracked by two different block explorer sites, BeaconScan and beaconcha.in. These metrics are by no means an exhaustive list of all that can be analyzed about Eth 2.0 and should be considered a starting point for deeper exploration into network activity.  Epochs progressed  Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ethereum 2.0 progresses in epochs, not blocks. An epoch is a bundle of up to 32 blocks that actors on the network (called validators) propose and attest to over a period lasting roughly 6.4 minutes. An epoch, along with all the blocks of which it is composed, is only considered finalized after the progression of two more epochs after it.  See also: A Day in the Life of an Ethereum 2.0 Validator  The number of epochs progressed is a reflection of how much time has elapsed on the network, as well as the finality of all transaction data up to the current epoch number minus two, otherwise called the “finalized epoch” number. (See image above.)  This metric can be a useful indicator of any network abnormalities. Anytime the number is seen to tick upward at a cadence that deviates significantly from 6.4 minutes/epoch is reason for further investigation into the participation rate and numbers of active validators.  Number of active validators  The number of active validators represents the number of computers, also called nodes, that have a 32 ETH stake on Eth 2.0 and that have passed the activation queue for entry into the network. As of Jan. 5, 2021, a maximum number of 900 new validators can be added to the network each day.  A total of 262,144 validators is needed at minimum for Eth 2.0 to advance to its next phase of development in which 64 mini-blockchains, called “shards,” will be spawned. At the current rate of 900 new validators being added to the network each day, phase 1 will occur sometime in late August or early September of this year.  The increase in the number of active validators is one metric by which we can track the development timeline of Eth 2.0. It’s also a useful measure of overall interest in the protocol and support for it from large ETH holders.  Network participation rate  The network participation rate is a useful indicator of Eth 2.0 network health. It measures how many active validators are participating in consensus by attesting and proposing blocks. Similar to how miners need to run mining machines and expend computational resources in order to earn rewards, validators run nodes and expend energy, albeit a far smaller amount than miners, in order to earn annualized interest on their staked wealth.  A participation rate of 99% suggests the vast majority of validators on Eth 2.0 are doing their job and securing the network. Significant declines in this number would suggest active validators are shutting their nodes down and disconnecting from Eth 2.0.  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Secures Enough Funds to Launch  This could be as a result of a major power outage in a certain part of the world or of validators lacking sufficient financial incentive to keep their machines running. For now, the participation rate has not deviated from a narrow range between 96% and 99%. However, its change over time will give clues as to how engaged Eth 2.0 validators are with earning rewards on the network.  Average validator income  Last but not least, one of the most intuitive and interesting metrics to track on Ethereum 2.0 is how much validators are earning on average, daily. Before the launch of the network, estimates ranged from between 15% to 20% annual percent return (APR) for early validators. As of Jan. 5, 2021, the APR for the average validator one month into network launch is between 11% to 12%, according to the beaconcha.in calculator.  On block explorer BeaconScan, validator rewards are broken down by day. For the past two weeks, validators have been earning roughly 0.008 ETH/day, which is valued at around $8.86/day at time of writing. Initially, the daily average had reached as high as 0.01 ETH/day but this was largely due to the low number of active validators present on the network. The reward system of Eth 2.0 is dynamically structured so that an increasing number of Eth 2.0 validators will trigger lower validator returns and vice versa.  Taking a look at the lowest daily average recorded thus far, which is 0.005 ETH/day on Dec. 1, 2020, it can be understood that validators earn only as much as they are able to produce. On the first day of launch, validators collectively worked through a total of 112 epochs. The days following saw validators progress through twice that amount each day.  Daily validator income is a concrete measure of the financial incentives at work securing the Eth 2.0 network. Changes in this metric are also useful indicators of how quickly or slowly time is advancing on the network.  Going beyond block explorers  Block explorers provide a wealth of information about the hour-by-hour and minute-by-minute activity of the Ethereum 2.0 network. They’re also free to use and available to the public.  Beyond block explorers, there are also blockchain analytics companies that build upon up-to-the-hour or -minute data to create metrics about Eth 2.0 spanning longer time horizons.

With the proposed legislation, the central bank is following the call of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to regulate cryptocurrencies and prevent related money laundering and terrorism financing risks, according to an explanatory note.      With Kyrgyz citizens becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies, and the technology gaining traction in electronic commerce worldwide, it's important to mitigate the risks associated with crypto, the National Bank wrote.      The regulator announced the proposed legislation on Dec. 31, 2020, publishing a package of drafts detailing why the new bill is needed and how it fits into Kyrgyzstan's existing regulation.      In one draft, cryptocurrency is defined as a digital good that represents value, is stored and used electronically and is neither a legal mean of payment nor a document representing any property rights. Virtual assets, however, are a different kind of asset and can represent property rights, another draft says, without going into detail.      Under the proposal, the property rights of cryptocurrency owners would be protected by the courts. Any companies and individual entrepreneurs, if they are not registered crypto operators or miners, should not accept crypto as payment for goods or services, as well as in a form of investment or savings deposit. Entities would not be able to offer crypto brokerage or issue securities based on cryptocurrencies.    Licensing and tax    Crypto exchanges, in turn, must register with and be licensed by the National Bank, and must keep a record of transactions they have facilitated – data that must be provided to the National Bank upon request. In the case of an ""emergency,"" the regulator can request that exchanges take specific measures for ""risk diminishing.""      The taxation of crypto-related businesses should be carried out the same way as the foreign exchange brokerages, the National Bank wrote.      The regulator also says participants of the cryptocurrency market must make transactions with crypto ""in good faith and on their own risk,"" learn how the cryptocurrencies of their choice function and abide by Kyrgyzstan's laws.

42405678,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoTs,1610114702,"First Mover: It Might Be Getting 'Silly' as Bitcoin Passes $39K, $40K, $41K","Bitcoin's momentum showed few signs of slowing on Friday as prices pushed to a new all-time high after blowing through $40,000 for the first time.      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as investors bet a dismal jobs report expected early Friday from the Labor Department on the December employment situation would strengthen the case for additional economic stimulus. Gold weakened 1.1% to $1,893 an ounce.      Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped Thursday to 1.07%, the highest since March, as traders focused on the potential for faster inflation under a U.S. government controlled by President-elect Joe Biden's Democratic party, according to the Wall Street Journal.      Read More: Over $41,000: Bitcoin Continues to Forge New Highs    Market moves    Bitcoin has climbed more than 40% in the first eight days of 2021 – after a quadrupling in 2020 and doubling in 2019 – and some analysts are turning wary.      ""We are very much in speculative bubble territory now, and while I don't think it's done it's becoming increasingly likely that it's going to get messy,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the London-based foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""I previously said I wouldn't be surprised to see $50,000 before the end of the month and I'm now thinking that was too conservative. The last $10,000 move only took four days. It's getting silly now.""      First Mover reached out to investors, analysts, executives and one finance professor for their views on whether a correction might be in the future. TL;DR: Yes. Here's what they said:    Joe DiPasquale, CEO, BitBull Capital, a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund. He says bitcoin “has been and remains extremely volatile.” As recently as Monday, he noted, after prices had climbed to a new all-time high, they tumbled almost $7,000. “What causes this is that people can use lots of leverage, so they can easily get washed out.” He sees a correction as possible, though there appear to be plenty of interested buyers around $28,000, so that might level might function like a price support barring any major news that might send prices crashing. What might that be? A forceful move by regulators to impose stiff anti-money-laundering rules on merchants, raising the threat of prosecution or forfeiture if bitcoin can be traced back to illicit proceeds. That might scare off new buyers.  Gavin Smith, CEO of the digital-asset firm Panxora. According to Smith, there hasn’t been a single year since 2013 when prices have not fallen at least 25% from a high point reached earlier in that year. “Before that it would move so much up and down that you can’t really draw any analysis.” He said he wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin prices rise to $70,000 or $80,000, nor if a setback of 40% were to materialize. Medium term, he’s bullish: “Over a three-year period, this is a great asset.” Over the long term, there’s a risk that technological developments could overtake bitcoin. “Even with quantum computing, there's nothing on the horizon that indicates that could happen,” he says, “but it’s always dangerous to completely ignore the risk.”  Mike Venuto, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing exchange-traded fund, which invests in blockchain-related stocks. Will bitcoin crash? “People are going to ask this because the last time we had a rally like this, it did crash.” He sees bitcoin prices rallying two to three times from their current level before falling back to about where they are now. That would imply a two-thirds retracement from that hypothetically new all-time high. “What’ll cause a crash more likely is overexuberance on the upside. I don’t think we’re there yet.” He says he estimates bitcoin’s fundamental value, based on the current size of the network, to be “somewhere between $40,000 and $50,000,” though that could increase over time.  Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant. “There will be swings and, yes, the swings will be wild,” he says. “You have a lot of retail flow that tends to panic.” He sees prices going up, in the long term, at least partly based on the bullish expectations of big Wall Street firms. “Can it go to $4,000? Yes.” One potential trigger for a rapid sell-off could be any actions brought by authorities against the company behind tether (USDT), a privately issued, dollar-linked digital token known as a “stablecoin” that has become a key source of liquidity in digital-asset markets. New York State prosecutors are currently battling Tether in court due to its finances.  James Angel, Georgetown University finance professor. “The history of financial markets is the history of bubbles, where investors get carried away with enthusiasm and they bid the prices of certain assets to levels far above their fundamental values,” Angel says. He notes that authorities could move to crimp the bitcoin rally if they start to get worried that it’s becoming a threat. “Almost everybody who tries to start their own money does so in competition with a national currency, and it usually gets shoved aside by regulators.”  Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a cryptocurrency provider. ""Bitcoin passing the $40,000 milestone shows the market still sees upside in the cryptocurrency market. While we're currently seeing an unequivocal expression in the market's bullish sentiment, a correction could well be on the horizon. But this is a natural part of market mechanics. While it may dampen near-term enthusiasm, it will ensure future price rises remain grounded.""  Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at the trading platform eToro. “There is likely to be profit-taking along the way, causing temporary dips (which are. of course. magnified with bitcoin relative to traditional assets) but, given the extraordinary amounts of adoption by institutions, it would be a surprise if bitcoin dropped below $20,000 any time soon – though I would caveat this to say that we are monitoring proposed regulatory measures and the posture of the new administration towards crypto to assess if they would have an adverse impact on institutional adoption of crypto assets.”    - Bradley Keoun and Muyao Shen      Read More: Why Is Bitcoin Going Up, and Will It Crash Soon? What’s Next as Price Doubles to $40K    Bitcoin watch    U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s Democratic party narrowly triumphed in the state of Georgia's special Senate elections earlier this week, wresting control of the upper legislative chamber from outgoing President Donald Trump's Republicans. With the lower chamber also under Democratic control, Biden and party leaders could have more room to implement policies.      Analysts at UBS Bank say the unified government houses could smooth the path to more fiscal stimulus. According to an Axios report, Biden is considering a two-pronged stimulus effort in the form of $2,000 checks for Americans and a tax and infrastructure spending package worth $3 trillion. The new fiscal stimulus is expected to boost inflation, weaken the U.S. dollar and bring more buyers for scare assets such as bitcoin and gold.      Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk that Biden’s stimulus would inject more liquidity into markets and likely fuel further bitcoin price rises.      The leading cryptocurrency is already in a strong bull market, courtesy of the inflation-boosting measures adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government over the past 10 months to counter the coronavirus-induced slowdown. These measures have pushed institutions to seek investments that offer a hedge against inflation.      Bitcoin prices have risen from $10,000 to record highs above $41,000 in the past four months, with public-listed companies such as MicroStrategy buying bitcoin to preserve the value of their treasury reserves. That trend could gather pace, as predicted by JPMorgan, with Biden’s additional fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s continued easing.      “The Biden stimulus may add an extra jolt to bitcoin’s price, but nothing more than pushing along a barreling freight train,” Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Why Joe Biden’s $3T Stimulus Package Could Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Rally    What's hot    65K comments and counting: Crypto industry fights ‘arbitrary’ Treasury rule (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin ""rich list"" rebounds to all-time high (CoinDesk)      XRP climbs back up crypto rankings with near 50% rise (CoinDesk)      Grayscale, provider of bitcoin trust, promotes Sonnenshein to CEO, plans to double staff in 2021, sees interest from pension funds and endowments (CoinDesk, Bloomberg)      BitMEX exchange says all users are now verified, months after U.S. prosecutors, regulators bring charges against principals over unregistered trading (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    December jobs report from U.S. Labor Department is projected to show the unemployment rate increased for the first time in eight months; economists see nonfarm payrolls growing by 50,000; report from Labor Department is due at 8:30 NY time (13:30 UTC) (Bloomberg).

42405667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoJ3,1610112600,Internet Shutdowns Cost India $2.8B in 2020: Report,"A new report shows India’s regional internet shutdowns in 2020 cost its economy approximately $2.8 billion, making it the country that suffered the most damage from internet manipulation by a government last year.      Internet shutdowns, or the intentional disruptions of internet access or electronic communications targeting a specific location or population, are often used by governments to control unrest but often lead to human rights abuses, from silencing the press and obstructing peaceful protests to cutting off access to information.      Intermittent shutdowns across India, combined with the blackout in the disputed Kashmir region that extended over months, made up 8,927 hours and affected over 10 million people, the report said. It also shows India and Myanmar are responsible for the longest shutdowns for the second consecutive year.      The “Global Cost of Internet Shutdowns in 2020” report, published by Virtual Provider Network (VPN) review platform Top10VPN, compiled instances of internet manipulation across the globe through the year and found that major shutdowns took place in 21 countries including Belarus, Yemen and Myanmar, contributing to a loss of over $4 billion in total – with India’s losses counting for about three-fourths of the total global cost.      Internet disruptions in these countries took a number of forms: total blackouts, social media shutdowns and internet throttling (when internet service providers limit users’ bandwidth or internet speeds), the report noted.      Read More: Belarus is Back Online, With Lessons About Censorship Resistance      “Not only are [internet disruptions] an act of economic self-sabotage, they also violate citizens’ freedom of expression, the right to information and the right to peaceful assembly,” Samuel Woodhams, digital rights researcher at Top10VPN and one of the authors of the report, told CoinDesk via an email.      The report indicated that in countries such as Myanmar and Yemen, internet disruptions may have prevented citizens, particularly in rural areas, from receiving important information and updates about the spread of COVID-19.      “By disrupting access to the internet, authorities denied citizens the right to access vital information about the virus … and may have created conditions in which the virus was able to spread unabated,” Woodhams said.      However, the global economic cost of internet shutdowns in 2020 was down by 50% from 2019, when the annual analysis by Top10VPN showed a loss of $8 billion. For instance, 263 days of disruptions in Iraq cost the nation $2.3 billion in 2019 compared to India, which lost $2.8 billion in over 8,000 days of disruptions.      Woodhams explained this is due to a disparity in the scale of interference.      “The Iraq and Sudan shutdowns in 2019 were so expensive because they were nationwide, rather than localized. In India, all of the restrictions were targeting regions, not the whole country, so the impact on the economy was less as only a proportion of the population experienced restrictions,” Woodhams said.      Between 2019 and 2020, India was responsible for the longest recorded internet shutdown in a democracy as the Kashmir region remained in the dark for at least seven months. When the internet was eventually restored, users only had access to 2G speeds, an example of severe internet throttling by a government over an extended time.      “While there is often little transparency regarding who ordered the disruptions, it is normally always authorities forcing companies to slow their speeds,” Woodhams said.      Read More: In India, a Clash of Digital Innovation and Internet Censorship      He added that the research team at Top10VPN kept up to date with internet shutdowns throughout the year and gathered data from a range of sources including nongovernmental internet monitoring organization Netblocks, which the researchers also used to estimate the cost, as well as an internet shutdown tracker by India’s Software Freedom Law Center.      The objective of reports compiling the costs of globe-spanning records of internet shutdowns is to make authorities around the world think twice about imposing these deliberate digital disruptions, Woodhams said.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/08/internet-shutdowns-cost-india-28b-in-2020-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff92c388bfe23565c6ac040b2bd9bb3895caf060-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoRu,1610111139,Why Joe Biden's $3T Stimulus Package Could Add Fuel to Bitcoin's Rally,"The Democratic Party narrowly triumphed in the special Senate elections in the state of Georgia earlier this week, wresting control of the U.S. Senate from the Republicans. As such, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives now has more freedom to implement its economic policies.      Analysts at UBS Bank believe the unified government legislature will smooth the path to more fiscal stimulus. According to an Axios report, President-elect Joe Biden is considering a two-pronged stimulus effort in the form of $2,000 checks for Americans and a tax and infrastructure spending package worth $3 trillion.      The new fiscal stimulus is expected to boost inflation, weaken the U.S. dollar and bring more buyers for scare assets such as bitcoin and gold.      Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk the extra stimulus would inject more liquidity into markets and likely fuel further bitcoin price rises.      The leading cryptocurrency is already in a strong bull market, courtesy of the inflation-boosting measures adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government over the past 10 months to counter the coronavirus-induced slowdown. These measures have pushed institutions to seek investments that offer a hedge against inflation.      Bitcoin prices have risen from $10,000 to record highs above $41,000 in the past four months, with publicly listed companies such as MicroStrategy buying bitcoin to preserve the value of their treasury reserves. That trend could gather pace, as predicted by JPMorgan, with Biden's additional fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's continued easing.      ""The Biden stimulus may add an extra jolt to bitcoin's price, but nothing more than pushing along a barreling freight train,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.      The U.S. central bank is unlikely to unwind or scale back its $120 billion-per-month asset-purchase program any time soon and is committed to keeping interest rates at record lows for sometime after inflation has risen above its 2% target.    Inflation expected    Market-based measures of inflation have begun factoring in a potential stimulus-driven rise in price pressures in the economy. The 10-year breakeven rate, which represents how the bond market foresees long-term inflation, rose to 2.09% on Thursday, the highest level in over two years, according to St. Louis Federal Reserve.      The breakeven rate bottomed out near 0.5% in March 2020 and has been rising ever since. Bitcoin has pretty much mimicked the ascent in inflation expectations over the past 10 months.      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is also extending its 2020 decline on expectations for additional fiscal stimulus. The index fell to a 33-month low of 89.21 earlier this week, while gold, a traditional inflation hedge, rallied to two-month highs near $1,960 per ounce.      Alongside all this, bitcoin has gained over 40% since the start of the year just eight days ago. The cryptocurrency set yet another new record high of $41,026 earlier today.      Also read: ‘Bitcoin Rich List’ Rebounds to Hit All-Time High      ""Traders are looking toward dollar weakness that would correlate to further upside in bitcoin,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit legal organization, said on its Hatewatch blog Thursday that ""white supremacists and neo-fascists"" have taken to DLive as a streaming alternative to YouTube due to its lack of moderation.      SPLC said it identified five DLive accounts livestreaming the protests: ""Baked Alaska,"" ""Gloomtube,"" ""Murder the Media,"" ""Loulz"" and ""Woozuh."" Baked Alaska members managed to breach the Capitol building, the post says.      The non-profit estimates that since DLive was founded it has allowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to be sent to such extremists through donations of cryptocurrency via a facility built into the site.      The platform also reaps rewards from the extremists' funding. DLive takes 25% from every donation, with 20% going to the platform itself and 5% is redistributed to other DLive users via its staking system, said SPLC.      On Wednesday, there was an unprecedented breach of the U.S. Capitol building as rioters supporting outgoing President Donald Trump stormed the building. The rioting left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer, and many wounded.      In December 2019, Tron founder Justin Sun announced his firm had struck an acquisition deal with DLive, moving the platform to the Tron Blockchain and integrating it with BitTorrent’s BLive streaming service.    See also: YouTube, Tron and the Dream of Decentralization    On Friday, soon after this article was published, DLive said in a post, ""While we strongly advocate for the empowerment of our content creators, we also have zero tolerance towards any forms of violence and illegal activities.""      Since Thursday, the platform said it has suspended three accounts, taken five channels offline, banned two accounts from livestreaming and permanently removed over 100 past broadcasts.      It's also taking action against streamers found to have been involved in the riots:    ""The DLive team actively are taking actions regarding streamers who are found to be part of or participants in the incident at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. on January 6th including but not limited to account suspension, removal of past broadcasts, freezing their earnings and abilities to cash out. The donation and paid subscriptions will be refunded to the accounts from which they originated.""    DLive further said it is now working on adding new reporting functions to help stop channels violating guidelines.      UPDATE (Jan. 8, 11:20 UTC): Updated with statements from DLive.

42405689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedoG6,1610098405,US Judge U-Turns on Ruling in Overstock Digital Dividend Lawsuit,"A senior district judge in the U.S. state of Utah has acknowledged he made a ""mistake"" when granting Overstock's motion to dismiss a lawsuit over its digital dividend issued in 2019.    In late September 2020, Overstock, the bitcoin-friendly e-commerce firm, was granted the motion to dismiss the case brought by the Mangrove Partners Master Fund.  In the latest filing on Jan. 6, Judge Dale Kimball said he had ""overlooked"" a footnote from the plaintiff requesting permission to file an amended complaint if the motion was granted.  The case hinges around the digital dividend that Overstock paid to investors, with Mangrove alleging it was deliberately designed to create an artificial squeeze on short sellers.  The plaintiff also claimed Overstock had made false declarations about its financial future.  The shareholder dividend took the form of a digital security listed on Overstock affiliate tZero’s trading platform.  Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s CEO at the time and a defendant in the lawsuit, was famously anti-short sellers and reportedly first became interested in blockchain as a way to limit their actions.  With Judge Kimball now acknowledging his error in granting Overstock's motion, he nullified the original ruling and granted Mangrove permission to file an amended complaint.

The reality is the bitcoin cryptocurrency’s trading history is so short, with methods for valuing the asset still largely untested, that nobody really knows for sure what it should be worth now or in the future.      That hasn’t stopped digital-asset investors or even Wall Street analysts from putting out price forecasts ranging from $50,000 to $400,000 or beyond.      Based on CoinDesk’s reporting, here are a few key reasons why bitcoin prices have recently rallied:    Demand from institutional buyers, many of them eyeing bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The cryptocurrency is seen as a hedge against inflation because, under the network’s original programming, only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created; so there’s a contrast with central banks like the Federal Reserve that can decide based on a committee vote to print more money. Big asset managers including Tudor Investmentand Guggenheim Partners have announced bitcoin purchases or wagered on prices using futures contracts on the Chicago-based CME exchange. Even old-line Wall Street firms such as Morgan Stanley have weighed in with bullish pronouncements. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, recently predicted a price of $146,000 over the long term.  The U.S. dollar’s decline in foreign exchange markets. The U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the dollar’s value against major world currencies like the euro and Japanese yen, slid 6.8% in 2020 and is down again in 2021. That’s key for bitcoin because the cryptocurrency’s price is mostly denominated in U.S. dollars. Possible reasons for the greenback’s decline include the Federal Reserve’s $3 trillion-plus of money printing over the past year, which is roughly three-quarters of the entire amount previously created in the U.S. central bank’s 108-year history. Images of protestors storming the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday probably didn’t burnish America’s leadership role on the global stage, and now many economists are predicting that big spending plans under a Democratic-controlled government would lead to new stimulus bills and potentially outsize government budget deficits for years to come. Much of those extra costs could be financed through additional Fed money printing.  Retail purchases. Many individuals are speculating on bitcoin prices, and it’s become increasingly easy to buy bitcoin, with big services like PayPal enabling purchases last year. Analysts for the digital-asset firm ByteTree noted this week that blockchain data appear to show a high concentration of bitcoin purchases in the amount of $600 - the same amount as the American stimulus checks sent out in the latest U.S. coronavirus emergency aid package.    All this may have led to a tremendous rally over the past few months. But could bitcoin prices crash? Of course they could, several analysts told CoinDesk.      The cryptocurrency’s price is notoriously volatile, and substantial and unexpected price swings aren’t uncommon. Below is a sampling of comments from cryptocurrency analysts and other financial experts on how a pullback might look, and what might cause it.    Bitcoin “has been and remains extremely volatile,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO, BitBull Capital, a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund. As recently as Monday, he noted, after prices had climbed to a new all-time high, they tumbled almost $7,000. “What causes this is that people can use lots of leverage, so they can easily get washed out.” He sees a correction as possible, though there appear to be plenty of interested buyers around $28,000, so that level might function like a price support.  There hasn’t been a single year since 2013 when prices have not fallen at least 25% from a high point reached earlier in that year, said Gavin Smith, CEO of the digital-asset firm Panxora. He said he wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin prices rise to $70,000 or $80,000, nor a setback of 40%. Medium term, he’s bullish: “Over a three-year period, this is a great asset.” But over the long term, there’s a risk that technological developments could overtake bitcoin. “Even with quantum computing, there's nothing on the horizon that indicates that could happen,” he says, “but it’s always dangerous to completely ignore the risk.”  Bitcoin prices could rally two to three times from their current level before falling back to about where they are now, said Mike Venuto, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing exchange-traded fund, which invests in blockchain-related stocks. That would imply a retracement of more than two-thirds from that hypothetically new all-time high. “What’ll cause a crash more likely is overexuberance on the upside. I don’t think we’re there yet.”  “There will be swings, and yes, the swings will be wild,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant. “You have a lot of retail flow that tends to panic.” He sees prices going up in the long term, at least partly based on the bullish expectations of big Wall Street firms. “Can it go to $4,000? Yes.” One potential trigger for a rapid sell-off could be any actions brought by authorities against the company behind tether (USDT), a privately issued, dollar-linked digital token known as a “stablecoin” that has become a key source of liquidity in digital-asset markets. New York State prosecutors are currently battling Tether in court due to its finances.  “The history of financial markets is the history of bubbles,"" said James Angel, Georgetown University finance professor. He notes that authorities could move to crimp the bitcoin rally if they start to get worried that it’s becoming a threat. “Almost everybody who tries to start their own money does so in competition with a national currency, and it usually gets shoved aside by regulators.”  ""While we're currently seeing an unequivocal expression in the market's bullish sentiment, a correction could well be on the horizon,"" said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a cryptocurrency provider. ""This is a natural part of market mechanics. While it may dampen near-term enthusiasm, it will ensure future price rises remain grounded.""  “There is likely to be profit taking along the way, causing temporary dips,"" said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at the trading platform eToro. ""But given the extraordinary amounts of adoption by institutions, it would be a surprise if bitcoin dropped below $20,000 any time soon.”    So for the Zoom party, you can tell them: Yes, according to the experts, a crash is probably coming but that’s typical for bitcoin, and if history is any guide, prices will probably recover.      Just don’t tell them when.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,"Bradley Keoun, Muyao Shen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/08/why-is-bitcoin-going-up-and-will-it-crash-soon-whats-next-as-price-doubles-to-40k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6f523646c3cd7cbc3d3a0b9a5b289d82cf91fd7-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
