42404923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bZV,1597098116,How a Decentralized Randomness Beacon Could Boost Cryptographic Security,"Key takeaways:    The League of Entropy is launching the first production-ready version of drand, a network that produces ""randomness"" (also known as entropy) for anyone to use.  Randomness is essential to cryptographic security.  Filecoin is the first protocol to use this version of drand in its upcoming mainnet launch to create decentralized, verifiable randomness for “leader selection.”    A novel cryptography piece, which could be of help to many cryptocurrency projects, is officially launching in production today.      The League of Entropy, which was launched last year, is opening the first production-ready version of drand, a network that produces ""randomness"" (also known as entropy) for anyone to use. Cryptography uses math and puzzles to secure communication in a way that snoops can't untangle. Randomness is an essential piece of cryptography that ensures security by adding unpredictable information to the mix.    What is entropy (or randomness)?    Randomness is data produced in an unpredictable way. One example is rolling a six-sided dice. Before rolling it, you can't predict which of the six numbers will appear.      You can even join together many dice rolls into a string of numbers. The more dice rolls done in a row, the more random and unpredictable the value.      A beacon is a randomness generator that shoots out random numbers at regular intervals, which anyone can look at and verify.      League of Entropy's drand beacon network is unique in that it generates randomness in a new way that doesn't rely on a single point of failure.      It's analogous to having several dice rollers generating numbers and stringing them together, so no single one needs to be trusted.      The founding members, who will be running the beacon, are Cloudflare, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Kudelski Security, Protocol Labs, and the University of Chile. Current membership has expanded to include C4DT, ChainSafe, cLabs, Emerald Onion, the Ethereum Foundation, IC3, PTisp, Tierion and UCL.      Read more: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser      At first an experimental project, League of Entropy is now launching drand in production for use on living and breathing projects. Filecoin, a decentralized storage network, will be the first to use the randomness generated by League of Entropy as an integral piece of its network.      ""There is simply no public service at the moment that provides the necessary guarantees that multiple applications that use randomness need,” Protocol Labs research scientist Nicolas Gailly told CoinDesk. Protocol Labs is the research and development organization behind Filecoin, which aims to ""radically improve the internet.""      The researchers behind the network have big plans for it: They see it becoming as important as other protocols underpinning the internet today. (Of course, whether it becomes that big remains to be seen.)    Why randomness?    Randomness is a crucial part of cryptography.      When you generate a private key for bitcoin or another a cryptocurrency, randomness is an essential ingredient. It is a component that wallets generally generate behind the scenes with the help of math.      Randomness helps to ensure that no one else can guess what your private key is.      Read more: Trust No Dapp: Chainlink Launches Oracle for Provable Randomness      ""Intuitively, this is why randomness is crucial in cryptographic applications – because it provides a way to create information that an adversary can't learn or predict,"" as a research paper on randomness from IEEE Security & Privacy magazine puts it.      For another example, Cloudflare famously uses a wall of lava lamps to produce the randomness it uses to secure a large swathe of the internet.    Public vs. private randomness    The type of randomness used in private keys is supposed to stay private, of course. Exposing the randomness could make it possible to figure out the full private key, leading the user to lose their cryptocurrency.      There's another, different type of randomness that League of Entropy uses – public randomness. This is useful for many other applications where the random numbers produced need to be verified by the public and can be verified by whoever looks at the website.      An example of where this can come in handy is a typical lottery, where the winners are chosen by supposedly random draws from a hat.      The problem is that lotteries have been gamed by the creators over the years, especially in cases where the creator has some control over the randomness generation process. It helps to have a beacon that chooses these random numbers, rather than a less public entity, as it makes it harder to game.      There are various ways to generate public randomness today. One such trusted source of randomness is the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST).      But there is still one problem: Generally, you still have to trust the entity, whether NIST or some other organization, that generates the randomness.      Read more: Ethereum Foundation and Others Weigh $15 Million Bid to Build ‘Randomness’ Tech      That is where drand comes in. It's a beacon generating randomness but in a decentralized way, to the extent that the several members composing League of Entropy are providing the randomness. If all goes according to plan, you won't have to trust one single entity, such as NIST. The idea is that it's less likely the organizations comprising the league will collude.      ""Today, randomness beacons generate numbers for lotteries and election audits – both affect the lives and fortunes of millions of people. Unfortunately, exploitation of the single point of origin of these beacons have created dishonest results that benefited one corrupt insider. To thwart exploitation efforts, Cloudflare and other randomness-beacon providers have joined forces to bring users a quorum of decentralized randomness beacons. After all, eight independent globally distributed beacons can be much more trustworthy than one!"" reads the blog post announcing League of Entropy in 2019.      ""There is no other production-ready randomness beacon that combines the guarantees of drand: publicly verifiable, decentralized and unbiasable,"" Gailly added.    Drand meets Filecoin    This ""beacon"" can be used for all sorts of applications, from election auditing, to lotteries, to cryptocurrency.      Filecoin is the first project to give the LoE beacon a whirl in Filecoin's attempt at making the internet better. Filecoin is in the midst of preparation for a mainnet launch, after several delays.      Read more: Filecoin Pushes Back Final Testing Phase, Announces ‘Calibration Period’ for Miners      Bitcoin miners are more likely to win block rewards if they have more mining hardware and computational power. By contrast, miners in Filecoin are more likely to win block rewards if they have more storagespace to contribute to the network.      The process of selecting a miner who wins each block reward is known as ""leader selection."" Filecoin will be using randomness generated by the League of Entropy for this so-called ""leader generation.""      ""Being able to verify the validity of the randomness, that it's actually correctly generated, is a crucial property for leader election in blockchains,"" Gailly said.      They launched the League of Network beacon to accomodate all of these use cases.      ""Drand’s largest deployment, the League of Entropy Mainnet, is a network specialized in generating randomness that can serve many applications rather than being tailored or embedded in just one application,"" said David Dias, research engineer at Protocol Labs and the drand project lead.      “The League of Entropy is creating the basis for future systems to leverage trustworthy public randomness online, and the new collaborative governance will only improve its ability to do so. We’re excited to watch drand help prevent bias and detect manipulation in elections, lotteries, and distributed ledger platforms, and improve the Internet for generations to come,” said Cloudfare head of research Nick Sullivan in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIL | MINING | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/10/how-a-decentralized-randomness-beacon-could-boost-cryptographic-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74a3a05f57c7ffd837589b58c34746c08d209786-2560x1927.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,468-$12,084  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin was able to hit as high as $12,084 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase only to quickly drop 4.5% a few hours later. Leverage may have played a large part in its initial runup and the sudden move down after, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research for Bequant, a London-based digital assets prime broker.      Read More: Bitcoin Suddenly Drops by $500 After Passing $12K      Indeed, leveraged bitcoin traders on derivatives exchange BitMEX were wiped out on the price ride up and back down. As bitcoin’s price increased, short-positioned traders lost over $2.5 million, the crypto equivalent of a margin call. Then, when the bitcoin price decreased, long-positioned traders lost over $8.4 million.      Vinokourov expects more short-term action in the derivatives market to affect bitcoin’s price. That’s because of very low perpetual rates charged to leverage on derivatives platforms such as BitMEX. “With perpetual rates that are flat to slightly positive, leverage flow will likely try its luck again and look to squeeze into the mid-$12,500 zone,” Vinokourov told CoinDesk.

One pattern with which that's historically been consistent is profit-taking during a broader trend of price increases,” said Suduiko.      Bitcoin is up 30% since the start of July, and Suduiko notes an array of factors for being bitcoin bullish. “In the context of sustained trading volume, increased signals of institutional entry and worries about the potential devaluation of the dollar, it's possible that this may represent broader interest in bitcoin's value rather than a fluke run-up in price,” he said.

Benefiting from this rally, moreover, cryptocurrency mining stocks trading on U.S. markets are significantly outperforming the benchmark cryptocurrency.    Over the past year, two cryptocurrency mining companies – Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group – have gained 97% and over 128 percent, respectively. Bitcoin is up 3% in the same period.  The companies moderately underperformed bitcoin during the Q1 2020, but since mid-April, both took off.

42404924,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bdR,1597085270,"After Tumultuous Election, Belarus Goes Offline","The Belarus presidential election ended with mass protests and a nationwide internet outage.      The country went offline on Sunday during its presidential election. Major social networks and message sites including Viber, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were inaccessible, as were local news outlets.      Following weeks of tension, people streamed into the streets of the capital to protest the landslide victory by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya rejected the results, claiming they were falsified.      Internet watchdog NetBlocks first detected network disruptions as early as 3:00 a.m. local time on election day, according to NetBlocks CEO Alp Toker and director of research Isik Mater. Social media restrictions began to pick up around 9:00 a.m. local time. But just as the polls were closing on Sunday, at around 8:19 p.m. local time, NetBlocks observed a near total connectivity drop across the country.      Toker exclusively told CoinDesk there were indications three Belarusian banks were reconnected simultaneously at around 1:30 p.m. local time Monday, but the core disruptions that began after the election were still in place.      As of 9:00 p.m. local time on Monday, many Internet blockages remained. “Only Telegram is working now via some proxy servers; those get cut from time to time, too,” said Nadia Venzhina of the Cyber Academy educational project in Belarus. “Those who set up a [virtual private network] in advance still can use Facebook and YouTube, but all the commonly used VPNs are down now, and you can’t install them,” she added.      Thirty human rights organizations signed a petition to the United Nations against the internet outage Monday, including Russia’s Moscow Helsinki Group, the U.K.’s Article19, South African Legal Resources Center and others.      According to NetBlocks' reports, in 2020 alone at least 10 countries including Zimbabwe and Venezuela at some point resorted to blocking access or use of the internet and social media to suppress communication during elections, or as a means of curbing public protests.    System overwhelmed    On Saturday, a local news report claimed a cellular company confirmed all forms of communication in Minsk, including telephone lines and the internet, would not work on election day. According to the report, employees of hotels and retail outlets received an “unspoken warning” about the communications shutdown but were asked to show up to work.      According to the chief technology officer of the Belarussian hosting service Hoster.by, Denis Otvalko, the reason for the outage might be the deep packet inspection (DPI) software analyzing web traffic to the country via national internet providers, reported local publication 42.tut.by.      “It might be that those filtering devices failed to proceed all the requests they got yesterday, we can only guess,” Otvalko said, noting that “the government has 100% control over the incoming traffic.”      Belarus President Lukashenko denied shutting down the internet, blaming the attacks from abroad, especially the U.K., Czech Republic and Poland. Belarus’ major internet provider Beltelecom said it had been dealing with increased traffic from abroad since Aug. 8.      “Our systems registered multiple cyber attacks on the government agencies’ websites and Beltelecom servers. That led to the communications channels getting overwhelmed and our infrastructure malfunctioning, leading to the disruption of access to some Internet resources and services,” the provider wrote, promising to fix the issues until the end of the day Aug. 10.    Political unrest    Days before, in an interview that aired on Aug. 6, President Lukashenko said it would be embarrassing for him if Belarusians took to the streets on election day, and he would do everything in his power to curb the “protest mood,” reported a journalist for Russian tech publication Kod.      The election protests were largely peaceful, but protestors were attacked by law enforcement. Tear gas and water cannons were used and at least one person reportedly was hurt by a flash-bang grenade, while another was hit by a police vehicle. Thousands of protesters have been detained.      Reporters from two Russian-language media outlets, Current Time and TV Rain, were denied accreditation and deported.

42404921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bcS,1597084422,"Ethereum Classic's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Week","Ethereum Classic developers were still licking fresh wounds late last week when yet another 51% attack was launched against their blockchain early Thursday morning.      And as the bits settle, the proof-of-work blockchain’s future remains in question more than ever.      The first attack occurred on Aug. 1, the network’s second ever. Five days later, a second 51% attack followed the news that the first had indeed seen a successful double-spend of $5.6 million worth of ETC.      Read more: Ethereum Classic Suffers Reorganization That Resembles 51% Attack Amid Miner Complications      The second attack was perhaps more important, although smaller in monetary terms ($1.68 million). By striking twice, the attacker proved the blockchain has seemingly no ability to protect itself from meaningful exploits.      A 51% attack on a blockchain refers to a miner or a group of miners trying to control more than 50% of a network's mining power, computing power or hash rate.    Proof of work and immutability    Ethereum is a hard fork of Ethereum Classic. The two chains split in 2016 in a disagreement over the value of immutability following a compromised smart contract, The DAO, causing a blockchain “rollback.”      At that time, Ethereum Classic developers decided to eat the attack’s losses. The majority of Ethereum’s leadership and hashing power did not and hard forked under the ETH ticker.      Four years later, Ethereum Classic has continued to operate in the shadow of Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum. The smaller chain’s last few hard forks have all but copy and pasted Ethereum’s work.      Yet, the project has differentiated itself on one point: a commitment to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin. Ethereum, on the other hand, has slowly moved toward the novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) under the Ethereum 2.0 project.      Read more: Hard Fork Sets Stage for Ethereum Classic’s Second Major Departure From Ethereum      That technical decision is under heightened pressure. PoW coins with low hashing power are liable to being 51% attacked. And Ethereum Classic seems unable to do anything about it for the time being.    Exchanges and Grayscale    When the network will be secure remains unknown. So, Ethereum Classic developers have encouraged exchanges to increase transaction confirmation times. This protects against spreading the “double-spent” ETC.      “We have taken down ETC since the attacks. We don’t plan to open it back up until the ETC network is deemed safe,” an undisclosed Binance security team member told CoinDesk in an email through spokesperson Jessica Jung.      Coinbase also increased the confirmation times for Ethereum Classic deposits to two weeks, the exchange said in Tweet.    Interestingly, ETC’s price was down only 5% on the week by Friday, according to Messari. One possible reason is crypto financial giant Grayscale’s stance on the matter. The firm holds 10%https://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-trust/ of all ETC supply via its regulated trust product.    “We’re continuing to monitor recent events and any steps the ETC network may take in response. But it’s important to note that events like this do not impact the security of the assets underlying our products,” Grayscale Investments Managing Director Michael Sonnenshein told CoinDesk in an email. Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.      Read more: Grayscale to Fund Ethereum Classic Developers for 2 More Years      On the other hand, Messari research analyst Wilson Withiam told CoinDesk that ETC’s price – like many cryptossets – is broken from the asset’s fundamentals.      “ETC tends to follow the general market. Crypto enthusiasm is hot right now, so ETC's price remaining afloat could be more related to current market sentiment,” Withiam said.    Next steps for Ethereum Classic    51% attacks are the reality low-cap cryptocurrencies live in, ETC Coop Executive Director Bob Summerwill told CoinDesk in an interview Aug. 3.      “If you are in a minority hash position, then you are in this position,” Summerwill said, referring to the first 51% attack.      Following the second attack, Summerwill told CoinDesk in a private message that “all hands are on deck” and that “both immediate, mid-term and long-term emergency actions are being considered.”      One option is an emergency hard fork to a different hashing algorithm. The network currently uses the Ethash algorithm also used by Ethereum. Developers hope a technical tweak could throw off future attacks.      “Ethereum Classic is exploring alternative mining algorithms, specifically replacing Ethash with SHA-3, which could help mitigate any further attacks. But until that transition happens, Ethereum Classic will remain vulnerable,” Wilson said.    Legal counters    ETC Labs, the firm behind the Core-Geth client, is pursuing criminal charges against the attacker. To that end, ETC Labs has hired blockchain law firm Kobre & Kim and analytics business CipherTrace.      “We want to ensure that there are severe consequences for manipulating a public blockchain to steal. We are determined to protect the integrity of the ecosystem,” ETC Labs CEO Terry Culver said in a press release.      Some have pointed out the oddity of a blockchain ecosystem turning to businesses with real-world addresses for security. Others, such as Geth team leader Peter Szilágyi, say it's unlikely to lead to any security changes as the network simply needs more hashing power.      “Essentially, ETC’s security was broken down completely to zero,” Szilágyi said in the Ethereum core developers call Friday morning. “The actual damage is that you have an entity who can always mine whatever block and can always force itself on the network.”      Yet, Ethereum Classic developers remain determined.      ""We are still steadfast in our resolve to do everything we can right now to ensure the ETC network and community are as secure as possible. Nothing has changed about that,” Culver said in an email to CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/10/ethereum-classics-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8814e75a997eefa2a8de58035c4cab017fbe1ff-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency picked up bids during the Asian trading hours, rising from $11,750 to $12,068, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. A break above $12,118 looks likely, as bullish demand can be seen in the strong hourly volume that continues to rise with bitcoin's hike in value.

And their incentives are not your incentives,” says Evan Shapiro, CEO of O(1), the team behind the Coda Protocol. Bitcoin was supposed to be an open system owned by its users.

42404919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bYW,1597073959,Researchers Find Flaws in Security Protocols Developed by Major Crypto Exchanges,"Cryptocurrency exchanges holding user funds have risked falling into numerous security pitfalls by failing to ensure security protocols are properly implemented, according to new research.    Speaking to Wired for an article Sunday, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, the co-founder exchange security firm Taurus Group, said he and his team, along with Omer Shlomovits from crypto wallet maker ZenGo, had uncovered three significant vulnerabilities in the way some custodial exchanges hold user funds.  While private crypto wallets usually have just one private key for the holder, exchanges go a step further and split keys up into different components – a distributed key scheme – so no one entity has complete control over the main wallet.  That generally improves security but, as Taurus Group found, the new attack vectors stemmed from splitting private keys up partly because they assumed key holders, entities responsible for part of the key, would not be malicious.  Some vectors come from the refresh function that enhances privacy by replacing key components so a third party can't slowly work out a full private key.  In one example, from open-source software from an exchange the researchers refused to identify, a malicious key holder could change, or threaten to change, part of the component so the full private key is lost – preventing the exchange from accessing funds again.  Arguably the biggest vulnerability came from a key-generation protocol from Binance where the key holder pretended to be the protocol itself, assigning other key holders the random values they need to verify their identity.  Armed with that information, a hacker could compromise the system from the moment it was set up, giving them access to the rest of the private key and allowing them to drain wallet funds.  Binance fixed the problem in March and said it recommends users go through the key-generation procedure only if they are concerned one of the holders could be malicious.  Both Aumasson and Shlomovits said the research highlighted just how easy it was for vulnerabilities to appear in ostensibly secure mechanisms.

42404928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8biM,1597068669,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Dropped 58% Last Week as Congestion Eased,"The cost of transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain fell sharply last week as the network reverted to less frantic levels of activity.    The average fee per transaction in U.S. dollars fell by 58% from the two-month high of $6.47 to $2.72 in the four days to Aug. 9, according to data source Blockchain.com.  The sharp drop comes alongside a decline in the size of the memory pool (mempool) – the store of valid transactions waiting to be confirmed on Bitcoin's blockchain.  The number of unconfirmed transactions topped out at a 2.5-month high of 56,648 on July 28 with a total block size of 53.5 MB and has been on a declining trend ever since, according to data provider Bitcoin Visuals.  As of Sunday, the mempool had 3,656 unconfirmed transactions, the lowest since July 12, with a total block size of 9.9 MB.  When there is a dramatic rise in transaction activity, the mempool can become congested, leading to longer waiting times.  This happens because miners can validate only 1 MB of transactions per block mined every 10 minutes.  Miners respond to congestion by prioritizing transactions offering higher fees, forcing other users to increase mining fees.  As such, average fees paid tend to rise with the size of the mempool and drop with the easing of congestion.  Rally-led rise?  The mempool expanded sharply in the second half of July, as bitcoin rose from $9,100 to levels above $10,000, confirming a bullish breakout.  The number of pending transactions surged by over 1,900% in the 16 days to July 28.  During that period, the mean fee volume increased by more than 650%.  The number of unconfirmed transactions jumped to a 28-month high of 267,068 in mid-May after prices rose into five figures, extending the meteoric rise from the low of $3,867 reached on March 13.

42404917,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bWY,1597066573,The Fourth Era of Blockchain Governance,"Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.      If you follow our writing at Prysm Group, you know one of our mantras is that governance is essential for the long-term survival of blockchain projects. Blockchain projects are complex technical and economic systems that require a systematic and architectural approach to design. Governance enables blockchain projects to continually innovate, upgrade their protocols and adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining the desired level of decentralization.      Blockchain governance design has faced a steep learning curve. I have described the evolution of blockchain governance design since 2018 as having three eras:    Era 1: Informal/ad hoc governance design. The original blockchain projects, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, had no formal governance. Decisions regarding upgrades and crises were made by developers and other influencers based on ad-hoc procedures.  Era 2: Copy and paste governance design. Realizing that projects need well-specified decision-making procedures to succeed, projects copied and pasted voting and proposal mechanisms from other, non-blockchain platforms.  Era 3: Bespoke governance design. Projects realized blockchain is a new and distinct environment and began to design systems ground-up based on first principles.    After a briefing I gave two weeks ago jointly with Mark F. Radcliffe, Partner at law firm DLA Piper, I believe we have entered Era 4: the era of systemic governance design. Systemic governance design also takes a ground-up approach based on first principles while explicitly considering the ways in which a project’s governance must be designed to work in harmony with the governance of other projects in the blockchain ecosystem.      And this era, unlike the previous three, will be led by enterprise blockchain. Enterprise use cases not only require cross-platform development but also frequently undergo rigorous, multi-year planning cycles. Enterprises considering deploying blockchain solutions want to know how various platforms and their governance designs function in sum, so they can minimize unnecessary uncertainty and deliver on their project goals.      Mark is a corporate securities and IP lawyer who advises many blockchain projects and consortia. In his view, many of the current blockchain offerings do not have sufficient governance from both an economic and legal perspective to be effectively used by enterprises.    Enterprises considering deploying blockchain solutions want to know how various platforms and their governance designs function in sum.    Having well-defined governance is one of the best ways that an enterprise blockchain consortium can incentivize new users to join. A shared ledger with distributed control can reduce costs and provide benefits for businesses in a variety of industries. But getting enterprises to attain and sustain the cooperation required to keep these consortia functioning – via contributions of time, money, and expertise – requires transparent and well-functioning collective decision-making.      For the earliest blockchain consortia, having any specified governance process put them at the head of the pack. But governance designed in isolation is no longer sufficient. Understanding the governance of the underlying technologies the consortium is using and the impact it will have on a consortium’s own governance also is essential.    Protocols and stablecoins    Consider two examples: protocols and stablecoins. Most blockchain applications will not build their own protocols, but will instead choose to build on existing options such as Hyperledger or Hedera. Each of these protocols has its own processes that determine development projects, upgrades and use rights. Poorly designed governance at the protocol level can have harmful and unintended impacts on the projects building on it.      Projects built on Ethereum, for example, have spent over three years wondering if and when Proof-of-Stake will be implemented and two years watching the community debate which changes, if any, to make to the transaction fee mechanism.      Projects may also choose to adopt a third-party stablecoin rather than establish and manage their own token. MakerDAO, the builder of the U.S. dollar stablecoin (dai) with the third-largest market cap, is planning to dissolve its governing Foundation and replace it with a DAO over the next two years. This is a risky path forward: DAOs have been notoriously difficult to run well and are slow in making decisions. The transition adds significant complexity to any enterprise project choosing to use dai.      Enterprise blockchain projects can make progress in the face of such uncertainty. But having the appropriate systems in place for designing governance is more important than ever.      See also: Stephanie Hurder - Why Enterprise Blockchains Fail: No Economic Incentives      First, embrace that governance design is a complex process drawing on a combination of economics, law and other disciplines. Like all parts of a blockchain project, it involves iteration over time using multiple areas of expertise.      Second, vet the governance of potential tech partners just as thoroughly as you would vet their technology. Just having a voting system in place is typically not sufficient governance. Including more sophisticated steps such as soliciting and distributing expert feedback on proposals, introducing mechanisms to ensure timely implementation of upgrades, and having well-defined crisis governance with clear delineation of decision-making all increase the probability that governance will be reliable.      Finally, resist the urge to regress in the face of this challenge: to design myopically and to copy and paste without context. While blockchain governance best practices are rapidly evolving, there are frameworks projects can use to minimize the prospect of overlooking essential elements. The more innovative a project, the less likely an out-of-the-box governance solution will meet its needs.      But all blockchain consortia should recognize that governance practices are evolving and should pay particular attention to the processes for changing governance procedures. Successful consortia will need to adjust their governance procedures as the business, protocols and consortia evolve.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/10/the-fourth-era-of-blockchain-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4d8a1e7d5c54c579e0bf2f62442301685ef0fec-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404930,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bjL,1597058245,First Mover: Bitcoin Hits $12K as Trump Orders Checks for Unemployed (Voters),"Bitcoin climbed above $12,000 early Monday before dipping once more as traders weighed U.S. President Donald Trump's move to provide emergency aid amid new signs the labor market recovery is stalling.      The oldest and largest cryptocurrency is up 63% on the year.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Trump announced a series of executive orders over the weekend, including authorizing unemployment payments of about $400 a week, less than the $600 benefit that expired at the end of July. Lawmakers with the opposition Democratic party quickly panned the move as unconstitutional, but economists with Goldman Sachs said the president's runaround might pressure Congress to quickly approve a stimulus package worth at least $1.5 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance.      The determination to provide additional stimulus – at a time when trillions of dollars have already been pumped into the global financial system by governments and central banks – could feed into bitcoin bulls' bet that the cryptocurrency will benefit as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold.      ""Bitcoin's digital gold narrative is stronger than ever,"" the data firm Messari wrote last week.      Even so, economists warned of emerging trends that could upend those bets: a lagging jobs-market recovery that could put downward pressure on wages, reducing any inflationary impulse from fresh stimulus.      A report Friday from the U.S. Labor Department showed the U.S. unemployment rate improved to 10.2% in July from 11.1% in June and 14.7% in April.      But that rate, still roughly triple where it was at the start of the year, might be as good as it gets, at least in the near term, wrote Scott Anderson, chief economist for Bank of the West, a unit of the French bank BNP Paribas.      ""We remain firmly of the view that the surge in unemployment is a wage-crushing event, which will play itself out in the data once the recent huge distortions fade, helping to hold down core inflation,"" the economics forecasting firm Pantheon wrote Friday in a report.      Indeed, the economics power-couple Carmen and Vincent Reinhart wrote for the September-October issue of Foreign Affairs that the worst of the coronavirus-induced financial crisis may be yet to come.      ""The pandemic has created a massive economic contraction that will be followed by a financial crisis in many parts of the globe, as nonperforming corporate loans accumulate alongside bankruptcies,"" they wrote. ""Sovereign defaults in the developing world are also poised to spike. This crisis will follow a path similar to the one the last crisis took, except worse, commensurate with the scale and scope of the collapse in global economic activity.      According to Deutsche Bank, there's now 15 million more unemployed people than job openings in the U.S., and recent surveys have shown a big drop in the number of small-business executives planning to raise worker compensation over the next three to six months.      Win Thin, global head of currency strategy for the brokerage firm Brown Brothers Harriman, told CNBC last week he thinks the dollar will continue its recent slide because the Federal Reserve ""is being much more aggressive than other central banks, and the U.S. economy is likely to underperform in the coming months due to the pandemic.""      That might ordinarily lead to higher U.S. inflation, since importers would try to pass on their higher costs for foreign goods. But the labor market is so weak, according to Thin, that ""it would be very difficult to pass on these higher costs to consumers.""      Among cryptocurrency analysts, the weakness just reinforces the likelihood of further stimulus.      As previously reported in First Mover, Deutsche Bank strategists have projected that the Fed could expand total assets by another $5 trillion to $12 trillion, from about $7 trillion now. At the start of the year, the U.S. central bank's balance sheet stood at about $4 trillion.      ""The jobs data only seems to be relevant to the markets these days in that it may have an impact on the amount of stimulus provided,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote on Friday.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,741 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $12,070 | 24-Hr Low: $11,536      Trend: Bitcoin is struggling to establish a foothold above $12,000 despite a key technical indicator reporting the strongest bullish bias in 13 months.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $11,700, having printed an eight-day high of $12,068 during the Asian trading hours. The move had nearly reversed the entire pullback from $12,118 to $10,659 observed on Aug. 2.      The weekly chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, is printing higher bars above the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of the upward momentum.      More importantly, the indicator is now reporting a value of 319, the highest since July 2019.      Further, the weekly chart is reporting a falling channel breakout. As such, there is a strong reason to expect a quick bounce back to $12,000 and further rally toward resistance at $12,325 (August 2019 high) in the near-term.      A violation there would expose the next major hurdle at $13,880 (June 2019 high).      On the downside, the Asian session low of $11,684 is a crucial support. Acceptance below that level would validate the buyer exhaustion signaled by lower highs on the daily chart MACD and open the doors for a re-test of $11,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/10/first-mover-bitcoin-hits-12k-as-trump-orders-checks-for-unemployed-voters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b252e49833f0ad5660ef9f5599a7bbe06a87477-1200x767.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This comes as Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) announced Monday it was piloting a blockchain-based app developed by the country's patent and intellectual property office.  Called Smart Trademark, the platform allows the legal owners of a trademark to link online stores and their supply chains to a government registry, so they can distinguish themselves from counterfeit websites.  Registered companies can also add a ""Trust Badge"" to their website so consumers can verify they are buying authentic brands. The NRL said two of its official merchandise stores would begin featuring the Trust Badge.  The trademark is secured using blockchain, making counterfeiting difficult. Owners can also be made aware of any illicit attempts to copy the trademark.  Karen Andrews, Australia's minister for industry, science and technology, said initiatives like Smart Trademark, as well as the underlying blockchain technologies, helped protect businesses as well as the country's international reputation.  “This app could be used across a range of Australian-made products and is a great example of how new technologies can be applied in very practical ways to grow the economy and create local jobs,” Andrews said in a statement.  Last year, the OECD estimated counterfeited and pirated goods were worth $509 billion in 2016 – around 3% of the global economy.  Andrews said as many as 5.4 million jobs could be lost globally by 2022 unless more was done to stop counterfeit goods.

Announced on Friday, Ontology will support the development and deployment of NEAR's Decentralized Identifier (DID) solution with an eye on regulatory compliance.  A DID is a new type identifier for digital identities that can be scanned to verify any subject including a person, an object, an organization or a data model, and is being standardized under the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The technology is aimed at preventing the privacy risks that can arise from centralized silos of user information.  As part of the new partnership, Ontology will also help NEAR's deployment of smart contracts and provide further assistance with W3C registration.  Erick Pinos, Ontology's ecosystem lead for the Americas, said the two firms shared the aim of making digital identity solutions more widely accessible.  NEAR said it chose to team up with Ontology due to its technical expertise and, in particular, has an interest in its decentralized identity solution ONT ID 2.0, which is designed for cross-chain interoperability, Near Foundation CEO Erik Trautman said.  NEAR recently raised $21 million in a token sale led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  The funding was joined by around 40 other investment firms including Pantera Capital, Libertus, Blockchange, Animal Ventures, Distributed Global and Notation Capital.  Trautman said following on from NEAR Protocol's mainnet launch on May 4, the project is now keen to build out its partner network.

42404929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8bhN,1597050159,Bitcoin Suddenly Drops by $500 After Passing $12K [Updated],"Update (12:12 UTC): Bitcoin fell by nearly $500 to $11,546 in the 10 minutes to 10:30 UTC, after failing to absorb selling pressure above the $12,000 mark during the early European trading hours. It's the second rejection above $12,000 in eight days, and comes as the U.S. dollar shows signs of bottoming out.      Bitcoin is on the hunt for a new yearly high, having crossed above $12,000 early on Monday.    The cryptocurrency picked up bids during the Asian trading hours, rising from $11,750 to $12,068, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at $12,000 – just 1% short of the 2020 high of $12,118 reached on Aug. 2.  A break above $12,118 looks likely, as bullish demand can be seen in the strong hourly volume that continues to rise with bitcoin's hike in value.  If bitcoin manages to surpass the $12,118 level, the next target would be the high of $12,325 reached early in August 2019.  Bitcoin ended last week (Sunday, UTC) at $11,683 – the highest weekly close since January 2018 (see chart above right).  That has has opened the doors for further gains, according to some analysts.  The options market is also skewed bullish, with call options (bullish bets) drawing higher prices than puts (bearish bets) on the one, three, and six-month time frames.  Crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital's co-founder Kyle Davies said Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem could be another catalyst bolstering bitcoin's recent rally.  Davies said new projects in DeFi may be taking advantage of ""existing primitives for loans and trading.""  Bitcoin, however, looks vulnerable to a potential bounce in the U.S. dollar, having recently developed a relatively strong negative correlation with the greenback.  Bitcoin jumped from $9,100 to $12,118 in the 13 days to Aug. 2, as the dollar index, which tracks the value of USD against major currencies, fell from 96 to a 26-month low of 92.55.  The dollar is now at its most oversold in over 40 years, according to Morgan Stanley.  The investment bank said it had exited its bearish position in the U.S. dollar.

Announced Thursday, BitMax – operated by LINE's LVC Corporation – has become the first crypto exchange in Japan to offer link (LN).  The token was previously listed on LVC's U.S. exchange Bitfront, which denies access to Japanese traders.  The token was launched as a rewards incentive in 2018 for LINE's over 84 million monthly active users, per the company's figures.  The company aims to develop an ecosystem in which users of services over LINE's network are rewarded in LN tokens for using decentralized apps, or dapps.  LINK is not to be confused with decentralized oracle network Chainlink's token of the same name (and goes by the ticker symbol LINK).  LINE's token was previously issued via the firm's proprietary private blockchain network and was listed on the Bitfront exchange (formerly Bitbox) back in August 2018.  The token joins five other listed crypto assets on BitMax including bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC).

42384364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAX2Hx,1597024804,Cosmos’ Founding Team Broke Up Early This Year. The Project Didn’t,"The rags-to-riches legend of Cosmos from 2017 (turning a $17 million token sale into roughly $104 million by 2019) almost came to an end in February 2020 when the interoperability project’s founding team engaged in a scathing feud.    Founder Jae Kwon accused early contributor Zaki Manian of blasphemyhttps://gist.github.com/jaekwon/8861452eea20def46b89dfcc79c9212e, arguing over whether this software was “godly” and demanding that Manian renounce his “self-professed godliness.” (This is a quasi-religious industry, after all. Kwon did not respond to requests for comment by press time.) Many tokens are blatantly tethered to their celebrity creators. Would Cosmos fade into the already expansive graveyard of once-hyped token projects?    Don’t put dirt on that grave just yet.      Manian said it was “pointless to continue with the current corporate structure” at Tendermint, adding the dramatic yet amicable breakup split the founding team into three companies, which may benefit Cosmos.      Read more: How to Turn a $17 Million ICO Into $104 Million: The Cosmos Story      According to the Interchain Foundation (ICF), the Swiss foundation that shepherds the project’s ICO earnings, Cosmos blockchain technologies were used to “secure” $6 billion worth of assets by July 2020.      The foundation committed nearly $15 million so far in 2020, on 36 grants to software developers like the team at Tendermint. ICF plans to continue ongoing grant evaluations throughout the year.      There’s no denying this initial coin offering (ICO) project from 2017 is still impacting real people and their assets.    Multiple teams    Kwon continues to spearhead Tendermint’s work on software development, as does Manian’s startup, Iqlusion, and a few other companies like Althea and Chainsafe. Plus, the non-profit created a startup in Berlin, Interchain GmbH, now staffed by former Tendermint technologists working on the same goals as 2019.      “The whole engineering team working on the consensus algorithm moved over to Interchain GmBH when it started,” said Tess Rinearson, VP of engineering at Interchain GmbH. “The transition was very smooth.”      “Interchain Berlin is perhaps the most focused team on the core infrastructure of Cosmos. At the moment, they don't have any other business interests,” Manian added. “Other teams are working on Cosmos technology but for specific customers who either have launched Cosmos chains or are planning to.”      Read more: How Chainlink and Cosmos Fit Into China’s Grand Blockchain Initiative      For example, Iqlusion generates revenue by running Cosmos validators and also offering software development services unrelated to the blockchain industry. Kwon is still president of the foundation and CTO at Tendermint, while Cosmos veteran Peng Zhong has taken the reins as Tendermint’s new CEO.      There’s always going to be politics at play when it comes to who gets funding. This is why ICF grant manager Billy Rennekamp said the foundation is actually working to structure an external advisory board to provide an ecosystem-wide perspective on funding proposals.      “That’s going to bring more eyes, hopefully, to who is getting money and why,” Rennekamp said.    More governance    Stepping back, the whole reason Cosmos exists is fans believe there will someday be many robust blockchain ecosystems and people will want tools that can work seamlessly across them.      For example, you might have a product or service that, on the backend, uses several smart contracts and crypto assets; like many ingredients in a single gourmet dish.      “The whole idea of blockchains is there should be many paths to access each other,” Rennekamp said.

Much like the MakerDAO project, people who own the Cosmos network’s ATOM tokens can vote on how the platform is being built. Each project has different needs. Voting participation among roughly 120 active token-owning validators appears unusually high, with a 55% turnout in the most recent proposal. Manian said this required a significant outreach and coordination effort, which his startup handled so Interchain Berlin could focus on software development.      “It is the first step in the long road towards ATOMs building comparative advantage,” Manian said.      Meanwhile, Polkadot, another interoperability project often uttered in the same breath as Cosmos, is still fundraising with an ongoing token sale and also gearing up for a competing launch in 2020.

It remains to be seen whether the project will evolve, despite conflicting interests, into something that attracts user demand beyond niche crypto circles.      This is a business-to-business model, not a crusade to promote ATOMs as a dominant currency. Other types of companies need to want blockchain-related software services in order for any of this to matter. The token project could still fail to find product-market fit, even if the software works and the builders cooperate.

Meanwhile, Manian is rallying the troops to tackle a controversial software update called Stargate.      “The cost is that, unfortunately, it will be a disruptive upgrade for many ecosystem participants, like wallets and exchanges,” Manian said of Stargate, which will make the Cosmos ecosystem more compatible with external tools used across the mainstream tech industry.      “The purpose of the Stargate [participatory governance] process is going to ensure a high degree of ecosystem coordination in the upgrade,” he said.      It may have started in the trendy rush of 2017, but this token project’s story is far from over.
